This technological revolution is the result of the emergence and evolution of a wide variety of new wireless networking tech- nologies. Now people using these technologies are able to access the network and control many applications at will with their handheld devices anywhere, anytime. Although these technologies have made a long lasting impact in the revolution, it has also opened up various challenging issues which are yet to be resolved to make them more efﬁcient and cost-effective. Wireless technologies are used in mobile cellular networks, wireless access network, Mobile Adhoc Networks  MANET , Wireless Sensor Networks  WSNs , Wireless Mesh Networks  WMNs , Vehicular Adhoc Networks  VANETs  and more recently Internet of Things networks. For readability and understanding, we have divided this book into three sections. Part I will discuss about trends and challenges of emerging wireless networks. In Part II, recent and advanced applications based on wireless communications are discussed. In our last section, we focus on future internet systems such as Internet of Things and other Internet-based systems.  Part I: Trends and Challenges of the Emerging Wireless Networks  Trends and Challenges of the Emerging Wireless Networks A wide variety of technologies have been proposed in recent years, of which most are based on user applications and demand. New applications and technologies bring in more chal- lenges for researchers, which need to be standardized for more interoperability. The new technologies need to be well-studied and understood before they are accepted and widely used by consumers. This section gives academics, technologists, and in- dustrial audiences up-to-date standards, technical challenges, and recent advances in the emerging wireless technologies.  v   vi  Preface  Cooperative and Mesh Networks Cooperative and Mesh Networks are new ar- chitecture for network convergence and solve some recent problems like load bal- ancing, routing, and handover. This chapter is dedicated to recent trends, propos- als, and architectures for Cooperative and Mesh Networks. In many cases these networks can also be used to save energy which also makes them energy efﬁcient networks.  Cooperation in Delay Tolerant Networks A new class of networks, known as Delay Tolerant Networks  DTN , may violate one or more fundamental assump- tion of performance characteristics of the underlying links, but will achieve smooth operations. There are many routing, message dissemination, peer-to-peer systems designed for DTN networks, which are widely discussed in this chapter.  Wireless Multimedia  4G and Beyond  Multimedia communications and appli- cations have been growing rapidly since the introduction of smart mobile phones. With the next generation networks such as LTE  Long Term Evolution  which is just deployed, wireless multimedia have picked up strength and will belong to the most widely used applications. This chapter gives an overview of recent coding techniques, algorithms, and protocols providing multimedia support.  Part II: Wireless Communications and Applications  This section covers wireless communications and applications that have been receiv- ing a lot of attention recently. The focus areas will be vehicular communications, broadband wireless technologies, RFID technology, and energy-efﬁcient wireless communications which are speciﬁcally chosen to match the main theme of the book. The chapters will be written in a style that will be appropriate for:  a  readers wish- ing to learn the basics and fundamentals,  b  as well as for those readers who are already familiar with the fundamental concepts but are very interested to learn about state-of-the-art results in the ﬁeld as well as emerging challenges in those speciﬁc areas. Developing the chapters this way will make the book appealing to undergrad- uate graduate students, engineers, developers, etc. and increase its impact on the widest possible audience.  Vehicular Communications An Introduction is given, Overview of Vehicular Communications  vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communications, Intelligent Transportation Systems  ITSs , VANET research areas  broadcasting, routing, security, QoS, MAC , Performance metrics for VANET, Standards such as DSRC, IEEE 802.11p, architectures and solutions that have been proposed for research areas  broadcasting, routing, security, QoS, MAC , and a discussion of the challenges that still need to be addressed followed by concluding remarks.   Preface  vii  Broadband Wireless Technologies We will cover primarily HSPA+, WiMAX, LTE, LTE-A, and the multiple access technologies protocols they use, their design architectures and the protocols they use, application areas these technologies are expected to support, deployment interoperability issues, future challenges of multi- hop wireless networks, cloud-based radio access networks, and reliability.

Part III: Future Internet Systems  Designed services over the Internet evolved depending on the identiﬁed needs from person-to-person interaction as email or phone services to meet other interactions like person-to-machine, machine-to-person and lately machine-to-machine, where no human interaction is needed; thus building the ubiquitous and pervasive com- puting. Ubiquitous and pervasive computing has started a long time ago with the ambition of offering computing all-pervading for more tasks automation; building a smart world. Introducing RFID technology in building new services over the net- work has pushed what is called the Internet of Things as a meeting point between the real world and the virtual world especially when combined with other technologies as sensor technology or mobile communication.  The Internet of Things appears to be one step further on the path to ubiquitous computing. This will be possible with the introduction of the technologies as RFID or sensors but also other technologies as robotics, nanotechnology and others that makes Internet of Thing services an interdisciplinary ﬁeld where most of the human senses are somehow reproduced and replaced in this virtual world.  In this part we plan to provide the building blocks of different emerging concepts and technologies such as machine-to-machine, Internet of things, emerging wireless technologies especially in healthcare area and the security issues related to these emerging concepts.  We will then present the future Internet of Things from the communication and the service point of views, showing the main directions in short and long term, explaining different concepts, functions, usage, and related technologies.   viii  Preface  We also present the ongoing machine-to-machine communication model and ex- pected services, the strengths and limits of these systems will be presented, showing what the industry could use from this M2M paradigm and what is still in the research perspective.  We will present also the emerging wireless technologies applied in the health- care domain, as this is identiﬁed as a very important domain where researchers and industrials are making more and more efforts.  We cannot ignore the security part related to these emerging technologies, so in this section, we will also present an overview of the related security issues of these emerging technologies and networks.

New applications and technologies bring in more challenges for researchers, which need to be standardized for more interop- erability. The new technologies need to be well-studied and understood before they are accepted and widely used by consumers. This section gives academics, tech- nologists, and industrial audiences up-to-date standards, technical challenges, and recent advances in the emerging wireless technologies.  In the last ten years, there has been a tremendous increase in wireless internet usage, which is largely due to pervasive devices such as smart phones. This has led to a fast pace of research and development in the wireless area with the promise of signiﬁcant new breakthroughs over the next decade and beyond. In 2001, the groundwork has been laid for fourth generation  4G  technology, which is now al- ready in use. This move to 4G  which is also known as Long Term Evolution, LTE  enabled a wide range of new anytime anywhere computing and multimedia appli- cations ranging from navigation and search for mobile video streaming.  LTE enables rich multimedia content to mobile devices. The LTE technology in- cludes a new air interface and simpliﬁed network architecture. It offers signiﬁcantly higher data rates for users, while reducing the cost-per-bit for service providers. It is anticipated that LTE could bring connection speeds of up to 50 times faster than 3G networks and could offer 3D visuals for the ﬁrst time [1]. The network architec- ture is based on a distributed uniﬁed IP network that improves both throughput and latency.  It is a well known fact that wireless networks are inherently more vulnerable than their wired counterparts. Due to mobility, dynamic topology, and ad hoc na- ture, wireless security has become more challenging compared to wired networks. Even though many valuable lessons were learned from wired security issues, these  N. Chilamkurti  B   La Trobe University, Melbourne, Australia e-mail: n.chilamkurti@latrobe.edu.au  N. Chilamkurti et al.  eds. , Next-Generation Wireless Technologies, Computer Communications and Networks, DOI 10.1007 978-1-4471-5164-7_1,   Springer-Verlag London 2013  3   4  N. Chilamkurti  advances cannot be directly applied to wireless networks. Thus a more proactive approach should be taken in the context of emerging wireless networks [2].  Various emerging wireless networks such as VANET’s, Wireless Mesh Net- works, Wireless Sensor Networks, 4G networks, Delay Tolerant, and Disruption Tolerant Networks requires high security and privacy before they can be fully uti- lized. Clearly emerging networks require some sort of key distribution, secure rout- ing, and instruction detection mechanisms which will enable user to secure commu- nication [3].  There has been quite a bit of work done addressing security issues in vehicular communications in recent years. However, they require the existence of reliable and ubiquitous roadside infrastructure. This exclusive infrastructure will be expensive, and deploying such infrastructure will be time consuming. In vehicular communi- cations, safety messages are time-sensitive and need to be delivered within a given time window. A compromised node vehicle can cause injury or even death to pas- sengers due to wrong or misleading information. So, a fully safe VANET system will not be realized until network security and privacy issues are fully resolved [2]. With the introduction of smartphones, multimedia-based application usage has been dramatically increased. One of the major problems with wireless delivery of multimedia is caused by the fact that wide-area cellular access remains relatively slow and the actual radio link bandwidth and channel error can ﬂuctuate across a wide range of parameters [4]. A recent technique, known as cross-layer feedback, to further improve QoS along with video rate adaptation for wireless channels has been considered to enhance end-to-end performance. Although 4G cellular systems can achieve high peak rates, when it comes down to a single user the capacity can be low and is not sufﬁcient to transmit rich media applications.  Supporting QoS in 4G networks will be a major challenge due to varying bit rates, channel characteristics, bandwidth allocation, fault-tolerance levels, and hand- off support among heterogeneous wireless networks [5]. In future, emerging tech- nologies maintain reliable QoS using techniques like network virtualization. Vir- tualization techniques use resources partitioning such as hardware, processing and bandwidth partitions. This is done by slicing network shared resources into distinct “slices”, while also providing software programmability necessary to customize net- work routing and higher layer protocols to the service carried on each slice. Service- speciﬁc admission control and bandwidth pricing strategies [6] can also be used to improve QoS for video streaming.  One of the most recent technologies, referred to as LTE  Long Term Evolution , is a standard for wireless communications of high-speed data for mobile phones and data terminals [7]. LTE is intended to address the increasing demand for mobile data services and its architecture was deﬁned to enhance the end to end Quality of Service  QoS  and to optimize the backhaul communication protocols.  Vehicular communications including vehicle safety communications have been enhanced due to recent improvements in LTE such as higher data rates, spectral efﬁciency etc. There has been wide range of research studies in using 4G for wireless communication in the vehicle. This is enabled by ultra-high bandwidth technology, always-on network connectivity, cloud computing, cloud storage, and value-added network assets such as content management [8].   1 Trends and Challenges of the Emerging Wireless Networks  5  These days, the new vehicle is ﬁtted with many sensors for different purposes. Many of these peer-to-peer wireless systems will likely interact closely with 4G, supporting each other to authenticate users for secure use of safety-critical “coop- erative” applications, such as vehicle-to-vehicle collision avoidance, or to run di- agnostics to ensure proper functioning of all vehicles or infrastructure-based safety and mobility applications. 4G terminals in vehicles may even off-load data trafﬁc opportunistically  possibly at reduced tariffs  to short range DSRC WAVE and WI- Fi may provide a number of inexpensive options for vehicle applications to ofﬂoad data or communicate to “the cloud”. This wealth of sensors, WI-Fi connectivity, large bandwidth, cost effective communication technologies will entice automotive electronics engineers to develop compelling, reliable, and cost effective vehicle- oriented applications [9].

Chapter 2 Cooperative Mesh Networks  Sumit Kumar, Garimella Rama Murthy, and Naveen Chilamkurti  2.1 Introduction  Rapid growth in wireless communication technologies have led to several networked technologies, like WLAN, WiMax, ZigBee, AdHoc networks, cellular networks etc. A new network architecture is required for convergence of the existing wireless tech- nologies. A converged network having dynamic control over the network parameters and architecture is simpler to manage and operate [1, 2]. A wireless mesh network merged with the concepts of cooperative communication networks can provide an efﬁcient platform for the convergence of these wireless technologies [3]. This con- vergence will also enable the network to realize virtual MIMO systems, which will further help to counter the effects of multipath fading, network latency, network ro- bustness, and energy efﬁcient operations [4]. Much work has already been done in the area of wireless mesh networks and cooperative communication networks. Let us have a brief overview of wireless mesh networks and cooperative communication networks and then we will discuss their convergence. We will also discuss MIMO systems which can be realized by such convergence.  2.2 Wireless Mesh Networks  Wireless mesh networking is a kind of wireless topology where not only each node is connected to every other in a wireless manner but also serves as relay for the other nodes for data communication. Wireless mesh networks typically consist of mesh clients, mesh routers, and gateways. Mesh clients can be typically cell phone PDA  S. Kumar  B  · G.R. Murthy  IIIT Hyderabad, Hyderabad, India  N.

Fig. 2.1 Wireless mesh network [9]  users, laptop users and other wireless devices etc. Mesh routers forward trafﬁc to and from the gateways. The coverage area of the radio nodes working as a single network is sometimes called a mesh cloud. The whole schematic can be seen clearly in Fig. 2.1. A mesh network is reliable and offers redundancy. When one node can no longer operate, the rest of the nodes can still communicate with each other, di- rectly or through one or more intermediate nodes. Wireless mesh networks can be implemented with various wireless technology including 802.11, 802.15, 802.16, cellular technologies or combinations of more than one type [5].  2.3 Cooperative Communication  In cooperative wireless communication, we are concerned with a wireless network, of the cellular or ad-hoc variety, where the wireless agents, which we call users, may increase their effective quality of service  measured at the physical layer by bit error rates, block error rates, or outage probability  via cooperation. Figure 2.2   2 Cooperative Mesh Networks  9  Fig. 2.2 Cooperative communication networks [10]  says in brief the underlying concept of cooperative communication. In a cooperative communication system, each wireless user is assumed to transmit data as well as act as a cooperative agent for another user. There are several methods of cooperation which allow single-antenna mobiles to share their antennas and thus enjoy some of the beneﬁts of multiple-antenna systems [6].  2.4 Cooperative Mesh Networks  A cooperative mesh network is about a new architecture developed on the ideas borrowed from wireless mesh network and cooperative communication networks. The architecture consists of a wireless mesh backbone formed by mesh routers and gateways. The mesh clients in this case are several other wireless technologies, like sensor networks, separate wireless mesh networks with a gateways to this coopera- tive mesh network, Ad-Hoc networks, WLAN networks, cellular networks etc. The clients have to access the mesh router backbone in order to get connected to the gate- ways. Nearby clients can directly access the mesh router backbone to get connected to the gateway, while the far end clients can get connected to the wireless mesh backbone through multi-hop communication [3]. A simpliﬁed diagram in Fig. 2.3 makes the idea discussed above more clear about cooperative mesh networks.  There can be another simpliﬁed architecture for a cooperative mesh network which will consist of regular rectangular grids of mesh clients, mesh routers  pos- sibly mobile  and mesh gateways. Every grid point is sampled for information  e.g. sensed variables , collected by a mesh router and transferred to the gateway. A suit- able terminology for this cooperative mesh network shall be “mesh cloud”. The mesh cloud can be divided into regions that are covered by multiple mobile routers by considering any sub-region of mesh cloud and planning the path of mobile mesh router covering those sub-regions.  There may be ﬁxed as well as mobile nodes in the cooperative mesh network, i.e. the mesh topology may be dynamically varying with time. This may be termed a dynamically reconﬁgurable network topology. In such a scenario the ability to control the network topology is very important.   10  S. Kumar et al.  Fig. 2.3 Cooperative mesh networks [3]  2.5 Realizing Virtual MIMO  MIMO is the use of multiple antennas at both the transmitter and the receiver to improve communication performance in wireless scenarios. MIMO is an important part of modern wireless communication standards such as IEEE 802.11n  Wi-Fi , 4G, 3GPP Long Term Evolution, WiMAX, and HSPA+ [7].  It offers signiﬁcant increases in data throughput and link range without addi- tional bandwidth or increased transmit power. Improvement in MIMO communica- tion promises performance enhancements over conventional single SISO technology for the same radiated power.  Hence if merged into a cooperative wireless network MIMO will be able to achieve signiﬁcant improvement in network power consumption, latency, and net- work robustness. And also MIMO achieves these things without increasing the bandwidth of the system and without increasing the radiated power, which is one of the most constrained and scarce resources in a wireless network [8].  The “cooperative” nature of the cooperative networks makes them inherently suitable for the MIMO type communication. Let us see how a virtual MIMO system can be realized in a converged networks like cooperative mesh networks.  Though it is very difﬁcult to get multiple antennas on the same node, be it a single node of a WSN or a cell phone user or a WLAN AP etc., if we see the whole network we have a good density of transceivers in a small area. So with the help of some intelligent synchronizing techniques we can couple a number of transceivers   2 Cooperative Mesh Networks  11  Fig. 2.4 MIMO with sensor networks [8]   each with a single antenna assumption  and form a virtual MIMO network. Single nodes are constrained with respect to space; hence antennas cannot be placed wide enough to achieve spatial diversity. In a cooperative mesh network it is possible to create a virtual MIMO.  WSNs placed in the vicinity of each other can cooperate with each other to make a MIMO system. It can be either on the transmitter side or the receiver as shown in Fig. 2.4.  Several other combinations are also possible, like MISO  multiple input single output, where there will be multiple antennas at transmitter side and a single antenna at the receiver side , SIMO  single input single output, where there is single antenna at the transmitter side and multiple antennas at the receiver side. The desired MIMO conﬁguration can be realized by dynamically changing the topology.  These conﬁgurations enable the network to achieve a very good spatial diversity as well as help achieving robustness. They also help in achieving energy efﬁciency.  2.6 Advantages  Some advantages which can be intuitively achieved with a cooperative mesh net- works are as follows:   Cooperative mesh networking will enable the choice of multiple paths between nodes i.e. clients, routers, gateways hence robust connections can be achieved. It will help to tackle the scenarios of node failures effectively.   The ability to control topology also enables the option for “optimal” cooperative communication i.e. based upon understanding the environment  building, metal- lic objects etc.  the mesh topology could be ﬁnalized, to handle issues such as multipath fading.   Mesh routers have a clear picture of the local topology; hence the node failures are easily detectable. In such cases a self-healing idea can be used to handle the node link failure.   Cooperative mesh networks inherently support scalability more than other exist- ing wireless network architectures. Scalability will make the path of heteroge- neous network convergence easier.   12  S. Kumar et al.    Realizing MIMO will reduce the effects of multipaths as well as will lead to lower transmit power.   Last but not least, it will thrust some more research areas like dynamic routing protocols and dynamically reconﬁgurable networks. Moreover application of cog- nitive radio is the other side of the coin whose application in cooperative mesh networks itself calls about a plethora of research issues.  2.7 Challenges  Realizing the goals above will require understanding the challenges in the design, implementation, operation, and maintenance of such networks. Some major chal- lenges can be load balancing, routing, handover, security, centralized vs. decentral- ized control etc.  We expect seamless convergence integration of different types of network, e.g.  WLAN, ZigBee, WiMax, and wireless mesh networks.  Load balancing: Load balancing is about discovering and capitalizing the avail- ability of multiple paths between source-destination pairs in the dynamically changing topology of network nodes. Path planning for mobile mesh routers i.e. multiple “mobile” mesh routers enable transferring information from and to the gateways.  Handover: There are two types of handover which have to be taken care of. Inter- mesh handovers where the mesh client can switch to another mesh router in the same network and intra-mesh handovers. Here the mesh client has to select the mesh router from another cooperative mesh network [3].  Routing: Routing protocols which can take advantage of multi-hop communica- tion as well as being robust with respect to the inter-network and intra-network handovers in a converged heterogeneous network will be required.  Security: Security will be an inherent requirement because every data item has to be routed through the mesh routers to the gate way. There may be cases when there are some faulty or malicious mesh routers and hence they may disrupt the information ﬂow. Also since the cooperative mesh network is made up of several heterogeneous networks, several suitable security protocols are required to run the network without any disruption.  Control: Dynamic control over the network  mainly network topology and network parameters  is an essential requirement. This control can be either centralized or distributed.  It is clear that different networks like WLAN, ZigBee, Internet, WiMax have widely different network parameters such as delay, jitter, bandwidth etc. In the integration of these networks, optimal delivery of different types of trafﬁc  such as voice, video, and data  is very challenging. Providing quality of service to various types of trafﬁc  e.g. multimedia  over different wireless networks leads to interesting challenges.   2 Cooperative Mesh Networks  2.8 Conclusion  13  Convergence is the demand of ever growing wireless network technologies. It will make the network operations simpler and easily manageable. Cooperative mesh net- work indeed provides a generic framework for the convergence of existing wireless technologies. Through its concept of mixing the advantages of mesh networking and cooperative communication schemes it can handle a large number of wireless net- works. It can also be scaled to handle even a larger number of networks. Advantages are coming from both the already matured wireless mesh networking technologies as well as widely used cooperative communication technologies. Further the appli- cation of cognitive radio technologies will add several advantages with respect to dynamic spectrum allocation as well as an increase in the QoS of the network.  References  1.

Chapter 3 Cooperation in Delay Tolerant Networks  Sudip Misra, Sujata Pal, and Barun Kumar Saha  3.1 Introduction  The ubiquitous Internet, based on the TCP IP stack, fails to work in environments that exhibit one or more of the following characteristics [1]:   Intermittent connectivity among the nodes in the network, which turns the as- sumption of the existence of end-to-end paths false. Such connectivity could be scheduled, for example, a satellite in the Mars’ orbit communicating with the Earth station only at certain times, or could be opportunistic, for example, two smart phones carried by human beings in an urban scenario communicate when they come in each other’s transmission range.   High or variable latencies in the message deliveries as an effect of intermittent connectivity among the nodes.   Asymmetric connections or link bandwidths—such constraints make an interac- tive protocol like TCP fail.   High error rates along the transmission media call for multiple retransmissions, which may not be feasible given the limited availability of communication oppor- tunities.  To contrast the so characterized challenged networks with the Internet, consider some quantitative examples. While the round-trip time  RTT  in the Internet is about few hundred milliseconds [2], the speed of light pushes the propagation delay be- tween Earth and Mars in the range of 3–20 minutes [3] depending on the positions of  S.

Misra et al.  the planets. Moreover, the speed of transmission directly between Earth and Mars is only about 500 bps–32 Kbps, whereas a typical dial-up modem provides a data rate of about 56 Kbps [4]. In case of underwater acoustic networks, too, the transmission speeds are limited to around 38 Kbps [5].  To cope with such characteristics, and provide interoperability among heteroge- neous networks, the DTN architecture was proposed [6]. DTN acts as an “overlay” to make the diverse networking architectures inter-operate. Thus, DTN enables to connect the terrestrial Internet with the deep-space network. While traditional In- ternet uses a store-and-forward strategy, DTNs provide a paradigm shift by using the store-carry-and-forward strategy. Typical examples of DTNs include, but are not limited to, Interplanetary Internet  IPN  [3, 7] and underwater acoustic sensor networks [8].  3.1.1 Evolution  The evolution of DTN began with the efforts of Cerf et al. [7] to deﬁne an IPN archi- tecture. The choice of extending the terrestrial Internet for interplanetary commu- nications was evident, given its tremendous success. However, several environmen- tal challenges, as mentioned previously, prevented the direct adaptation of TCP IP- based Internet for the purpose, which called for the deﬁnition of a new architecture. In the proposed architecture, the IPN was divided into multiple regions. Data among the nodes were transferred as “bundles” using a store-and-forward approach. In par- ticular, IPN had three types of node: bundle agents  source and sinks of the bundles , IPN relays, and IPN gateways  connecting two or more IPN regions .  Fall [6] generalized the concepts presented in [7] into a delay-tolerant network- ing architecture to provide interoperability among diverse and challenged networks, where one or more assumptions of the Internet may not hold true. The DTN ar- chitecture so proposed served as an overlay on the top of the transport layers of the underlying networks. The concepts of regions and gateways from IPN were ex- tended for the DTN as well. The DTN architecture identiﬁed two different types of node—with and without persistent storage. In addition, the author also discussed about different services available in, and issues related to, such networks.  Over the years, researchers have explored the idea of DTNs to give rise to multi- ple specialized sub-domains. Khabbaz et al. [9], however, observed that while DTN was originally meant as an “overlay” architecture [6], in many cases in the existing literature the term DTN has been used to refer to the individual challenged networks as well. The authors differentiate the two categories as “delay-tolerant networking” and “intermittently connected networks”. Two prominent subclasses of such chal- lenged networks are the Opportunistic Mobile Networks  OMNs  [10] and Pocket Switched Networks  PSNs  [11]. An OMN essentially captures the idea that, un- like the traditional networks, communication links do not always exist in such a network. Rather, mobility of the nodes provides them with opportunities to commu- nicate with the other nodes in the network. On a similar note, the concept of PSNs   3 Cooperation in Delay Tolerant Networks  17  was proposed. A PSN is formed by portable devices such as smart phones and PDAs, carried by human beings. The devices in the PSNs communicate among themselves using global connectivities, if available. In absence of that, the devices communi- cate opportunistically when they are in the transmission range of one another. Thus, the PSNs provide an interesting communication paradigm in environments lacking network infrastructure, for example, post-disaster rescue operations [12].  We note that the abbreviation “DTN” has been used in the literature to denote both the delay-tolerant networking architecture and the challenged networks, where one or more assumptions of the Internet fail. In this work, by “DTNs” we refer to such challenged networks that exhibit the characteristics enumerated at the begin- ning of this section.  3.1.2 Characteristics and Challenges  The inherent characteristics of the DTNs ensure that the protocols from the Internet, wireless networks or MANETs fail to work with such networks. This implies that the network dynamics, for example, routing and security, should be addressed from a different point of view. To illustrate, consider a popular routing protocol for the MANETs, Dynamic Source Routing  DSR  [13]. One of the fundamental assump- tions of the protocol is the availability of at least one end-to-end communication path between any source and destination node pairs. In [14], multiple such paths are considered as backups, in case the primary path fails. Unfortunately, such possibil- ities are rare in DTNs. Therefore, the nodes in DTNs need to store the messages in their buffers  for a considerable time  until a communication link is available. Fur- ther, in such challenged networks, it is desired that the nodes engage in cooperative communications so that the resources, and opportunities, are efﬁciently utilized, and the network performance is optimum.  3.1.3 Contributions  In this chapter, we identify the different aspects on which nodes in DTNs could co- operate, and review the different schemes proposed for the same. Speciﬁcally, we explore in detail the incentive-based and game theory-inspired mechanisms adopted for enforcing cooperation in DTNs. The scope of this work, however, excludes ve- hicular DTNs. To the best of our knowledge, no survey on cooperation in DTNs has been done so far.  3.1.4 Organization  The remainder of this chapter is organized as follows. Section 3.2 provides a brief overview on a few representative unicast routing protocols for DTNs. Section 3.3   18  S. Misra et al.  deals in depth with the cooperation issues and challenges in DTNs. In Sect. 3.4, we review the different credit- and reputation-based incentive schemes proposed for en- forcing cooperation in DTNs. Section 3.5 provides a brief overview of game theory, and discuss multiple game theoretic approaches proposed for achieving cooperative behavior among the nodes in DTNs. Apart from incentive- and game theory-based mechanisms, several other schemes for cooperative communications are reviewed in Sect. 3.6. A few open problems in the related domain are pointed out in Sect. 3.7. Finally, in Sect. 3.8, we summarize and conclude this chapter.  3.2 A Brief Overview of Routing Protocols in DTNs  Routing is one of the fundamental activities performed by the nodes in any network. With reference to the OSI model, routing is the decision made at the network layer of any node with regards to the next recipient of a packet. In OMNs, routing by a node is essentially sending a message to another node when the latter comes within the transmission range of the former. To cope with the different challenges, as men- tioned above, routing in DTNs usually involves replication of the messages, i.e., a copy of a message is sent to the node in contact. However, when a node comes in contact with the destination node of a given message, the message is then forwarded. When a node receives multiple copies of a given message, it discards all copies but the ﬁrst. Formally, consider a network with a set of nodes, N, and a set of messages generated in the network, M. The action, Action i, j, m , taken by any node, i ∈ N, having a message, m ∈ M, while in contact with another node, j ∈ N, i  cid:3 = j , could be Forward m, j  , Replicate m, j   or ∅. Here, ∅ indicates that no action was taken. We now brieﬂy look at three representative replication-based routing protocols proposed for DTNs, namely epidemic [15], Spray-and-Wait  SnW  [16] and Proba- bilistic Routing Using History of Encounters and Transitivity  PROPHET  [17]. The epidemic routing protocol presents an extreme case, where uncontrolled ﬂooding of all messages across the network is performed. SnW presents a limited-copy ﬂood- ing. PROPHET, on the other hand, replicates messages only to the nodes having higher likelihood of delivery.  In the epidemic routing protocol, when two nodes come within each other’s trans- mission range, they exchange a summary vector of the messages contained by each node. Based on these summary vectors, each node exchanges  replicates  messages to the other node that the former have, but the latter does not have. Thus, in case of the epidemic routing, the action taken by a node on a message, when the other node does not have the message, could be stated as  Action i, j, m  =  Forward j, m , Replicate j, m ,  j = m.destination   otherwise   3.1    cid:2   Unlimited replication of the messages over the entire network introduces high overhead, since each node could be carrying a copy of a given message. To cope   3 Cooperation in Delay Tolerant Networks  19  with this, SnW introduces an upper limit on the number of replications that could be made for a given message in the entire network. In the SnW routing protocol, each message contains a header L, where L ≥ 1. When SnW is used in the binary mode, the source node of a message replicates L 2 copies of the message to the ﬁrst node it comes in contact with. The remaining L 2 copies are held by the source node. Subsequently, each of these two nodes could replicate the message L 4 times to any other node they come in contact with already not containing that particular message. A node continues to replicate a message likewise until it has a single copy, which could only be forwarded to the destination node. Thus, the routing actions in case of SnW could be represented as:  Action i, j, m  =  Forward j, m , Replicate j, m , m.L   > 1  j = m.destination     3.2    cid:2   When the binary mode is not used, the source node distributes a single copy of the message at most to the ﬁrst unique L − 1 nodes that it comes in contact with. Any of those nodes, when in contact with the destination, forwards the message to the destination node.  PROPHET takes a different approach for replication: a node forwards a replica of a message to another node only if the other node has greater chances of encountering the destination of the message than itself. Nodes that meet frequently have greater delivery predictabilities as compared to the nodes that meet infrequently. The fol- lowing three equations, related to updating delivery predictabilities on encounter, aging of the predictabilities, and transitive predictabilities, govern the functionality of the PROPHET routing protocol [17]:  ⎧⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎩  P a,b  = P a,b old +  1 − P a,b old   × Pinit P a,b  = P a,b old × γ k P a,c  = P a,c old +  1 − P a,c old   × P a,b  × P b,c  × β   3.3   Here, P a,b  represents the current measure of message delivery predictability of the node b as determined by the node a, and P a,b old represents the previous measure of the same metric. Pinit ∈  0, 1] is an initialization constant, γ ∈  0, 1  represents the aging constant, and k the count of the number of time units since the last update. β ∈ [0, 1] is a scaling constant, which controls the effect of transitivity on the delivery predictabilities. Thus, if d represents the destination of any message m, the routing actions under PROPHET could be formalized as  Action i, j, m  =  Forward j, m , Replicate j, m , P j,d  > P i,d   j = d   3.4    cid:2    20  S. Misra et al.  Fig. 3.1 Message forwarding scenarios in the presence of  a  cooperative,  b  selﬁsh, and  c  mali- cious nodes. While selﬁsh nodes may choose not to forward another node’s message at a particular time instant, a malicious node drops it  3.3 Cooperation in DTNs  In DTNs, the nodes have intermittent connectivities, and end-to-end paths usually lack between any source–destination pair. A node in a DTN could possibly opt to directly deliver a message to its destination node. Such mechanism, however, results in fewer message deliveries and high delivery latency, since a source–destination node pair has limited contact opportunities. To overcome these limitations, nodes in DTNs rely on the intermediate nodes, met along the way, for forwarding the messages. In this situation, if the meeting intermediate nodes do not cooperate in the communications process, it will directly affect the network performance. So, the intermediate relay nodes play a key role of cooperation in DTNs and cooperation is one of the major issues in DTNs.  Multiple routing protocols proposed for the DTNs assume that nodes are fully co- operative. However, such situations may not be true in real-life. The non-cooperative behavior exhibited by the nodes could be broadly classiﬁed into two types—selﬁsh and malicious. Selﬁsh nodes attempt to preserve their own resources  for example, energy and buffer space —in other words, look for their own gain. Thus, selﬁsh nodes do not forward messages received from the other nodes, but use other nodes as free riders for serving their own purposes. Malicious nodes, on the other hand, intentionally drop the messages forwarded to them by the other nodes. Unlike self- ish nodes, the primary motive of the malicious nodes is to cause harm to others rather than making self proﬁts. Figure 3.1 illustrates the different communication scenarios in the presence of cooperative, selﬁsh, and malicious nodes.  3.3.1 Challenges  It may be noted that “cooperation in a network” could indicate numerous higher level phenomena. In practice, one must deﬁne the network dimensions where coop-   3 Cooperation in Delay Tolerant Networks  21  eration plays role. Cooperation among the nodes in a network could be with regards to various aspects, including, but not limited to:   Buffer space: A node in a DTN, which forwards it own messages to other nodes, must also accept and store the other nodes’ messages into its buffer. The bundle protocol [18] provides the facility of custody transfer—a reliable mechanism for transferring bundles. In custody transfer, a DTN node accepting a bundle  the custodian  from another node cannot drop the bundle either until it has been for- warded to some node, or its TTL is expired.   Communication opportunities: A node in a DTN not only carries message s  from other nodes, but also forwards them without discrimination when suitable contact opportunities are available. This is important, since, as discussed earlier, lack of connectivity among the nodes in a DTN is the norm rather than exception. Of course, a node forwards messages created by itself with higher priority.   Energy aspects: A node with critical energy considerations may utilize the current communication opportunity with another node to seek cooperation in forwarding the messages. Differently, a node may increase its transmission power to reach the distant nodes [19].  The unique characteristics of DTNs make cooperation enforcement  or, punish- ment  a difﬁcult task. Sparse connectivities among the nodes in DTNs poses a great challenge by delaying the detection of the non-cooperative behavior of the node s , if at all. This is critical, since the damage might have been done before the malicious behavior of the nodes is detected and avoided.  3.3.2 Approaches  A brief walk-through of the existing literature reveals that diverse approaches have been taken towards ensuring cooperation in DTNs. This chapter explores the differ- ent cooperation-enforcing schemes proposed in the literature for DTNs. Among the multitude of schemes, one of the well known is the incentive-based approach [20– 23], to bring about cooperation among the nodes. The problem—whether a node should cooperate or not in the presence of other non-cooperative nodes—has been explored from the game theoretic perspective as well. Several works presented op- timum strategies that the nodes should undertake in order to maximize the network performance metrics.  3.4 Cooperation Based on Incentive Schemes  Many routing protocols for DTNs, for example, [15–17], are based on the assump- tion that the intermediate nodes in the network are ready to forward messages re- ceived from the other nodes. However, when the owners of the nodes are people or   22  S. Misra et al.  parties, the nodes might behave as selﬁshly or maliciously. The presence of these types of misbehaving node forcefully degrades the performance of the networks. So, to overcome the effects of non-cooperative behavior, many incentive-based schemes have been proposed for the DTNs, which indirectly enforce cooperation among the nodes. An incentive-based scheme provides some credit  reputation  to the nodes to motivate them to cooperate and refrain from selﬁsh malicious behavior. The nodes can “encash” the incentive received to get their own messages forwarded. Here, we have categorized two types of incentives scheme:  a  credit-based, and  b  reputation-based. In credit-based incentive schemes, virtual currency or pricing acts as the credit. In reputation-based schemes, reputation of the nodes is calculated by their neighbors based on the message forwarding actions. Thus, if node X ﬁnds that the reputation of node Y is less than some chosen threshold, X would refuse to accept messages from Y .  3.4.1 Credit-Based Incentive Schemes  To encourage message forwarding among the nodes, credit is given to each of the forwarding nodes in the form of virtual currency. The nodes receive payments when they help in forwarding the messages from the other nodes. The nodes can use these credits to transmit their own messages. Thus, if node A knows  for example, through acknowledgments  that node B has forwarded some message s , it provides appro- priate credits to node B. Node B, in turn, uses its accumulated currency to ask the other nodes to forward its messages.  Shevade et al. [21] proposed a pair-wise Tit-for-Tat  TFT  incentive mechanism for DTNs. The authors described two constraints, generosity and contrition, to max- imize the cooperation among the nodes. The basic TFT scheme prevents relaying the messages when two nodes meet for the ﬁrst time, as no message is relayed by the other node. To overcome this drawback, the generous TFT was proposed. In a generous TFT, a node must relay at least ε number of messages. Generous TFT helps to overcome asymmetric trafﬁc demands. So, it is possible that a node may act selﬁshly after it has achieved this criterion. To prevent this selﬁsh behavior, another constraint, contrition, is considered. Contrition stops for doing selﬁshness by getting a valid counterattack to its own mistakes. Contrition prevents endless retaliation.  Zhu et al. [20] proposed a Secure Credit-based Incentive scheme  SCI , a frame- work for enforcing cooperation among the selﬁsh nodes in DTNs. In addition to cooperation, SCI also adds a security mechanism for layered coin, a virtual elec- tronic credit system where credits are distributed by the intermediate nodes without the involvement of senders. A layered coin consists of a base layer originated at the source node, and multiple endorsed layers generated by the intermediate nodes. The base layer expresses different rewarding policies such as payment rate, remuneration conditions, and class of service requirement. When any intermediate node receives a layered coin, it veriﬁes the bundle life time, likability of layers chain, sender’s cer- tiﬁcate, supporting signatures of the base layer, and intermediate nodes certiﬁcates.   3 Cooperation in Delay Tolerant Networks  23  After performing these veriﬁcations, the intermediate node determines the next-hop forwarding node and creates an additional endorsed layer. The endorsed layers ap- pends a unforgeable digital signature based on previous layers. The authors intro- duced a concatenated layer technique, which prevents malicious users for cheating credits and concatenates different layers with each other by injecting the generator information of the next layer into the previous layer. The authors further proposed two performance optimization techniques to minimize the transmission overhead.  In [22], the authors proposed SMART, a Secure Multilayer Credit-based Incen- tive scheme for DTNs. SMART not only stimulates cooperation among the nodes, but also prevents the malicious users from cheating credits by a secure incentive scheme, which is based on layered coins. The propagation path can be easily tracked by checking the digital signature of an endorsed layer. The digital signature provides the security and the propagation path of the end-to-end connection from source to destination. Each intermediate nodes periodically submits the layered coin to a Vir- tual Bank  VB , which takes charge of credit clearance. The last intermediate node submits the collected layered coins to VB for clearance. The VB checks the de- posited layered coins and shares the credits with each of the forwarding nodes ac- cording to predeﬁned reward policy.  MobiCent [23] is a credit-based incentive scheme, suitable for mobile social net- works [11], where people carry low power mobile devices. MobiCent is compatible with replication-based routing protocol in DTNs. In this scheme, the selﬁsh nodes in DTNs are not detected. Rather, the nodes are motivated for cooperation by pro- viding them incentives for the message relays. A mobile device operates in two modes:  a  long-range low-bandwidth radio, and  b  short-range high-bandwidth link. The ﬁrst mode ensures that a mobile device can maintain connectivity with dis- tant devices, while, in the second mode, devices can exchange huge amount of data opportunistically with their closely located peers. Due to these two types of opera- tion, a mobile device in this environment can face the challenges in forwarding the data in unpredictable, opportunistic networks, where disconnections among nodes are the general norms. The authors described two types of attack—edge insertion and hiding. These two attacks are addressed by an incentive compatible payment scheme. Edge insertion attacks are launched by the selﬁsh nodes by inserting a sybil in the earliest path. Adding a sybil on a later path does not change the eligible path set. In edge hiding attacks, the selﬁsh nodes hide the path, and they can hold the message instead of forwarding it to other nodes. To counter edge insertion attacks, the Multiplicative Decreasing Reward  MDR  algorithm is used, which prevents the relay and clients from gaining in edge insertion attack. To prevent edge hiding attacks, minimum cost and minimum delay selection algorithms are used to deter- mine an incentive-compatible relay set by examining a sufﬁcient subset of paths ever revealed before the deadline. These two algorithms prevent the selﬁsh nodes from launching edge insertion and hiding attacks, and, thereby, ensure cooperation among the nodes.  Lu et al. [24] proposed a practical incentive  Pi  protocol, where the selﬁsh nodes are stimulated to cooperate by forwarding the bundles. Pi utilizes both credit-based and reputation-based incentive schemes, and considers the single-copy data for- warding algorithms. Each source node sends the bundle by attaching some incentive   24  S. Misra et al.  with the bundle. This incentive scheme is fair to the source node. An intermediate node may or may not participate in the bundle forwarding. If the intermediate nodes forward bundles, which ﬁnally reach the destination node, then all the intermedi- ates nodes get credits, which leads to increased reputation from the source node. However, if any forwarded bundle fails to reach the destination, then each of the intermediate nodes are assigned higher reputation values from a trusted authority. In this case, the source node is not required to provide any credit to the intermedi- ate forwarding nodes. Thus, each intermediate node in the network is stimulated for cooperation. The Pi protocol also guarantees a secure incentive schemes by using a layered coin model and veriﬁable encrypted signature techniques. The Pi protocol provides fair incentives, and prevents free riding attacks i.e., the layer removal and addition attacks.  SATS [25] is a Secure dATa-forwarding Scheme proposed for the DTNs. This scheme prevents black hole and selﬁshness attacks. Black hole attackers silently drop others’ messages. SATS uses credit or micropayment, which encourages the selﬁsh nodes to cooperate in data forwarding. SATS also uses a trust system for assigning a trust value to a node, when the nodes cooperate in forwarding. The trust value of a node degrades, if a node does not cooperate in forwarding.  Discussions: The following observations could be made from the above reviewed credit-based incentive schemes for cooperation:   Shevade et al.’s scheme does not address any security issues for DTNs, whereas SMART and SCI provide security to prevent cheating credits. Similarly, Mobi- Cent prevents edge insertion and edge hiding attacks.   SMART is based on individual selﬁshness. If a node has limited storage and power, it would not be able to participate in message forwarding, which is not intentional non-cooperation.   MobiCent is based on social selﬁshness, where a node is willing to forward the messages belonging to the same community, while it does not forward the mes- sages of the other communities. Li et al. [26] considered these two types of selﬁsh behavior and evaluated the impact of social selﬁshness in DTNs.   Different from the other protocols, Pi focuses on the fairness towards the source nodes, and uses a hybrid  credit- and reputation-based  incentive model, which encourages the selﬁsh node to take part in forwarding the bundle. The Pi protocol allows preventing the layer adding attack for a DTN node with multiple identities. However, it is still a challenging problem when more than one of the DTN nodes collude and launch a layer adding attack.   SMART [22], MobiCent [23], pair wise Tit-for-Tat [21] are designed for mul- ticopy routing protocol such as epidemic routing, whereas Pi with single copy routing protocols.  Furthermore, a fair incentive protocol for multicopy routing algorithms has yet  not been developed. So, Pi could be extended to address such algorithms.   3 Cooperation in Delay Tolerant Networks  25  3.4.2 Reputation-Based Incentive Schemes  In the reputation-based incentive schemes, each node is evaluated by the neighbor- ing nodes and assigned a reputation value based on their cooperating behavior with the other nodes. If a node cooperates, its reputation value is high and the node re- ceives better services. The reputation value of a node is reduced when it does not cooperate with the other nodes in forwarding the other nodes messages. Therefore, to avoid low reputation values, all the nodes try to cooperate with other nodes by forwarding their messages.  Wei et al. [27] proposed MobiID, a user-centric and social-aware incentive scheme based on reputation, to mitigate the effects of dishonest nodes in the net- work. The scheme used reputation self-check and community-check. The nodes in the same community meet frequently and periodically forward bundles among each other. When any node assigns a low reputation value to any other node, the latter is blacklisted, and the former informs its community members about the same. The network is modeled as a weighted directed graph, where the link weights are deter- mined based on the forwarding histories of the nodes. The authors deﬁned Average Forwarding Time  AFT , a metric to capture the effects of both contact durations and messages forwarded among any pair of nodes. Using this, a new metric willing- ness, wij ∈ [0, 1], was deﬁned as [27]   cid:7  wij = exp   cid:8   − AFT2 ij 2σ 2   3.5   The willingness, wij , indicates the extent to which a node i wills to forward the  bundles to node j , ∀i, j . The term σ denotes a scaling factor.  To deal with reputation management, reputation tickets are used. A reputation ticket is a signed evidence of bundle forwarding action by any node. When any node X forwards a bundle to another node Y , Y sends a reputation ticket to X. Any given node maintain the counts of successful and failed forwarding. The counts are updated using the Beta distribution, based on the reputation tickets obtained in the latest observation interval. Further, the two counts do age with time. Nodes are blacklisted when their corresponding reputations are less than a given threshold. No bundles are forwarded to  received from  such nodes. Additionally, reputation values for any node X are shared among the members of the communities to form a consensus on the reputation of X. In such case, a weighted average is taken over all the members of the community.  Zhang et al. [28] noted that even when credit-based incentive schemes are used, the selﬁsh nodes could engage in other types of misbehavior. The authors observed that there are three reasons for isolating the selﬁsh nodes in DTNs:  1  increase per- formance by not involving them in the routing process,  2  by preventing the selﬁsh nodes to join the network, they are indirectly forced not to behave selﬁshly, and  3  the negative impact of selﬁshness in the network is minimized. In contrast to the credit-based schemes, the reputation-based schemes take into account the opin- ions  reputation  of the other nodes in the network, before taking any routing deci- sion. To discourage selﬁshness in DTNs, Zhang et al. [28] proposed PRI, a practical   26  S. Misra et al.  reputation-based incentive scheme. PRI is comprised of three modules: monitoring the nodes’ behavior, computing their reputation, and responding to the other nodes’ requests. Successful Forwarding Credentials  SFCs  are used as positive evidence of the nodes’ successful forwarding of the messages. Authentication and integrity of such SFCs are ensured using digital signatures. When a node receives a message, it sends out an SFC to the forwarding node. Any intermediate node, Ni+1, also sends out the SFC received from the immediate downstream node, Ni+2, to the node Ni that had originally forwarded to itself. While the SFCs serve as ﬁrst-hand evidences, second-hand evidences are gathered through reputation propagation by the nodes. The reputation value of the node j , as determined by the node i, is given by [28]  RVij  τn  = e  −σ  τn−τn−1  × RVij  τn−1  × FHVij  τn  × SHVij  τn    3.6   where τn denotes the nth time instant when the reputation value is updated; FHV and SHV, respectively, denote the ﬁrst-hand and second-hand evidence functions, and σ indicates the rate at which the historical value of the reputation decays. Based on the value of RVij , node i classiﬁes node j as honest, normal or selﬁsh as follows [28]:  ⎧⎪⎨ ⇒ honest ⎪⎩RV ij  τn  ≥ ηH ηS < RV ij  τn  ≤ ηH ⇒ normal ⇒ selﬁsh RV ij  τn  < ηS   3.7   The constants ηH and ηS, respectively, denotes the thresholds of honest and self- ish behaviors. Any request from the honest nodes are prioritized. Selﬁsh nodes, on the other hand, are blacklisted, and eventually disregarded from the network. Re- quests from such nodes are not served.  3.5 Cooperation Based on Game Theory  In DTNs, the intermediate nodes may need to store and carry the messages for a long time, which wastes their resources [29, 30] in terms of energy and buffer space. Thus, any node in the network cooperates with the other nodes in the message forwarding actions by taking strategic decisions depending on their individual  or network-wide  gains. The concept of strategic decision making can be resembled by using the concepts from game theory. In terms of the game theoretic concept, any player’s user’s gain is equal to the other participant’s loss  zero-sum game . Each rational user in the network take individual decisions based on the fact that their actions affect others. Game theory has been extensively applied in the wire- less networks research. Here, we discuss some of the existing research works on cooperation in DTNs based on game theory.   3 Cooperation in Delay Tolerant Networks  27  Table 3.1 Payoff matrix for two player strategic game  Fig. 3.2 Extensive form game tree  Player 2  Left  Right  Player 1  Top Bottom   a1, a2    b1, b2    c1, c2    d1, d2   3.5.1 Brief Overview of Game Theory  Game theory is the study of mathematical techniques, where the actions taken by each rational user affects the outcome of the group. A group of individuals make decisions that beneﬁt each player by optimizing their payoffs. A game is com- posed of a set of players, a set of rules strategies for specifying the individual actions decisions, the outcomes for each such decision taken, and the payoff ma- trix that deﬁnes the players’ utility functions. There exist different forms of games, including strategic  normal  form, extensive form—with or without perfect informa- tion, and coalitional  characteristic  forms. The extensive form and strategic games are classiﬁed under the non-cooperative games, while coalitional games belong to the cooperative games category. We brieﬂy discuss the different types of game in the following.   1  Strategic Form Games In strategic form games, all players acts without knowing the strategies of the other players. It suppresses the sequential structure of decision making. This game is also known as normal form games or matrix games. A strategic form game can be represented as G =  N,{Si}i∈N ,{pi}i∈N  , where N is the set of players, Si is the set of actions for player i, and pi : S → R is the pay- off function of player i. Table 3.1 shows the payoff matrix for two players strategic game, where each player has two actions. If Player 1 plays Bottom and Player 2 plays Right, then the payoff received by Player 1 is d1 and the payoff received by Player 2 is d2.   2  Extensive Form Games An extensive form game describes the possible se- quential moves of players, each of the players makes his own decision and the play- ers are free to change their mind based on the consequences. An extensive form game is represented by a game tree, as shown in Fig. 3.2.  Such a game tree consists of nodes  initial, decision and terminal , branches, action labels, player labels, and payoffs. Figure 3.2 shows an extensive form game   28  S. Misra et al.  tree for two players—1 and 2. Player 1 moves ﬁrst and chooses either left or right. Based on player 1’s decision, player 2 makes his decision and chooses either A or B. If player 1 chooses right and player 2 chooses A, then player 1 gets −10 and player 2 gets 5.   3  Coalitional Games Coalitional games [31] are cooperative games, which fo- cus on the behavior of the group of players, rather than on individual players in the non-cooperative games. A coalitional game consists of:   a set players, N,   a set of actions for each group S  S ⊆ N  or coalition, and   preferences of the player over the set of all actions of all coalitions of which the player is a member.  A coalitional game can be represented by the pair  N, v , where N is the set of player and v is the coalitional value. The coalitional value is mapped into the amount of utility that individual members obtained from their coalition. A coalitional value can be in three different forms: characteristic, partition, and graph. In the charac- teristic form, the value of a coalition S depends exclusively on the members of the coalition. In the partition form, the coalitional value depends both on the members of the group or coalition, S, and on the rest of the players in the other coalition, N − S. In the graph form, the value v depends on the connection between players in the coalition.  3.5.2 Non-cooperative Game Theory  Non-cooperative game theory involves a set of players, where each player takes his individual decision independently, knowing the possible choices of other play- ers and their effect on the player’s utilities. Non-cooperative game theory mainly focuses on the study and analysis of competitive decision-makers. These types of game are used in various ﬁelds, for example, economics, political science, biology, sociology, and wireless networks. In this section, we describe how non-cooperative game theory is used for enforcing cooperation in delay tolerant networks.  To avoid selﬁsh behavior and stimulate cooperation, Buttyan et al. [32, 33] pro- posed the concept of barter, and developed a non-cooperative game theoretic model. The authors considered delay-tolerant personal wireless networks in a touristic city that distribute the information among the tourists. It may happen that selﬁsh users download interesting messages from others, but they do not store and distribute messages for the other users. Their model prevents this selﬁsh behavior using the concept of barter. When two nodes A and B come in contact with each other, they ﬁrst send the description of their messages. Then, they send a list of messages that they want to download from each other. Two types of messages were considered in the system—primary and secondary. A message is primary if the mobile node has interest in it, and secondary if the mobile node has no direct interest in it. Each   3 Cooperation in Delay Tolerant Networks  29  message has some barter value for each node and the value is determined by its age and type. Using the game theoretic model, the mobile nodes A and B decide the messages that they want to download from each other to maximize their own bene- ﬁt. The game model described consists of the players  P  , strategy space  Si , and the payoffs. Each individual node act as a player. The node behavior depends on two parameters  s, h , where s is the secondary ratio of the nodes represented by the primary players, and h is the threshold value, below which the nodes do not download the secondary messages from the other players. The payoffs of the players is the average total score of the nodes in the groups. Each node receives a score after each interac- tion, i.e., Score = Gain − Loss, where Gain is the total value of primary messages downloaded in the interaction and Loss is total number of exchanged messages in the interaction. Using the concept of best response and Nash equilibrium, it was observed that message delivery rate increases if the mobile nodes follow the Nash equilibrium.  Yin et al. [34] proposed a model named Pay-for-Gain  PFG . In this mechanism, each node keeps record of the identiﬁcation of encountered nodes, the total amount of buffer space it has lent from the encountered nodes, and the amount of buffer space it will lend to the encountered nodes. The authors deﬁned a Loan Feedback  LFB  function, as shown in  3.8  and  3.9 , which helps in computing the amount of buffer space lent to user Y by user X [34],   cid:10  × BF  X   BL Y     cid:9   cid:2  B Y   = g  cid:10  =  1,   cid:11    cid:9   g  BL Y    BL Y   ≤ B0  1   B Y  −B X    , BL Y   > B0   3.8    3.9   where B Y   is the amount of buffer space X lends to Y , BL Y   is the total amount of buffer space X lent to Y , BF  X  is the amount of buffer that has not been occupied, and B0 is the initial amount of buffer that a user can be lent.  Using the above two equations, each node can calculate how much it can lend to other users. When each pair of node offers equal-sized buffer space which they borrow from each other, the strategy PFG is similar to TFT, and according to the Nash equilibrium it is the maximum optimization possible. When the buffer space of a node is smaller than the expected buffer size of another node, then the node offers smaller buffer space between them, which is the Nash equilibrium of maximum optimization. So, both conditions lead to maximal interest.  3.5.3 Cooperative Game Theory  In non-cooperative game theory, each player’s individual actions are taken as prim- itives, whereas in cooperative game theory, the joint actions of group of players are taken as primitives.  Niyato et al. [35] used coalitional game theory for improving data delivery in DTNs. The authors ﬁrst developed a model based on a multi-dimensional absorbing   30  S. Misra et al.  Markov chain for heterogeneous groups of nodes in DTNs. This model measures the performance gain from various groups in terms of delay, throughput, and aver- age number of nodes carrying the packet. Then, they proposed a non-transferable utility  NTU  coalitional game. In a NTU game, the coalitional value cannot be as- signed a single real number, and thus, cannot be distributed among the players of the same coalition. The payoff received by each player in a coalition S is dependent on the joint actions that the players of coalition S select [36]. The game consists of communities or groups of nodes, strategy of each player and the payoff. The pay- off of data delivery of each community is calculated by considering the gain from throughput and loss from the cost of carrying and forwarding the packets. The strat- egy of each player is to ask whether to join or leave the coalition. A player can leave the coalition, if the payoff of the player is higher than that in original coalition. In this way, a coalition is split into multiple coalitions. Multiple coalition can collec- tively form a single coalition, if the newly formed coalition have higher payoff than the individual coalitions. The game is solved when it reaches a stable coalitional structure, where all players stops changing their decisions of joining and leaving the coalitions.  3.6 Other Cooperation Schemes Mechanisms  Besides the cooperation mechanism discussed above, there are other approaches, which shows how the cooperative and non-cooperative nodes affect the performance of routing in DTNs. We brieﬂy review them in this section.  Panagakis et al. [37] studied the effect of node cooperation  and lack of it  on epidemic, two-hop and binary spray-and-wait routing algorithms using the random direction mobility model. The performance of these algorithms was studied in terms of delivery delay of the messages and the corresponding transmission overhead. Co- operation was measured in terms of the node’s probability to drop the message copy on reception  Type I cooperation  due to misbehavior or resource constraints, or carry the message and forward the message copy upon node encounter  Type II co- operation . On reception of a message copy, a node either drops a message with probability Pdrop or forwards the message with probability Pf orward . So, the de- gree of cooperation in the ﬁrst case is  1 − Pdrop  and the degree of cooperation in the second case is Pf orward . Cooperation degree is measured using the metrics nor- malized mean delivery delay and total number of transmission as a function of the applied forwarding threshold. The authors observed that epidemic routing performs well in Type I and Type II cooperation, whereas binary spray-and-wait is more sen- sitive to mean delay and the two-hop relaying algorithm is the least sensitive to the cooperation algorithm.  Resta and Santi [38, 39] also analyzed the effect of different degree of node co- operation on the performance of routing protocols  epidemic, two-hop and binary spray-and-wait  in DTNs. Their work is different from [37] in the respect that they provide detailed theoretical insights on routing protocol performance in the pres- ence of different types of node cooperations. The authors considered four different   3 Cooperation in Delay Tolerant Networks  31  behaviors of the nodes—coop, def , rand and tft. In coop, the nodes behave normally according to the underlying routing protocol. In def , the nodes discard messages from the other nodes and send their own messages. In rand, the nodes forward other nodes messages with a probability p. With the tft strategy, a node forwards other nodes’ messages with a probability p, where p depends upon the network con- ditions. The authors evaluate the network performance with respect to the packet delivery rate. Epidemic routing performed the best and two-hop routing provided the worst performance. Binary SnW provided the best compromise between packet delivery rate and message transmission overhead.  Keranen et al. [40] considered forwarding, non-forwarding, and partly forward- ing nodes and investigated their impact on the message delivery ratio for three mobility scenarios  random waypoint, map-based model, and the real-life KAIST traces [41]  and three routing protocols  epidemic routing, spray-and-wait and PROPHET . In [37, 38], the nodes accept and silently drop the messages with some probability, which waste energy for the reception of the messages. On the contrary, in [40], the nodes do not accept the messages in the ﬁrst place, but exhibits a co- herent behavior. This work does not consider any incentive mechanism for cooper- ation. Instead, the authors proposed two types of behavior for cooperation—static and dynamic. Under the static cooperation scheme, behavior of the node remains the same throughout the network operation; under the dynamic scheme cooperation, the nodes acclimate the behavior on the basis of time energy constraints. Forward- ing nodes are cooperative nodes, which help in storing and forwarding the messages. Non-forwarding nodes are non-cooperative, which do not help in storing forwarding the messages of others, but receive messages destined to them using other nodes as free riders. Partly forwarding nodes receive others’ messages and forward if they come in direct contact with the corresponding destinations. So, the messages travel at most two hops for delivery to the destination. The authors evaluated network per- formance by considering the message delivery ratio achieved under the different routing protocols. The relative performance of spray-and-wait was less than the epi- demic and PROPHET protocols. All the three routing protocols behave good in the presence of 20–60 % of non-cooperating nodes, suggesting that mobile DTNs are quite robust against selﬁshness.  Panagakis et al. evaluated the effect of cooperation in DTNs through simulations. While Resta and Santi presented a theoretical framework for evaluating the effect of node cooperation in DTNs, they have not focused on the cost caused by the non- cooperation behaviors. Li et al. [42] studied the selﬁsh behavior of nodes which affects the system performance and analyzed how the non-cooperative behavior of the nodes impart negative impacts on the different routing algorithms. They consid- ered two-hop relay and epidemic routing protocol and modeled a two-dimensional continuous time Markov chain, which derives the system performance in terms of the message delivery latency and the delivery cost. The message delivery cost in- creases while dropping the messages, and reduces while not receiving the messages in the two-hop relay. Dropping a message increases the delay but does not affect the cost in case of epidemic routing. For both epidemic and two-hop routing pro- tocols, delivery latency increases and delivery cost decreases on not receiving the messages.   32  3.7 Open Issues  S. Misra et al.  The aspects of cooperation is promising in research on DTNs. While several ap- proaches for ensuring cooperation in such networks have been proposed, a few is- sues still remain there for further explorations.   Energy aspects: As discussed in Sect. 3.3, there are several attributes on which the nodes in a network could cooperate with each other. The existing works, however, do not investigate if energy of the nodes could be a driving force for cooperation. This is particularly relevant for unattended DTNs or PSNs, where the nodes do not have regular opportunities for recharging.   Multicasting scenarios: Multicasting in DTNs has received relatively less at- tention till date. Li et al. [43, 44] evaluated the performance of multicasting in energy-constrained DTNs in presence of social and individual selﬁshness of the nodes. It may be noted that any form of group-based communication would fail if the nodes in the network do not cooperate among themselves.   Content sharing in DTNs: Nguyen et al. [45] proposed Content Centric Delay Tolerant Networks  CCDTNs , where the content is provided through publish- subscribe mechanisms. The performance of CCDTNs would be affected if the nodes exhibit selﬁsh malicious behaviors. Such behavior could be with respect to the source destination of the content, or, perhaps, their category.   Human aspects: In PSNs, the mobile devices that communicate, are carried around by their human owners. Saha and Misra [12] have considered the effects of human intelligence on mission-oriented opportunistic networks  MOONs , which are an extension of the PSNs. It would be interesting to study how, if at all, the human factors affect cooperation in such networks.  3.8 Conclusion  To cope with issues such as intermittent connectivity, high latency, and asymmetric bandwidths, and provide interoperability among heterogeneous networks, the De- lay Tolerant Network  DTN  architecture was proposed. Since the communication opportunities among the nodes are rare in such challenged networks, it is desir- able that the nodes engage in cooperative behavior. In this work, we reviewed the incentive- and game theory-based approaches for stimulating cooperation in DTNs. While some schemes punish the selﬁsh malicious nodes, others reward the coop- erating ones. This survey reveals that game theoretic modeling of cooperation in DTNs is relatively poor, but growing. Furthermore, we identify several other direc- tions, for example, devices’ energy considerations and human aspects, into which the research efforts on cooperation in DTNs could be focused.

Jagannatham  4.1 Introduction  With the advent of 4G wireless cellular communication standards such as Long Term Evolution  LTE  [1], Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access  WiMAX  [2] and the parallel development of the high speed Wireless Local Area Network  WLAN  standards such as 802.11n, video transmission for wireless com- munication systems has become a reality. These latest standards are based on the cutting edge Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing  OFDM  and Multiple- Input Multiple-Output  MIMO -based physical layer  PHY  technologies and are envisaged to support data rates in excess of 50 Mbps. Further, the tremendous in- crease in the processing and computational power of the embedded processors also greatly supported the cause of multimedia processing in wireless clients. Hence, sev- eral wireless applications such as mobile video conferencing, video telephony, inter- active gaming, and mobile TV, which are based on transmission of rich multimedia content are in high demand. Moreover, video transmission has a vital role in crit- ical applications such as security, reconnaissance, surveillance, health monitoring amongst others. Thus digital video holds the key in future wireless communication. However, digital video transmission over wireless channels is signiﬁcantly compli- cated compared to traditional voice transmission due to the tremendous amount of bandwidth required. The following example illustrates the need for sophisticated signal processing for video transmission. As shown in Fig. 4.1, digital video transmission is organized into a series of picture frames. Consider the transmission of a video sequence of resolution 640 × 480 pixels at a rate of 30 frames per second with each of the Red, Green and Blue  RGB  components quantized to one byte each per pixel.

Jagannatham  required for such video transfer is given as  Rraw = 30 × 640 × 480 × 3 × 8 = 220 Mbps.  Hence transmission of a raw unprocessed video signal consumes a signiﬁcant amount of bandwidth that cannot be supported by traditional communication links. It is therefore imperative to compress the video content prior to wireless transmis- sion and this involves the use of a video encoder. At the receiver, the video signal can be reconstructed from the compressed data stream through the use of a corre- sponding decoder. This encoder-decoder pair, which employs a certain format of compression, is termed a codec.  Figure 4.2 shows a basic schematic of a wireless communication system for video transmission. It is the complexity of the encoder and decoder processing which make the design and implementation of wireless video transmission an arduously chal- lenging task. Further, there is a keen interest in developing open global standards for the video codecs to ensure uniformity and platform independent video transmission and decodability. This desire has resulted in the coming together of video compres- sion experts across the world to spawn international standardization bodies such as ITU-T VCEG  Video Coding Experts Group  and ISO IEC MPEG  Motion Picture Experts Group  amongst others. Their efforts have resulted in the development of video compression standards such as MPEG-2, H.262, MPEG-4, H.264 etc., which have greatly sped up the implementation and adoption of systems for digital video storage and transmission such as DVDs, set-top boxes, video streaming over IP and so on. In this context, the H.264 SVC  Scalable Video Coding or Scalable Video Codec, depending on the context  is one such standard that has garnered signiﬁcant attention due to the promise it holds for wireless transmission of video content and is the focus of this paper. In the rest of the paper we describe the motivation to de- ploy such an SVC over wireless channels, followed by an elaborate overview of the SVC process and paradigms for optimization of multimedia streaming.   4 Wireless Multimedia  4G and Beyond   39  Fig. 4.2 Generic schematic of a video compression-based wireless communication system  Fig. 4.3 Spatial and temporal redundancies in a video stream  4.2 Basics of Video Compression  A digital video stream consists of a sequence of images known as frames  shown in Fig. 4.1  represented using the binary format of logical 0s and 1s. Such a video sequence is typically generated by the visual sampling of a dynamically evolving scene [3]. Video frames contain a signiﬁcant amount of spatially and temporally redundant information. The spatial redundancy arises from the fact that a substantial part of a typical frame is comprised of the background and objects with large swaths of uniform intensity such as people, trees etc. and is illustrated in the rectangular boxes in the frames in Fig. 4.3. Hence, a signiﬁcant reduction in the number of bits required to represent a frame can be obtained by compressing the spatially redundant parts of the picture frame. This is termed intra-frame compression and such frames are termed I frames. This is essentially similar to the principle employed in still image compression standards such as JPEG, GIF etc.  A unique feature of video that sets it apart from still images is the presence of a large amount of temporal redundant information. This arises from the presence of a number of objects displaced slightly between successive frames as indicated by the elliptical regions in the successive frames in Fig. 4.3. By predicting the motion   40  A.K. Jagannatham  Fig. 4.4 Motion prediction-based video compression  of the different objects or different components of a composite object  such as a human face , temporal redundancy can be eliminated, in turn substantially lowering the bit rate. This process is termed motion compensation  MC  and a generic encoder schematic that employs MC-based compression is shown in Fig. 4.4.  The process of predicting the motion of the objects between successive frames is termed motion estimation. This is done through the computation of motion vectors, which represent the direction and magnitude of displacement of the objects between the current and previous frame [3]. These motion vectors can be represented as a motion vector ﬁeld shown in Fig. 4.5.  Thus, in principle one can transmit the previous frame and the motion vectors and avoid transmission of the current frame entirely to save the bit rate. However, many times the motion vector estimation is not accurate. Further, motion estima- tion suffers from the problems of occlusion and uncovering. Occlusion refers to the phenomenon when an object in the previous frame becomes occluded in the cur- rent frame due to another object blocking it. Uncovering refers to the opposite case where an object becomes visible in the current frame after being blocked visually in the previous frame. Both these occurrences result in inaccuracies in motion pre- diction. Hence, one also transmits along with the motion vectors, the error between the motion compensated previous frame and the current frame  which is essentially small if the motion prediction algorithm is accurate and robust . The same is rep- resented in the schematic in Fig. 4.5 and lies at the heart of all modern video com- pression algorithms.   4 Wireless Multimedia  4G and Beyond   41  Fig. 4.5 Motion vector ﬁeld for a sample video frame  Fig. 4.6 IPB frames for video compression  Such frames which are predicted exclusively from a single past or future I frame are termed predicted or P frames. Further, frames can be predicted from a combina- tion of past and future frames, and such frames are denoted by B or bi-directionally coded frames. Figure 4.6 shows a typical sequence of frames in a compressed video stream along with the prediction dependencies. Such a sequence is termed a GOP  Group of Pictures . The interested reader can ﬁnd a more elaborate introduction to video compression in [4].  4.3 H.264 Video Compression and Scalable Video Coding  H.264 SVC supports video transmission at multiple bit rates depending on the qual- ity demanded and supported by the wireless environment [5]. However, a unique feature of the SVC is that the computational complexity required to code at several bit rates does not scale linearly with the number of bit rates supported. Instead, by   42  A.K. Jagannatham  Fig. 4.7 Group of pictures for temporal scalability  coding each higher bit rate as an enhancement layer over a base layer, the encoding complexity is much lower compared to multiple rate coding, signiﬁcantly improv- ing the ease of processing. Thus, it essentially codes a master bit-stream from which several valid lower quality video streams can be extracted depending on the require- ment. The term scalable refers to this aspect of the video stream, where the quality of the video content can be appropriately scaled by choosing to retain and drop dif- ferent layers from the same master bit-stream. Conventional bit-streams that do not have this scalability feature are termed single-layer streams. Scalability is achieved in the H.264 SVC through three scalability modes. These are  1. Temporal scalability 2. Spatial scalability 3. Quality or SNR scalability  Below we describe each of these modes in greater detail.  4.4 Temporal Scalability  A video stream is said to be temporally scalable when the frame rate of the stream can be varied adaptively by dropping a subset of frames from the master bit stream. A schematic of such a temporally scalable video stream is shown in Fig. 4.7. Each frame Tk belongs to the kth temporal layer, with k = 0 denoting the base tem- poral layer. The scalable stream is organized such that one can dispense with all   4 Wireless Multimedia  4G and Beyond   43  Fig. 4.8 Spatially scalable video stream  frames belonging to layers k ≥ K + 1 and the remaining frames belonging to lay- ers 0, 1, . . . , K will still constitute a valid video sequence, albeit one of a lower frame rate. Hence, the lowest temporal resolution one can choose corresponds to the layer T0. The addition of each subsequent higher layer increases the temporal resolution of the video sequence.  4.5 Spatial Scalability  A video stream is spatially scalable when one can dynamically vary the pixel res- olution of the transmitted video frames. A schematic of a spatially scalable video stream is illustrated in Fig. 4.8. This in turn yields a convenient handle to vary the bit rate dynamically, as it is directly proportional to the spatial resolution. Thus, one can transmit or extract a stream of lower spatial resolution for video streaming on handheld devices such as mobile phones and PDAs, while higher spatial resolutions can be employed for video conferencing, gaming, and other applications on portable laptop computers. Again, as in the case of temporal scalability, one can discard all spatial layers Sk such that k ≥ K + 1 and the remaining layers constitute a valid video stream, which has a lower spatial resolution compared to one that includes all the spatial layers. The video frames illustrated in Fig. 4.9 employ a dyadic scaling, in which the spatial resolution increases by a factor of 2 with each decoded enhancement layer.  4.6 SNR or Quality Scalability  Quality scalability refers to varying the bit-rate of the transmitted bit-stream by adaptively adjusting the resolution of the quantizer employed to represent the digi- tal frame. A coarser quantization results in a lower bit-rate and higher quantization noise level. This in turn yields a low SNR for the digital video stream and the cor- respondingly lower ﬁdelity of reproduction. Figure 4.10 shows three digital video   44  A.K. Jagannatham  Fig. 4.9 Video frames illustrating dyadic spatial scaling  Fig. 4.10 Video frames of decreasing quantizer resolution  frames encoded at progressively coarser quantization levels  quantization is coarser from left to right . Thus, by tweaking the ﬁdelity of the digital video one can opti- mally scale the bit-rate of the video stream to match the link quality of the wireless environment and also meet the QoS criteria for content delivery. The resolution of the quantizer is adapted in the transform or the DCT domain as it yields the most graceful degradation with decreasing quantizer resolution. As in the case of spatial and temporal scalability, the base layer video stream has the lowest SNR or essen- tially corresponds to the coarsest quantizer resolution. Each successive reﬁnement layer is predicted from the lower layers and the transform domain  block DCT  co- efﬁcients of the error image are quantized at a much ﬁner resolution compared to the lower layers and coded using a variable length entropy code.   4 Wireless Multimedia  4G and Beyond   45  4.7 Conclusion  The H.264 SVC speciﬁes the video stream syntax for the scalable proﬁle of the H.264 video compression standard. The scalability characteristic of the video stream is achieved through a combination of the temporal, spatial, and quality parameters of the video stream. However, the complexity of encoding this scalable stream is much lower than coding independently at multiple bit rates. The H.264 SVC’s rel- evance has been demonstrated in the context of next generation wireless networks since it can optimize the network performance for multimedia delivery by adaptively adjusting the bit-rate to suit the link quality, end client specs, and QoS constraints.

One factor is the con- centration of population in speciﬁc areas. The technical report of the United Nations Population Foundations showed that for the ﬁrst time, more than half of the world’s population lives in urban areas [31]. As the urban zones become more populated, the needs of mobility and solutions to congestion problems increase. People depend on mobility, which provides personal freedom and access to services for business and pleasure. The amount of time that people spend on traveling from one location to another can vary signiﬁcantly depending on the trafﬁc conditions. The growing vol- ume of trafﬁc has adverse effects on the environment, economy, and public health and especially in accidents that cause fatalities, injuries, and material damages.  The Texas Transportation Institute published in its technical report that in 2010 trafﬁc congestion represented $101 billion dollars of annual drain on the U.S. econ- omy, with 4.8 billion hours and 1.9 billion gallons of fuel spent on trafﬁc. These numbers are equivalent to one workweek and three weeks worth of gas every year [29]. In Europe, trafﬁc congestion costs $50 billion per year or 0.5 % of the community Gross Domestic Product  GDP . If appropriate measures are not taken in the next few years, this percentage could increase to 1 %.  J.A. Guerrero-Ibáñez  B  · C. Flores-Cortés  School of Telematics, University of Colima, Av.

Guerrero-Ibáñez et al.  According to the technical report on trafﬁc congestion and greenhouse gases [3] a third of America’s carbon dioxide  CO2  emissions come from moving people or goods, and 80 % of these emissions are from cars and trucks. According to the Eurostat data, road transport accounted for 19.5 % of the European Union  EU  total greenhouse gas emissions in 2008 [2].  In addition, the technical report of the Commission for Global Road Safety indi- cates that road crashes kill at least 1.3 million people each year and injure 50 mil- lion. Notably, 90 % of these road casualties occur in developing countries. Each year 260,000 children die on the road and another million are seriously injured. By 2015 road crashes are predicted to be the leading cause of premature death and disability for children aged ﬁve and older [5].  The statistics and data reported above show that our society faces signiﬁcant chal- lenges in the transportation area that need to be addressed as quickly as possible. To solve several of the aforementioned transportation problems, and improve trans- portation safety, security, and efﬁciency and enable the development of novel vehic- ular applications, the researchers have been focusing on the design, development, and deployment of intelligent mechanisms and technologies. The primary goal of researchers and engineers is to make trafﬁc control and management more efﬁcient and safe. Emerging communication technologies are being used in innovative solu- tions to reduce trafﬁc congestion and improve safety. Safety and efﬁciency on roads should be substantially improved with the deployment of intelligent systems such as adaptive trafﬁc control, incident detection and management systems both in cities and highways. Vehicles must be equipped with wireless radios and communication devices must be placed on roadsides. Roadside units can be utilized to extend the network coverage, enable communication between distant vehicles  i.e. beyond the vehicle’s radio range , support a high-speed and low-latency network and provide services to both public and private companies. In this sense, recent technological advances, particularly in the areas of mobile computing, electronic and telecommu- nications have enabled the emergence of new concepts such as Intelligent Trans- portation Systems  ITS  and a new generation of wireless ad-hoc networks namely Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks  VANETs .  We present an overview of some of the trafﬁc and transportation issues and how the use of communication and information technologies can address various trans- portation challenges listed earlier. We focus on how ITS and, speciﬁcally, VANETs can contribute to the development of solutions that improve or solve the problems related to transportation systems. The rest of the chapter is organized as follows. Section 5.2 presents an overview of the ITS. In Sect. 5.3, we present VANET applications and communication technologies used in VANETs. Section 5.4 de- scribes various routing protocols that have been recently proposed for VANETs. In Sect. 5.5, we discuss various VANET security issues. Section 5.6 outlines some of the challenges and opportunities for VANETs followed by some concluding re- marks in Sect. 5.7.   5 VANETs: Architecture, Protocols and Applications  51  5.2 Intelligent Transportation Systems  To improve safety, security, and efﬁciency of transportation systems, the develop- ment of novel vehicular applications is required. Applications related to transporta- tion systems are commonly referred as Intelligent Transportation Systems  ITS  [25]. There is no unique deﬁnition of ITS. Each country or region that attempts to implement ITS has its own vision and deﬁnition. For example, Europe deﬁnes ITS as the new application that information and communication technologies are ﬁnding in urban transport and it is also referred as Transport Telematics [8]. In the United States, the Intelligent Transportation Society of America  ITSA  deﬁnes ITS as a broad range of different technologies can address many of the existing transportation problems. ITS consist of various technologies including information processing, communications, control, and electronics. The integration of all these technologies into existing transportation systems is intended to save lives, time and money [13]. Finally, Japan refers to ITS as a fundamental solution to solve the prob- lems related to transportation systems, which in turn covers trafﬁc accidents, trafﬁc congestion and environmental pollution. ITS deals with these issues using the most advanced communication and control technologies [12].  As we mentioned previously, each country has its own vision of ITS but they all share the same common vision: the usage of emerging technologies to solve issues related to transportation systems. Generally, ITS attempt to utilize communication and information technologies in vehicles and vehicular infrastructures to manage all elements  such as vehicles, trafﬁc loads, and routes  that make up the transporta- tion network. The objectives of ITS include safety, reduced travel times, optimize the trafﬁc ﬂows and reduce the fuel consumption. ITS aim to solve these aforemen- tioned issues by applying emerging technologies such as wireless, sensing, cellular, and mesh networks.  By carefully integrating relevant emerging technologies into the transportation system’s infrastructure, and in vehicles themselves, the congestion can be alleviated and road safety improved along with an increase in productivity. However, the main challenge is to integrate all technologies within a complementary and cooperative environment that can address various transportation problems. This new cooperative environment where all networking, electronic, and computing technologies are well integrated will enable safer roads, and achieve more efﬁcient mobility and minimize the environmental impact.  One of the most important components of ITS is the Vehicular Ad-hoc NETwork  VANET . VANET is a type of wireless ad-hoc network designed to provide sup- port to a wide variety of applications and beneﬁts in areas such as vehicular safety, entertainment, and trafﬁc control among others.  5.3 Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks  VANET is considered as a subgroup of Mobile Ad-hoc Networks  MANETs  in which all nodes are vehicles that move at various speeds. The main objective of   52  J.A. Guerrero-Ibáñez et al.  VANET is to enable communication among vehicles on the road and between ve- hicles and roadside infrastructures. For this communication to be possible, devices known as On-Board Units  OBUs  and RoadSide Units  RSUs  must be placed at each vehicle and road, respectively. These devices can send or receive data to or from roadside units. Nevertheless, if a vehicle cannot directly send its data to an RSU, it can relay its data to other vehicles until the data reach a RSU using a multi- hop transmission strategy [35].  5.3.1 VANETs and MANETs  VANETs and MANETs share common features such as the movement, self- organization and self-management of information in a distributed fashion without a centralized authority or server controlling the communication. Although VANETs share common characteristics with MANETs, VANETs have distinctive features that impact the design of communication systems, protocols, and applications. Some of the unique characteristics of VANETs include:   In VANETs a node movement is restricted by several factors such as road trafﬁc direction and regulations.   Unlike MANETs, nodes in VANETs are not subject to power and storage limita- tions.   In VANETs the topology is considered highly dynamic because it is always changing, as vehicles are moving at various speeds.   The propagation model is usually not assumed to be free space because of the presence of different obstacles and potential interference of wireless communica- tions from other vehicles or access points.  Dahiya and Chauhan summarized some of the technical aspects that contrast  VANETs from MANETs. Their analysis is presented in Table 5.1 [6].  5.3.2 Communication Modes in VANET  VANET communication can be categorized into inter-vehicular communication and vehicle to infrastructure communication. Inter-vehicular communication refers to the kind of communication in which vehicles communicate with each other via wireless technology, also referred to as Vehicle-to-Vehicle communication  V2V  as shown in Fig. 5.1. As Fig. 5.1 illustrates when a vehicle breaks down, immedi- ately, the vehicle begins the information dissemination process using the broadcast communication mode. The vehicles that are near to the vehicle, which has broken down, re-transmit the message. In this way vehicles are notiﬁed and can take alter- native routes, avoiding a possible problem of trafﬁc congestion.  The second mode of communication refers to communication where vehicles and ﬁxed infrastructure exchange information. This communication mode is referred to   5 VANETs: Architecture, Protocols and Applications  53  Table 5.1 A comparison of MANET and VANET  Parameter  MANET  VANET  Cost of production Change in topology Mobility Node density Bandwidth Range Node lifetime Multihop routing Moving pattern of nodes Position acquisition  Cheap Slow Low Sparse 100 kbps Up to 100 m Depends on power resource Available Random Using ultrasonic  Expensive Very fast High Dense and frequently variable 1000 kbps Up to 500 m Depends on the lifetime of vehicle Weakly available Regular Using GPS, Radar, etc.  Fig. 5.1 Vehicle to vehicle communication mode  V2V   as Vehicle-to-Infrastructure  V2I  or Vehicle to Roadside  V2R  communication. V2I is the direct wireless exchange of relevant information between vehicles and the communication units placed on the side of roads and avenues. Figure 5.2 shows a representation of this kind of communication. In this scenario we observe that when a vehicle is broken down, the vehicle begins the communication with the ﬁxed infrastructure in order to notify the problem. The base station notiﬁes the vehicles that are within its coverage area about the problem identiﬁed. At the same time, the base station could begin the inter-roadside communication process to extend the area of coverage. In this way vehicles further away are notiﬁed and can take alternative routes, avoiding a potential problem of trafﬁc congestion.   54  J.A. Guerrero-Ibáñez et al.  Fig. 5.2 Vehicle to infrastructure communication mode  V2I   5.4 Vanet Applications and Communication Technologies  5.4.1 VANET Applications  One of the most important challenges that researchers are facing is to satisfy the various requirements associated with VANETs and their applications.  Recent hardware and software advances along with the emergence of VANET have led to the emergence of a wide range of VANET applications. Santa et al. [28] classiﬁed vehicular applications depending on the method of communica- tion used [28]. In this case, the authors deﬁne three categories: vehicle-to-vehicle, vehicle-to-infrastructure and a combination of both. Another classiﬁcation method is based on the penetration rate. This method deﬁnes two categories: behavior and warning applications [24]. Cooperative behavior applications apply communication technologies for supporting inter-vehicular cooperation schemes for gathering other vehicles information. These applications enhance the perception of the environment through the usage of different on-board sensors. On the other hand, warning appli- cations focus on the dissemination of relevant information, such as trafﬁc conditions and alerts of on-road incidents to improve trafﬁc ﬂuency and safety by preventing and avoiding accidents.  Another classiﬁcation is based on the application area. According to this clas- siﬁcation, applications for vehicular networks are divided into three major groups: safety, infotainment and assistance, and trafﬁc efﬁciency and management.   Safety applications are those that are employed to minimize the probability of trafﬁc accidents and to avoid collisions situations that most frequently occur be-   5 VANETs: Architecture, Protocols and Applications  55  tween vehicles and other objects such as animals, trees, and pedestrians. This type of applications relies on real-time information and uses a vehicle-to-vehicle com- munication scheme. They provide information and assistance to drivers to avoid trafﬁc accidents. Vehicles and roadside units share information, which is then used to predict a dangerous situation. Moreover, this information is used to locate dangerous locations on roads. They use beacon messages, a single-hop position- based or fast-bidirectional communication regime, and their latency cannot ex- ceed 100 milliseconds, whereas the packet delivery ratio cannot be lower than 99 % [24]. Some examples of safety applications include: intersection collision warning, lane change assistance, overtaking vehicle warning, head on collision warning, and emergency vehicle warning.   Infotainment and driver assistance applications provide services such as com- fort and driving assistance. This class of applications attempts to support all fea- tures needed by drivers and passengers for a convenient travel. Driver assistance applications provide information about repair notiﬁcations, remote diagnostics, context information, navigation information, and alerts. These applications usu- ally use vehicle-to-backofﬁce or vehicle-to-roadside communication. They uti- lize normal messages and bidirectional communication; their latency cannot be higher than 400 milliseconds, whereas the packet delivery ratio cannot be lower than 95 % [24]. Infotainment applications also are known as in-car comfort en- tertainment, and they usually do not use inter-vehicular communications. These applications are usually found inside vehicles or at vehicle-to-roadside settings. They use alerts, a multihop position-based communication scheme, and their la- tency cannot be higher than 400 milliseconds, whereas the packet delivery ratio cannot be lower than 95 % [24]. Applications in this category include cooperative local services and global Internet services.   Trafﬁc management applications capture domain issues such as trafﬁc bottlenecks and fuel consumption amongst others, including environmental issues. These ap- plications focus on improving the vehicle trafﬁc ﬂow, trafﬁc coordination and trafﬁc assistance, and provide updated local information, maps and information of relevance bounded in space and time. This type of time-to-live trafﬁc application is usually used by vehicle-to-backofﬁce or vehicle-to-roadside scenarios. They may use beacons or alerts, a multihop position-based communication regime, and their latency cannot be higher than 400 milliseconds, whereas the packet delivery ratio cannot be lower than 95 % [24].  5.4.2 Communication Technologies in VANET  VANET applications have different requirements in terms of bandwidth, latency, er- ror rate, and coverage area. These requirements must be satisﬁed at any time and at any location. It is necessary to evaluate the properties of different existing network access technologies such as Wireless Local Area Network  WLAN , Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access  WiMAX , cellular networks, and satellite   56  Fig. 5.3 Channels available in 802.11p  J.A. Guerrero-Ibáñez et al.  communications. One of the challenges is the selection of the appropriate access technology that can meet the service requirements of the various VANET applica- tions. The 802.11-based WLAN is very popular and it supports fairly high-speed data transmissions but its area of coverage is limited. Even though this technology can reach a data rate of 100 Mbps, its short transmission range leads to frequent interruptions of communications particularly when the speed of vehicles is high making it necessary to deploy an important number of access points along the road. The 802.11 task force group has been working on the development of a new communication standard known as IEEE 802.11p. This new standard is based on the 802.11a technology and is also referred as the Dedicated Short-Range Com- munications  DSRC  standard. DSRC uses the 5 GHz frequency spectrum that is divided into seven channels  10 MHz each : one control channel  CCH  and six service channels  SCHs  as shown in Fig. 5.3 [32]. DSRC evolved into Wireless Access in Vehicular Environment  WAVE . WAVE supports high-speed V2V and V2I communications and has major applications in ITS, vehicle safety services, and Internet access. WAVE operates at 5.850–5.925 GHz and adopts Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing  OFDM  and achieves data rates of 6–27 Mbs s [34].  Nodes use the control channel to exchange network control messages and the service channels to exchange data packets and WAVE short messages. The link bandwidth of these channels is further divided into transmission cycles. Each cy- cle comprises a control frame and a service frame. The draft of the IEEE 802.11p standard suggests a frame duration of 50 milliseconds for either a control frame or a service frame. DSRC supports a very high data rate  6–27 Mbps  with a maximum coverage of 1000 m. Some studies have investigated the performance of DSRC for various VANET applications. The results of these investigations have shown that the reliability of DSRC in vehicle-to-vehicle communication is satisfactory for its usage in vehicular safety applications [1, 18].   5 VANETs: Architecture, Protocols and Applications  57  WiMAX is a technology based on the IEEE 802.16 standard that supports a large geographical coverage  up to 50 km , and offers adequate bandwidth to end-users  up to 72 Mbps theoretically . Even though the IEEE 802.16 standard only supports ﬁxed broadband wireless communication, the versions of the 802.16e and 802.16j standard support speeds of up to 160 km h and classify the information in several classes of service. In terms of Quality of Service  QoS , WiMAX deﬁnes ﬁve cate- gories of service. In WiMAX the quality of service is managed by the channel access method. WiMAX makes use of a scheduling algorithm for which the subscriber sta- tion needs to compete only once for initial entry into the network. Afterwards, it is allocated an access slot by the base station.  Different performance comparison analyses of 802.11p and 802.16 have been reported demonstrating that the 802.16-based technology offers a wider radio of coverage and higher data rates than IEEE 802.11p. The results also showed that the latency of 802.16 is signiﬁcantly larger when the communication distance is short  e.g. less than 100 m . However, the results also revealed the strong competitiveness of the 802.16-based technology in the context of vehicle to infrastructure communi- cation [4, 19].  3G cellular wireless technology supports a broad area of coverage and high- mobility. Current third Generation  3G  networks deliver a data rate that ranges from 384 kbps to 2 Mbps for ﬁxed nodes. 3G systems deliver smoother handoffs compared to WLAN and WiMAX systems; however, their main weakness is their latency. The 3G technology usually yields delay values in the order of several hun- dreds of milliseconds which are too high for critical applications. However, as vari- ous studies have shown, cellular networks are able to maintain a regular behavior in latency times [15].  Satellite communication is another technology available for supporting vehicu- lar communications that provides ubiquitous coverage at any location. However, the main problems of networks that utilize this technology are the high costs and large propagation delays. The design of a global platform for vehicular communications is an important challenge. The design of this global platform should be on the ba- sis of intelligent integration of readily available technologies in order to minimize its deployment cost and speed up its deployment. However, the design should also support new emerging technologies. Recent research trends have been focusing on two areas: heterogeneous architectures and multi-interface mobile nodes. Various design of integrated architectures made up of different technologies interconnected using an ad-hoc communication model have been proposed recently [22, 35]. For multi-interface mobile nodes, the usage of several radios in the OBU to enhance the performance of the network has been investigated.  5.5 Routing Protocols in VANET  As VANETs become more complex, transporting information from one vehicle to another or to all vehicles within a given region or area becomes a highly challenging   58  J.A. Guerrero-Ibáñez et al.  Fig. 5.4 Classiﬁcation of VANET routing protocols  task. A lot of research has been carried out to develop protocols and mechanisms that can provide network services  e.g. routing  to applications in a VANET en- vironment. Several classiﬁcations of the various routing protocols for transporting information have been proposed in the literature [16, 20, 36]. Figure 5.4 shows a summary of some of the recently proposed routing protocols for VANETs.  5.5.1 Broadcast Routing Protocols  The Broadcast routing approach is generally used for disseminating information on a large scale. This information can be trafﬁc, weather, emergency, and road con- ditions. This communication scheme sends packets to all nodes in the network us- ing ﬂooding  Fig. 5.5 . When messages need to be disseminated beyond the radio transmission range, a multihop mechanism is utilized. Thus, in a native broadcast implementation, all receiving nodes simply rebroadcast the received messages. To limit message duplication, nodes broadcast messages only once, and a time to live parameter can be utilized to limit the area of coverage of messages. Using this rout- ing scheme, the delivery of messages to all nodes is guaranteed. However, a large amount of bandwidth is consumed and is the reason why this routing scheme only performs well when a small number of nodes is participating within the VANET and its performance drops quickly when the size of the network increases.  5.5.2 Geocast Routing Protocols  Geocast is a multicast routing approach that delivers messages to nodes located within a given geographical region  Fig. 5.6 . These routing protocols generally   5 VANETs: Architecture, Protocols and Applications  59  Fig. 5.5 Broadcast routing protocol  Fig. 5.6 Geocast routing protocol   60  J.A. Guerrero-Ibáñez et al.  Fig. 5.7 Forwarding routing protocol  deﬁne a forwarding zone that limits the ﬂooding of messages. Using this routing scheme it is possible to, for instance, report an accident to vehicles located within a given region or alert a driver when driving on a motorway in the wrong-way.  5.5.3 Forwarding Routing Protocols  The forwarding routing approach transports messages between two nodes via mul- tiple hops  Fig. 5.7 . This mechanism is useful when the requested information is only of interest to a few nodes. For example, a node may request information to a nearby car parking about free car parking spaces and fees. When a node is request- ing information, a unicast message is sent. To forward the message to its destination a route is reactively constructed, for example, by looking at local routing tables or by asking nearby nodes whether they know about the destination node.  5.5.4 Cluster-Based Routing Protocols  The cluster-based approach groups nodes located within a given region  e.g. nodes with direct link to each other . For each cluster, a cluster head node is selected which is responsible for managing inter and intra-cluster communication  Fig. 5.8 . The cluster-based structure functions as a virtual network infrastructure whose scalabil- ity favors routing and media access protocols although an overhead cost is incurred when forming clusters in highly mobile network environments and network delays may occur for large networks.   5 VANETs: Architecture, Protocols and Applications  61  Fig. 5.8 Cluster-based routing protocol  5.5.5 Beaconing Routing Protocols  The Beaconing routing mechanism is suitable for applications that require sharing information with other vehicles periodically  e.g. the exchange of local trafﬁc in- formation . In this routing scheme a node announces information periodically and the receiving nodes do not rebroadcast the received message immediately. Instead, they store the received information in their local information caches. On the next beacon, a message is constructed using both information from the local cache and the incoming information and is rebroadcast to neighboring nodes.  5.5.6 Position-Based Routing Protocols  For Position-based routing to work, information on the location of each node is fundamental. To decide on how to route messages, nodes utilize geographical lo- cation information obtained from sources such as street maps, trafﬁc models and on-board navigational systems  Fig. 5.9 . Routing decisions at each node are made by taking into consideration the position of the destination node and each node’s location information. As routing tables are not required, no overhead is incurred on maintaining and establishing routes.  5.5.7 Delay-Tolerant Routing Protocols  The Delay-tolerant routing mechanism is used where the density of vehicles is really low and consequently establishing end-to-end routes is not possible. For example at   62  J.A. Guerrero-Ibáñez et al.  Fig. 5.9 Position-based routing protocol  nights, trafﬁc in cities can be really low and available vehicles may not be close enough to receive and forward messages. Also, in rural areas vehicle density may be low and, for such sparse networks, a delay-tolerant protocol can be utilized. This routing mechanism is based on the concept of carry and forward, where a node carries messages and these are only forwarded when another node moves into its vicinity, otherwise, they are simply stored.  5.5.8 Ad-hoc Routing Protocols  Ad-hoc routing protocols were initially designed to operate in Mobile Ad-hoc Net- works  MANET  environments. VANET attempts to test these routing protocols in such new environments have been carried out [17, 26]. However, requirements  such as unique address identiﬁcation  of these address-based and topology-based mechanisms make these protocols less suitable for VANETs.  5.6 Security in VANET  As VANET becomes more ubiquitous in the near future, a serious challenge in this environment is security. As we mentioned previously, VANET is a special imple- mentation of MANET. Consequently, VANETs inherit all the security issues asso- ciated with MANETs. The malicious behavior of users, such as the modiﬁcation of the disseminated messages, could be fatal to the other vehicular users.   5 VANETs: Architecture, Protocols and Applications  63  Security and privacy in vehicular networks are important prerequisites for their acceptance. VANETs’ architectures and communication schemes will provide de- velopers an environment for the deployment of a wide variety of applications. How- ever, major concerns of such environments are security and privacy. To protect both applications and users from possible attacks, strong security mechanisms are re- quired. Therefore, robust schemes are needed to protect users’ private information. For example, user-related privacy information such as driver’s name, license plate, speed, position, must be protected and only accessed by authorized users. Such in- formation should be shared by entities that satisfy a set of required privacy and authentication requirements. VANETs’ security is of great importance because any vulnerability could lead to disastrous accidents where people’s integrity may be put at risk.  Security mechanisms and schemes must guarantee the protection of personal data transmitted through VANET including but not limited to identity, location, and destination, among others. In this context, various authors have recently published in the literature some of the possible security and privacy threats in VANETs [14, 23, 25, 27]. We summarize below some of these threats.   Denial of service: An attacker may intentionally prevent communication of vehi- cles located within its communication range by jamming their communication  for instance, generating interfering transmissions or selectively erasing mes- sages . This attack may prevent the delivery of important information to the in- tended destination. In the case of a denial of service attack, vehicles may not be able to receive messages from a vehicle alerting of an accident ahead.   Impersonation: A vehicle within a VANET may pretend to be or act as a special type of vehicle  e.g. ambulance or patrol car  or infrastructure  e.g. roadside unit  spooﬁng trafﬁc or safety messages. Examples of techniques that can be utilized towards impersonation include message fabrication, alteration and replay. An at- tacker impersonating a roadside unit, for instance, may contaminate the network fabricating false safety alarms.   Privacy violation: To prevent spooﬁng attacks  such as a Sybil attack when an en- tity masquerades as multiple, simultaneous identities  a mechanism to bind each vehicle driver within the VANET to a single identity could be utilized. A strong authentication scheme like this could be used to provide forensic evidence to tra- ditional law enforcement approaches and prevent attacks on vehicular networks. However, such a system may also result in drivers abandoning their anonymity and exposing valuable information to attackers. The frequent exchange of mes- sages containing sensitive personal data such as location, trip details, vehicle identiﬁcation, and e-payment information among others pose a high risk to pri- vacy violations, as attackers can potentially overhear messages and misuse the information contained in them.   On-board and in-transit trafﬁc tampering: On-board units are susceptible to at- tacks from outsiders whom may attempt to alter sensed data such as speed or lo- cation. Similarly, attackers may manipulate critical in-transit trafﬁc information corrupting or dropping overheard messages.   64  J.A. Guerrero-Ibáñez et al.  5.6.1 Security and Privacy Challenges  The unique characteristics of VANETs such as fast mobility of nodes, frequent changes in topology, self-organization of nodes and user requirements make it chal- lenging to guarantee security and privacy. As we mentioned earlier, VANET is highly susceptible to different types of attack and adversary  e.g. greedy drivers, snoops and pranksters . To support and protect VANET applications various secu- rity and privacy challenges must be addressed. To address these security and privacy challenges the following design principles have been proposed [23, 25].   Default network access: Messages broadcasted should be accessible to all nodes that can receive them, and, all nodes must assist in enabling multihop communi- cation.   Authenticated localization of message origin: Vehicular applications must be able to determine the origin of a message at a given location. With the exception of the originator, nodes should not be able to modify messages and receivers must corroborate the message’s sender.   Visibility of events: In the case of distributed protocols, events that trigger joint computations or actions must be visible to or attested by all participating nodes  e.g. neighboring nodes . To attest messages, a node is either responsible for the generated event or has locality and timeliness privileges such as the reception of the message within a given time interval from its generation.   Mandated  non-circumventable  mediation: All actions that impact on the secu- rity state of the network  e.g. node identiﬁcation scheme and authentication mech- anism  must be mediated by a network authority and should not be bypassed or avoided by any node.   Accountability: Protocol executions and messages that can have an impact on substantial functions of the network  e.g. an alert message notifying of a vehicle failure  should be subject to auditing.   Vehicle autonomy: With the exception of mediated messages and protocols VANET applications can be autonomous with respect to other nodes. For ex- ample, messages from other nodes can be rejected.   Separation of privilege: Security, privacy and fault-tolerance systems must be distributed among multiple authorities. Each authority must be in charge of one activity and should only have the rights necessary to complete the designated task.   Liability and faulty behavior: A node causing deliberate or accidental actions that disrupt the operation of the VANET must be legally responsible for its actions and it should be possible for authorities to identify such a node. As the faulty behavior could be intentional or as a result of network or nodes’ failures, authorities could utilize a staged response mechanism where penalties may range from a warning notiﬁcation at the ﬁrst stage to an eviction from the system at the last stage.   Privacy: Personal data such as the identity of the driver and the vehicle, location, speed, and traveling routes must be protected. Nevertheless, as mentioned in the liability and faulty behavior principle, authorities must be capable of identifying messages’ senders in case of an accident or violation of legal regulations.   5 VANETs: Architecture, Protocols and Applications  65    Availability: Regardless of faults or malicious conditions, the network and appli- cations must remain operational. This implies that the design of protocols and applications should be secure, fault-tolerant and resilient to attacks.   Trust: Data should not be altered and they should be truthful. False or modiﬁed data could lead to potential problems such as crashes, bottlenecks, and other traf- ﬁc safety problems. For this reason, trusted information must be provided in all VANET communications.  5.7 Challenges and Opportunities  Emerging technologies applied to vehicular networks face several challenges. The development of ITS brings new challenges to vehicle driving, controlling and mon- itoring. In this context, the vehicular network’s vision is focused on four funda- mental principles: sustainability, integration, safety, and responsiveness as shown in Fig. 5.10 [21].  Vehicular networks will play a major role in promoting and ensuring the sus- tainability of transport infrastructures. Emerging technologies can facilitate the ef- ﬁcient use of existing transportation infrastructures, regulate and control demand, encourage and facilitate the use of alternative communication modes, and manage congestion and its effects.  Management tools such as electronic tolling, traveler information, and intelligent trafﬁc lights are all based on ITS, and constitute the core of demand management solutions that support transport infrastructure sustainability. Moreover, through a more efﬁcient management of trafﬁc on existing roads, VANET facilities can delay or deny the need of new infrastructures adding to the sustainability of all transporta- tion infrastructures.  However, the current challenge is not the use of VANET and emerging technolo- gies, but developing mechanisms and protocols that allow a complete integration of the different technologies to provide a seamless mechanism to disseminate and access accurate information, facilitating the management of transportation systems and addressing the transportation issues such as trafﬁc congestion and vehicular ac- cidents. In this context, the typical ITS based on discrete and self-contained systems need to evolve towards systems that are based on heterogeneous technologies.  One of the main challenges of VANET and ITS is the compatibility and porta- bility of systems. For example, a collision avoidance system is of limited use if ve- hicles cannot successfully communicate because of interoperability issues between communication protocols and network devices. Standards are clearly necessary to achieve these objectives.  In the last few years, signiﬁcant efforts have focused on developing interna- tional standards in speciﬁc areas such as architectural design; database technol- ogy, automatic vehicle and equipment identiﬁcation, fee and toll collection, gen- eral ﬂeet management and commercial-freight, public transport-emergency; inte- grated transport Information, management and Control, traveler information sys-   66  J.A. Guerrero-Ibáñez et al.  Fig. 5.10 Principles and objectives of emerging technologies in the transportation  tems; route guidance and navigation systems, vehicle-roadway warning and con- trol systems, DSRC, and wide area communications—protocols and interfaces [33]. The International Organization for Standardization  ISO  has been developing ITS standards since 1994 [30], and the European Committee for Standardization  ECS  since 1991 [7]. The main focus of new developments is the integration of emerging technologies and their generic communications standards such as 2G, 3G, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and WiMAX in order to create the new generation of standards that allow vehicle-vehicle  V2V  vehicle-infrastructure  V2I  systems to operate within a het- erogeneous communication environment by integrating most of the major vehicle manufacturers, transport management system providers and operators, and highway infrastructure operators.  In this context, ISO has been developing a new communication framework, known as the Communications Access for Land Mobiles  CALM  initiative. CALM is the ISO approved framework for heterogeneous packet-switched communication in mobile environments. CALM focuses on providing a layered solution that en- ables continuous or quasi-continuous communications between vehicles and the in- frastructure, or between vehicles, using wireless communications that are available in any particular location, and has the ability to migrate to different available media when needed [9].  The ISO TC204 Work Group 16 is developing a family of International Stan- dards based on the CALM concept. This family of standards speciﬁes a common   5 VANETs: Architecture, Protocols and Applications  67  architecture, network protocols and communication interface deﬁnitions for wired and wireless communications using various access technologies including cellular 2G, 3G, satellite, infra-red, 5 GHz microwave, 60 GHz millimeter-wave, and mobile wireless broadband. These and other access technologies that can be incorporated are designed to provide broadcast, unicast, and multicast communications between mobile stations, between mobile and ﬁxed stations, and between ﬁxed stations in the ITS sector [11].  ISO 21217 describes the common architectural framework around which CALM- compliant communication entities  called ITS stations  are instantiated, and provide the architectural reference for use by the CALM family of International Standards including the lower layer service access point speciﬁcations described in the net- work protocol speciﬁcations  IPv6 networking and non-IP networking , and the ITS station management speciﬁcations.  5.8 Conclusion  One of the major priorities for many governments around the world is to deﬁne mechanisms and schemes that could help solve trafﬁc problems that modern soci- ety faces. Recent technological advances have led to the development and usage of integrated intelligent systems. We have presented how the different emerging technologies could be applied to transportation systems in order to solve the traf- ﬁc problems that modern society is facing. In the last few years a suite of systems and applications for vehicular communications has emerged. This suite includes applications that can be utilized for improving vehicular safety, enhancing trafﬁc control, improving driver efﬁciency, and making it more comfortable for passengers inside vehicles. In addition, many of the emerging technologies are also enabling the development of transportation systems that are capable of optimizing fuel con- sumption, minimizing trafﬁc congestion, reducing carbon dioxide emissions, and, more importantly, reducing human casualties.  In addition, there are several private and public initiatives that have been launched that are dedicated to the development and research of vehicular systems. The in- herent characteristics of VANETs in terms of, for example, its dynamic network topology, mobility patterns, low latency, among others, development and make the deployment of vehicular applications still a challenge. In this chapter we have iden- tiﬁed some of the challenges that vehicular networks face and need to be addressed. The successful development of VANET technologies and applications depends on VANET standards that enable the integration of heterogeneous systems. We need to continue to promote users’ acceptability and accessibility to vehicular applica- tions and technologies. Finally, to guarantee the privacy and security of VANET users, novel secure architectures and protocols still need to be developed in the fu- ture.

Chapter 6 Broadband Wireless Technologies  Farhan Siddiqui, Sherali Zeadally, and Scott Fowler  6.1 Introduction  Broadband Internet service provides high speed Internet access to end-users. The latest development in broadband Internet is its connectivity to a wide range of wire- less networking technologies. Wireless broadband is a high-speed Internet access via some wireless access technology. The versatility of wireless Internet, and its po- tential for increasing the productivity of users, has consumers requesting the service at an increasing rate. At present, people are requesting wireless Internet access not only in their ofﬁces and homes, but also at their local cafes and restaurants. This popularity is pushing the fast development of wireless broadband Internet services. Locations that provide wireless broadband Internet access are known as hotspots. The service is mostly utilized by mobile devices such as laptops and handhelds with wireless capabilities and an active subscription to the broadband service.  Emerging broadband wireless technologies  Fig. 6.1  include Worldwide In- teroperability for Microwave Access  WiMAX IEEE 802.16 , Long Term Evolu- tion  LTE , Long Term Evolution-Advanced  LTE-A , High Speed Packet Access  HSPA , HSPA+, Cloud Radio Access Networks  C-RAN , etc. WiMAX, LTE, and LTE-A are all intended to offer ubiquitous broadband at multiple megabits per sec- ond. Carriers across the US and around the world are competing to build the next  F.

Fig. 6.1 Evolution of broadband wireless technologies  generation of data networks to meet the ever increasing demand of high-speed In- ternet connections.  6.1.1 Motivation for LTE LTE-A  Cellular LTE is the next step forward in cellular 3G services. The LTE technol- ogy is based on a Third Generation Partnership Project  3GPP  standard that pro- vides for a downlink speed of up to 320 Mbps with multiple antennas. LTE-A is a major enhancement of the LTE standard by the 3GPP. LTE-A was ratiﬁed as an IMT-Advanced 4G  Fourth Generation  technology to address the challenges asso- ciated with the increasing use of devices that require signiﬁcantly higher spectral resources than conventional cell phones. LTE-A targets peak data rates up to 1 Gbps with up to 100 MHz supported spectrum bandwidth. It uses a high-order Multiple- Input Multiple-Output  MIMO  transmission with up to eight spatial layers on the downlink and four spatial layers on the uplink.   6 Broadband Wireless Technologies  73  Table 6.1 Beneﬁts of LTE technologies and WiMAX  Beneﬁts of LTE and LTE-A  Beneﬁts of WiMAX  High data rates Enhanced mobility Low latency Multiple user support Enhanced security Lower power requirement Lower deployment cost Greater spectral efﬁciency Flexibility of services  Broad coverage area Non-Line-of-Sight  NLOS  service Interoperability Improved Quality of Service  QoS  Lower Consumer Premises Equipment  CPE  cost Lower installation costs Expansion of revenue Beneﬁts to community Support for a wide variety of applications  For consumers, LTE and LTE-A offer better, faster, pocket-sized multimedia ser- vices. High-speed data over cellular networks will enable a rich suite of mobile multimedia services. Cell phones and handheld devices are the new media centers, with access to music, photos, games, video and several connectivity options. LTE-A provides several technical enhancements to LTE, with improved market for services such as voice-over-IP  VoIP  and video. High downlink rates are important for two- way bandwidth-intensive communications such as video-conferencing.  For network operators, LTE offers ﬂexibility, efﬁciency and cost savings. The LTE technology provides a scalable bandwidth, from 1.25 MHz to 20 MHz, and up to 100 MHz  in the case of LTE-A . This bandwidth will suit the needs of different network operators that have different bandwidth allocations, and also allow opera- tors to provide different services based on spectrum. This provides a ﬂexibility that is not available in other existing cellular networks. Since LTE is a 3GPP standard, an upgrade path is laid out for operators who already use Wideband Code Division Multiple Access  WCDMA  networks. It is already the case that some network op- erators can upgrade to the High Speed Download Packet Access  HSDPA  standard with little capital expense. As new LTE systems are deployed, carriers will reuse the exact same sites of today’s base stations. Real estate for base stations is difﬁcult and expensive to obtain and carriers need to maintain their existing coverage patterns. In the case of LTE, standards-based upgrades allow carriers to keep their existing cell tower sites. 3G networks are more spectrally efﬁcient than 2G, and LTE is expected to increase that efﬁciency. With greater spectral efﬁciency, operators can serve more standard voice customers and also provide more data and services in a given band- width. That efﬁciency could also help carriers improve their Average Revenue Per Unit  ARPU , helping to offset the cost of new LTE-capable devices and network upgrades. LTE spectral efﬁciency is expected to be between three and four times that of HSDPA.   74  F. Siddiqui et al.  6.1.2 Motivation for WiMAX  WiMAX is an adopted global standard for low-cost, high performance wireless broadband networks. One of the main goals of WiMAX is to make high quality, long-range data and voice communications affordable. This Next Generation tech- nology platform offers several improvements in the operation of wireless broadband access networks. WiMAX technology offers advantages for both customers and net- work operators alike. The beneﬁts [8] of deploying WiMAX networks are discussed below.  WiMAX provides a broad coverage area and can cost-effectively connect a large number of customers to the network. With a lower investment in infrastructure, WiMAX has enabled the possibility of serving rural as well as economically de- pressed areas in cities with lower broadband adoption rates. The Mobile WiMAX standard [24] features a 256 carrier Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing  OFDM  technology which signiﬁcantly enhances the Non-Line-of-Sight  NLOS  capabilities of the radio. This allows the operator to support more customers per cell site due to better signal penetration. The WiMAX technology represents a shift in strategy for designing and operating wireless broadband data networks. WiMAX compliant devices from different device manufacturers will be able to operate on the same network. The improved Quality of Service built into the WiMAX technology platform enables carriers to offer advanced and media-rich features and services, such as gaming or multicast video. The cost of WiMAX modems and compliant devices continues to decrease as multiple equipment vendors compete with one an- other in introducing their products.  The installation of WiMAX is a simple process. Mobile and ﬁxed WiMAX Customer-Premises Equipments, CPEs, are “plug and play” modems that can eas- ily be hooked up by a novice user. Technician installation, such as that required by satellite television systems, can cost hundreds of dollars, some of which may have to be assumed by the operator, or integrated in monthly subscription fees. The use of smart antenna systems facilitates the introduction of user-friendly WiMAX com- pliant laptops and devices, such as Personal Digital Assistants, PDAs. The result of the savings in installation costs is an increased return on investment for the wireless operator, which could determine the difference between success and failure of a new broadband access business.  The launch of WiMAX has enabled an increased number of applications for consumers and businesses because of its Quality of Service, range of service, and throughput improvements. Applications include the delivery of data, Voice over In- ternet Protocol  VoIP  and video streaming. Services can be delivered via a ﬁxed connection to the customer premise or via a portable modem device.  The prominent features of WiMAX include its Quality of Service support, in- creased bandwidth capacity, greater coverage area, reduced costs of installation and operation and inexpensive CPE for users. Mobile WiMAX is an innovative technol- ogy that can be rapidly deployed at low cost especially in economically disadvan- taged areas. It can provide various beneﬁts in many communities such as schools, health care units, government agencies, etc. [8].   6 Broadband Wireless Technologies  75  6.2 Background  6.2.1 Overview of WiMAX  WiMAX is a MAC and physical layer wireless communication technology. WiMAX was designed to provide outdoor broadband wireless access at a municipal, state- wide, or regional level. The standards that deﬁne WiMAX are developed and main- tained by the IEEE 802.16 Working Group [802.16, WG]. A consortium of WiMAX vendors and providers, referred to as the WiMAX Forum [27], serves to promote the technology by specifying common operating modes and offering test certiﬁcation services to promote interoperability.  WiMAX is designed to operate in radio frequencies ranging from hundreds of megahertz to 66 GHz. To operate over a wide range of environments and to meet requirements of broadband applications, WiMAX is a versatile and justiﬁably com- plex protocol. The WiMAX Forum addresses this complexity by identifying work- ing proﬁles that deﬁne operating modes and conﬁguration settings allowing equip- ment set to the same proﬁle to interoperate. Operating modes and conﬁguration options that are speciﬁed by a proﬁle include Point-to-Multipoint  PMP  or mesh operating modes, operational parameters such as center frequency range, channel bandwidth, channel frequency step size, duplexing mode 802.16d  ﬁxed, portable  or 802.16e  mobile  operation [17].  6.2.2 WiMAX Standards  Several speciﬁcations for WiMAX have been standardized by the IEEE 802.16 working group. In 2001, the ﬁrst IEEE 802.16 standard was published, which aimed to support the communications in the 10–66 GHz frequency band. Two years later, IEEE 802.16a was introduced to provide additional physical layer speciﬁcations for the 2–11 GHz frequency band. These two standards were revised further in 2004  IEEE 802.16-2004 IEEE 802.16REVd . In 2005, IEEE 802.16e was approved as the ofﬁcial standard for mobile applications. In addition to the IEEE 802.16 working group, companies in the industry have also formed the WiMAX forum to promote the development and deployment of WiMAX systems. Table 6.2 highlights the main differences between IEEE 802.16-2004 and IEEE 802.16e-2005. According to the IEEE 802.16 standards, WiMAX can support up to a 75-Mbps data rate  single channel  and covers a range of up to 30 miles. Despite many salient features, from a technical perspective, the success of WiMAX also depends on how it can provide cost-effective solutions for a variety of services [16].  6.2.3 Mobile WiMAX  The objective of the Mobile WiMAX standard is bridge the “gap” between the WLANs  which provide very high data rate but short-range coverage  and the 3G   76  F. Siddiqui et al.  Table 6.2 A Comparison of WiMAX standards  Access type Duplexing Modulation Handoffs Subscriber units  Preferred frequency bands  Applications  IEEE 802.16-2004  IEEE 802.16e-2005  Fixed TDD, FDD OFDM No High performance outdoor and indoor customer premises equipment  CPE  2.5 GHz, 3.4–3.6 GHz, 5.8 GHz  Indoor broadband access for residential users  High Speed Internet, VoIP, etc.   Fixed, portable, and mobile TDD, FDD optional OFDMA Yes Low cost consumer electronics CPE and embedded modules  2.3–2.4 GHz, 2.5–2.7 GHz, 3.3–3.4 GHz, 3.4–3.8 GHz “Portable” broadband access for consumers  cellular systems  which provide highly mobile long-range coverage but at low data rates  by providing a speciﬁcation that supports a mobile broadband access system  including functions to enable handoff between base stations  BSs  or sectors . Fur- thermore, the goal is to signiﬁcantly reduce the cost of the WiMAX infrastructure per unit data rate by signiﬁcantly increasing the system capacity compared to the current 3G standard systems.  The Mobile WiMAX air interface speciﬁcations are based on the IEEE 802.16- 2004 Air Interface standard and the IEEE 802.16e amendment, ratiﬁed in late 2004 and 2005, respectively. Although conﬁned only to the physical  PHY  and Medium Access Control  MAC  layer speciﬁcations, these standards are very extensive. The Mobile WiMAX standard has targeted application areas for WiMAX systems such as Voice over Internet Protocol  VoIP , video conferencing, streaming media, mul- tiplayer interactive gaming, Web browsing, instant messaging, and media content downloading. These applications consume signiﬁcant bandwidth and, in some cases, require short end-to-end latency [24].  6.2.4 Physical and Medium Access Control Speciﬁcations  The speciﬁcations in the current WiMAX standards can be partitioned into two important parts: the physical  PHY  layer and the MAC layer. According to the standards, IEEE 802.16 supports four PHY speciﬁcations for the licensed bands: Wireless MAN-SC  Single Carrier, 10–66 GHz , Wireless MAN-SCa  Single Car- rier, below 11 GHz , Wireless MAN-OFDM  orthogonal frequency division multi- plexing, below 11 GHz , and Wireless MAN-OFDMA  orthogonal frequency divi- sion multiple access, below 11 GHz . In addition, IEEE 802.16 also supports three different PHY speciﬁcations  i.e., SCa, OFDM, and OFDMA  for the unlicensed bands—wireless High-speed unlicensed MAN  wireless HUMAN . Most PHYs   6 Broadband Wireless Technologies  77  Fig. 6.2 WiMAX point-to-multipoint network  are designed for Non-Line-of-Sight  NLOS  operation in frequency bands below 11 GHz, except SC, which is for operation in the 10–66 GHz frequency band. To support bidirectional communications, IEEE 802.16 supports both Time Division Duplex  TDD  and Frequency Division Duplex  FDD  operations. Based on the MAC speciﬁcations, there exist two types of WiMAX network [16]:   PMP Network: The PMP network  Fig. 6.2  is designed primarily for providing the last-mile access to the Internet Service Providers  ISPs . In the PMP architec- ture, nodes are organized into a cellular-like structure consisting of a Base Station  BS  and Subscriber Stations  SSs . The channels are divided into uplink  from SS to BS  and downlink  from BS to SS , and both uplink and downlink chan- nels are shared among the SSs. The PMP mode requires all SSs to be within the transmission range and clear Line-Of-Sight  LOS  of the BS.  6.2.5 WiMAX Network Architecture   Mesh Network: The WiMAX mesh network  Fig. 6.3  is a multi-hop ad-hoc net- work in which subscriber stations can connect with one another directly. The con- cept of MS is speciﬁed in IEEE 802.16e, which extends the PMP mode and de- ﬁnes a concept of Mobile Multi-hop Relay  MMR  networking. In such a way, the network may expand the coverage area and enhance throughput through multi- hop paths. In the mesh mode, an ad-hoc network can be formed with all nodes acting as relaying routers in addition to their sender and receiver roles, although nodes still can serve as BSs to provide backhaul connectivity.  6.3 Overview of LTE  The LTE as deﬁned by the 3GPP is a highly ﬂexible new air interface for the evolu- tion of Universal Mobile Telecommunications System  UMTS . The ﬁrst release of   78  F. Siddiqui et al.  Fig. 6.3 WiMAX mesh network  LTE provides peak rates of 300 Mbps, a radio-network delay of less than 5 millisec- onds, a signiﬁcant increase in spectrum efﬁciency compared to previous cellular systems, and a new ﬂat radio-network architecture designed to simplify operation and to reduce cost. LTE supports both Frequency Division Duplex  FDD  and Time Division Duplex  TDD , as well as a wide range of system bandwidths in order to operate in a large number of different spectrum allocations. Furthermore, LTE also aims for a smooth evolution from earlier 3GPP systems such as Time Division Synchronous Code Division Multiple Access  TDSCDMA  and Wideband Code Division Multiple Access High-Speed Packet Access  WCDMA HSPA , as well as 3GPP2 systems such as Code Division Multiple Access  CDMA  2000. Finally, LTE also constitutes a major step toward International Mobile Telephony  IMT - Advanced [7].  LTE is based on OFDM rather than CDMA technology. It is similar in concept to Mobile WiMAX, although the LTE systems operate with different frame structures, subcarrier spacings, and physical layer procedure and system bandwidths. The LTE air interface consists of physical signals and physical channels, which are deﬁned in 3GPP TS 36.211 [3]. The main downlink physical channels are the Physical Broad- cast Channel  PBCH , Physical Downlink Control Channel  PDCCH , and Physical Downlink Shared Channel  PDSCH . The main downlink physical signals are the Reference Signal  RS , and the Primary and Secondary Synchronization Signals  P- SCH, S-SCH . The main uplink physical channels are the Physical Uplink Control Channel  PUCCH  and the Physical Uplink Shared Channel  PUSCH . The main uplink physical signals are the Demodulation Reference Signal  RS  and the Phys- ical Random Access Channel  PRACH . Physical signals are generated in Layer 1 and used for system synchronization, cell identiﬁcation and radio channel estima- tion. Physical channels carry data from higher layers including control, scheduling and user payload. For the downlink, primary and secondary synchronization signals   6 Broadband Wireless Technologies  79  encode the cell identiﬁcation, allowing the MS to identify and synchronize with the network. For both the downlink and the uplink there are Reference Signals  RSs , known as pilot signals in other standards, which are used by the receiver to estimate the amplitude and phase ﬂatness of the received signal. The ﬂatness is a combination of errors in the transmitted signal and additional imperfections caused by the radio channel. Without the use of the RS, phase and amplitude shifts in the received signal would make demodulation unreliable, particularly at high modulation depths such as 16 Quadrature Amplitude Modulation  QAM  or 64QAM. In these high modu- lation cases, even a small error in the received signal amplitude or phase can cause demodulation errors. Alongside the physical signals are physical channels, which carry the user and system information. The channel structure of LTE is closer to HSPA than it is to the original W-CDMA, which is based on channels dedicated to single users.  There are two radio frame structures for LTE: Frame Structure type 1  FS1  for full duplex and half duplex FDD, and frame structure type 2  FS2  for TDD. FS1 is optimized to co-exist with 3.84 Mbps UMTS systems. This structure consists of ten 1 millisecond sub-frames, each composed of two 0.5 millisecond slots, for a to- tal duration of 10 milliseconds. The FS1 is the same in the uplink and downlink in terms of frame, sub-frame, and slot duration although the allocation of the physical signals and channels is quite different. Uplink and downlink transmissions are sepa- rated in the frequency domain. The smallest time-frequency unit used for downlink transmission is called a resource element, deﬁned as one symbol on one subcarrier.  6.3.1 LTE Network Architecture  The various components that constitute a LTE network architecture  shown in Fig. 6.4  are as follows:  User Equipment  UE  Mobile Station  MS  The UE MS is a device used by the end user for communicating over the network. Typically, the UE is a handheld de- vice such as a smart phone or a data card which is embedded into a device such as a laptop, etc. The UE also contains the Universal Subscriber Identity Module  USIM  that is a separate module from the rest of the UE, which is often called the Terminal Equipment  TE . USIM is used to identify and authenticate the user and to derive security keys for protecting the radio interface transmission. Functionally, the UE offers a user interface to the user and is a platform for a communication application, which signals the network to set up, maintains and removes the communication links the end user needs.  E-UTRAN Node B  eNodeB  the only node in the Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access  eUTRAN  is the eUTRAN Node-B  eNodeB . It is a radio BS that is in control of all radio related functions in the ﬁxed part of the system. Typically, the eNodeBs are distributed throughout the networks coverage area, each residing   80  F. Siddiqui et al.  Fig. 6.4 LTE network architecture  near the actual radio antennas. It is worth noting that most of the typical protocols implemented in today’s Radio Network Controller  RNC  are moved to the eNodeB. The eNodeB is also responsible for header compression, ciphering and the reliable delivery of packets. On the control plane, functions such as admission control and radio resource management are also incorporated into the eNodeB. Beneﬁts of the RNC and Node-B merger include reduced latency with fewer hops in the media path, and distribution of the RNC processing load.  Mobility Management Entity  MME  The Mobility Management Entity  MME  is a signaling-only entity, thus user’s IP packets do not go through the MME. Its main function is to manage the user’s mobility. In addition, the MME also performs authentication and authorization, idle-mode user tracking, security negotiations; and Network-Architecture Speciﬁc  NAS  signaling. An advantage of a separate network element for signaling is that operators can increase signaling and trafﬁc capacity independently.  Serving Gateway  S-GW  In the basic system architecture conﬁguration, the high level function of S-GW is tunnel management. The S-GW is part of the net- work infrastructure maintained centrally on operation premises. The S-GW has a very minor role in control functions. It is only responsible for its own resources, and it allocates them based on requests from other network entities, such as the MME, PDN-GW, or Policy Control and charging Rules Function  PCRF  which in turn   6 Broadband Wireless Technologies  81  are acting on the need to set up, modify or clear bearers for the UE. If the request was received from the PDN-GW or PCRF, the S-GW relays the command on to the MME so that it can control the tunnel to eNodeB. Similarly, when the MME initiated the request, the S-GW will signal on to either the PDN-GW or the PCRF. During mobility between eNodeBs, the S-GW acts as the local mobility anchor. The MME commands the S-GW to switch the tunnel from one eNodeB to another. The MME may also request the S-GW to provide tunneling resources for data forward- ing, when there is a need to forward data from source eNodeB to target eNodeB during the time UE makes the radio handover. The mobility scenarios also include changing from one S-GW to another, and the MME controls this change accord- ingly, by removing tunnels in the old S-GW and setting them up in a new S-GW. For all data ﬂows belonging to a UE in connected mode, the S-GW relays the data between eNodeB and PDN-GW. However, when a UE is in idle mode, the resources in eNodeB are released, and the data path terminates in the S-GW. If S-GW receives data packets from PDN-GW on any such tunnel, it will buffer the packets, and re- quest the MME to initiate paging of the UE. Paging will cause the UE to re-connect, and when the tunnels are re-connected, the buffered packets will be forwarded to the UE. The S-GW monitors data in the tunnels, and may also collect data needed for accounting and user charging.  PDN Gateway  PDN-GW  Packet Data Network Gateway  PDN-GW  is the edge router between the EPS and external packet data networks. It is the highest level mobility anchor in the system, and usually it acts as the IP point of attachment for the UE. It performs trafﬁc gating and ﬁltering functions as required by the ser- vice in question. Similarly to the S-GW, the PDN-GWs are maintained in operator premises in a centralized location. Typically the PDN-GW allocates the IP address to the UE which uses it to communicate with other IP hosts in external networks  e.g. the Internet . It is also possible that the external PDN to which the UE is con- nected allocates the address that is to be used by the UE, and the PDN-GW tunnels all trafﬁc to that network. The IP address is always allocated when the UE requests a PDN connection, which happens at least when the UE attaches to the network, and it may happen subsequently when a new PDN connectivity is needed. The PDN-GW performs the required Dynamic Host Conﬁguration Protocol  DHCP  functionality, or queries an external DHCP server, and delivers the address to the UE.  The PDN-GW performs gating and ﬁltering functions as required by the policies set for the UE and the service in question, and it collects and reports the related charging information. The User Plane trafﬁc between the PDN-GW and external networks is in the form of IP packets that belong to various IP service ﬂows. If the interface toward the S-GW is based on tunneling, the PDN-GW performs the map- ping between the IP data ﬂows to tunnels which represent the bearers. The PDN-GW sets up bearers based on request, either through the PCRF or from the S-GW, which relays information from the MME. In the latter case, the PDN-GW may also need to interact with the PCRF to receive the appropriate policy control information if that is not conﬁgured in the PDN-GW locally. The PDN-GW also has functionality for monitoring the data ﬂow for accounting purposes. PDN-GW is the highest level   82  F. Siddiqui et al.  mobility anchor in the system. When a UE moves from one S-GW to another, the bearers have to be switched in the PDN-GW. The PDN-GW will receive an indica- tion to switch the ﬂows from the new S-GW. Each PDN-GW may be connected to one or more PCRF, SGW and the external network. For a given UE that is associated with the PDN-GW, there is only one S-GW, but connections to many external net- works and, respectively, to many PCRFs may need to be supported if connectivity to multiple PDNs is supported through one PDN-GW [13].  6.3.2 LTE-Advanced  The LTE-Advanced standard primarily lays down performance enhancements to LTE in addition to being backward compatible with it. LTE-Advanced system is designed to have a peak data rate of 1 Gbps in downlink and up to 500 Mbps in the uplink [15]. The characteristic features of the LTE-Advanced radio interface are discussed below [5].  6.3.2.1 Carrier Aggregation  ITU has allowed the creation of wider bandwidths through the aggregation of con- tiguous and non-contiguous component carriers. Thus spectrum from one band can be added to spectrum from another band in a UE that supports multiple transceivers. For example we can implement contiguous aggregation of two 20 MHz channels that are located side by side. In this case the aggregated bandwidth covers the 40 MHz minimum requirement and could be supported with a single transceiver. However, if the channels in this example were non-contiguous—that is, not adja- cent, or located in different frequency bands—then multiple transceivers in the UE would be required. To meet ITU 4G requirements, LTE-Advanced supports three component carrier aggregation scenarios: intra-band contiguous, intra-band non- contiguous and inter-band non-contiguous aggregation. The spacing between cen- ter frequencies of contiguously aggregated component carriers will be a multiple of 300 kHz to be compatible with the 100 kHz frequency of Release 8 9 and at the same time preserve orthogonality of the subcarriers which have 15 kHz spacing. De- pending on the aggregation scenario, the n × 300 kHz spacing can be facilitated by inserting a small number of unused subcarriers between contiguous component car- riers. In the case of contiguous aggregation, more use of the gap between component carriers could be made, but this would require deﬁning new, slightly wider compo- nent carriers. An LTE-Advanced UE with capabilities for receive and or transmit carrier aggregation will be able to simultaneously receive and or transmit on multi- ple component carriers.   6 Broadband Wireless Technologies  83  6.3.2.2 Enhanced Uplink Multiple Access  LTE-Advanced enhances the uplink multiple access scheme by adopting clustered SC-FDMA, also known as Discrete Fourier Transform Spread OFDM  DFT-S- OFDM . This scheme is similar to SC-FDMA but has the advantage that it allows non-contiguous  clustered  groups of subcarriers to be allocated for transmission by a single UE, thus enabling uplink frequency-selective scheduling and better link per- formance. Clustered SC-FDMA helps satisfy the requirement for increased uplink spectral efﬁciency while maintaining backward-compatibility with LTE.  6.3.2.3 Enhanced Multiple Antenna Transmission  To improve single user peak data rates and to meet the ITU-R requirement for spec- trum efﬁciency, LTE-Advanced speciﬁes up to eight layers in the downlink. These downlink layers, with the requisite eight receivers in the UE, allow the possibility in the downlink of 8 × 8 spatial multiplexing. The UE will be speciﬁed to support up to four transmitters allowing the possibility of up to 4 × 4 transmissions in the uplink when combined with four eNode-B receivers.  6.3.2.4 LTE-Advanced: Further Enhancements  Further enhancements to LTE-Advanced include the Coordinated Multi-Point trans- mission reception  CoMP , relaying, support for heterogeneous networks, and LTE Self-Optimizing Network  SON  enhancements [1].  Coordinated Multi-Point transmission reception  CoMP  is considered by 3GPP as a tool to improve coverage, cell-edge throughput, and or system efﬁciency. The main idea of CoMP is as follows: when a UE is in the cell-edge region, it may be able to receive signals from multiple cell sites and the UE’s transmission may be received at multiple cell sites regardless of the system load. Given that, if the signal- ing transmitted from the multiple cell sites is coordinated, the downlink performance can be increased signiﬁcantly. This coordination can be simple as in the techniques that focus on interference avoidance or more complex as in the case where the same data is transmitted from multiple cell sites. For the uplink, since the signal can be received by multiple cell sites, if the scheduling is coordinated from the different cell sites, the system can take advantage of this multiple reception to signiﬁcantly improve the link performance.  In terms of downlink CoMP, two different approaches are used: Coordinated scheduling or Coordinated Beamforming  CBF , and Joint Processing Joint Trans- mission  JP JT . In the CS CBF category, the transmission to a single UE is from the serving cell, exactly as in the case of non-CoMP transmission. However, the scheduling, including any Beamforming functionality, is dynamically coordinated among the cells in order to control and or reduce the interference between differ- ent transmissions. In principle, the best serving set of users will be selected so that   84  F. Siddiqui et al.  the transmitter beams are constructed to reduce the interference to other neighbor- ing users, while increasing the served user’s signal strength. CoMP techniques are applicable for both homogeneous and heterogeneous networks. For Joint Process- ing Joint Transmission, the transmission to a single UE is simultaneously transmit- ted from multiple transmission points, across cell sites. The multipoint transmis- sions are coordinated as a single transmitter with antennas that are geographically separated.  6.3.2.5 Relaying  The concept of Relay Node  RN  has been introduced in LTE Release-10 to en- able trafﬁc signaling forwarding between eNode-B  eNB  and UE to improve the coverage of high data rates, cell edge coverage and to extend coverage to heavily shadowed areas in the cell or areas beyond the cell range. The relay nodes are wire- lessly connected to the radio access network via another cell called the donor cell. The RN is connected to the donor eNB via the Un interface and the UEs are con- nected to the RN via the Uu interface. The Un connections can be either in-band or out-band. For an in-band connection, the eNB-to-relay link shares the same band with the direct eNB-to-UE link within the donor cell. In this case, Release-8 UEs should have the ability to connect to the donor cell. For an out-band connection, the eNB-to-relay connection is in a different band than the direct eNB-to-UE link.  6.3.2.6 LTE Self-Optimizing Network  SON  Enhancements  SON technologies have been introduced in Release-8 Release-9 to help decrease the Capital Expenditure  CAPEX  and Operating Expense  OPEX  of the system. The initial SON features in Release-8 and Release-9 assist operators in deploying LTE networks with clusters of eNBs in existing 2G, 3G legacy networks to meet the initial coverage requirements. As LTE networks expand towards more ubiqui- tous coverage, operator focus will shift towards network growth and optimize the capacity and coverage in a heterogeneous environment with 2G and 3G Radio Ac- cess Technologies  RATs , and with multiple carriers per RAT. Features are being standardized in 3GPP Rel-10 that offer additional opportunities to further optimize the performance of heterogeneous networks and further reduce OPEX.  Table 6.3 presents a comparison of the main features of WiMAX, LTE, and LTE-  Advanced.  6.4 High Speed Packet Access  HSPA   High Speed Packet Access  HSPA  commonly referred to as 3.5G cellular standard, was conceived as a natural evolution of the existing Wideband CDMA  WCDMA,   6 Broadband Wireless Technologies  85  Table 6.3 Features of WiMAX, LTE, and LTE-advanced  WiMAX  LTE  LTE-advanced  1.25–10 MHz  IP-based  Access technology OFDMA Channel bandwidth Network architecture Cell capacity Maximum data rate Deployment  OFDMA and SC-FDMA OFDMA and SC-FDMA 1.25–20 MHz  40–100 MHz  IP-based  IP-based  Up to 200 users Downlink: up to 75 Mbps Uplink: 25 Mbps Since 2008  Exceeds 400 users Downlink: 100 Mbps Uplink: 50 Mbps Started in 2011  3 times higher than LTE Downlink: 1 Gbps Uplink: 500 Mbps Expected in 2013  known as 3G . HSPA is a combination of High Speed Downlink Packet Access  HSDPA  and High Speed Uplink Packet Access  HSUPA . It has emerged as one of the most dominant beyond-3G technologies and has been serving many regions and countries to support broadband applications. HSPA offers data rates up to 14.4 Mbps in downlink and 5.76 Mbps in uplink for stationary users. Therefore, stationary users can easily access broadband applications in most areas with good signal qual- ity through HSPA. HSPA networks are in operation in many regions and countries around the world. HSPA is deployed over the WCDMA network so that it shares all the network elements in the core network and in the radio network. The upgrade from WCDMA to HSPA only requires new software packages and additional hard- ware components in the base station to support a higher data rate and capacity [23]. “HSPA+” refers to the new additional HSPA capabilities introduced in 3GPP Release 7 and thereafter. The main features of Release 7 are 64QAM and MIMO— with both relying on the use of the “Enhanced Layer 2” feature [9].  6.5 QoS Support in WiMAX and LTE Networks  WiMAX and LTE have been designed with different Quality of Service  QoS  frameworks to enable the support of emerging Internet applications. In the following sections, we discuss and compare mainly the air interface QoS features of WiMAX and LTE networks [6].  6.5.1 QoS over LTE Networks  The QoS level of granularity in the LTE Evolved Packet System  EPS  is the bearer  as shown in Fig. 6.5 , which is a packet ﬂow established between the Packet Data Network Gateway  PDN-GW  and the User Terminal  UE or MS . The trafﬁc run- ning between a particular client application and the PDN-GW can be differentiated into separate Service Data Flows  SDFs . SDFs mapped to the same bearer receive   86  F. Siddiqui et al.  Fig. 6.5 QoS bearers in LTE networks  the same QoS. A bearer is assigned a scalar value referred to as a QoS Class Iden- tiﬁer  QCI , which speciﬁes the class to which the bearer belongs. QCI refers to a set of packet forwarding treatments  e.g., scheduling weights, admission thresholds, queue management thresholds, and link layer protocol conﬁguration  preconﬁgured by the operator for each network element. The bearer management and control in LTE follows the network-initiated QoS control paradigm, and the network initiated establishment, modiﬁcation, and deletion of the bearers.  LTE supports Guaranteed Bit Rate  GBR  and non-Guaranteed Bit Rate  non- GBR  bearers. Dedicated network resources related to a GBR value associated with the bearer are permanently allocated when a bearer becomes established or modi- ﬁed. A non-GBR bearer is referred to as the default bearer, which is also used to establish IP connectivity. Any additional bearers are referred to as dedicated bearers and can be GBR or non-GBR. In LTE, the mapping of SDFs to a dedicated bearer is classiﬁed by IP ﬁve-tuple-based packet ﬁlter either provisioned in the Policy Control and charging Rules Function  PCRF  or deﬁned by the application layer signaling. However, the default bearer typically uses a match all packet ﬁlter; any SDF that does not match any of the existing dedicated bearer packet ﬁlters is mapped onto the default bearer.  LTE speciﬁes several standardized QCI values with standardized characteristics, which are preconﬁgured for the network elements. This ensures multivendor de- ployments and roaming. The set of standardized QCIs and their characteristics is presented in Table 6.4. The QCI table [2] speciﬁes values for the priority handling, acceptable delay budget and types of service for each QCI value.  The LTE air interface scheduler is responsible for dynamically allocating down- link and uplink air interface resources among the bearers while maintaining their desired QoS level in both downlink and uplink directions. To make a scheduling decision, the LTE air interface scheduler uses the following information as input:   Radio conditions at the UE measured at the eNB and or reported by the UE.   The state of different bearers, such as uplink Buffer Status Reports  BSR  that are required to provide support for QoS-aware packet scheduling.

The LTE scheduler can try to control inter-cell interference on a slow basis. This improves the QoE associated with the MSs at the cell’s edge.   6 Broadband Wireless Technologies  87  Table 6.4 QCI values and their associated parameters  QCI  Resource Type  Priority  Example of services  Packet delay budget  ms   1 2  3  4 5 6  7 8  9  GBR GBR  GBR  GBR Non-GBR Non-GBR  Non-GBR Non-GBR  Non-GBR  2 4  5  3 1 7  6 8  9  100 150  300  50 100 100  300 300  300  6.5.2 QOS over WiMAX Networks  Conversational voice Conversational video  live streaming  Non-conversational video  buffered streaming  Real-time gaming IMS signaling Voice, video  live streaming , interactive gaming Video  buffered streaming  TCP-based  WWW, email , chat, FTP, p2p ﬁle sharing  The QoS mechanism employed by WiMAX is ﬂow-based QoS which classiﬁes trafﬁc into different service ﬂows with diverse QoS parameters. The WiMAX Ac- cess Service Network  ASN  supports admission control and resource scheduling to manage non-guaranteed QoS per service ﬂow. The WiMAX ASN also marks trafﬁc to enable other networks to provide QoS consistent with the air interface. A Ser- vice Flow  SF  is a unidirectional MAC-layer transport connection with particular QoS parameters. The WiMAX network creates at least two service ﬂows  each for uplink and downlink and are the default service ﬂows  for a device when it joins the network. These default service ﬂows are Best Effort and support most trafﬁc types. The WiMAX network also allows for devices to be pre-provisioned with ad- ditional dedicated service ﬂows to provide QoS for selected applications. WiMAX provides mechanisms for dynamically creating, modifying and deleting dedicated service ﬂows during a subscriber’s active session. These requests can be initiated by either the network or the device. Table 6.5 shows the ﬁve Service Flows  SF  supported by IEEE 802.16e and their targeted trafﬁc types.  The SF framework provides QoS granularity and inter-SF isolation over the air interface. The air interface scheduler is responsible for enforcing QoS by assigning downlink and uplink physical  PHY  layer resource blocks among SFs. This mech- anism is called bandwidth allocation. A scheduling decision is determined based on appropriate SFs’ QoS state variables such as buffer lengths, elapsed packet delay, SFs’ QoS requirements such as MRTR and maximum latency, and Radio Frequency  RF  conditions of different MSs. Generally, SFs with shorter maximum latency or SFs with higher Minimum Reserved Trafﬁc Rate  MRTR  receive higher priorities in the scheduling decision. SFs, with late packets or long buffer lengths also, receive   88  F. Siddiqui et al.

MSs with better RF conditions receive higher priorities by the scheduler in order to improve overall sector throughput. However, an operator can adjust fairness to ensure MSs in poor RF conditions receive reason- able QoS. The air interface scheduler may differentiate between trafﬁc ﬂows within an SF by packet priority levels such as DSCP values  intra-SF . The scheduler can also further utilize the trafﬁc priority attribute of SFs to differentiate between trafﬁc associated with SFs of the same type  inter-SF .  6.5.3 A Comparison of QoS in WiMAX and LTE  Table 6.6 presents a comparison of QoS frameworks between LTE and IEEE 802.16e IEEE 802.16m networks [6].  6.6 Security in WiMAX and LTE  Both WiMAX and LTE support security mechanisms which are fundamental for wireless networks. WiMAX provides privacy so that eavesdroppers cannot read the data transmitted over the network. It also provides authentication so that unau- thorized users cannot use the network’s services. IEEE 802.16 deﬁnes a security sub-layer below the Medium Access Control  MAC  layer  as shown in Fig. 6.6 . This sub-layer has two protocols: a Privacy and Key Management  PKM  protocol and an encapsulation protocol. The PKM protocol distributes security keys between the base station and the subscriber or mobile station, and the encapsulation proto- col encrypts the transmitted data. WiMAX also supports a multicast and broadcast rekeying algorithm to refresh trafﬁc-keying material to ensure secured multicast and broadcast services.  LTE provides similar security mechanisms, using security keys between the mo- bile devices and the base station to encrypt the communication.

The GBR bearer will be provided by the network with a guaranteed service rate, and its mechanism is similar to rtPS; the non-GBR has no such requirement and performs like BE in IEEE 802.16e IEEE 802.16m LTE MBR and GBR are similar to IEEE 802.16e IEEE 802.16m MSTR and MRTR, respectively. However, MBR and GBR are only attributes of GBR bearers, while in IEEE 802.16e IEEE 802.16m even a BE SF can be rate limited using its MSTR. Also, with 3GPP Release 8, GBR and MBR are set equal, while IEEE 802.16e IEEE 802.16m allows the operator to select independent values for MSTR and MRTR. In contrast, LTE AMBR allows the operator to rate cap the total non-GBR bearers of a subscriber In LTE the QCI and the associated nine standardized characteristics are not signaled on any interface.

The ﬂexible architecture gives the mobile client opportunities for differentiation   90  Fig. 6.6 Protocol layers in IEEE 802.16  F. Siddiqui et al.  Fig. 6.7 Security in IEEE 802.16  presents a key derivation protocol in addition to other mechanisms, such as resetting the connection if it detects a corrupt key [4].  6.6.1 WiMAX Security Process  The IEEE 802.16 security process is performed in three steps  Fig. 6.7 :  1. Authentication. 2. Data key exchange  Fig. 6.8 : the Transport Encryption Key  TEK  is used to perform the data key exchange. TEK is generated by the BS randomly. It is en- crypted with 3DES using 128 bits KEK, RSA using SS’s public key and AES us- ing 128 bits KEK. The key exchange message is authenticated by HMAC-SHA1. This provides message integrity and authentication key  AK  conﬁrmation.  3. Data encryption  Fig. 6.8 : Only data messages are encrypted using DES in Ci- pher Block Chaining  CBC  mode. There is no message integrity detection and replay protection. By using AES in CCM mode, Replay protection is provided by using packet numbers.   6 Broadband Wireless Technologies  91  Fig. 6.8 Authentication, key exchange, and encryption in WiMAX   92  6.6.2 LTE Security  F. Siddiqui et al.  The LTE-SAE security architecture [19] has security in different planes such as user, network, and control planes. This is an enhancement on the UMTS security proce- dures and architecture. There are four main requirements for security in LTE. These include: providing at least the same level of security as the 3G network, providing defense against current attacks from the Internet, supporting no interference in the step-wise transition from 3G to LTE, and ﬁnally, allowing the continued use of Uni- versal Subscriber Identity Module  USIM . The latter two requirements are satisﬁed by using the 3GPP Authentication and Key Agreement  3GPP AKA  mechanism. The security requirements for LTE core network can be satisﬁed by applying the Network Domain Security  NDS  at the IP layer. However, because of certain Ra- dio Network Controller  RNC  functions integrated into the eNodeB in LTE, the 3G security architecture cannot be reused as is for the radio access network in LTE.  For data encryption, LTE uses a stream encryption method in which data are encrypted by taking an XOR of the data and the key stream. The algorithms used in 3G generate a key stream of ﬁnite length. To prevent the reuse of the key stream, the key used to generate the key stream is frequently changed. In addition, to minimize the security impact that may result if one of the keys used for encryption becomes compromised, it is desirable that the same key is not stored and used at multiple locations on the network.  6.6.3 Security Threats in WiMAX  6.6.3.1 PHY Layer Vulnerabilities  WiMAX  802.16  [10] is vulnerable to physical layer attacks such as jamming, scrambling, water torture attack, forgery, and replay attacks. Jamming is achieved by introducing a source of noise strong enough to signiﬁcantly reduce the capacity of the channel. Jamming is either unintentional or malicious. Jammed segments of bandwidth, once detected, can also be avoided in a spread spectrum scheme. Scram- bling is a sort of jamming, but for short intervals of time and targeted to speciﬁc frames or parts of frames. Scramblers can selectively scramble control or manage- ment information with the aim of affecting the normal operations of the network. Scrambling largely affects time sensitive messages. A water torture attack involves an attacker forcing a Subscriber Station  SS  to drain its battery or to consume com- puting resources by sending a series of bogus frames. In forgery attacks, an attacker with an adequate radio transmitter can write to a wireless channel. In the mesh mode, 802.16 is also vulnerable to replay attacks in which an attacker resends valid frames that the attacker has intercepted in the middle of forwarding  relaying  process [18].   6 Broadband Wireless Technologies  93  6.6.3.2 MAC Layer Vulnerabilities  WiMAX is vulnerable to many MAC layer attacks [21] caused by attackers spoof- ing, modifying, and replying to MAC layer messages. The major security threats in WIMAX PMP network are as follows.  DoS Reply Attacks During MS Initial Network Entry When the MS joins the network, it scans the downlink channel and synchronizes with it. In the downlink, the BS announces the range of initial ranging codes  initial ranging is the adjustment of time, frequency and power parameters before establishing a communication ses- sion  for the MS. The MS selects any one of the ranging codes and sends it to BS for initial ranging. The BS replies upon the successful receipt of the ranging code by a Ranging Response  RNG-RSP  message. The RNG-RSP message is used to nullify the offsets of frequency, time and power used by the MS. The message ﬂows before SA-TEK are un-encrypted nature. So the attacker can decode the MAC messages, modify and re-send it to BS or MS. The security issues during initial network en- try are:  i  RNG-RSP vulnerability  ii  Auth-Request and Invalid vulnerability and  iii  Rogue BS. For the RNG-RSP vulnerability, the attacker modiﬁes the RNGRSP message and sets the status as failed, then resends it to MS. So the MS goes for initial ranging again. If the attacker continuously sets the RNG-RSP status as failed, the MS cannot access the network leading to a DoS attack.  Latency During Handover and Unsecured Pre-authentication When han- dover occurs, the MS is re-authenticated by the target BS. The re-authentication and key exchange procedure increase the handover time, which affects delay sensitive applications. In the handover response message, the BS informs the MS whether the MS needs to do re-authentication with the target BS or not. If the MS is pre- authenticated by target BS before handover, then there is no need of device re- authentication but user authorization is still necessary.  Downgrade Attack The ﬁrst message of the authorization process is an unse- cured message from the MS telling the BS the security capabilities it has. An at- tacker could, therefore, send a spoofed message to the BS containing weaker ca- pabilities in order to convince the BS and the attacked MS to agree on an insecure encryption algorithm.  Bandwidth Spooﬁng bandwidth by sending the un-necessary BW request message to BS.  In bandwidth spooﬁng, the attacker grabs the available  6.7 Mobility Support: WiMAX Versus LTE  Mobility aspects in WiMAX are implemented using an individual Mobility Agent  MA  layer, above the MAC  link  layer, with some network layer signaling to   94  F. Siddiqui et al.  develop a complete solution. The WiMAX mobility structure deﬁnes three types of link layer handover procedure in a homogeneous environment. Of these, Hard Handover  HHO  is the default handover mechanism and two soft handover mech- anisms, Macro-Diversity Handover  MDHO  and Fast Base Station Switching  FBSS , are the optional procedures. The standard speciﬁes a highly ﬂexible and scalable layer 2  MAC-layer  handover policy, allowing handovers to be initiated and optimized by the mobile station  MS , the Base Station  BS  or the backbone network [20].  The mobile WiMAX supports optimized handover schemes with latencies less than 50 milliseconds to ensure real-time applications such as Voice over Internet Protocol  VoIP  are efﬁciently supported without service degradation.  6.7.1 Mobility in LTE Networks  The 3GPP LTE network provides support for various types of user mobility. The User Equipment  UE  measures the downlink signal strength, processes the mea- surement results and sends the measurement report to the serving eNodeB. The serving eNodeB then makes the handover decisions based on the received measure- ment reports.  Figure 6.9 shows the message exchange during the LTE handover procedure [26].  The handover procedure consists of three parts:  Handover Preparation  In this part, the UE, serving eNodeB, and the target eNodeB make preparation before the UE connects to the new cell. The main message and process are de- scribed as follows:  1. Measurement control report  messages 1–2 : the serving eNodeB conﬁgures and triggers the UE measurement procedure and the UE sends the measure- ment report message to the serving eNodeB.  2. Handover decision  messages 3–4 : the serving eNodeB performs the han- dover decision based on the received measurement report message from the UE.  3. Admission control  messages 5–6 : the target eNodeB performs the ad- mission control dependent on the QoS information and prepares handover with L1 L2.  4. Handover command  message 7 : the serving eNodeB sends the handover  command to the MS.  The Handover Execution Processes Are as Follows  5. The UE disconnects from the old cell and synchronizes with the new cell  messages 8–10 . The UE performs the synchronization with the target cell and accesses it.   6 Broadband Wireless Technologies  95  Fig. 6.9 LTE handover process  The Handover Completion Includes the Following Steps  6. The handover and path switch  messages 11–16  are conﬁrmed: the serving- Gateway switches the path of downlink data to the target side and is achieved by the serving-Gateway exchanging messages with the Mobility Manage- ment Entity  MME .  7. The resources  messages 17–18  are released: upon reception of the release message, the serving eNodeB can release radio and control of related re- sources. Subsequently, the target eNodeB can transmit the downlink packet data.   96  F. Siddiqui et al.

Given that mobile devices are required to have always-on connectivity, it is essential for wireless networks to incorporate advanced power saving mechanisms. There- fore, both LTE and WiMAX propose methods for energy efﬁcient operation. While WiMAX power saving is implemented via idle and sleep modes, 3GPP LTE utilizes Discontinuous Reception  DRX  mechanisms for power saving [14].  In the LTE DRX mechanism, the sleep wake scheduling of each UE is deter- mined by the following four basic parameters: DRX Short Cycle, DRX Long Cycle, DRX Inactivity Timer, and DRX Short Cycle Timer. The Short Sleep Cycle and Long Sleep Cycle deﬁne duration of ON period, which is a ﬁxed value applied to both long and short cycles  as shown in Fig. 6.10 . The UE device monitors the   6 Broadband Wireless Technologies  97  physical downlink control channel to determine if there is any transmission over the shared data channel allocated to the mobile device during the ON duration. The Inactivity Timer speciﬁes the period where the UE device should stay awake and monitors physical downlink control channel after the last successful decoding of the physical downlink control channel. The Short Cycle Timer speciﬁes the period where the UE device should follow Short Sleep Cycle, after The Inactivity Timer has expired. In LTE DRX, the sleep wake-up mode consists of the three different states, namely, inactivity period, light sleep period, and deep sleep period. The Inactivity period is the power active mode, whereas the light sleep period and the deep sleep period are the power saving mode. The transition from the Inactivity period to the light sleep period is controlled by Inactivity Timer, while the transition from the light sleep period to the deep sleep period within the power saving mode is controlled by Short Cycle Timer [28].  A typical power saving process in WiMAX is as follows: after the negotiation with the Base Station  BS , the Mobile Station  MS  turns off its Wireless Network Interface Card  WNIC  and gets into a low consumption state, namely, the sleep state, when the BS buffers all downlink trafﬁc for the MS and ensures that no trafﬁc is sent to it. Indeed, the MS does not know whether there are any data for it being buffered in the BS, and hence it has to wake up constantly to listen to the indication from the BS. If no packets are available for it, a new sleeping interval continues; otherwise it wakes up, switches on the WNIC again and enters into a serving state to receive the data. 802.16e deﬁnes three classes of power saving for different kinds of trafﬁc and applications. Class I, which caters for Best Effort  BE  and Non-Real- Time Variable Rate  NRT-VR  trafﬁc, provides limited QoS yet saves energy as much as possible. Class II supports delay guaranteed services and is suitable for Real-Time Variable Rate  RT-VR  trafﬁc. In addition, Class III sleeps for a long ﬁxed interval, and is therefore appropriate for multicast and management operations. In WiMAX, the BS controls the transmission power of the MS, as in the case of the CDMA system. The MS transmission power is controlled in order to avoid exceeding the BS’s total receiving power from an antenna. The WiMAX system sup- ports Adaptive Modulation and Coding  AMC , which varies the modulation, or the error correction coding rate according to the wireless channel quality. In the pres- ence of a good Signal-to-Noise-Ratio  SNR , the MS can use a high-speed modula- tion, and a small amount of error correction code, so a high transmission rate can be achieved. The SNR can be improved by allowing the MS to transmit at high power. However, increasing the transmission power increases the battery consumption, re- sulting in a shorter battery time. In the WiMAX system, the BS assigns sub-channels for each subordinate MS to avoid interference. An MS that experiences interference with its signal increases the transmission power to maintain the transmission rate. This shortens the battery lifetime further. Since battery lifetime is critical for a MS, it is important to control the transmission power in Mobile Stations, taking into consideration the transmission type and the battery lifetime [12].  Both WiMAX and LTE use OFDMA for the downlink and so have broadly similar performance for any given RF bandwidth and set of conditions. In con- trast, the modulation techniques for their uplinks are entirely different. WiMAX   98  F. Siddiqui et al.  Fig. 6.11 SC-FDMA transmitter–receiver [22]   including Mobile WiMAX  also uses OFDM for uplink, while LTE uses a new technique—Single Carrier Frequency Division Multiple Access  SC-FDMA . SC- FDMA is more power efﬁcient than OFDMA. This makes mobile devices consume less power, which increases their battery life.  SC-FDMA is a new multiple access technique that utilizes single carrier modula- tion, DFTspread orthogonal frequency multiplexing, and frequency domain equal- ization. It has a similar structure and performance as OFDM. SC-FDMA transceiver  as shown in Fig. 6.11  has a similar structure as a typical OFDM system except the addition of a new DFT block before subcarrier mapping. Hence, SC-FDMA can be considered as an OFDM system with a DFT mapper. The main advantage of SC- FDMA is the low Peak-Average-Power Ratio  PAPR  of the transmit signal. PAPR is deﬁned as the ratio of the peak power to average power of the transmit signal. As PAPR is a major concern at the user terminals, low PAPR makes the SC-FDMA the preferred technology for the uplink transmission. PAPR relates to the power am- pliﬁer efﬁciency at the transmitter, and the maximum power efﬁciency is achieved when the ampliﬁer operates at the saturation point. Lower PAPR allows operation of the power ampliﬁer close to saturation resulting in higher efﬁciency. With higher PAPR signal, the power ampliﬁer operating point has to be reduced to lower the signal distortion, and thereby lowering the ampliﬁer efﬁciency. As SC-FDMA mod- ulated signal can be viewed as a single carrier signal, a pulse shaping ﬁlter can be applied to transmit signal to further improve PAPR.  6.8 Cloud-Based Radio Access Networks  The traditional wireless network topology consists of adjacent or overlapping macro cells. However, various factors are changing this topology, including capacity con- straints, coverage issues and a need to support new classes of users and devices. A different network architecture called Cloud Radio Access Network  C-RAN  is being envisioned. A C-RAN moves the communications signal processing back into   6 Broadband Wireless Technologies  99  Fig. 6.12 Cloud-based Radio Access Network  C-RAN  architecture  a centrally located, virtualized base station, referred to as a Baseband Unit pool. As a result, cell sites are only responsible for radio transmission. Cell sites primarily consist of Remote Radio Heads  RRHs  and antennas  as shown in Fig. 6.12 . The virtualized servers perform baseband processing for a high number of cell sites  for example, thousands in a large data center . These cell sites are pooled resources and have the intelligence needed to support additional services [11].  In traditional base stations, the digital and radio processing elements are co- located with the antenna array. This is true for both macro and small cell formats, though there are variations of the implementation scheme. For example, RRHs are now relatively common in macro deployments. In a C-RAN conﬁguration, the radio equipment is located with the antenna array and the baseband digital processing, called radio equipment control, is remote with a ﬁber link connecting the two. The radio elements reside at the top of the tower and the digital processing in the cabinet at the base of the tower.  The Common Public Radio Interface  CPRI  provides a standard interface for interconnecting the radio elements. The major difference between the classic RRH and the cloud base station is the length of the ﬁber. In RRHs, the ﬁber is relatively short  a few hundred feet at most . In a cloud topology the ﬁber run may be up to several kilometers. In addition, there is extra processing deployed at the antenna to compress the antenna data so that multiple antenna streams can access and share the long-haul ﬁber. The beneﬁt of a cloud base station, which is the centralized portion   100  F. Siddiqui et al.  of a Cloud Radio Access Network  C-RAN , comes from co-locating many sets of Radio Equipment Control elements. According to the China Mobile Research Insti- tute, Cloud RANs will “improve network quality and coverage, reduce transmission resource consumption” [25].  6.8.1 Beneﬁts of C-RANs  Cloud-based RAN deployments are expected to provide spectral efﬁciency gains. Co-location of large-scale antenna processing may also lead to very efﬁcient co- ordinated interference management. Rather than coordinate across multiple geo- graphically disperse base stations, a concentrated view of the available spectrum eliminates the need to transmit coordination data sets. The ability to generate and evaluate multiple transmission scenarios between transmission intervals will ulti- mately determine the spectral efﬁciency for the entire geographic coverage area. A well designed scheduler implemented in a cloud RAN will lead to better user scheduling and ultimately to enhanced spectrum usage. This assumes a signiﬁcant increase in signal processing capability that is scaled to handle the larger spectral input and a large number of users.  6.8.2 Challenges in Deploying C-RANs  There are a few challenges that may prevent the vision of cloud RAN from becoming a widespread reality. The main issue could be the cost and availability of long- distance ﬁber. Often wireless or other wired links are used for base station backhaul. This is because ﬁber may be impractical for cost, physical impediments or right-of- way issues. Other alternatives to ﬁber simply do not have the bandwidth to transport the volume of antenna data that a cloud base station requires. In those situations where these impediments exist, traditional macro or small cell base stations will continue to be deployed. Another potential obstacle in the C-RAN deployment is latency. Propagation delay over relatively long ﬁber links may not be high, but it might induce enough latency to negatively impact spectral efﬁciency. This could hinder cloud RAN deployments or limit them to dense city environments, where the distance to the server facility will be short [25].  6.9 Conclusion  There exists an ever-increasing demand for high speed broadband wireless tech- nologies supporting high data transmission rates and mobility. This requirement has created an interest among network providers and telecom operators to develop and   6 Broadband Wireless Technologies  101  deploy new technologies capable of offering low-cost, high efﬁciency services to end users. WiMAX, 3GPP LTE, an LTE-A are leading wireless broadband services being deployed to fulﬁll user demands. WiMAX deployments have already begun throughout the world, whereas LTE-A is still in an early installation phase. There are also ongoing research efforts to integrate WiMAX and LTE and provide seamless mobility services across these two access networks.  In this chapter we have presented a comparison of existing and emerging broad- band wireless technologies. WiMAX and LTE have several similarities, yet they differ in their evolution, industry support, and deployment models. As the number of WiMAX subscribers increases, and the LTE LTE-A market also gains momen- tum, these technologies will play a major role in achieving successful deployment of large-scale mobile broadband services. Furthermore, as subscribers continue to increase and higher data transfer speeds are required, vendors around the world are trying to move Radio Access Networks into the cloud to address some of the emerg- ing challenges of broadband wireless access networks. Cloud RANs are expected to signiﬁcantly improve the scalability as well as the computational efﬁciency of these networks.

Chapter 7 RFID: Opportunities and Challenges  Yanbo Wu, Quan Z. Sheng, and Sherali Zeadally  7.1 RFID Basics  RFID  Radio Frequency IDentiﬁcation  is a technology that transfers the informa- tion between an electronic tag and an interrogator using radio waves. It is used to create a seamless link between individual, physical objects and their digital na- tives. RFID allows individual objects to be uniquely and automatically identiﬁed using wireless communications to extract identiﬁers from RFID tags attached to ob- jects. In contrast to traditional identiﬁcation technologies such as magnetic strips or barcodes, RFID is a contact-less technology that operates without line-of-sight restrictions [14].  Regardless of the underlying technologies around which an RFID system is built  e.g., microelectronic tags, surface acoustic wave tags, tags using multiple reso- nances to encode data and so on , all modern RFID system infrastructures can be categorized into three primary components, namely tags, readers, and backend sys- tems. Figure 7.1 illustrates the interconnected components of a typical modern RFID infrastructure.  Y. Wu  B   Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China e-mail: ybwu@bjtu.edu.cn  Q.Z.

Fig. 7.1 Overview of an RFID system  7.1.1 Tags  Tags are attached to objects. A tag contains an Integrated Circuit  IC  or a chip that stores the identiﬁcation of the object to which the tag is attached, and an antenna that communicates the information via radio waves. When a tag passes through an electromagnetic ﬁeld generated by a reader, the tag communicates to the reader the identiﬁcation information. Consequently, there is no line-of-sight requirement for object identiﬁcation in RFID systems.  The data stored on the tag, object identiﬁcation information, may be an Elec- tronic Product Code  EPC  [38], which is a unique identiﬁcation code for an item. Although a variety of existing as well as hitherto undeﬁned identiﬁcation codes can   7 RFID: Opportunities and Challenges  107  Table 7.1 Differences between tags of different frequencies  Frequency  Low Frequency  LF   High Frequency  HF   Ultra High Frequency  UHF   0.5∼1 m Good Slow Poor  Range Penetration Data rate Simultaneous reading Applications  <1 m Average Fast Average  >3 m Poor Fastest Good  Point-of-sale  Tickets, passports  Supply chain, toll payments  be encoded as EPC, an EPC typically contains information that identiﬁes the man- ufacturer, the type of item and the serial number of the item.  RFID tags can be classiﬁed based on their frequency of operation  Low Fre- quency  LF , High Frequency  HF , Ultra High Frequency  UHF  , or according to powering techniques  passive, semi-passive, and active  [14]. An active tag has its own transmitter and a power source to power the microchip’s circuitry and broad- cast signals to an RFID reader. The power source is either connected to a powered infrastructure or uses the energy stored in an on-board battery. In the latter case, an active tag’s lifetime is constrained by the battery. A passive tag does not have its own power source and scavenges power from the electromagnetic ﬁelds generated by readers. A passive tag also has an indeﬁnite operational life and relies on reﬂect- ing back the ElectroMagnetic  EM  ﬁeld generated by the reader and on modulating the reader’s EM incident on the antenna to send the information stored on the tag back. Semi-passive tags use their own power source to run the microchip’s circuitry but scavenge power from the waves sent out by readers to broadcast their signals.  Figure 7.1 summarizes the differences between tags of different frequencies. Active and semi-active tags are more expensive and typically used for high-value goods and or large assets that need to be tracked over long distances. For example, the U.S. Department of Defense uses active tags to track many containers being shipped to bases and units overseas. On the other hand, passive tags are very inex- pensive  as cheap as 20 cents  and can even be used for common materials in very large quantities. Currently, signiﬁcant efforts are being undertaken to achieve 5-cent tags by shrinking chip size, cutting antenna cost, and increasing their consumption  e.g., RFID mandates from Wal-Mart and U.S. Department of Defense .  RFID tags appear in a wide variety of shapes  e.g., key fobs, credit cards, cap- sules, pads , sizes  e.g., as small as a grain of rice, as big as a six inches ruler , capabilities, and materials. Tags can have metal external antennas, embedded anten- nas, or printed antennas.  In this chapter, we will not give a detailed review of physical principles about  RFID hardware design. Interested readers are referred to [14, 44].   108  7.1.2 Readers  Y. Wu et al.  The readers’ function is to generate an electromagnetic  EM  ﬁeld to power tags  when passive tags are employed  and facilitate communication with tags. RFID readers communicate with tags using a radio frequency interface. Either a strong energy storage ﬁeld near the reader’s antenna, or radiating EM waves, establishes the RF interface. Communication between a reader and a tag may involve interrogat- ing the tag to obtain data, writing data to the tag or beaming commands to the tag so as to affect its behavior. The readers consist of their own source of power, process- ing capability and an antenna  antennas . In addition, most modern RFID readers are equipped embedded systems with networking capabilities  WIFI or Local Area Network  LAN   to allow readers to be networked with other types of computing hardware. Typically, readers are connected to a backend system via the networking interfaces  as shown in Fig. 7.1 .  RFID readers are generally placed at ﬁxed locations with their antennas strate- gically placed to detect tagged items passing through their EM ﬁeld. RFID readers can read multiple co-located tags simultaneously  e.g., up to several hundreds of tags per second . The reading distance ranges from a few centimeters to more than 100 meters, depending on the types of tag, the power of readers, interference from other RF devices, and so on [14].  Handheld RFID Reader is one type of the Mobile RFID Readers. Compared with ﬁxed readers, mobile RFID readers are not deployed at ﬁxed locations. In contrast, the readers are embedded in Personal Digital Assistants  PDAs  or mobile phones so that they can be carried around. Mobile readers are very important and useful in mobile payment [32]. However, their usage in traceable networks is limited.  7.1.3 Backend Systems  The readers are connected to a computer network in which the data are collected and processed. This network may be limited to a single organization, or it may cross organizational boundaries to enable cooperation and sharing between business partners  e.g., manufacturers, warehouses, and retailers .  Typically, as shown in Fig. 7.1, the raw RFID readings are transferred to the data processing server or directly into the databases. In most cases, they will be pre- processed at the Data Processing Server to reduce redundancies or get ﬁltered and cleaned. The pre-processed data are then used by the Application Server for further usage and analysis. In general, RFID data processing includes the pre-processing  ﬁltering, cleaning etc. , RFID event extraction and the storage and management of the data. On the other hand, the processed data stored in data warehouses can be used for high-level analysis such as pattern recognition, frequent itemsets, time- series data mining etc. Regular data processing techniques and database manage- ment systems can be used to achieve some of these functions. However, due to the   7 RFID: Opportunities and Challenges  109  special characteristics of RFID data, which we will introduce in the next section, we have to provide custom solutions for them.  The backend system is normally distributed. For example, a global supply chain consists of organizations from all over the world. As a result, the data must be shared among the organizations in order to answer the queries about either the full lifecy- cle information of individual objects or the statistics of the aggregated data. The data sharing brings some issues in privacy protection, which we will discuss in Sect. 7.3.  In this chapter, we will examine the data processing and data management prob- lems layer by layer in the RFID infrastructure and discuss the challenges and op- portunities for exploratory research. The organization of this chapter is as follows. First, in Sect. 7.2 and Sect. 7.3, we discuss the characteristics of RFID data and their requirements for the RFID systems. In Sect. 7.4, we present an overview on the state-of-art research on RFID data cleaning, management and mining, and we discuss the unresolved issues in these areas. Finally, we summarize the future re- search directions that might be interesting to researchers in Sect. 7.5.  7.2 RFID Data Characteristics  The basic format of RFID data captured at the reader is a triple tuple, denoted as {Tag_ID, Timestamp, Reader_ID}. As simple as it sounds, due to the nature of RFID devices and the collecting process, RFID data have some unique characteristics. In this section, we brieﬂy summarize them.  7.2.1 Redundancy  There are two sources of getting redundant RFID reading entries. First, the RFID readers are often conﬁgured to emit the radio waves in a periodic manner, for ex- ample, every second. As a result, if the same tag stays in the EM range of a reader, it will be read more than once and duplicated tuples will be generated for this tag, for which the Tag_ID and Reader_ID are the same, while the timestamps are not. Second, several RFID readers may be deployed together to cover the region of in- terests. The tag is likely to be read by several readers at the same time. The two kinds of redundancy are called Temporal Redundancy and Spatial Redundancy, re- spectively. Spatial Redundancy causes confusion as it introduces inconsistent infor- mation about the location of the object. Temporal Redundancy, on the other hand, causes unnecessary storage in the backend database and affects the efﬁciency of data processing.   110  Y. Wu et al.  7.2.2 Implicit Semantics The RFID tuples {Tag_ID, Timestamp, Reader_ID} do not carry much information. From a single entry {oi , t, rj}, the only conclusion that we can derive is that “this object oi was detected by reader rj at time t”. In order for the higher level appli- cations to make good use of these data, inferences must be made to connect the relevant data and provide meaningful information.  Generally, two kinds of semantically meaningful data are required by enterprise applications. First, data that allow traceability applications, such as postal services, the ability to track and trace individual objects. Using RFID and linking all RFID tuples for the same object will produce a trace along which the object has traveled, which can be displayed to the end customer to track his or her packages. Second, it is useful for the managers to get various statistics. For example, a supply chain man- ager can use the statistics to better plan the resource allocation such as transportation routes, fuel consumption and so on.  7.2.3 Uncertainties  The typical uncertainties are summarized as follows:  RFID devices have several limitations.  Figure 7.1 shows that the reading range is limited and the reading process is affected by the environmental factors.  And the data collected from the readers are not perfect.   False positives. The data generated by readers are limited in accuracy. RFID read- ers may report a tag identiﬁer which is not stored on a tag within the reader’s EM ﬁeld. This is called a “Ghost Read”. Essentially, the reader receives incorrect data which are interpreted by the reader as being valid. False positives result in erro- neous data that are difﬁcult for information systems to handle.   Missing events. A reader may miss identifying an object or a temporal malfunc- tion of a device may cause a systematic error during event generation. A missed tag reading results in incompleteness of data, because the information stored in the tag, such as the identiﬁer, is not captured by the reader.   Nodal limitations. At a given time, an object o may be in movement from reader rs to rd , or it may have arrived at rd but not yet identiﬁed. If we consider a query “Where is o?”, the answer might be rs, according to the data we have collected. This detachment of the digital observation from physical reality affects the accuracy of traceability queries.  7.2.4 Large Volume  In large-scale RFID applications  e.g., global supply chains , there will be thousands of readers distributed across and within organizations that generate large volumes of   7 RFID: Opportunities and Challenges  111  data automatically and rapidly. Data volumes can be enormous  e.g., Wal-Mart gen- erates about 7 tera-bytes of data every day if goods are tagged at the item level [39] . The large volume of RFID data brings about two difﬁculties. Firstly, we need to store all the RFID data. Consequently, traditional data sampling techniques are not applicable here. Secondly, general data management systems will be very slow in the highly dynamic RFID database systems.  As a result of these unique characteristics of RFID data, special requirements for RFID systems must be fulﬁlled. In the next section, we will discuss these require- ments and brieﬂy present the state-of-art development of RFID systems.  7.3 RFID System Requirements and Overview  7.3.1 Requirements for RFID Systems  We consider the following key system development requirements:  1  scalability,  2  heterogeneity,  3  support for unique identiﬁer,  4  uncertainty management,  5  timeliness, and  6  security and privacy. Among them, we consider the scalabil- ity and heterogeneity as the most important ones in large-scale RFID systems.  7.3.1.1 Scalability  A scalable architecture framework is required to ensure adequate performance of RFID systems as the volume of data increases. A scalable architecture must address the following issues:   Amount of data. Given the large quantities of potential object instance level data, an appropriate solution that does not involve the permanent storage of individual raw data must be found.   Integration. It should be possible to integrate an increasing umber of nodes into the system without degrading query performance such as the timeliness of re- sponses. This is signiﬁcant because a linear increment of the number of nodes will also linearly increase the number of nodes that must be searched for object related data with a blind search. A linear increment of the number of nodes will cause exponential increase of the generated data.  7.3.1.2 Heterogeneity  An RFID system is established by connecting different readers, which may belong to different organizations, use different hardware and software systems, store the collected data in different formats. In addition, with the rapid development in RFID technologies, new devices may be introduced. Consequently, RFID systems should be agnostic to such heterogeneity and, ideally, be compliant with global standards for interoperability across organizations and geographies.   112  Y. Wu et al.  7.3.1.3 Support for Unique Identiﬁers  Given the distributed nature of data collection and storage, there must be a mecha- nism for associating products with their relevant lifecycle data in networked infor- mation systems as well as on the products themselves. This aspect is fundamental to networked RFID systems. The universally unique identiﬁer  UUID  forms the link between an object and its associated information collected and possibly distributed at various organizations and locations. The UUID can then be used to discover and access information associated with it from distributed information resources simi- lar to the way in which web addresses or Uniform Resource Locators  URLs  are used to access information from the Internet. Supporting applications such as tar- geted product recall and anti-counterfeiting requires that each architecture supports a unique identiﬁer. The scope of the identiﬁer may be deﬁned by the application. However, for managing global applications with a worldwide focus  such as supply chains distributed across countries , a fundamental requirement is the support for a globally unique identiﬁer.  7.3.1.4 Uncertainty Management  The responses to queries may not be deterministic since the underlying RFID net- work is limited by the number of discrete observation points  nodes , hardware per- formance and data sharing issues. Consequently, a signiﬁcant challenge is to manage uncertainty.  7.3.1.5 Timeliness  RFID applications are built on the premise that changes in the physical world are reﬂected by timely changes in information systems. Real-time information is critical for managing distribution operations, rapid product recalls and service maintenance operations that need to be constantly re-evaluated based on traceability information of tools and technicians. Therefore, an expectation of an RFID system is that it should be responsive, with the ability to provide timely information.  It is expected that the queries should work in both Pull and Push mode. In the pull mode, the front-end system sends the query to the backend to get an answer. Meanwhile, in the push mode, the front-end system gets notiﬁed when a certain pre-set condition is met. Normally, the push mode is implemented as the Observer pattern [12]. However, this pattern requires a centralized mapping from the observed objects to the observer. When the number of the observed objects increases linearly, the time used to notify the observers increases linearly too. This causes a severe delay in large-scale applications.   7 RFID: Opportunities and Challenges  113  7.3.1.6 Security and Privacy  RFID is a pervasive technology capable of mass serialization and unobtrusive scan- ning from a distance. So no discussion is ever complete without addressing various security and privacy related issues. RFID systems are susceptible to issues arising from vulnerabilities in RFID technology [23] as well as associated information sys- tems. For example, competitors of an organization  such as a rival supermarket  may scan another organization’s inventory labeled with RFID tags or eavesdrop on the organization’s own valid operations to obtain valuable information, such as sales data, to ascertain the performance of its competitors  an act commonly referred to as corporate espionage . The fact that a third party can eavesdrop on a conversation between a tag and reader from a distance is a fundamental vulnerability.  There are numerous publications [5, 10, 13, 24, 33] that address vulnerabilities of RFID systems through improved security features such as the kill functionality for Class 1 Generation 2 tags and lightweight security mechanisms suitable for RFID devices. Furthermore, there is a mature and standardized set of cryptographic tools  e.g., public key security mechanisms such as RSA and Elliptic Curve Cryptogra- phy, private key mechanisms such as the Advanced Encryption Standard  available for securing computer networks and networked resources. Therefore, we will only consider the traceability system’s ability to manage RFID data without violating pri- vacy or compromising security of partner organizations participating in a traceable RFID Network.  7.3.2 Overview of RFID Systems  In the past decade, the rapid deployment of RFID technology is making the collec- tion, processing, integration and sharing of RFID data an active area of research and development [39]. In this section, we ﬁrst introduce the EPCglobal standards. Then we present an overview of current efforts being developed. Based on the analysis, we also highlight some challenges and open issues that need to be addressed.  7.3.2.1 EPCglobal Architecture Framework  EPCglobal [11] is an organization focusing on developing standards to support RFID in information rich trading networks. The major standards in EPCglobal Ar- chitecture Framework  EAF  are illustrated in Fig. 7.2. EAF is widely regarded as one of the most well-known RFID network architectures. EAF is a collection of standards for hardware, software and data interfaces, together with several core ser- vices  i.e., “EPC Network Services”  as shown in Fig. 7.2. This framework is a lay- ered architecture that separates functionalities into three isolated modules, namely identity, capture, and exchange.   114  Y. Wu et al.  Fig. 7.2 EPCglobal architecture framework  7.3.2.2 Identity  The identity layer standardizes data representation in RFID tags  i.e., “Reader Air Interface and EPC Spec” . An important standard in this layer is the Electronic Product Code  EPC, not shown in the ﬁgure . EPC is designed to be a scalable license-plate identiﬁcation number that enables linking between an individual prod- uct and its associated information resources or backend information services. The air interface standards deﬁne the speciﬁcations for data and commands to be trans-   7 RFID: Opportunities and Challenges  115  ferred between tags and readers  e.g., the Class 1 Generation 2 UHF Air Interface Protocol Standard or “Gen 2”1 .  7.3.2.3 Capture  The capture layer consists of standards for reader management, reader protocols and most importantly, the Application Level Event  ALE  interface. ALE is a common interface for accessing processed RFID data and controlling the collection of raw RFID event data sent from RFID readers. The ALE speciﬁcation describes the be- havior of aggregating and ﬁltering of RFID data within a period of time. This period of time is called Event Cycle  EC . At the end of an event cycle, the data collected are processed and transformed into a report with ﬁltered event data containing what, when, and where information. ALE also deﬁnes these report speciﬁcations.  7.3.2.4 Exchange  The data exchange layer is designed as a service-oriented architecture. In this layer, there are three core services deﬁned, namely EPC Information Service  EPCIS , Object Naming Service  ONS  and Discovery Service  DS :   EPCIS is the ﬁrst step to enable data sharing and object tracing between partners. It deﬁnes a set of interfaces for data capture and query. It also deﬁnes a high- level data model which classiﬁes data as either Master Data  static  or Event Data  dynamic . The cooperation and data sharing methods are achieved by two interfaces, namely EPCIS Query Control Interface and EPCIS Query Callback Interface. Both interfaces deﬁne access control policies to allow only authorized trading partners to access data.   ONS functions like the Domain Naming Service  DNS  in the Internet protocol stack. It uses the ID of an object to retrieve the address of the EPCIS containing its data. It is based on DNS and uses a particular type of DNS record, called Naming Authority Pointer  NAPTR  record,2 to provide for future ﬂexibility. It should be noted that ONS only resolves the address of the EPCIS instance where the EPC is originally assigned to the object, although the object may be scanned and stored in other EPCIS instances.   DS is currently under development.3 This service is expected to discover infor- mation which may be distributed across many EPCIS instances, for a speciﬁc object.  1http:  www.gs1.org gsmp kc epcglobal uhfc1g2. 2IETF RFC 2915. 3http:  www.gs1.org gsmp kc epcglobal discovery.   116  7.3.2.5 BRIDGE  Y. Wu et al.  Building Radio frequency IDentiﬁcation for the Global Environment  BRIDGE 4 is a European Union funded project to develop networked RFID systems. Although BRIDGE utilizes the EPCglobal standards, it explores many related ﬁelds includ- ing hardware, software and security with extensions. Work carried out within the BRIDGE project includes the implementation of the EAF  see Sect. 7.3.2.1 , de- velopment of prototype Discovery Services  DS , deﬁnition of essential interfaces such as the DS publish interface, and development of algorithms and tools for building traceability applications. The BRIDGE project has explicitly taken track and trace into consideration and designed speciﬁc services for traceability queries while taking into account uncertainties. Several successful industrial trials have been achieved in the project.5  To support the Serial Level Lookup Service, BRIDGE has leveraged and ex- tended the EPCglobal standards by developing a DS Query and Publisher interface along with the development of Discovery Services. The BRIDGE project has ad- dressed an existing gap in the EAF by developing the key services necessary to enable traceability applications.6  An important part of BRIDGE is a Supply Chain Node Network Hierarchy Model that encapsulates a supply chain model for capturing physical ﬂow of objects in terms of nodes and connections. The track and trace model is used to model the ac- tual state of an object and the observed state reported by the RFID devices based on a Hidden Markov Model  HMM , which distinguishes between the actual and the latest observed state. The HMM model describes the uncertainty under which the observed state reﬂects the actual successive states of the object. The Tracking Algo- rithms which consist of probabilistic and non-probabilistic algorithms provide pro- cedures for track, trace, and prediction queries. Probabilistic algorithms are particu- larly designed to address uncertainty of reported observations  e.g., missing reads .  7.3.2.6 IBM Theseos  IBM’s Theseos [7] is a query engine capable of processing complex queries across organizations to enable the development of traceability applications in a completely distributed setting. Theseos relies on a novel traceability data model that eliminates any data dependencies between organizations, which serves as a global schema that allows the formulation of a query without knowledge on how the data are stored or where they are located, and how a tracking query is executed [3]. In particular, The- seos introduces two attributes in its data model, namely sentTo and receivedFrom,  4http:  bridge-project.eu. 5http:  bridge-project.eu index.php bridge-public-deliverables en . 6Researchers from IBM Almaden Research Center have also developed prototype DS [34]. How- ever, the BRIDGE project has particularly demonstrated the use of DS along with the EPCglobal architecture in various industrial projects.   7 RFID: Opportunities and Challenges  117  that each organization is required to maintain for the movement path of an object. With this information, it is possible to minimize the number of nodes to be visited without ﬂooding queries to all nodes in the network. Traceability queries are ﬁrst processed locally. Based on the outcome of this process, the query is further ana- lyzed. It may be rewritten and then forwarded to other distributed databases. The results retrieved from the network are added to the local results and post-processing is required to yield the ﬁnal response.  One advantage of Theseos is that the data are not centrally maintained and each organization has the ability to selectively share traceability data with other trading partners. Another advantage is its scalability. Since data are processed and stored in each individual node, the workload is naturally distributed. Unfortunately, to obtain the sentTo and receivedFrom information, Theseos requires high synchronization with other enterprise data  e.g., billing or accounting information . This is imprac- tical for many applications where such enterprise data may be unavailable. Another signiﬁcant disadvantage of Theseos is its instability. If any of the peers is down, all queries relevant to that peer will fail. This is because of the difference between peer-based RFID solutions and other peer-based data sharing applications such as Bittorrent [47]. Bittorrent allows redundancy to exist and makes good use of this feature to increase data availability and reliability. But peer-based RFID solutions keep data strictly private at each node  i.e., there is no redundancy .  Theseos allows enterprises to selectively control access to traceability data using Hippocratic Database  HDB  [4] technology based on ten principles rooted in pri- vacy regulations. Consequently, successful execution of a traceability query requires the inquiring party to have the access privileges to the data stored at the nodes along the movement paths of an object.  7.3.2.7 PeerTrack  PeerTrack [49, 50] is a platform designed for efﬁciently tracking and tracing objects in large-scale RFID systems. PeerTrack features a pure P2P architecture for data and query processing. In particular, a data model for traceability networks has been designed, which eliminates the data dependencies between organizations. Important tracking and tracing queries have been implemented as built-in features and it en- ables ﬂexible support for the development of add-in queries. PeerTrack relies on a generic data model for moving objects in large-scale networks, namely “a Model for mOving Objects in Discrete Space”  MOODS . A discrete space refers to a ﬁnite set of nodes which represents all the organizations in the network. MOODS elimi- nates the data dependencies between organizations by storing the information about object movements at the nodes where the object has been transported. In particular, PeerTrack introduces the Information of Object Path  IOP , which includes proper- ties that indicate the departure and arrival information of objects, such as timestamps and physical locations. With IOP, each node maintains segments of objects’ moving paths and uses this information to expedite P2P queries in the network.   118  Y. Wu et al.  7.3.3 Open Issues and Challenges  As we have discussed above, many issues still need to be addressed at the architec- ture level in RFID systems.  7.3.3.1 Uncertainty and Prediction Query Support  Most of the existing architectures do not address uncertainty explicitly. The assump- tion that the underlying data capturing technologies are perfect is not correct. Un- certainty in captured data signiﬁcantly affects the results generated by traceability queries. In recent years, uncertainty has become an active research topic [2, 6]. Only the architecture extension supported by BRIDGE has provided high-level models and algorithms capable of modeling the uncertainty. However, an important issue with the approach is the need of supervised learning for the models to be useful. Signiﬁcant work is needed to  i  investigate other modeling techniques such as Con- ditional Random Field  CRF , skip chain CRF [40] and Emerging Patterns [18] and  ii  consider more dynamic models that do not require a learning phase [19, 37].  7.3.3.2 Scalability  The existing architectures have achieved scalability based on either federated or P2P architectures. EPCglobal Network and BRIDGE are federated. The problem with this approach is that the Discovery Service  Serial Lookup Service in BRIDGE  be- comes a bottleneck. This issue is considered by the Hierarchical P2P approach by implementing the Discovery Service in a pure distributed manner and by DIALOG based on its multi-agent design. In general, in a P2P-based approach, each node delegates a query to its neighbors if it cannot answer the query itself. For exam- ple, in Theseos and PeerTrack, queries are processed locally and rewritten before forwarded to the next node. However, a signiﬁcant issue for P2P-based approach is that each node must take an equal importance in the network and be open to the idea of having its data stored on different peers that may be controlled by competitive businesses.  7.3.3.3 Timely Response  EPC Network, BRIDGE and DIALOG use subscription mechanisms  “push”-based approaches  to support real-time data requirements. However, in query processing, P2P architectures are not capable of providing time constraints although this is an important requirement for traceability applications. For P2P architectures, a query may be propagated several times and this signiﬁcantly increases the processing time. Improving the timeliness of query responses is a signiﬁcant issue and future research is needed in this direction.   7 RFID: Opportunities and Challenges  119  7.3.3.4 Security and Privacy  To enable a fully distributed RFID system, there must be some level of data shar- ing between nodes. Access control in DIALOG is shifted away from parties down the supply chain towards manufacturers. Manufacturers of objects exercise a strong control over the collection of information from other parties and sharing of that information with client applications. In contrast, the EPCglobal Network  through the Discovery Services mechanism developed in BRIDGE  allows highly granular access control policies to be speciﬁed by parties collecting information in order to determine access rights by other entities to product related data. There are trade- offs between the privacy and data sharing. For example, P2P architectures protect privacy adequately by providing nodes with ownership of the data and the choice to respond to queries from desirable parties, which also means some constraints for data sharing. Thus techniques for dealing with the tradeoff between privacy and data sharing are still a research challenge.  7.4 RFID Data Processing, Management and Mining  In this section, we present the state-of-art research on RFID data processing, man- agement and mining.  7.4.1 RFID Data Processing  7.4.1.1 RFID Data Cleaning  To compensate the unreliability of RFID streams, most of the RFID stream clean- ing middleware employ the “Smoothing Filter” technology. SMURF [22] is the ﬁrst declarative, adaptive smoothing ﬁlter for RFID data cleaning. In particular, SMURF models the unreliability of RFID readings by viewing RFID streams as a statistical sample of tags in the physical world. SMURF continuously adapts the size of the smoothing window size to provide accurate RFID data. In [21], the authors pro- posed an abstracted adaptive RFID framework called MDI-SMURF which cleans the RFID data while shielding applications from the challenges that arise when interacting directly with sensor devices. Rao et al. [35] introduced a deferred ap- proach for detecting and correcting RFID data anomalies. Unlike SMURF which cleans data according to its own rules, this work allows applications to deﬁne detec- tion and correction rules and rewrites the queries based on these rules on the data. In [30], a new adaptive data cleaning scheme, called WSTD, is proposed. WSTD uses the comparison of the two window subrange observations or estimated tag counts to detect when transitions occur within a window.  In [52], the authors introduced an approach for data cleaning that exploits basic characteristics of RF signals as well as the maximum likelihood operations. This   120  Y. Wu et al.  method enables reasoning about the position of RFID tags in the reader’s range without measuring the signal strength of tag responses.  Liao et al. [28] dealt with another problem that data streams collected by multiple readers usually contain cross-reads,7 by introducing a method that estimates the density of each tag using a kernel-based function and keeps the event from the reader corresponding to the micro-cluster with the largest density.  In [26], a Bayesian inference-based framework for cleaning RFID raw data is proposed. The authors ﬁrst studied an n-state detection model and formally prove that 3-state model can maximize the system performance. Then they extend the model to support 2-dimensional RFID reader arrays.  There are also some generic data cleaning frameworks. Gonzalez et al. [17] pro- posed a cleaning framework that takes an RFID dataset and a collection of clean- ing methods, with associated costs, and a cleaning plan that optimizes the overall cleaning costs by determining the conditions under which inexpensive methods are appropriate and necessary. Jeffery et al. [20] propose the Extensible Sensor Stream Processing  ESP  framework to build sensor data cleaning infrastructures. ESP is designed as a pipeline using declarative cleaning methods.  Open Issues and Challenges Recently proposed cleaning methods for RFID streams mostly focus on improving the data qualify from a statistical perspective  i.e., they are speciﬁcally designed for aggregated queries such as COUNT, AVG and SUM. Moreover, these methods focus on the aggregated information of indi- vidual objects. As a result, they are not suitable for dealing with cross-site trajectory queries in distributed traceability applications. The ability to recover the missing readings in a distributed system at the item-level is still a challenge.  7.4.1.2 RFID Event Processing  In an uncertain environment, extracting and processing semantically events from RFID data streams is also associated with various challenges. Consequently, regular event processing techniques are no longer effective.  In [25], a probabilistic approach  called PEEX  is presented for high-level event extraction from RFID data. PEEX translates event deﬁnitions into SQL queries and based on conﬁdence tables to determine the probability of ambiguous events. It uses partial events to handle data errors. In [36], an event processing system, Lahar, for probabilistic event streams was proposed. Lahar exploits the probabilistic nature of the data to enable declarative queries over real time and archived streams of prob- abilistic events. Cascadia [48] is another RFID event processing system which can cope with ambiguous RFID data by transforming RFID readings into probabilistic  7In a small environment, a tag may be read by more than one reader at the same time; as a result, its location is uncertain because of inconsistency derived from the readers.   7 RFID: Opportunities and Challenges  121  events. In [31], the authors proposed an approach to perform Complex Event Pro- cessing directly over the unreliable RFID event streams instead of the cleaned ones, by incorporating cleaning requirements into complex event speciﬁcations.  In [45] and [46], the authors introduced an approach for event materialization under uncertainty, which includes a model for representing materialized events us- ing Bayesian Network, and the algorithms for specifying the probability space of an event history where Monte Carlo sampling algorithm is used to assess materialized event probabilities.  In [41], the authors proposed a probabilistic model to capture the mobility of the reader, object dynamics and noisy readings. This model can self-calibrate by auto- matically estimating key parameters from observed data. Based on the model, the authors also proposed a sampling-based technique to infer clean, precise informa- tion about object locations from raw streams from mobile RFID readers.  Open Issues and Challenges The models, algorithms, and frameworks discussed earlier are designed mainly for the extraction of high-level events from unreliable RFID data and the derivation of their conﬁdences. However, they mostly focus on each individual RFID-tagged object and location, rather than the trajectories of their movements. As we discussed in Sect. 7.2, extracting trajectory-based information is very important for RFID-based traceability applications and many open research issues still need further research.  7.4.2 Management of RFID Data  Data models determine the structures of the data storage and representation. The design of data models signiﬁcantly affects the performance of the whole system. Due to the nature of large-scale traceability applications, data models must be ap- propriately designed to support various queries in highly dynamic, data-intensive environments. To support traceability applications in different business contexts, fundamental generic data models are necessary. In this section, we examine recent research efforts on data modeling and corresponding query processing techniques for RFID systems.  7.4.2.1 DRER Model  Dynamic Relationship ER  DRER  [42] as shown in Fig. 7.3 is the data model used by Siemens’ RFID middleware system. It is one of earliest RFID data models. It abstracts the static and dynamic entities including object, reader, location and transaction. Interactions are modeled as either state- or event-based relationships. In [42], low-level temporal and spatial queries are considered. Although the design takes containment into consideration by introducing the Containment relationship, it does not mention how this relationship is captured. DRER models the transition   122  Y. Wu et al.  Fig. 7.3 The DRER model  The simplicity of this model also leads to a few drawbacks:  of states for objects using the dynamic relations  e.g., ObjectLocation . This model is simple yet expressive, so that it can be used to answer most of the queries.   The model and the query processing techniques assume all data are stored in a single database or database cluster. They are hard to use in highly distributed, heterogeneous systems.   The model focuses on modeling individual RFID events. It lacks support for com- plex data structures  such as path . Consequently, some queries have to be imple- mented by composing low-level queries which are not efﬁcient.   The model lacks support for statistical queries.  7.4.2.2 KAIST Trace Model  Researchers from KAIST  Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology  proposed a novel model to efﬁciently encode and query path information in an RFID database [27].8 The encoding scheme is based on the Chinese Remainder Theorem and can encode a path to a serial number level. A query processing language is also proposed. The idea of this model is to represent the paths as a forest. Each starting location is presented by the root of a tree and receiving locations are child nodes of sending locations.  Experiments have proved that this encoding scheme with the query processing method efﬁciently discovers the path information for a given object. In particular, for most queries, the KAIST model is better than RFID Cuboid [16]. Moreover, similar to the RFID-Cuboid model, it signiﬁcantly decreases the data storage size. However, this model does not assume that the object moves in groups, so it can be  8The authors did not give a name to the model. For convenience, we call it “KAIST Trace Model”.   7 RFID: Opportunities and Challenges  123  Fig. 7.4 SPIRE  used in more scenarios. The KAIST trace model is path-centric and can efﬁciently process path-oriented queries.  The KAIST trace model has several issues which prevent it from being used in distributed environments. First, the encoding decoding scheme is path-oriented, thus data from different nodes must be stored in the same sever, otherwise it be- comes difﬁcult to build the tree. Second, once the tree is built, any change in the network requires the whole tree to be rebuilt. In dynamic distributed environments, this process is costly in terms of both time and bandwidth.  7.4.2.3 SPIRE Model  None of the aforementioned models discuss how the containment relationship is captured. The automatic inference of the containment relationship is still an open research problem. It is a multiple-layer problem which involves hardware conﬁgu- ration, data cleansing, uncertain data management and other techniques. SPIRE is a research effort that attempts to address this problem.  An earlier work from SPIRE [8] proposes two options to detect containment relationships. One option is the manual approach, the other is to conﬁgure RFID readers so that each reader can read only the outermost container’s tag. However, it does not solve the regrouping problem. In addition, due to the unreliability of RFID readers, it will not work perfectly even with the assumption that no regrouping exists. In a recent work by the same authors [9], the SPIRE system is improved to detect containment relationship using a statistical method. In this approach, the containment is inferred by the historical co-location of tags. A time-varying colored graph model was proposed as shown in Fig. 7.4.  The edges indicate possible containment relationship, while the objects detected together at the same location are marked with the same color. At the beginning, the edges are added from the higher level container to lower level objects containers if   124  Y. Wu et al.  they are at the same location. After they move to a new location, some edges are removed if there is no co-location relationship anymore. Ideally, after some point, there should be exactly one path from the root to a certain leaf. However, this rarely happens because of regrouping. To address this problem, a probabilistic inference method is proposed in SPIRE. The basic idea is to assign weights to the co-location records with a recent record receiving a higher weight. The incoming edges to a node are sorted by the weighted sums of the co-location records. SPIRE chooses the edge with the highest sum to update the containment relationship.  The containment relationship is inferred by co-location of tags but it cannot dis- tinguish between co-location and containment. To solve this problem, it is necessary to encode the containment level information in the tag. This makes this model in- ﬂexible and expensive because the tag must be uniﬁed across all organizations.  7.4.2.4 Open Issues and Challenges  The underlying RFID data models play an important role in shaping the higher level architectures for RFID systems. A well-designed data model can signiﬁcantly im- prove system performance and decrease persistent data storage requirements. From the discussion above, we found that signiﬁcant work remains in the area of RFID data models and query processing:   Distributed data model. Most RFID systems are distributed and spread across or- ganizations. It is difﬁcult to assume or require data to be stored in centralized databases. Distributed data models therefore need to be carefully designed to support traceability queries. However, at the time of writing, to the best of our knowledge, there are no existing data models that meet all the requirements we have outlined. We believe that extensive research efforts are needed for modeling distributed RFID data.   Statistical queries over trajectories. These queries can provide data ﬂow statistics through particular nodes or trajectories, which are vital for high-level business decisions in RFID applications. Unfortunately, these statistical queries are not well supported by existing data models.   Containment queries. Containment queries over object trajectories are also im- portant, especially in product recalls where an object  e.g., tainted pork  from a node should be recalled. For these scenarios, it is necessary to ﬁnd all other ob- jects  e.g., other pork that traveled in the same pallet  that have a containment relationship with the object in question, obtain their paths and recall them. Unfor- tunately, containment queries are also not well supported by most of the existing data models.   Uncertainty. Most existing data models do not take uncertainty of RFID data into consideration. However, as we have discussed in Sect. 7.2, uncertainty should be treated as ﬁrst class citizen in RFID traceability networks.   7 RFID: Opportunities and Challenges  7.4.3 RFID Data Mining  7.4.3.1 RFID Warehousing  125  The idea of RFID Cuboid [16] is based on the observation that individual objects tend to move and stay together  i.e., bulky object movements . The records for the objects moving along the same segments can be merged without loss of informa- tion. The term “cuboid” implies that data are merged at some point. Compared with DRER, RFID Cuboid is a data mining model instead of dynamic event-driven model.  The most important advantage of RFID-cuboid is the efﬁcient support of sta- tistical and path-oriented queries, by grouping the objects and consolidation of the group information. This consolidation signiﬁcantly improves the performance of query processing. However, the storage used by RFID-Cuboid is higher than that used by DRER because of the additional tables. This additional storage cost is fur- ther reduced by the same authors’ recent work where they introduced a Gateway- Based Movement Graph model [15]. This enhanced work assumes that there are some “gateway” nodes in an RFID network, which have either high fan-in or high fan-out edges. These gateway nodes connect the sub-graphs together.  The RFID Cuboid can be established around the gateway nodes, and ungrouped within the sub-graphs. Instead of using the starting location of a group of objects as the root, the gateway-based movement graph selects the gateway nodes as the root. In this way, the root groups are the largest, so that the number of groups is minimized. This is very useful for large-scale, distributed traceability applications  e.g., global supply chain systems .  The RFID-Cuboid model efﬁciently compresses the data and improves the per- formance of queries using a tree-structure. However, it is highly dependent on the data distribution. The performance is signiﬁcantly affected if objects do not exhibit bulky movements. Consequently, this data model is only suitable for large datasets that share some common properties  e.g., move together in bulky mode .  7.4.3.2 Pattern Matching  Pattern matching over uncertain event streams is an important topic also. In [1], the authors proposed a formal evaluation model that offers precise semantics for the new class of queries and a query evaluation framework that allows for systematic optimizations in a principled way. Zhao et al. [51] proposed a model to measure pat- tern frequency based on the possible world semantics. Two mining algorithms were developed based on the model for mining frequent sequential patterns. In [29], two solutions to deal with out-of-order event streams were proposed, namely aggressive and conservative strategies. The aggressive strategy produces maximal output under the optimistic assumption that out-of-order event arrival is rare, while the conserva- tive one deals with the common out-of-order data.   126  Y. Wu et al.  In [43], the authors modeled the mining of frequent itemsets as a Poisson bino- mial distribution and developed an approximate algorithm which can efﬁciently and accurately discover frequent itemsets in a large uncertain evolving databases.  7.4.3.3 Open Issues and Challenges  As we discussed above, there has been some research on mining RFID data. How- ever, there are still some open issues and interesting challenges that need to be ad- dressed in the future.   Trajectory-based mining. The current pattern matching research focus on frequent item sets  i.e., objects often appearing together . However, no trajectory-based mining has been done. Due to the uncertainties of RFID data, it is difﬁcult to get the complete trajectory for all the objects. This still remains a challenging problem that has not really been investigated.   Distributed RFID data mining. Most large-scale RFID systems are distributed. It is necessary to enable the mining across different organizations which leads to several challenges. First, we have the problem of exchanging large volumes of data. Due to the network cost, it is inefﬁcient to send over all the data. The second issue is about the location where mining should be done. This will require careful load balancing solutions to be in place.  7.5 Summary  RFID promises to revolutionize the way we track items in supply chain, retail store, and asset management applications. In this chapter, we have provided an introduc- tion of its basic concepts and we have highlighted the challenges that currently need to be addressed in the RFID system architecture. We presented the state-of-art re- search results on RFID data processing, data management and mining. We also propose some problems which are suitable topics for future exploratory research, including:   Uncertainties management. Uncertainty is a natural characteristic of RFID tech- nology, not only in the data themselves, but also in the way they are processed. Modeling uncertainties and managing them are important and interesting prob- lems.   Trajectory management. Most data models are object-based. Trajectory is treated as second-class citizen. However, trajectory is fundamental to implement tracking and tracing in RFID systems. We argue that more research needs to be done in this area.   Distributed data mining. Mining distributed RFID data streams is also needed because most RFID systems are distributed across several sites and are spread across various organizations. Data exchange and load balancing are two interest- ing issues that need to further investigations.   7 RFID: Opportunities and Challenges  127  Acknowledgements Quan Z.

Chapter 8 Energy Efﬁcient Routing in Wireless Sensor Networks  Faisal Karim Shaikh, Sherali Zeadally, and Farhan Siddiqui  8.1 Introduction  Increasingly, the notion of a widely inter-connected, adaptive and dynamic ubiq- uitous computing environment is being proposed for virtually all application do- mains. Wireless Sensor Networks  WSNs  represent a key enabling technique for the emerging ambient ubiquitous pervasive computing areas. The fusion of sensing and wireless communication has led to the emergence of WSNs. Recently, WSNs have been proposed for multiple applications, such as ﬁre detection [12, 15], object tracking [43] and environmental monitoring [3]. Accordingly, the commercial use of WSNs is expected to increase dramatically in the near future.  Generally, a WSN comprises a large number of static sensor nodes with low processing, limited power capabilities and often communicating over short-range unreliable radio links as shown in Fig. 8.1. Additionally, sensor nodes have limited storage capacity, batteries and multiple on-board sensors that can take readings such as temperature, level of humidity, and accelerometers. Sensor nodes are deployed in an ad-hoc manner and cooperate with each other to form a wireless sensor network. Since the communication range of sensor nodes is limited, hop-by-hop communica- tion is often adopted by sensor nodes to exchange data. Typically, a powerful base  F.K.

Fig. 8.1 A wireless sensor network system  station termed a sink, is also an integral part of a WSN. The sink mediates between the sensor nodes and the applications running on a WSN. WSNs offer signiﬁcant advances over traditional wired sensing networks and can be applied to many appli- cation scenarios because of their ﬂexibility, cost-effectiveness, and ease of deploy- ment.  Many WSN applications are data centric, i.e., they are deployed to interact with the physical environment and report on the phenomenon of interest to the user via the sink. Therefore, the main goal of a WSN is to support the delivery of data gen- erated in response to the sensed phenomenon towards the sink along the path made available via routing protocols. As the communication over radio is a dominant energy consuming operation [2] in WSNs, it is highly desirable that the routing protocols be energy-efﬁcient. The various WSN applications can be classiﬁed as delay sensitive and delay tolerant. Delay sensitive applications are those which do not compromise on latency requirements such as event detection and tracking ap- plications. In contrast, delay tolerant applications may tolerate some delays in data reception [24]. Energy-efﬁcient routing protocols exploit application requirements   8 Energy Efﬁcient Routing in Wireless Sensor Networks  133  Fig. 8.2 A wireless sensor network system with mobile nodes  in order to save precious energy of the sensor nodes resulting in extended lifetime of the network [34].  Routing protocols for delay sensitive applications tend to reduce the number of transmissions in order to save energy. For delay tolerant applications routing proto- cols make use of duty cycling  sleep when there is no work to do  or exploit mobility in the network.  The traditional WSN model is based on the assumption that the network is dense, so that sensor nodes and the sink can communicate with each other through multihop paths. Consequently, mobility is not considered as an option and in most cases the sensors are assumed to be static. More recently, mobility has also been introduced to WSNs [21, 23, 40] as shown in Fig. 8.2. As nodes are mobile, a dense deployment of sensor nodes in order to reach the sink may not be a requirement. In fact, mobile nodes can cope with the network coverage problem due to inherent perturbations and connect the isolated regions. Moreover, mobile nodes can visit sensor nodes in the network and collect data directly through single-hop transmissions. This re- duces contention, collisions, and message loss, resulting in maximizing the energy efﬁciency.  We focus on the data routing techniques emphasizing on the energy they consume and how they extend the lifetime of the network. Moreover, we provide a compar- ison among the routing protocols in order to help researchers and practitioners to select or blend some of them according to their needs.  The rest of the chapter is organized as follows. Section 8.2 discusses the vari- ous issues which consume energy in wireless sensor networking environments. In   134  F.K. Shaikh et al.  Sect. 8.3, we present a comprehensive taxonomy of energy-efﬁcient routing proto- cols. Sections 8.4 and 8.5 describe recent energy-efﬁcient protocols for supporting delay sensitive and delay tolerant applications. In Sect. 8.6, we discuss future needs and opportunities for energy savings in traditional WSNs and Mobile WSNs. Fi- nally, Sect. 8.7 concludes the chapter.  8.2 Energy Consumption in Wireless Sensor Network  Before discussing the classiﬁcation of energy-efﬁcient routing protocols, it is worth presenting the factors which drain the most of the energy from sensor nodes which will ultimately reduce the overall WSN lifetime.  Generally, a sensor node includes three basic subsystems  i  a sensing subsys- tem to acquire data from the environment,  ii  a processing subsystem for local data processing and storage, and  iii  a wireless communication subsystem for data transmission. Additionally, a power source  usually with limited energy budget , i.e., a battery, is used to power up the sensor nodes for performing the desired ac- tions. Furthermore, it should be noted that it is merely impossible to recharge the batteries due to the deployment in difﬁcult and hostile terrains or due to the large number of quantities deployed in the environment. Despite all these constraints, the applications running on WSNs require the sensor nodes to be functional to fulﬁll their requirements for several months or even years. These requirements motivate the need to extend the lifetime of WSN by prolonging the life of its sensor nodes.  Let us consider a scenario where the WSN is required to monitor the forest to avoid or minimize the risk of ﬁre hazards. Hundreds of sensor nodes will be re- quired to monitor the vast area of the forest. Accordingly, the farthest node in the forest will be many hops away from the sink. As the number of hops increases we will require more transmissions for the data to reach to the sink. Among the three subsystem of a sensor node the communication subsystem consumes more energy on average than the processing subsystem [2]. Generally, the sensing subsystem consumes a lower amount of energy depending on the type of sensor used  e.g., for temperature, light etc. . However, in some cases the sensor nodes may consume a substantial amount of energy  e.g., when using a Global Positioning System  GPS  module [26] . Accordingly, there are various mechanisms that can be implemented to either consume less energy or to provide more energy by scavenging from the environment. In any case, energy consumption is critical and is a key issue in WSNs that must be addressed.  Since the communication subsystem consumes more energy many approaches proposed in the literature aim to minimize the communication cost. Some of these approaches include: the use of in-network processing, location awareness or to send data when needed to reduce the communication cost while others exploit duty cy- cling and put the nodes in sleep mode whenever there is no task to be performed. Other approaches use mobility if available in the network to further reduce the en- ergy consumption by not allowing the sensor nodes to directly send the data to the   8 Energy Efﬁcient Routing in Wireless Sensor Networks  135  sink but by moving mobile sensor nodes toward the sensor nodes in order to col- lect the data. Referring to the forest monitoring scenario we describe how we can save energy during transmissions. Generally, all the sensor nodes need to report to the sink periodically. In this case the sensor nodes farthest in the forest drain more energy from the network because nodes on the way have to send their own data and forward the data from other sensor nodes as well. The situation becomes worse for nodes near to the sink resulting in an imbalance of energy in the network. To address this imbalance one proposed solution is to use multiple disjoint paths which lead to a balanced energy consumption. Another proposed mechanism requires that the sen- sor nodes do not send data periodically. Instead, the sensor nodes start sending the data towards the sink [37] when an event occurs  e.g., when a ﬁre is detected in the forest . In this mechanism the energy depletion is directly proportional to the num- ber of events happening in the forest. It is also found that the generated data have spatial and temporal correlations [41]. Some mechanisms [17, 30] exploit these cor- relations and make clusters within the forest based on some criteria. In this scenario, instead of all nodes from the farthest areas sending data to the sink, they will send data to some speciﬁed cluster head  e.g., trees of same kind may form a cluster . After some processing only the cluster head will send data to the sink instead of all sensor nodes in the vicinity thereby saving signiﬁcant amounts of energy. Energy can also be saved by not allowing the sensor nodes to send data periodically but whenever the application needs the data it will send the query to the network  e.g., the humidity level at tree number 120 . In this case, only sensor nodes which can respond to the query will respond back . In addition, the energy drain is related to the number of queries made by the application. Location information can also be used to save energy in WSNs. Instead of ﬁnding paths to the sink the sensor nodes know where the sink is located and send the data in that direction  e.g., the sensor nodes of some tree send data in a northern direction .  To further save energy when there are no data to send the sensor nodes may go into a sleep mode. Despite the fact that sensor nodes are not sending the data, being in active state consumes energy. Therefore, duty cycling is now getting attention by researchers. However, if the sensor nodes require to sleep and wake up frequently then the energy savings may not be optimal since letting the sensor node to go in sleep mode and awakening it back also requires energy. Still, in this case, once the data are generated they have to traverse the network to reach the sink.  Mobility in WSNs can also be utilized to reduce the energy consumption pro- vided mobility incurs low overheads. Generally, mobility incurs more energy ex- penditure on the mobile node, i.e., motors and other hardware require more energy. The main assumption by mobile WSNs is that the mobile nodes do not have energy constraints. They traverse the network and return back to the sink where they can be recharged because at the sink we do not suffer from limited resources. Moreover, the mobility may be inherent in the network  e.g., moving people or guards in the forest . Using our forest example, the sensor nodes on the trees gather the environ- mental data and wait for the mobile node to come in contact with them. Once the sensor node encounters a mobile node it will transfer its data to it. After traversing the forest, the mobile node comes into contact with the sink where it ofﬂoad the data,   136  F.K. Shaikh et al.  saving energy. This approach needs the sensor nodes to be aware of the existence of the mobile node. Next, we classify current energy-efﬁcient routing protocols that have been proposed for WSNs.  8.3 Classiﬁcation of Energy Efﬁcient Routing Protocols  Energy is a very scarce resource in WSNs and most of the times WSNs are used for applications where access is either not necessary or not possible in order to monitor or sense vicinity conditions. The energy resource could be saved by avoiding the transmission of redundant user data or may be by following the same routes or not to transmit receive anything when not required to do so. Therefore, it is not desirable to use sensor nodes in a way that they need to be recharged frequently. To address this aforementioned issue, various routing protocols have been designed to utilize the energy resource efﬁciently.  Typically, WSNs utilize intrinsic sensor node redundancy for assuring proper network connectivity such that all sensor nodes can communicate with the sink in a multihop fashion. However, the redundancy of sensor nodes comes at a cost. Redun- dant nodes generate correlated information and deliver the same information from multiple sensor nodes rapidly depletes the energy resources in the network. Being an ad-hoc environment, WSN is subject to a wide range of operational perturbations af- fecting the delivery of information to the sink. Along with node and communication perturbations, environmental disturbances also contribute to the loss of information. New routing protocols that take into consideration these perturbations in WSNs have emerged in the last few years. These proposed routing protocols consider the inher- ent features of WSNs along with the application requirements. An efﬁcient routing protocol will improve network lifetime and supports efﬁcient power utilization. Due to energy constraints, ﬁnding and maintaining routes in WSNs is a core issue be- cause the sensor node status  e.g., failure, malfunction, sleep or relocation  along the route may change, resulting in frequent topological changes. Thus, the routing protocols employ different routing mechanisms, suitable for WSNs, to minimize energy consumption. Accordingly, we classify the current energy-efﬁcient routing protocols for two major classes of WSN applications, i.e., delay sensitive routing protocols and delay tolerant routing protocols as shown in Fig. 8.3. We further clas- sify energy-efﬁcient routing protocols for delay sensitive routing as reliable routing and best effort routing and for delay tolerant routing as routing based on duty cycles and routing for mobile WSNs.  Energy-Efﬁcient Best Effort Routing The protocols in this class ﬁnd available paths from source sensor nodes to the sink on a best-effort basis. The protocols in this class can be further classiﬁed as follows.   Flat Routing: All the sensor nodes in WSN have the same role, i.e., they can be either source or routers.   8 Energy Efﬁcient Routing in Wireless Sensor Networks  137  Fig. 8.3 Taxonomy of energy-efﬁcient routing in wireless sensor networks    Clustering-based Routing: The routing protocols in this class organize the sensor nodes in a group or cluster to achieve load balancing and energy efﬁciency.   Location-based Routing: The sensor nodes take advantage of the available posi- tion information in order to send data in an energy-efﬁcient manner.  Energy-Efﬁcient Reliable Routing Under this class the protocols are more re- silient to route failures either by achieving load balancing of the paths or by re- transmitting the undelivered data. The sensor nodes may suffer from the overhead of maintaining routing tables and other parameters. Energy-efﬁcient reliable routing can be further classiﬁed as follows:   Multipath Routing: The protocols in this class exploit the redundant paths in the networks to deliver the data towards the sink.   Event-to-Sink Routing: In this class, the protocols take advantage of the inherent spatial correlation of the data in forwarding them to the sink.  Energy-Efﬁcient Routing Based on Duty Cycling To save energy, the protocols in this class put the radio in the  low-power  sleep mode whenever communication is not required. Ideally, the radio should be switched off when there is no more data to send receive, and should be activated when new data become available. This mechanism of switching the radio on and off is referred to as Duty Cycling.  Energy-Efﬁcient Routing for Mobile WSNs Mobility is exploited in this class to save energy. The sensor nodes discover the mobile node in their vicinity and transfer the data to it instead of sending them to the sink via neighbors in a multihop manner. The mobility in the network can be either controlled or random. This class can be further divided into two categories as follows.   Plane Routing: In this class the mobile nodes move to collect data from the static nodes. There is no architecture formed by the static nodes.   Hierarchical Routing: The mobile nodes move toward cluster heads  a leader among the set of sensor nodes  for data transmission purposes.   138  F.K. Shaikh et al.  We compare the energy-efﬁcient routing protocols of different classes based on following performance metrics.   Path Type: The routing path type refers to the methods used by the protocols to ﬁnd a path from source sensor nodes to the sink. Thus, this path may be the shortest path, reliable path, energy aware path etc.   Periodic Messages: The periodic message represents the messages exchanged be- tween the sensor nodes to know about their presence.   Efﬁciency: Efﬁciency of the protocol refers to the total number of messages ex- changed in delivering the data from the source sensor node to the sink. We cate- gorize this metric relative to the protocols in their respective class as low, medium and high. Low refers to having a higher number of messages exchanged and high means a lower number of messages exchanged.   Type: This metric corresponds to the way protocol behaves, i.e., either the pro- tocol is reactive or proactive in nature. A reactive routing protocol is one which ﬁnd routes when there is a need of sending the user data. In contrast, a proactive routing protocol ﬁnds the route in advance.  8.4 Energy Efﬁcient Routing for Delay Sensitive Applications  8.4.1 Energy Efﬁcient Best Effort Routing for Wireless Sensor  Networks  In this class, the protocols do not provide any guarantees for reliability and focus only on how to optimize the energy constraint. The protocols in this class can be further classiﬁed as Flat, Clustering and Location-based routing protocols. There are many protocols [35] in this class. Next, we present an overview of some of these important protocols.  8.4.1.1 Energy Efﬁcient Flat Routing  Flat routing protocols are those protocols that keep the same criteria for all the nodes in a network, i.e., either source nodes or nodes forwarding the user data. The routing protocols in this category provide a route for each sensor node towards the sink. Table 8.1 compares the Flat routing protocols and techniques for delay sensitive WSN applications.  Generally, there are two types of routing protocol in WSNs, i.e., proactive and reactive. The proactive routing protocols ﬁnd the routes in advance before the user data  the data required by the application  are sent to the sink. The routes are built by exchanging the control data  the data required to update the routing information  between the sensor nodes periodically in order to overcome topological changes. Thus, in proactive routing there is an inherent loss of energy due to these periodic   8 Energy Efﬁcient Routing in Wireless Sensor Networks  139  Table 8.1 Comparison of energy-efﬁcient ﬂat routing protocols  Protocol  Path type  Periodic messages Efﬁciency Type  Based on Dijkstra [32, 33] optimal TORA [6] shortest best energy E-TORA [47] SEER [13] remaining energy HELLO  routing table No No  low medium high medium  proactive reactive reactive reactive proactive  updates. The reactive routing protocols ﬁnd the routes when the user data are avail- able for sending to the sink. Before sending the user data the sensor nodes try to ﬁnd the routes towards sink by using ﬂooding or related techniques. In reactive routing as well there is energy consumption involved by design. The different energy-efﬁcient routing protocols try to optimize the utilization of energy in the network.  To establish routes in WSNs some earlier approaches [32, 33] proposed proac- tive routing using traditional mechanisms from wired networks. Neighbor nodes ex- change routing tables to ﬁnd the whole topology of WSN. Once the nodes get topol- ogy information any shortest path routing algorithm such as Dijkstra’s or Bellman– Ford algorithms can be used to compute the route. The user data transmission is very robust and energy-efﬁcient since the routes are calculated in an optimal man- ner. But gathering the whole topology information on nodes require lot of commu- nication steps. Furthermore, storing and processing the large routing tables require high memory and processing capabilities leading to high energy consumption. As a result, traditional routing protocols are inefﬁcient for WSNs, where many sensor nodes are deployed.  Temporarily Ordered Routing Algorithm  TORA  [6] sends the routing updates only when there is a topological change instead of periodically updating the routing tables. In TORA, each sensor node knows its height and the height of its directly connected neighbors by using initial ﬂooding by the sink. During ﬂooding the sink includes the hop number in the control data and the receiving nodes update their height, increment the hop number and forward it to the other nodes. After the ini- tial ﬂooding the sensor nodes know their heights in the network. The control data exchange is localized to a very small set of nodes where the topological change oc- curs, thus optimizing the energy efﬁciency. Each sensor node classiﬁes its neighbors as upstream or downstream based on whether the height of its neighbor is greater or less than its own height. When a sensor node gets user data, it always sends them to a downstream neighbor, i.e., towards the sink. In [47], the extension of the conventional TORA protocol called Energy-aware Temporarily Ordered Rout- ing Algorithm  ETORA  is proposed. With TORA, the power level at each node is not considered. TORA follows the route with the least number of hops but if there are more data to deliver, the nodes will soon drain all their energy. ETORA basi- cally addresses this problem by incorporating a strategy not to use the same route if it is being used frequently. This way the energy consumption at each node can be minimized thereby extending the lifetime of the network.   140  F.K. Shaikh et al.  Table 8.2 Comparison of energy-efﬁcient clustering-based routing protocols  Protocol  Path type  Periodic messages  Efﬁciency  Type  LEACH [17] LEACH-C [16] TEEN [30] APTEEN [31] ELCH [27] DHAC [29] SHPER [20]  direct direct best best maximum energy best energy-efﬁcient  No No No No No HELLO No  medium low medium low medium medium high  proactive proactive reactive reactive proactive proactive proactive  Simple Energy Efﬁcient Routing  SEER  [13] routing protocol aims to optimize the network lifetime. SEER uses source-initiated communication, along with event- driven reporting to reduce the number of user data messages. Routing decisions are based on the distance to the sink, i.e., hop count  height  as well as on remain- ing battery energy levels of the sensor nodes on the path toward the sink. When a node’s energy falls below a certain threshold, it sends an energy message to notify its neighbors about its remaining energy. The sink node periodically sends a HELLO broadcast message to update the neighbor tables of the sensor nodes.  8.4.1.2 Energy Efﬁcient Clustering-Based Routing  Table 8.2 summarizes the comparison of different clustering-based energy-efﬁcient routing protocols.  The Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy  LEACH  protocol is a hier- archical protocol that was proposed in [14, 17]. There are two phases of LEACH protocol.  i  The setup phase when clusters are formed and the cluster head  CH  selection is made by the sensor nodes.  ii  The steady phase includes sending of the data from CHs to the sink. The CH aggregate and send the data to the sink. By using a stochastic algorithm each sensor node ﬁnds whether it will become a CH. Sensor node cannot become a CH for P rounds  where P is the desired percentage of CHs  if it becomes a CH for one time. The energy consumption is balanced by ro- tating the CHs thus leading to a longer lifetime of the network. However, the major drawback of LEACH is that it uses single-hop routing where each node can transmit directly to CH and the sink. Therefore, for large networks this scheme will not be effective. Also, dynamic clustering may cause more energy consumption because of extra overhead of cluster formation in each round.  Unlike LEACH where nodes conﬁgure their clusters themselves, the Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy Centralized  LEACH-C  protocol uses the sink to setup clusters [16]. Initially the sink collects information  location and energy level  of each sensor node in the network. Using this information, the sink chooses clus- ters to minimize the energy required to transmit the data by sensor nodes to their respective CHs. LEACH-C’s main advantage is the global coordination among the   8 Energy Efﬁcient Routing in Wireless Sensor Networks  141  nodes which enables the number of CHs to be equal compared to LEACH where number of CHs is dynamic leading to unbalance energy in the network. The dis- advantage of LEACH-C is that it is again a single hop protocol since in multihop scenario gathering the information on the sink require lot of energy expenditure.  For WSNs subjected to sudden environmental changes  such as temperature , the Threshold sensitive Energy Efﬁcient sensor Network  TEEN  protocol [30] has been proposed. The WSN architecture is hierarchical in which closer nodes form clusters and this process is repeated at the second level until the sink is reached. In this architecture, each CH broadcasts to its members the hard threshold  i.e., the threshold value of the sensed attribute  and the soft threshold  i.e., a small change in the value of sensed attribute . TEEN achieves energy efﬁciency by exploiting the threshold values. Whenever the sensed attribute parameter has reached its hard threshold value, the node starts transmitting the sensed data. In other case the node remain idle and only senses the environment and saving the energy.  The Adaptive Threshold sensitive Energy Efﬁcient sensor Network  APTEEN  [31] protocol is an improved version of TEEN. It periodically collects data and reacts to time-critical events. After the cluster formation, the CHs broadcast the environmental attributes of interest, the threshold values and transmission schedule to all the nodes in the cluster. Since the environmental data have correlation it is wasteful to forward all the received data from the sensor nodes of the cluster to the sink. Therefore, after cluster formation the data aggregation is performed by the CHs, which saves much energy by sending only the aggregated data. APTEEN is more energy-efﬁcient than TEEN but it is more complex and has higher latency due to aggregation delays.  Extending Lifetime of Cluster Head  ELCH  [27] is yet another cluster-based algorithm. However, the cluster heads are decided on the basis of mutual consent of neighbors through an election process. This protocol has two phases. The ﬁrst phase is the setup procedure when the clusters and the CHs are formed by an election process. The most voted sensor becomes the CH. The second phase is the steady- state phase where the election results are considered to set up clusters, forward user data to CHs and transmitting from CHs to the sink is carried out. The clusters consist of CH and sensor nodes located in a radius less than the radio radius of CH. Then, the Time Division Multiple Access  TDMA  is used for each cluster member to transmit data to the CH. In addition, each CH maintains a table with maximum power for each cluster member. Once the clusters have been organized, the CHs form a multihop routing backbone towards sink. The data are directly sent to CH by its cluster members. ELCH minimizes the transmission energy and the network can be more balanced in terms of energy efﬁciency.  The Distributed Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering  DHAC  [29] approach uses a hierarchical clustering algorithm in which each node needs to have knowl- edge of its immediate neighbors that are one hop away. In the ﬁrst step each node in the WSN will consider itself as a CH and exchanges a control data HELLO mes- sage with its immediate neighbors. After this step, DHAC forms clusters based on the degree of resemblance  can be either quantitative  e.g., location  or qualitative  e.g., connectivity   among the sensor nodes. Clusters formed through this process   142  F.K. Shaikh et al.  Table 8.3 Comparison of energy-efﬁcient location-based routing protocols  Protocol  Path type  Periodic messages Efﬁciency Type  best  GEAR [48] SELAR [28] maximum energy MERR [53] minimum energy consumption No GREES [49] minimum energy consumption HELLO  HELLO HELLO  low medium high high  proactive proactive proactive proactive reactive  can have a large number of nodes inside one cluster. Consequently, after cluster for- mation, the cluster tree is modiﬁed so that a predeﬁned number can be set. A cluster may also have a lower number of nodes and in this case a cluster merging operation is performed. DHAC chooses the lower id node between the two nodes that join the cluster as CH. After the clusters are set up, data forwarding is executed.  The Scaling Hierarchical Power Efﬁcient Routing  SHPER  [20] protocol as- sumes that the sink is able to transmit with high power to communicate with all the sensor nodes in the WSN because of its unlimited power supply. The operation of SHPER protocol consists of two phases. In the ﬁrst phase the sink broadcasts a TDMA schedule and requests the sensor nodes to report themselves. The sensor nodes respond back to the sink via control data which include hop count and their residual energy value. Accordingly, the relative distances among the sensor nodes are identiﬁed by the sink. After that the sink randomly elects CHs by taking into account the residual energy of nodes and broadcasts their information along with energy-efﬁcient path information to route user data. This leads to energy balance and the power depletion among the nodes is performed more evenly. In the steady state phase the CH forwards the user data via an energy-efﬁcient path to the sink.  8.4.1.3 Energy Efﬁcient Location-Based Routing  Location-based routing relies on some type of coordinate system for reference. The coordinate system can be ﬁxed, i.e., accurate locations are known  e.g., GPS  or relative. Next we present and compare  Table 8.3  recently proposed energy-efﬁcient location-based routing protocols.  The Geographic and Energy Aware Routing  GEAR  [48] protocol uses energy aware and geographically close neighbor selection heuristics to route user data to- ward the sink. In GEAR each sensor node knows its own location and its remaining energy level, and its neighbors’ location and their remaining energy levels through a control message, i.e., HELLO message. The two main characteristics of this proto- col include:  i  GEAR selects the node closer to the sink when selecting a next-hop node among all neighbors.  ii  When all neighbors are further away, there is a hole. In this case GEAR selects a neighbor which minimizes the cost to cross the hole. The advantage is that GEAR always attempts to balance the energy among the net- work nodes leading to an increase in the lifetime of the network.   8 Energy Efﬁcient Routing in Wireless Sensor Networks  143  The Scalable Energy-efﬁcient Location Aided Routing  SELAR  [28] is a com- bination of energy-based as well as location-based routing. In the ﬁrst step, the sink ﬂood its location information to its neighbor nodes. After the sink has ﬂooded all the nodes, they in turn ﬂood the neighboring nodes with their location and energy information. The process is repeated until all nodes receive the location information of the sink and that of their neighbors. To save energy, SELAR exchanges control messages  HELLO messages  among one hop neighbors only. In addition to that, user data are sent by the sensor nodes by ﬁnding candidate neighbor nodes  with the highest level of energy  in their forwarding zone, where zone is the area formed by the angle α in the direction of the sink and the coverage area of the sending node. The advantage of this protocol is that it always routes the information through the nodes that have the highest energy. The disadvantage is that this protocol is not well suited for dynamic network topology changes.  The Minimum Energy Relay Routing  MERR  [53] protocol calculates the dis- tance between two nodes that are transmitting information. This distance is cal- culated based on the energy consumed on a particular link. When the next hop is decided, the transmitting power is regulated in order to use the minimum energy required for the signal to reach the sensor node. In MERR each sensor node ﬁnds a neighbor node within its maximum transmission range which is closest to the sink. Once the next hop is selected, the sensor node adjusts its transmission power such that the next hop sensor node just receive it. The energy consumption can be min- imized by adjusting the transmission power. MERR performs well when nodes are following a linear topology and they send their information to a single sink. The disadvantage is that it considers its adjacent neighbor for routing and if many sensor nodes are in the vicinity, a lot of energy can be wasted.  Geographic Routing with Environmental Energy Supply  GREES  [49] com- bines geographic and energy-efﬁcient routing by considering the lossy wireless channel with the renewal capability. In GREES, each sensor node locally main- tains its one hop neighbor’s information  i.e., the neighbor location, residual en- ergy, energy harvesting rate, energy consuming rate, and wireless link quality  using HELLO messages. The sensor node forwards the user data progressively towards the sink, while at the same time it tries to balance the energy consumption across all its forwarding neighbor nodes.  8.4.1.4 Discussion  Tables 8.1, 8.2, 8.3 compare the various routing protocols in the best effort routing class for delay sensitive applications.  We observe that for ﬂat routing protocols, E-TORA and SEER are more energy- efﬁcient than the traditional and TORA protocols. Flat routing views WSNs as tra- ditional wired networks where each sensor node requires a path toward the sink. Generally the periodic messages are exchanged to maintain the connectivity across the neighbor nodes which increases the energy consumption by the network.   144  F.K. Shaikh et al.  We observe that maintaining routes for each and every node in the network is cumbersome and not much energy-efﬁcient. Thus, clustering protocols divide the network into clusters to balance the energy consumption. We note that periodic mes- sages are not normally exchanged for routing purposes in WSNs but are used for cluster information and maintenance operations. ELCH and SHPER are the most energy-efﬁcient protocols in this category. LEACH and LEACH-C are good pro- tocols and provide insights how clustering is achieved in WSNs but unfortunately they are not scalable and provide only single hop communication. On the other hand TEEN and APTEEN achieves energy efﬁciency by aggregating the data from sensor nodes at the Cluster Head  CH  and forwarding only the aggregated data.  For location-based routing we observe that MERR and GREES outperform SE- LAR an GEAR in terms of energy efﬁciency. Periodic messages are normally ex- changed by location-based protocols to ﬁnd the location of neighboring nodes and maintain network connectivity. External sensors may be utilized but they tend to be costly and may require more processing at the nodes which can lead to energy drain.  8.4.2 Energy Efﬁcient Reliable Routing for Wireless Sensor  Networks  As the name suggests, the protocols in this category are robust to link failures and ultimately guarantee reliable data routing. Link failures can be mitigated by satis- fying certain requirements such as following routes with low delays or routes that consume the lowest energy or routes where a minimal number of retransmissions occur. This category can be further broken down into multipath-based protocols and Event to Sink  Ev2S  protocols. A brief description of these routing strategies is given in the following sections.  8.4.2.1 Energy Efﬁcient Multipath Routing  Multipath routing is a robust technique and avoids route failures by rerouting us- ing load balancing [44] techniques. Multipath protocols perform well compared to single-path protocols because of their robustness against node failures, congestion and their ability to cope with latency with low overheads. Several multipath routing protocols have been designed in order to guarantee reliable data transfer [35]. In this work, we focus on and compare the major techniques  Fig. 8.4  adapted by the routing protocols to achieve energy efﬁciency  Table 8.4 .  Overlap Multipath  OM : Usually protocols employing the OM technique are reactive in nature, i.e., the route is created when user data need to be transferred. Sensor nodes periodically exchange control data  including energy  among neigh- bors to maintain network connectivity. Each sensor node selects a set of multiple neighbor nodes based on their energy budget. Once the user data are available for sending, the sensor node selects a forwarding node from the set. The selection can   8 Energy Efﬁcient Routing in Wireless Sensor Networks  145  Table 8.4 Comparison of energy-efﬁcient multipath routing approaches  Technique  Path type  Periodic messages  Efﬁciency  Type  Overlap multipath Funnel multipath Disjoint multipath Hierarchical multipath  energy-efﬁcient any energy-efﬁcient energy-efﬁcient  Yes Yes Yes Yes  medium medium low low  reactive reactive proactive proactive  be made based on different criteria such as round robin, nodes having energy above the threshold etc. It should be noted that for every user data packet the new sensor node is selected and the packet is uni-casted to the selected sensor node  Fig. 8.4 a   which ensures a balanced energy consumption in the vicinity of the sensor node sending the user data. The resulting paths may overlap each other. This technique exploits the node’s lifetime to achieve energy efﬁciency. The Label-based Multipath Routing  LMR  [18] protocol uses the OM approach. The major drawback of OM is that the path may deviate and take longer routes to reach to the sink which will unnecessarily use energy from the underlying WSN.  Funnel Multipath  FM : To overcome the drawback of OM the FM approach associates a width of funnel while forwarding the user data beyond which the data will not be propagated. The funnel is the virtual corridor between the source sensor node and the sink  Fig. 8.4 b  . The sensor node broadcasts the user data to a set of nodes  usually with high energy budget  in the direction of sink and increment the funnel counter. Once the data reach the sensor nodes where the funnel counter becomes equal to the width associated by the source sensor node, the data will not be forwarded further. At this point, data will ﬂow along the funnel by using multiple paths. Various protocols  such as GRAdient Broadcast  GRAB  [46], Multi-Path and Multi-SPEED  MMSPEED  [8], Directional Controlled Fusion  DCF  [7]  in WSN use similar techniques to achieve energy efﬁciency during the routing process.  Disjoint Multipath  DM : Although FM saves unnecessary energy drain but in cases where sensor nodes have to send more data, the sensor nodes along the funnel will run out of energy faster leading to energy imbalance in the WSN. To over- come this drawback, DM techniques have been proposed  Fig. 8.4 c  . Generally DM is adapted in a proactive manner and the multiple paths are kept signiﬁcantly apart such that they will not interfere with each other and balance the energy across the network. The DM can be created by the sink having global knowledge of the network [10] or in a distributed manner.  Hierarchical Multipath  HM : Another mechanism to create disjoint paths is to divide the WSN into clusters [45, 51] and make the user data ﬂow across different clusters.  8.4.2.2 Energy Efﬁcient Event-to-Sink Routing  Unlike multipath routing where multiple routes are maintained, the Ev2S routing protocols exploit spatial redundancy caused by the occurrence of an event in the   146  F.K. Shaikh et al.  Fig. 8.4 Multipath routing strategies to prolong wireless sensor network lifetime  network. Generally these protocols help the existing routing protocols to be more energy-efﬁcient by reducing the number of sensor nodes or data reporting the same event. Table 8.5 compares the Ev2S reliable routing protocols.  The Event to Sink Reliable Transport  ESRT  [37] technique achieves the energy efﬁciency and reliability objectives by adjusting the data rate of source nodes to   8 Energy Efﬁcient Routing in Wireless Sensor Networks  147  Table 8.5 Comparison of energy-efﬁcient event-to-sink-based routing approaches  Protocol  Path type  Periodic messages  Efﬁciency  Type  ESRT [37] STCP [19] RBC [50] GIT [42]  any path any path shortest path reliable path  No No No HELLO  high medium medium high  reactive proactive reactive proactive  avoid congestion. ESRT assumes that the sink requires a certain number of messages for an event within a speciﬁed time interval. The message loss is assumed to be the result of congestion. At the end of a time interval, the sink makes a decision based on number of messages received and the congestion state of the network. ESRT relies on the fact that at least some messages from source nodes will arrive at the sink to report the event happening in the network. When the sink receives a lower number of messages than expected with the congestion bit set, it will request the source nodes to decrease their data rates since more data will cause further congestion leading to higher energy consumption.  Yogesh et al. proposed a Sensor Transmission Control Protocol  STCP  [19] for WSNs. Before sending the data the sensor nodes establish sessions with the sink. During the session establishment the sensor node informs the sink about the number and type of ﬂows, the data rate, energy, and the reliability requirement. The sink stores this information and sends an acknowledgment  ACK  message back to the sensor nodes. If the sink does not receive the data from the sensor nodes within the estimated time, it will send a Negative ACK. The time estimation for STCP requires clock synchronization between the sink and the source nodes.  The Reliable Bursty Convergecast  RBC  [50] technique is designed for transfer- ring a burst of messages from the source nodes to a sink. The RBC reliability design is based on a window-less block ACK scheme and an Implicit ACK scheme which enables continuous message forwarding in the presence of message and acknowl- edgment loss. RBC achieves energy efﬁciency by avoiding collisions by adapting proper schedules for transmission.  The Generic Information Transport  GIT  [42] technique considers various ap- plication requirements and evolvable network conditions in WSNs. GIT delivers the user data by utilizing a probabilistic transmission approach to ensure tunable reliability along with energy efﬁciency. GIT is distributed in nature and only re- quires knowledge about one hop neighbors. When data need to be sent periodically, GIT uses a shortest single path using a routing tree which is established proactively. Along the path, data are distributed probabilistically to meet the application require- ments. When multiple sensor nodes have similar data to send, energy efﬁciency is achieved by selecting a subset of sensor nodes along the perimeter of the event  which are near to the sink  instead of all nodes sending the data towards the sink.   148  8.4.2.3 Discussion  F.K. Shaikh et al.  Tables 8.4 and 8.5 compare different protocols for energy-efﬁcient reliable routing class.  For multipath routing we observe that generally the approaches take care of en- ergy efﬁciency  OM and FM  and also balance the energy usage across the net- work  DM and HM . The multipath protocols exchange periodic messages in order to have knowledge of the neighbors for forwarding the data. If there are multiple nodes sending the data  i.e., sending ﬂow  towards the sink it is difﬁcult to man- age the multiple paths because they may interfere with other ongoing transmissions. If the number of ﬂows is low and data ﬂows are generated at different intervals, multipath routing is a good choice.  For Ev2S protocols we observe that ESRT, STCP and RBC do not exchange pe- riodic messages making them energy-efﬁcient. For Ev2S protocols, we observe that STCP and RBC are not as energy-efﬁcient as ESRT. Despite the fact that GIT ex- changes periodic messages, it still performs well because of its capability of choos- ing reliable paths with probabilistic forwarding which helps to minimize energy consumption. ESRT is also good candidate because it takes any path to reach the sink and fulﬁll application reliability requirements in an energy-efﬁcient manner.  8.5 Energy Efﬁcient Routing for Delay Tolerant Applications  8.5.1 Energy Efﬁcient Duty Cycle-Based Routing for Wireless  Sensor Networks  To save energy in WSNs duty cycling has been exploited by routing protocols for delay tolerant applications. Sensor nodes can perform duty cycling as per some schedule or on demand when some user data need to be delivered. Next, we present various protocols which utilize duty cycling.  The idea behind on-demand approaches is that the sensor node should be awak- ened before the data arrive from the neighboring node. Generally, two different channels are used, i.e., a data channel  for normal data transfer  and a wakeup chan- nel. Table 8.6 compares the various approaches in this class.  The Sparse Topology and Energy Management  STEM  [39] protocol uses two different radios, one radio for data transfers and another radio to awake sensor nodes. At each sensor node, the wakeup radio is turned on periodically for a duration of Tact ive. When a node wants to communicate with its neighbor during Tact ive, it sends a stream of beacons using the wakeup channel. Once the beacon is received by the neighboring node it will turn on its data radio and will send an ACK on the wakeup channel.  In [38] the authors propose a variant of STEM  referred to as STEM-T  that uses a wakeup tone instead of a beacon. It should be noted that the wakeup tone  consist- ing of few bits  consumes less energy compared to sending beacons. In STEM-T all   8 Energy Efﬁcient Routing in Wireless Sensor Networks  149  Table 8.6 Comparison of energy-efﬁcient duty cycle-based routing approaches  Protocol  Path type  Periodic messages  Efﬁciency  Type  STEM [39] STEM-T [38] RTPM [11] schedule-based  any any any any  Beacons Tone No No  low medium high medium  reactive reactive reactive proactive  nodes in the neighborhood of the initiator are awakened by the tones. For forwarding the user data nodes having high energy are selected.  To minimize energy consumption by wakeup radios, a Radio-Triggered Power Management  RTPM  scheme is proposed in [11]. The basic idea of RTPM is to wake up a sensor node to use the energy contained in the wakeup messages  e.g., beacon or tones . A special hardware circuit is used to extract the energy from the beacons and trigger the node from sleep mode to awake mode.  Some scheduled duty cycling strategies require that all neighboring nodes wake up at the same time [5, 22] while some other strategies avoid the tight synchroniza- tion and allow each node to wakeup independently [36, 52]. When nodes are awak- ened synchronously, multiple paths between a source and a destination are possible. In contrast, when sensor nodes are awakened independently, the forwarding path may suffer high latency because the other sensor nodes along the path may not be available during the same time period.  8.5.1.1 Discussion  Table 8.6 presents an insight into duty cycle-based routing in WSNs. The routing protocols do not optimize routes based on energy consumption because of the com- mon assumption that energy is already saved by using duty cycle mechanisms. We also observe that when the data are sent on demand, i.e., by using reactive protocols, waking up nodes to forward the data is a problem. This leads to extra hardware to be embedded with sensor nodes  RTPM  or multiple radios to be employed  STEM, STEM-T . If nodes know the schedule to wakeup then it is possible to employ the proactive routing protocols for forwarding the data. We still need to investigate the tradeoffs between optimizing energy efﬁciency at the routing layer and the use of duty cycle mechanisms.  8.5.2 Energy Efﬁcient Routing for Mobile Wireless Sensor  Networks  Energy Savings during routing can be further achieved if mobility can be used in WSNs [23]. In a general scenario, sensor nodes send data towards the sink in a mul- tihop fashion. As the number of hops increases, the energy consumption increases   150  F.K. Shaikh et al.  Table 8.7 Comparison of energy-efﬁcient plane routing protocols for mobile WSN  Protocol  Path type  Periodic messages  Efﬁciency  Type  EARM [1] WEDAS [4]  maximum energy shortest minimum energy  No No  high medium  proactive reactive  too due to an increase in the number of transmissions to reach the sink. Alterna- tively, the source sensor nodes can store data and when they encounter the mobile node, they transfer the data to it in a single hop. Once the mobile node reaches the sink it ofﬂoads the data to it saving a lot of energy by having a lower number of transmissions. In some scenarios the mobility can be controlled whereas in other cases it may not be possible to do so. Next we discuss various protocols to support energy-efﬁcient routing toward a mobile node in mobile WSNs.  8.5.2.1 Energy Efﬁcient Plane Routing  The plane routing for mobile WSN mainly focus on direct delivery to mobile node or ﬁnding the nearest sensor node from where the mobile node can collect the data. Table 8.7 compares the plane routing for mobile WSNs.  The Energy-Aware Routing to Mobile gateway  EARM  protocol [1] is designed for Mobile WSN where the mobile node moves in stages on a linear path. Initially the EARM protocol calculates energy-efﬁcient routes to reach the mobile node in the network by any existing routing protocol in the WSN. Since, the mobile node is in continuous motion throughout the WSN, the routing paths are continuously updated on a best effort basis in an attempt to minimize routing overheads. If a mobile node goes out of reach, the nodes increase their transmission power to enable a higher transmission range. However, if the mobile node goes beyond reach, then routes are scaled with the help of old neighboring nodes and making them their immediate forwarders until acceptable overheads reach a certain limit. Otherwise, rerouting is a performed.  The Weighted Entropy Data Dissemination  WEDAS  protocol [4] is based on an information-theoretic approach. WEDAS consists of forwarders which are selected between the source nodes and a mobile node by estimating  a  the remaining energy at sensor nodes and  b  the position of the mobile node. The parameters  such as energy and position of mobile node  are estimated and tracked to ﬁnd out how they evolve in time. Due to uncertainty of the parameters entropy estimation is used by the source nodes to calculate the routes by weighting the remaining energy of for- warders along with the mobile node. Next the sensor nodes with minimum weighted entropy are used to forward the user data.   8 Energy Efﬁcient Routing in Wireless Sensor Networks  151  Table 8.8 Comparison of energy-efﬁcient hierarchical routing protocols for mobile WSNs  Protocol  Path type  Periodic messages  Efﬁciency  Type  SEAD [25] MASP [9]  shortest energy-efﬁcient  No No  high low  proactive proactive  8.5.2.2 Energy Efﬁcient Hierarchical Routing  In energy-efﬁcient hierarchical routing for mobile WSN the data are transmitted to mobile nodes in a hierarchical format. Table 8.8 provides comparison between different protocols of this class.  The Scalable Energy-efﬁcient Asynchronous Dissemination  SEAD  proto- col [25] builds a dissemination tree for data routing and data caching. The mobile nodes mobile nodes can join the dissemination tree by sending a query message to the nearest node. This nearest node becomes the access node for the mobile node and acts as a bridge between the mobile node and the rest of the network. Once a query message is received, the access node starts creating a dissemination tree recur- sively. As the mobile node continues to move in the network, the dissemination tree is recomputed and is continuously updated. If the hop distance between the mobile node and its access nodes is beyond a particular limit  i.e., threshold , a new access node is selected and a new dissemination tree is built. This threshold is a tradeoff between latency and energy expenditure for updating the dissemination tree.  The Maximum Amount Shortest Path  MASP  protocol [9] is used to locate the mobile node and to gather data in mobile WSNs. MASP is basically a two phase data collection protocol. MASP works with the help of proxies which are spread in the network and are data collectors of the network. Proxies are actually elected sensor nodes which collect sensor data using multihop routing. Only those sensor nodes which are at a distance of one hop away from the mobile node could serve as proxies. One of the problems that occurs in MASP is proxies having a short contact time with the mobile node creates congestion in the network when they have to transmit a lot of data. This is addressed by assigning sensor nodes to clusters based on the duration of the contact time with the mobile sensor node. Therefore, this approach increases the throughput and reduces the energy consumption as well.  8.5.2.3 Discussion  Tables 8.7 and 8.8 compare energy-efﬁcient routing protocols for mobile WSNs. We observe that the protocols achieve energy efﬁciency by exploiting energy levels at the sensor nodes. The protocols do not also incur a lot of routing overheads to achieve energy efﬁciency. For small and disconnected networks the plane routing is more suitable. For dense networks, hierarchical routing is more appropriate. Also for unpredictable and uncontrolled mobility patterns it is difﬁcult for the protocols to achieve energy balance.   152  F.K. Shaikh et al.  8.6 Future Research Challenges and Opportunities  In recent years many energy-efﬁcient routing protocols have been proposed. WSNs are being extensively deployed in many application areas which include: wireless body area networks for elderly people, electronic-health care systems, Vehicular Adhoc NETworks  VANETs , underwater sensor networks, and Internet of things. For many of these application scenarios, there is a huge amount of data that are gen- erated from the environment and need to be routed. The future trend is to store this information using cloud infrastructures for efﬁcient retrieval and data analysis. This trend lends itself to a new paradigm shift to interconnect WSNs with Internet-based cloud computing environments commonly referred to as cyber-physical systems. This new paradigm shift creates new opportunities to revisit the energy efﬁciency routing issue in WSNs. New challenges include how queries are created and sent from the cloud to the WSN and how the data can be retrieved from the WSN envi- ronment to be stored in the cloud environment in an energy-efﬁcient manner.  The majority of protocols provide energy efﬁciency by using various load bal- ancing techniques at the sensor nodes only [35]. Although these techniques help in extending the lifetime of the WSN network, it is becoming a challenge to provide energy-efﬁcient routing on an end-to-end basis as WSNs become an integral part of cyber-physical systems. Furthermore, many routing protocols for WSNs do not adequately investigate the impact of scalability on energy-efﬁciency. Many recently proposed energy-efﬁcient routing protocols are evaluated using various simulation studies. The real deployment scenarios often impose different characteristics that are not really captured in these simulation tests. Thus, evaluating these energy-efﬁcient WSN routing protocols using real testbeds or in real deployment settings can pro- vide a much better insight into the practical performance of these protocols.  In the last few years there has been an increased interest in applications that support the mobility of the users. In contrast, mobile WSNs where single or very few nodes are mobile to assist with the data delivery, the new paradigm may include mobility for all or the majority of sensor nodes. An example of this scenario is the e- health care application where sensors are attached to the patient and the sensor data need to be sent to the doctor continuously. Another example can be VANETs where cars are equipped with sensors which cooperate with each other as the vehicles move to share road safety data. Very little work has been done in this area and a more in- depth analysis and energy-efﬁcient protocols are needed to address the challenges posed by the highly mobile nodes.  8.7 Conclusion  Due to limited battery capabilities, energy efﬁciency has become an important issue for Wireless Sensor Networks  WSNs . Given the cooperative nature of WSN nodes along with the complexity of the operations performed by them we need to design, implement and deploy energy-efﬁcient routing approaches which can guarantee net- work connectivity for WSNs for data delivery.   8 Energy Efﬁcient Routing in Wireless Sensor Networks  153  We have presented a comprehensive taxonomy of recently proposed energy- efﬁcient routing approaches in WSNs based on the types of application supported by WSNs. We discussed the importance of the various approaches based on the appli- cation perspective, i.e., delay sensitive and delay tolerant applications. The results of this work should enable researchers and designers of WSNs to better design and optimize future energy-efﬁcient routing protocols for WSNs.

Part III Future Internet Systems   Chapter 9 Internet of Things: From Real to Virtual World  Hakima Chaouchi, Thomas Bourgeau, and Pinar Kirci  9.1 Introduction  The digital era has revolutionized human society during the last century. In fact, the information digitization process has led to designing computers, phones, and differ- ent other machines offering a plethora of applications running on standalone com- puting machines. Then came digitized information transport, which has introduced digital communication and networking where machines were connected forming very large networks and offering applications remotely. These machines connected to these networks created the opportunity to deploy different services either in voice communication, data transfer or entertainment as TV and has led to this digital society; now totally dependent on that biggest network ever, the Internet; one of the major human astonishing inventions. In this network most of the information trafﬁc is created and generated by persons as with email, web, and other user ser- vices. Now, after the information digitization, the transport and the communication, “Ubiquitous Computing” is emerging relying on digitized information coming from the real world environment, allowing building automation of more tasks around us to better interact with the real world environment. Ubiquitous computing, pervasive computing, ambient intelligence appeared lately as one of the most challenging and ultimate goals of the digitization process where automatic processes are expected to be all around us to build the so-called smart world, where the real and virtual worlds are co-existing together, where not only persons are communicating through the  H.

Chaouchi et al.  network but also any connected object or thing involved in a certain process, with and without human intervention will be communicating and generating trafﬁc in the network. Ubiquitous computing is getting the computing embedded everywhere programmed to act automatically with no manual triggering; it is just omnipresent. Internet of Things is somehow a leading path to the smart world with ubiquitous computing and networking. This is to ease different tasks around users and provide other tasks such as easy monitoring of different phenomena surrounding us. In In- ternet of Things, environmental and daily life items, named also things, objects, or machines are enhanced with computing and communication technology and join the communication framework in which wireless and wired technologies already provide the communication capabilities and interactions, meeting a variety of ser- vices based on person-to-person, person-to-machine, machine-to-person, machine- to-machine interactions and so on. These connected machines or objects things will be new Internet or network users and will generate data trafﬁc in the current or emerging Internet network.  Connecting the objects might be wireless as with the Radio Frequency Identiﬁ- cation  RFID  or sensor radio technologies that offers, respectively, identiﬁcation of items and sensing the environment, or wired as with Power Line Communication  PLC  that offers data transport over electrical media and actually has pioneered in home networking the connectivity of electronic consumer devices that we also name objects such as smart fridge, smart TV, smart heater, etc.  In Internet of Things, identifying, sensing, and automatically deciding and actu- ating will be the main new functionalities that will enable ubiquitous computing and networking. Therefore, sensor and RFID  Radio Frequency IDentiﬁcation  among other technologies will be increasingly deployed and thus will allow integrating real world environment in the networked services. In fact, billion of RFID tags and sen- sors are expected in the following years to connect billion of items objects things to the network. Scalable identiﬁcation, naming and addressing space and structure, scalable name resolution, scalable and secure data transfer are of major concern. Other enabling technologies for this real world networked services include the nan- otechnology, the automatic processing and robotics, and probably new emerging technologies enabling the envisioned smart world to become true.  The Internet of Things will connect heterogeneous devices and will be very dense connecting billion of objects. Internet or IP  Internet protocol  or TCP IP  Transport Control Protocol  Internet Protocol -based model stands in the center of the Internet of Things. It is one possible INTERNET working solution to hide the ever increas- ing heterogeneity of networking technologies and communication systems in this envisioned ubiquitous environment. But IP might not support the resource limita- tion and the scalability of the network of billion of objects. IP or Internet will cer- tainly support the close to the market Internet of Things applications, but Internet of Things research development might hopefully also come with a new INTER- NET working communication model and architecture which can better support the new requirement as heterogeneity of objects, scalability regarding the expected bil- lions of objects, the limited resources of connecting objects, and new requirements related to new services and applications to be designed over this connected real   9 Internet of Things: From Real to Virtual World  163  Fig. 9.1 Origin of Internet of Things [16]  world. It falls exactly under the Post IP or Future Internet era [3–5] where several research projects are undertaking the idea of building a new communication model and architecture that is more adaptive to the requirements of a given network. In- ternet of Things is one network with new requirements related to the introduction of these nodes objects with new technologies in the network. The existing TCP IP model might be compatible with the emerging post IP or future Internet model, and, while seeking the design of the Internet of Things network and services, rethinking the basic concepts will emerge related to addressing, routing, scaling, guarantee- ing quality of service, security, mobility, etc. These are supported today by the All IP network where the packet switching TCP IP model has taken over the classi- cal telecom circuit switching model and Internet became the generalized model in telecommunication to offer different services thanks to the convergence efforts.  9.2 History of Internet of Things  “Internet of Things” was originally introduced by Auto-ID research center at the MIT  Massachusetts Institute  [1] where an important effort was made on the unique identiﬁcation of products named EPC  Electronic Product Code  which was then commercialized by EPCglobal. EPCglobal was created to follow the AutoID objec- tives in the industry, with EAN.UCC  European Article Numbering—Uniform Code Council  now called GS1 as a partner to commercialize Auto-ID research, mainly the electronic product code.  A thing or object is any possible item in the real world that might join the com- munication chain. As presented by [16], the initial main objective through the called Internet of Things was to combine communication capabilities characterized by data transmission viewed as Internet called also network of bits representing the “digital world”, with the process of automation characterized by atoms called network of atoms or the physical world called “network of atoms” as shown in Fig. 9.1.  The ITU  International Telecommunication Union  has in 2005 shown the in- terest of the telecommunication to look at new business possibilities that could be built over new services around the new connectivity of environment objects to the network. The ITU has produced a comprehensive report on the Internet of Things   164  H. Chaouchi et al.  Fig. 9.2 ITU Any place, any time and any thing vision [18]  from technical, economical and ethical points of view [18] and introduced a new axis in the ubiquitous networking path to complete the existing “anywhere” and “anytime” connectivity; it is the “anything” connectivity axis where the thing-to- thing or machine-to-machine interaction is added to complete the existing person- to-person and person-to-machine in the possible connectivity framework, and this clearly opens new service opportunities. Figure 9.2 presents the ITU view of the ubiquitous networking adding the “anything connection” to the connectivity every- where and anytime.  By adding the anything connection axis, new sources of information are intro- duced in the connected network and this will enable new services, exploiting the newly introduced information in the network. These services will be designed to offer the expected ubiquitous networking where the real world environment might react and adapt to different situations in order to make human life easier and more comfortable. Connecting these new objects will obviously raise many questions such as:   the connecting technology of the so-called objects,   the interoperability between objects,   the communication model of these connected objects,   the possible interaction with the existing models such as the Internet,   the choice of the transport model,   the addressing, identifying and naming,   the security and privacy,   9 Internet of Things: From Real to Virtual World  165  Fig. 9.3 Ubiquitous networking [20]    the economical impact and the telecommunication value chain evolution.  In fact, most of the services in the Internet were designed mainly to satisfy the person-to-person interaction such as email service, phone service, and the traf- ﬁc transported in the Internet is currently generated by persons; either voice, or data. Then, new services were developed around person-to-machine and machine- to-person interactions such as video on demand or content distribution services, and ﬁnally in order to provide tasks and process automation, new services will be de- veloped around the machine-to-person, machine-to machine or thing-to-thing and any other possible interactions in the so-called ubiquitous networking as shown in Fig. 9.3.  Internet of Things will connect objects to offer new services around persons and objects; we can also call it “Network of Things Objects”. Internet of Things might suggest that the Internet model will have to be adapted to support the connectivity and trafﬁc transport of the new services based upon the connected objects. It is also worth mentioning that “Web of Objects” is also another term used to refer to the Internet of Things. As the web is the main service accessibility to the current Internet connected nodes, similarly Internet of Things is seen as the main service accessibility to the networked and connected objects. Also, in Internet of Things, the naming resolution of identiﬁers to web addresses is considered to handle the   166  H. Chaouchi et al.  correspondence of identiﬁers introduced by the RFID technology and the service to get through a similar process as Domain Name Service  DNS , also named ONS  Object Name Service . “Web of Objects” has more meaning from the application viewpoint without implying indirectly the extension of the Internet communication model to these new connected objects as “Internet of Things” might suggest.  9.3 About Objects Things in the Internet of Things  What is exactly a connecting or connected object or a thing? In the close to the market Internet of Things applications, RFID tags, sensors are connecting inanimate daily objects and are building the actual things enabling the ﬁrst Internet of Things services.  Following the American Auto ID research center description of an internet of things and the European CASAGRAS research project terminology [12], things or objects are described as a set of atoms, the atom is the smallest object in the Internet of Things; as could be seen by the nanotechnology which is also one of the enabling technologies of the Internet of Things. Network of atoms combined with network of bits falls into what is named Internet of Things. It will gather a set of objects connected to the network to help in the execution of new services, enabling the smart world. So the atom being the smallest probable object, it is possible to classify objects as follows based on their size and complexity, their moveable aspect and the fact of being animate or inanimate as shown in Fig. 9.4 [12].  In this terminology, classical devices such as PCs, mobile phones are already connected objects using wired or wireless communication. Internet of Things will extend the connectivity and interworking of these current existing objects with new ones connected through the radio sensing or identifying technologies such as sensor networks or RFID networks allowing the development of new services involving in- formation from the environment. This information could be either a simple identiﬁer as with RFID or captured information as with sensors. In other terminologies, com- mon networking devices such as PC, laptop, and mobile phone are not considered as object. Only small devices such as sensors, actuators, RFID added to objects are considered as connected things or objects. But also machines identiﬁed in home net- working; connected consumer electronic devices as smart TV, fridge, light, etc. are connected objects. In this chapter, by “thing” or “object” we refer to the connected daily life and surrounding items using radio connectivity as sensors or RFIDs or wired communication such as PLC  Power Line Communication . These technolo- gies are mainly enabling the development of new services orchestrating real world information via the connected objects.  Different technologies can be used to interconnect objects. Note that connecting objects such as consumer electronics as a smart fridge or a smart heater has started with the home networking where consumer appliances are connected through wired technology such as Power Line Communication  PLC  allowing the communication through the power line. A number of standardization and industry organizations are   9 Internet of Things: From Real to Virtual World  167  Fig. 9.4 Objects classiﬁcation [12]  addressing different issues of the home networking puzzle. Current home network- ing applications are not suffering from any resource limitation of the connected objects  smart fridge, smart TV, etc.  and can easily deploy existing communication model such as TCP IP model to allow data transmission. They are concerned more with interoperability problems. This is different from the issues of the new appli- cations of Internet of Things relying on sensors and RFIDs where the resources of the connected objects via radio are limited especially the energy, memory, and pro- cessing capability. Another concern is supporting the connectivity of heterogeneous objects, and a huge number of these connected objects things as billion of tagged items or sensors. Sensor networks have been used in industrial process control and they allowed the automation of the sense and actuate process in order to perform automatic control, maintenance, and data collection operations. In addition, a large number of potential environment monitoring applications for RFID and sensor net- works are to come. In home networking, new applications using sensor and RFID technologies will allow the automatic control of certain processes, hence minimiz- ing the human intervention.  9.4 The Identiﬁer in the Internet of Things  IP addresses are identifying the nodes in the Internet and also serve as locators for routing. IPv6 allows larger address space than IPv4. In the Internet of Things a large identiﬁcation space will be needed to cover the identiﬁcation of the tremendous   168  H. Chaouchi et al.  number of connected objects. A speciﬁc semantic of these identiﬁers will follow the application’s need. In the Internet of Things, where objects are addressed via identi- ﬁers stored into tags and interrogated by networked readers, the question of unifying and standardizing the identiﬁer’s size and structure is critical in order to allow large deployment of services relying on these new connected objects. Since RFID tech- nology is naturally used for identiﬁcation, the standardization of the identiﬁer stored in the RFID is the current Internet of Things concern. The same question rises for any addressing schema used in the network of objects. In case that it is IP based, the problem will be more about the semantic of the identiﬁer, scalability of the address- ing space, and the memory size limitation of the devices addressed by the chosen address identiﬁer space.  The term “identiﬁer” is similar with the term “name”. A name does not change with location, in contrast to an “address” which is intended to be used to refer to the location of a thing. IP addresses are used to route packets between end-systems. Emerging Internet of Things service providers expect to rely on a convenient iden- tiﬁer space for the envisioned service, knowing that anything can be assigned an identiﬁer—a physical object, person, place or logical object. A wide variety of ser- vices and applications can be envisaged, once it becomes possible to provide in- formation associated with a tag identiﬁer in different forms  text, audio or image . For example, in a museum, an identiﬁer on a tag attached to a painting could be used to ﬁnd further information on the painting and the artist. In a grocery store, an identiﬁer on a food package could be used to check that the food is safe to eat and not a member of a sample that has been found to be contaminated in some way. Other areas in which identiﬁer-triggered information access could be valuable are in medicine pharmaceuticals, agriculture, libraries, the retail trade, the tourist industry, logistics and supply chain management [20].  So, the major issue to start with in this Internet of Things to maximize its success is the standardization in order to ensure interoperability of the connected objects and nodes in the Internet of Things. As will be presented in Sect. 9.7, this prob- lem is well known in the communication ﬁeld, but it is worsened in the Internet of Things since billion of objects are expected to be connected. It is then important to standardize the object identiﬁer since the objects in the network of objects will be addressed by a unique identiﬁer similarly to IP addresses of connected nodes in the Internet.  EPCglobal has ﬁrst standardized the electronic product code identiﬁer, followed by ISO. In addition to ISO and EPCglobal, the Ubiquitous ID Centre  UIDcentre  has deﬁned a generic identiﬁer called “ucode” which is not only intended to iden- tify physical objects but also extended to places and digital information. ISO has addressed the issue of standardized identiﬁer by considering proprietary propos- als such as EPCglobal and UIDcentre but also offers the possibility to deﬁne other identiﬁers but conform to ISO recommendations. For example, if one might use IP address space for identiﬁcation, and if a device thing has enough memory, one can propose to consider IPv6 address space to be used as identiﬁer space of objects since IPv6 address space is supposed to be large enough to offer up to 223 addresses in a square meter. Unfortunately, deﬁning an identiﬁer is not only about the scalability of   9 Internet of Things: From Real to Virtual World  169  the identiﬁer space but it is also about the structure and the meaning semantic of the identiﬁer. Also it is important that an identiﬁer plays only the role of identiﬁcation, so that even if the identiﬁed objects are mobile, the identiﬁer remains the same. In the IP communication model, IP addresses play two roles: from a network point of view, they act as a locator for routing and from an application point of view; they identify hosts for the duration of a communications session. This dual role is seen to be problematic due to increasing demands for mobility and the multi-homing of end-systems. For this reason the Internet Research Task Force  IRTF  and the Inter- net Engineering Task Force  IETF  have developed the Host Identity Protocol  HIP  which deﬁnes Host Identiﬁers that can perform the identiﬁer role of the IP address, leaving the IP address to act solely as a locator for routing. These Host Identiﬁers of HIP protocol could potentially be used as another type of identiﬁer in the Internet of Things under the condition to respect the ISO standard and being capable to carry the semantic of the identiﬁer needed by the intended Internet of Thing application. For instance, a EPC global identiﬁer contains information on the product itself, the manufacturer, etc. IPv6 address informs us about the network preﬁx and the address of the node, this is not containing the semantic expected by the new identiﬁers. A mapping between IP addresses and the things identiﬁers will be possible in case of using IP network to interconnect these identiﬁed and connected objects to the Internet.  As mentioned earlier identifying, addressing and naming the objects in the In- ternet of Things service are very important. As for IP-based devices, IP addressing and naming are used to enable the routing and the network resource location in the network. Address resolution protocol  ARP  and name resolution using the IP Do- main Name Service  DNS  are used in IP networks to offer different services such as World wide web, email, ﬁle transfer, Voice over IP, etc. Some existing IP services such as domain name service are considered in handling the identiﬁer resolution to a name in certain Internet of Things services such as product tracking where and electronic identiﬁer of the product will call the web page of the manufacturer and all the history of this product manufacturing and shipping. This service is named by EPCglobal ONS or Object Name Service. In order to use ONS for all the emerging Internet of Things services orchestrating identiﬁers, certain problems such as the scalability of this naming service also have to be addressed, since we are expecting billions of objects tagged with identiﬁers. Other non-technical issues related to ONS such as the governance of this ONS are also important. As for the DNS root which is hosted in United States, ONS system will also have an ONS root, and Europe would like to host it [11]. Using DNS approach in certain Internet of Thing services raises the term World Object Web as the application running over the network of objects or web of objects similarly to World Wide Web running over the network of IP nodes; the Internet. Figure 9.5 shows an example of ONS usage to retrieve a manufacturer web page.  An example of ONS usage for other Internet of Thing application than product tracking was presented in the Internet of Things conference in 2008 [6], it was about helping a blind person in automatic reading of a book tagged with an RFID where he can put it on a reader connected to a computer. As soon as the reader gets the   170  Fig. 9.5 Object name service architecture [12]  H. Chaouchi et al.  identiﬁer of the tagged book, a web page appears in the screen starting reading the book; it is the application developed and running at the Internet side. Most of the current RFID-based applications will be based on this touch a tag and trigger an application relying on the resolution of the RFID object identiﬁer through the ONS [15].  9.5 Enabling Technologies of Internet of Things  As stated by the ITU report [18], the full-scale commercialization of many of the technologies related to Internet of Things may require some time yet, early devel- opments have already led to a lot of innovative applications likely to become ubiq- uitous in everyday’s life; in the home, at work, on the farm, in the hospital, at the shop, on the road, and even inside the body. Item-based tagging and identiﬁcation will take anytime and anywhere communications to the next revolutionary step in networking: “anything communications”. Empowering things to detect and monitor their environment through sensors will enable the network to sense, react and re- spond to external stimuli. Embedded intelligence at the edges of the network will further increase the network’s ability to respond [18].  Internet of Things services will bring new functionalities in the network that allows the real environment information to be processed by some Internet of Things applications. These functionalities will be among others identifying, sensing and actuating in addition to the communication or information transport capabil- ity.  More and more edge technologies will be connected to the existing and future network in order to interact with the real world as shown in Fig. 9.6 to allow differ- ent applications around the user that we named Internet of Things services. Other applications will involve more object-to-object communication for different type of Internet of Things services more related to the real world environment.   9 Internet of Things: From Real to Virtual World  171  Fig. 9.6 Example of current edge technologies for Internet of Things services [12]  The main Internet of Things enabling technologies will be ﬁrst the electronic identiﬁcation technology such as RFID, the sensing and actuating technology such as sensor actuator, and the communication technology from object-to-object and also from the network of objects to the existing networks such as wired and wire- less communication networks, other technologies such as nanotechnology, smart technologies, robotics, location, etc. will also enable different Internet of Things services.  Wireless-based Internet of Things services is more popular since the RFID and sensors will provide information through the radio interface. The wired commu- nication between objects will mainly be the power line communication since the home electronic appliances considered then as objects will take advantage of the electrical communication to also send information. When home networking appli- cation has started at the same time as PLC development, these applications were named home networking applications. With the introduction of wireless RFID and sensors, new applications can be developed in home networking but also every- where involving the real world objects, and then the world of Internet of Things is used to better cover all these existing and emerging new services and applica- tions interacting with the real world. RFID technology, sensor technology are the close to market enabling technologies of the IoT as they enable the object or the thing to be connected to the network and they are offering the possibility to develop new services based on wireless communication. On the other hand, PLC technology provides a natural connection to other type of objects, not tiny ones, they are home electronic appliances and show other applications of Internet of Thing in the home networking using wired link such as PLC and these are actually new applications compared to classical applications that we can get through computers or telephones using the classical technologies such as ﬁxed or mobile communication. These other communication technologies such as ethernet, wireless, and mobile communication technologies are connecting devices such as computers or telephones  ﬁxed or mo- biles  but we prefer to not consider these devices as objects or things, since they are   172  Passive RFID  Table 9.1 RFID tag technologies [25]  H.

These tech- nologies are forming the network support to transport the Internet of Things service information such as identiﬁer, sensing information, actuating to be processed in the application running somewhere in the mobile or ﬁxed network to which the network of objects is connected.  9.5.1 Identiﬁcation Technology  Identiﬁcation technology initially was achieved with simple barcodes that are uniquely identifying items for tracking. Bar codes evolved to 2D barcodes in or- der to contain more information or more identiﬁers on the same 2D space. Finally electronic barcode with the introduction of the RFID  Radio Frequency Identiﬁca- tion  will allow storing the identiﬁer in the memory of the RFID tag. In the Internet of Things, RFID technology is considered as one of the enabling technologies to build new services over the network. The RFID technology will identify, track the location of the object, and provide it to a speciﬁc Internet of Things application. It mainly answers the question “What, Which, Where” while the sensor answers the question: “How” [18]. RFID systems consist of three main components:   A transponder or a tag to carry data.   Microwave antenna or Coil and a data microchip located on the object-to be identiﬁed – tags can be passive, semi-passive or active, based on their power source and  the way they are used, as shown in Table 9.1;  – can be read-only, read write or read write re-write, depending on how their data  are encoded.   9 Internet of Things: From Real to Virtual World  173    An interrogator or reader – Compared with tags, readers are larger, more expensive and power-hungry.   Middleware, which forwards the data to another system, such as a database, a personal computer or robot control system, depending on the application.  Different applications are possible with RFID technology, mainly item tracking  of products in retail chain, tracking animals or any other items.  RFID communication system can attain long distances such as in animal tracking application where the distance of reading is few kilometers. Near ﬁeld communica- tion  NFC  is a short-range wireless technology that enables easy and convenient interaction between devices. NFC will use the RFID communication system but limiting the reading range to a few centimeters and this can be used for applications requiring security of the RFID reading process. It is also an extension of proximity card technology; contactless ISO 14443. It combines the interface of a smart card and a reader in one device. NFC technology enables RFID reader-only, tag-only, and smart-card-only solutions. It is optimized for service discovery and initiation where a middleware in the network side is deﬁned such as the Nokia Field Force Solu- tion architecture. Mobile devices with NFC technology enabled are already in the market in order to offer access to different applications such as mobile ticketing in public transport, mobile payment, smart poster, electronic tickets, electronic money, etc. This is seen as the possibility to mobile network operators to be the interface to access these different Internet of Things services via these NFC enabled mobile phones. Different Internet of Things applications are close to the market, offering NFC interface in mobile phones that will be able to read RFID tags and trigger a certain application or service [9]. More applications and services will emerge taking advantage of the RFID technology and more research effort is currently ongoing in RFID area. For instance, in [22] the authors introduce the possibility to use the RFID technology to improve the wireless indoor positioning, and in [23] the authors pro- pose to improve the IP mobility by boosting the movement detection of the mobile node using the RFID technology.  9.5.2 Sensing and Actuating Technology  As mentioned earlier, an RFID mainly answers the question “What, Which, Where”, while the sensor answers the question: “How”.  A sensor is an electronic device that detects senses or measures physical stimuli from the real world environment, converts signals from stimuli into analogue or digital form. Some sensors are also providing actuation functionality; it is named sensor actuator.   mechanical  e.g. position, force, pressure, etc. ,   thermal  e.g. temperature, heat ﬂow ,   electrostatic or magnetic ﬁelds,  Sensors can be classiﬁed according to the parameters they measure [18]:   174  H. Chaouchi et al.    radiation intensity  e.g. electromagnetic, nuclear ,   chemical  e.g. humidity, ion, gas concentration ,   biological  e.g. toxicity, presence of biological organisms , and so on.   military—enemy tracking or battleﬁeld surveillance; Many scientiﬁc and research groups are working to develop more efﬁcient and fea- sible sensor networks. The main technical constraints are:   power, size, memory and storage capacity,   trade-off between power and size,   interference, communication model,   the environment where the sensors are deployed  underwater, land ﬁeld, etc.   Many applications of sensors can be envisioned in different domains; military environment, healthcare, construction, commercial applications, remote monitoring of the temperature of products, home applications such as smart home, and so on.  9.5.3 Other Technologies  Emerging technologies will bring about more possibilities to develop new Internet of Things applications involving less the user and becoming more object centric, meaning: very autonomous. Here are a few of them that we can mention.   Smart technologies – Thinking and deciding technologies based on the sensing and received infor-   Process automation and robotics – Executing the actuation building the autonomous communication.   Nanotechnology – The atom is the object, the smallest object in the Internet of Things.  mation building the autonomous communication.  More possible Internet of Things services are based on new type of material, feeling cloths, adapting wall painting, etc. pushing more the ubiquitous networking to many daily life objects [18].  9.6 Connected Object’s Communication  9.6.1 Object-to-Object  In the object-to-object communication, the interoperability is very important and building the network of objects with end-to-end communication is challenging. For instance RFID reader to RFID tags will use the standardized ISO communication model named ISO 18000 [7] where serial communication is used at few kilobits per   9 Internet of Things: From Real to Virtual World  175  second and in some technologies up to a megabit per second, and it is a point-to- point communication. In case of sensor-to-sensor communication, different wireless technologies are possible and the IEEE 802.15.4 or Zeegbee is one of the promoted wireless technologies for building wireless sensor networks. In a home networking and wired scenario, objects might communicate with other objects using the Pow- erLine Communication. Using the IP model in the emerging network of objects, communication might be possible under certain conditions related to the resources of the nodes, the addressing, naming and identiﬁcation of the nodes, the size of the network and the density of the nodes, etc. At the moment IP model will be possi- ble as a network hosting the Internet of Things application functionalities and using special gateways to connect the objects or the network of objects to the Internet.  9.6.2 Object or Network of Objects to Other Networks  First generation of Internet of Things services that are close to the market will rely on these new objects connected to the network via technologies such as RFID  NFC for secure short range reading applications , sensors to introduce the real world in- formation into the network to be processed by these new applications. In this case, most of the interconnection effort will be made at the gateway point attaching the objects to the network. This gateway can be connected either by wired or wire- less mobile communication system. Other technologies that are already used for different applications might be mentioned, such as possible technologies for new Internet of Things services to connect the object at one hop to the network such as are smart cards for automatic payment, location technologies  Real Time Location System  RTLS , Global Positioning System  GPS , etc.  to enable location-based services and also tracking, bar code  2D  for item tracking etc.  9.7 About Internet in the Internet of Things  Connecting objects of different technologies and different communicating models raise the question of end-to-end communication between heterogeneous systems. IP or Internet Protocol has in the past answered this same question where it suc- ceeded to interconnect heterogeneous networks with different physical and link lay- ers transporting different type of trafﬁc through the network IP layer by introducing the new addressing space; the IP addressing and the routing schema that allows to reach any connected node to the IP network as long as it has a routable IP address. In the Internet of Things there are more issues than heterogeneity in connecting the new objects and also interconnecting the network of objects to the existing network, so we need to:   design or adapt an appropriate communication model to set up the network of objects,   176  H. Chaouchi et al.    design or adapt the connectivity of this network of objects to the current Inter- net where some of the Internet of Things functionalities will be hosted such as information data bases, applications, actuation commands, etc.  Regarding the communication model to set up the network of objects, several issues need to be considered. An important issue is the available resources offered by the objects such as battery, memory, and processing capability. For instance tiny objects such as sensors or RFIDs have limited resources. However, other objects in home networking application such as smart TV or smart fridge might have enough resources. Usually when there are enough resources, IP model meaning addressing and routing could be considered as the communication model to set up this network of objects as long as it respects the application trafﬁc requirement. Another issue is the heterogeneity of the connecting objects. Again the IP model could be con- sidered to handle the connectivity of heterogeneous nodes and networks, but this will be possible only if there are enough resources. Tiny objects such as sensors, RFID, etc. show clearly the limitation of the current IP model especially with the energy consumption, thus new adaptation of this model has already started in the IETF meaning that IP model might be used to connect some objects in the Inter- net of Things such as sensors under certain parameters. In fact, the IETF 6lowpan working group has produced an IPv6-based model to satisfy the sensor environment requirement over IEEE 802.15.4 [2]; also the ROLL working group has looked at how to adapt the routing process to these new environments and came up with the RPL protocol [8]. IP for Smart Objects  IPSO  Alliance which is a group of more than a 100 industrials is also looking at the adaptation of IP to these smart and tiny devices [17]. Note that sensor networks are gaining more and more attention from the industry since they can help in building new services and applications in differ- ent domains such as health, agriculture, transport, in any place, therefore creating new revenues and so does the RFID technology. But before developing more appli- cations and considering more and more objects, it is necessary to avoid problems such as scalability, complexity, and heterogeneity in communication. Internet  cur- rent future  model is considered as one possible communication framework for the emerging Internet of Things-based services at least in the short and medium term. But to be more generic, we should consider the word Internet in the “Internet of Things” as INTERNET working of objects, meaning transport capability, hetero- geneity management, easy object network management, easy services development, and deployment capability. This could be realized by an adapted version of the IP model or totally new communication model, which is highly expected by the Future Internet Network worldwide initiative [3, 4].  Regarding the interconnection of the network of objects to other networks such as existing Internet, it will depend on the purpose of this interconnection. We know that Internet of Things applications will orchestrate functionalities from the current In- ternet network to allow the transport of the generated trafﬁc of the Internet of Things nodes and also allow the service access locally or remotely. Another functionality is related to this network of objects management with simple and known tools lo- cally or remotely. Consequently, network of objects using IP model or any other communication model within objects’ network has to be connected to the Internet   9 Internet of Things: From Real to Virtual World  177  Fig. 9.7 ITU Internet of Things reference model [20]  through some speciﬁc gateways, as shown in Fig. 9.13, allowing the communication between the network of objects and the worldwide Internet in order to beneﬁt from its existing tools and data transport and management. The gateway will be close to the tag reading or the sensor to handle the transport of this information on the IP side. For instance some command can be sent from an Internet node toward the network of objects. In this case the Internet model should be adapted to support the properties of this new trafﬁc coming from, and going to this network of objects.  In order to understand the new trafﬁc properties, it is important to look at the functionalities required by the Internet of Things service. Since these emerging ser- vices intend to introduce information from the real world environment in the net- work to be processed and then automate some tasks in the real world, identifying, sensing and actuating are the major building blocks of an Internet of Things-based service. All these functionalities will generate trafﬁc that need to be transported from one point to another of the network. For instance, the identifying process will generate the identiﬁer information using the current identiﬁer technology, the RFID that will be used by the application service located in the network. The RFID reader can be directly connected to the network or multi-hop away from it. When using sensors, sensing information is generated by the sensor and has to be transported to the application process through other sensors; multi-hop transport model or one hop away from the node running the application. The actuation process might be trig- gered locally or remotely also through a network and will need an efﬁcient network transport to satisfy the trafﬁc requirement of the actuation service. In any case, there is a need for efﬁcient information transfer taking into account the limited resources of the current object technologies such as RFID tags and wireless sensors among other requirements.  The ﬁrst proposed architecture by the ITU is shown in Fig. 9.7 where IP network is selected to transport the identiﬁcation or the sensing information at the edge of the Internet, and it shows a need for an interface to the transport and the service planes of the Internet or NGN  Next Generation Network . But IP network will not be the only possibility to support the transport of the information generated by these   178  H. Chaouchi et al.  new Internet of Thing-based services. This is a short and medium term view of the Internet of Things’ applications that are close to the market. A Future network model might emerge to handle the new requirement of the Internet of Things services and trafﬁc transport based on these tiny devices suffering from lack of energy, memory and processing resources. More adaptation and autonomic behavior will be included in the new communication model.  As mentioned by the ITU in Fig. 9.7, the industry’s point of view is considering IP and Next Generation Networks  NGN  in the short and medium term as the net- work support for Internet of Things services. This is seen as a natural step forward to the convergence process in telecommunication seeking the All IP model. Based on this fact, certain Internet of Things services might be deployed very quickly as soon as some security related issues are solved such as privacy related to RFID deployment. These close to the market services are those that are using Internet to run the application that orchestrates the objects connected to the existing net- work nodes. In this context, the user interface to these new services will be either related to the ﬁxed or mobile networks. The actuation process might be triggered locally if it is programmed so, or remotely through a given network based on a cer- tain terminal. For instance through a mobile phone connected to the emerging 4G network or any other wireless or mobile network and this has attracted a particular interest from mobile network operators and mobile devices manufacturers designing smart phones with RFID reader capability. In fact emerging mobile phones could be used to trigger some Internet of Things services remotely, and also interact locally through new reading interface with the objects added to the real environment.  Following the industry approach where the convergence to All IP continues with the new Internet of Things services, it is then important to recall the convergence path to All IP. As summarized in Fig. 9.8, the convergence in telecommunication can be seen from different angles. The value chain actors are initially telecommunica- tion, Internet, and broadcasting operators to offer speciﬁc services as regards voice, data, and media, respectively. The convergence will impact these speciﬁc operators to offer all the three services at the same time on the same network. In fact the con- vergence in telecommunication will end up by designing the same container named IP packet to transport different information  voice, data, media  in the same network known today as IP network. This transported information has speciﬁc properties sat- isﬁed by the corresponding network before the convergence and by IP network after the convergence since IP completed with the QoS architecture can offer these mul- tiple services in the same packet switched network, the Internet. Consequently, the convergence impacts also the corresponding markets; communication, information, and entertainment, respectively. Finally, the convergence impacts the design of de- vices or interfaces to the corresponding services; terminal  telephone , computer, and home consumer electronic appliances  e.g. TV  where the convergence pushes to design an all in one device to get access to all these services no matter which phys- ical network we are connected too, ﬁxed or mobile. This has also an impact on the service management from the network side, the convergence in telecommunication came with a service oriented approach where a service abstraction layer is intro- duced and the access to a service has to be transparent from the physical transport   9 Internet of Things: From Real to Virtual World  179  Fig. 9.8 Convergence in telecommunication [13]  of the information generated by this service. IP Multimedia Subsystem IMS and ﬁxed mobile convergence is a good example of a service abstraction layer, where it is possible to get a service  e.g. telephony  no matter which physical network the user is connected to thanks to the SIP  Session Initiation Protocol  signaling that in- troduces a new user identiﬁer to be mapped with the location of the user at anytime and anywhere.  All IP, which is one concrete answer to the need to convergence in telecommu- nication, has started with the need to optimize network resources of ﬁxed telephony network based on a circuit switching model. Initially, there were speciﬁc and ded- icated networks with speciﬁc nodes and linking technologies to offer one speciﬁc service. In fact, the ﬁrst designed network was meant to be used only for telephony; it is the ﬁxed telecommunication network. The data transport network came mainly with Internet network and ﬁnally the television application was deployed in another speciﬁc network, the TV broadcast network. Designing a speciﬁc network for a spe- ciﬁc service is deﬁnitely not optimizing the usage of the resources, and using an end-to-end physical circuit for only one communication, even if there is no voice transported, is not optimizing the resource utilization.  One of the major revolutions in networking is the move from the circuit switched networking to the packet switched networking, known also as IP network, Internet, TCP IP network, data network, or packet network. IP being the de facto protocol to interconnect heterogeneous networks, added by a set of other protocols for con- trol as well as for management, makes it the convergence vector in the evolving telecommunication systems. IP was threatened at different times, ATM as a packet switching network but too complex and expensive, switched Ethernet was not scal- able. IP has won due to its simplicity, less investment, scalability, and multi usage to carry different services relying on the virtual circuit switching over packet switching   180  H. Chaouchi et al.  Fig. 9.9 Telecom value chain evolution [13]  network. The convergence to what is called All IP can then be seen at different lay- ers, the transport, the management, the control, and application development; this is all to maximize the revenues of the telecom actors of the value chain.  The value chain is also impacted in this convergence path as shown in Fig. 9.9, since initially it was linear where each actor in the value chain has his own devel- opment and market, and now after the convergence the value chain is non-linear; most of the actors are moving to this user centric approach where it is all about designing new services to be transported by this unique and stable network, the All IP. New services will emerge with the Internet of Things and will also impact the value chain where some services will be object centric, meaning that the interaction of these new services will be based on object-to-object with no human interaction. The trafﬁc generated by these object-to-object oriented services will need to match a certain business model with new actors.  The path to convergence continues with the Internet of Things, and raises the question if IP will be fully adopted to support Internet of Things services, or if it will be used only partially. As shown in Fig. 9.10, the Internet of Things will impact the convergence in telecommunication at different angles  By adding Internet of Things services in the network, it will impact ﬁrst the value chain, since new actors will be introduced in the telecommunication chain. For instance the actor of product identiﬁcation since RFID technology is part of the Internet of Things enabling technologies. As shown in Fig. 9.11, sensing and actuating designers, automation process developers will join the existing telecom value chain with wired and wireless communication providers in order to develop Internet of Things services.  By introducing IoT in the convergence path, it will impact the selection of the information container  IP?  that will transport in the converged network the Internet of Things generated information. Knowing that Internet of Things services will in- troduce mainly new functionalities; identifying, sensing, actuating, we need to ask   9 Internet of Things: From Real to Virtual World  181  Fig. 9.10 Internet of Things in the convergence path [13]  Fig. 9.11 New actors in the IoT value Chain [20]  two questions regarding keeping IP as the convergence vector. First, what is inter- esting for IP to be used in Internet of Things? Internet model might be considered immediately in connecting the objects  with enough resources  for its capabilities of naming and addressing, routing, scalability, easy deployment and management, easy application development, easy naming, addressing, name and address resolu- tion, etc. [17]. Second, what are the limitations in using IP for Internet of Things services? In the current object technologies we can mention resources limitation of the objects: battery, memory, processing. Also, IP has to support the trafﬁc proper- ties of the introduced functionalities mainly identifying, sensing, and actuating.  In Fig. 9.10, we add “IoT information” next to “voice, data, media” knowing that Internet of Thing generated information might be an “identiﬁer, a sensing in- formation, an actuation order, etc.”, this type of information might have different QoS properties and there is a need to study the trafﬁc model of this new type of   182  H. Chaouchi et al.  information and analyze if IP as it is today can transport this information by re- specting the trafﬁc properties. For instance a remote actuation might have higher priority than existing voice trafﬁc due to the urgent character of a given Internet of Thing application. For delay tolerant Internet of Thing applications, the question will be more about the overhead of the IP model compared to the Internet of Thing generated data. It is then important to know if the IP model can be used from end- to-end meaning addressing the objects using IP and then beneﬁt from the IP trafﬁc forwarding, or use the IP model only from the gateway connecting the network of objects to the Internet as suggested in Fig. 9.13.  Adding the Internet of Thing services in the big picture of convergence will im- pact the device design to contain the interfaces to access the Internet of Thing service and this will certainly join the all in one device approach, most probably mobile smart device  phone , and here mobile operators are very interested in these new emerging IoT services.  Finally, the path to this convergence will certainly start by considering IP or an adapted version of IP to handle the ﬁrst generation of Internet of Things services which are still user centric, and the massive deployment in the short and medium term of these Internet of Things services will be mainly allowed, ﬁrst by the accep- tance by society of the new technologies such as RFID with privacy issues that are enabling technologies of most of attracting Internet of Things services with promis- ing new revenues in the user centric value chain.  In the long term, probably a new communication model will emerge following the Post IP and Future Internet Network developments and then next generation of Internet of Things services will be naturally deployed being user centric but mostly object centric where network scalability need will increase, expecting billions of objects connected and orchestrated by Internet of Things applications that focuses more on trying to improve human society’s lifestyle by adding more tasks’ automa- tion and respecting the real world environment by deploying services to monitor or act following the goal of better respecting nature and our planet.  9.8 SoA Architecture of IoT  Most of the existing architectures of the Internet of Things in the literature follow the design of the middleware that will hide the low layer objects heterogeneity and that eases the design and access to the applications of the IoT. Most of these architectures follow the Service Oriented Architecture  SOA  approach which is mainly offering the possibility to compose in a modular way the functionalities necessary to build a service or an application.  The adoption of the SOA principles as stated in [10] as shown in Fig. 9.12 allows for decomposing complex and monolithic systems into applications consisting of an ecosystem of simpler and well-deﬁned components.  Note that other architectures are possible, such as a resource oriented approach where speciﬁc gateways have to be developed in order to orchestrate the objects communication to offer the intended service  application to the user [24].   9 Internet of Things: From Real to Virtual World  183  Fig. 9.12 SoA architecture of Internet of Things [10]  Fig. 9.13 Internet of Things abstract view  Following the convergence path in Fig. 9.10 from the service access point of view, we might follow the service oriented approach where IoT services should be independent from the network transport part, so that in case of changing the trans- port network, the service will always be accessible, as in IMS approach. This might sound as a new step in the convergence of networks to the All IP convergence where a service oriented approach is followed in order to get a service no matter the net- work transport. It is important to have an abstraction layer for Internet of Things services to be developed independently from the transport network, meaning that it should be independent if the network is ﬁxed or mobile, IP based or post IP based or Future network based. What is important is to be capable to reuse the developed In- ternet of Things services over any transporting network and also offering the service no matter which transport network is used by the network of objects. Our abstract view of the Internet of Thing service oriented approach is shown in Fig. 9.13.   184  H. Chaouchi et al.  Fig. 9.14 Internet of Things domain applications [10]  9.9 Applications of IoT  Internet of Things-based services will provide more automation of various tasks around persons and connected objects in order to build the smart world not only in manufacturing industries but also in the ofﬁce, at home, and everywhere. Most of these services will also rely on the easy location and tracking of the connected objects. Other services, object to-object oriented ones, will emerge for instance in the context of the green planet goal where speciﬁc applications will monitor the environment and automatically react for example to minimize the waste of energy or avoid certain natural disaster.  Most of the Internet of Things applications are well described in the literature, they can be grouped into the following domains [10, 14, 18] as shown in Fig. 9.14:   Transportation and logistics domain.   Healthcare domain.   Smart environment  home, ofﬁce, plant  domain.   Personal and social domain.   Others.  9.10 Important Issues  Objects can be heterogeneous in various respects: nature and functionalities, prop- erties  ﬁxed, mobile , type of resources, communication modes  synchronous, asyn- chronous, multi hop, broadcast  and medium, types of application [21].  Apart from investigating the possible synergies between the heterogeneous tech- nologies, it is important ﬁrst of all to classify the heterogeneous connected objects   9 Internet of Things: From Real to Virtual World  185  based on their functionalities, their properties whether they are ﬁxed or mobile, what are their resources; as for computing, memory, and energy; their communica- tion capabilities: whether they offer synchronous or asynchronous communication, broadcast or ad hoc communication, and their usability for which type of applica- tion.  Regarding the functionalities of the heterogeneous connected objects, we need to identify and classify the new functionalities that will generate new trafﬁc to be transported in the network. As for the current existing objects we can mention the new functionalities that are identiﬁcation for object tracking, sensing, and actuating for environment monitoring, and so on. It will then be of major interest to analyze the new trafﬁc model and its requirement toward the network.  Based on the connected object characteristics, the communication model to be designed to connect these objects will deﬁnitely be adaptive to the limited resources and the heterogeneity of these objects; it will also have to face the high density and the scalability of the network connecting these objects. In the process of connecting these objects, identifying, addressing and naming these connected objects will send us back to the time when IP addressing was designed to offer scalable connectivity of heterogeneous networks. However, IP is greedy in terms of resources; and these are scarce in the projected connected objects. Designing scalable, resource and en- ergy aware identiﬁcation and addressing plan is one of the major issues in the path to efﬁciently connect objects. Adapting the IP addressing plan as proposed by the IETF in 6LOWPAN working group and designing new addressing but also mapping to IP to allow interconnectivity with IP networks will also have to be investigated. Considering that the identiﬁcation and addressing of the connected objects is solved, then the bootstrapping and the auto-conﬁguration and neighbor discovery of the connected objects in order to set up the connectivity and maintain the network of objects have to be designed. Again these processes have to be energy and resource aware.  Now, considering that the connected objects have well conﬁgured their addresses, they have to be capable to transmit and forward the trafﬁc from one object to another, reaching the right destination in a reliable and scalable fashion. Here, there is a need to investigate the existing relaying models such as broadcasting, IP routing, ad-hoc routing, delay tolerant routing, and so on, and again energy and resource awareness are of major importance, but also the mobility of objects, and here object location and tracking might be used for efﬁcient trafﬁc relaying. Note that two approaches will be confronted; the ﬁrst one is supporting the end-to-end trafﬁc transmission; similarly to the IP approach, and the other one will use gateways but special ones such as semantic gateways that will interconnect sub networks of objects to the rest of the network and will understand and translate the communication from one sub network to another.  In fact, in the network communication design, it is important to investigate in parallel the communication model design of the network connectivity between ob- jects and the communication model of the connectivity of an object or a network of objects to another network such as Internet. In the ﬁrst case, this might come up with   186  H. Chaouchi et al.  a new communication model based on new paradigms such as autonomic commu- nication or any emerging future networking, or it might adapt the existing commu- nication model such as the Internet model. In the second case, as mentioned earlier, researches will follow the existing investigations as in the IETF or IPSO regarding the adaptation of the existing IP model to extend the connectivity to these new nodes, a.k.a. objects, or design speciﬁc gateways for protocol and trafﬁc semantic transla- tion to interconnect these objects to the targeted network, a.k.a. Internet, to offer design and access to new services built upon these objects and accessed through the All IP converged network. This last scenario is attracting mobile telecommunication stakeholders.  Mechanisms for ensuring QoS would allow ISPs to support new services and Network Providers to build for QoS paths. However, QoS can lead to complex prob- lems in IP networks, although legacy voice telcom networks were speciﬁcally de- signed to provide a guaranteed level of QoS, in contrast to the current Internet which provides only “Best Effort” connectivity. Packet loss, latency, and jitter are the main QoS parameters describing the network performance and hence quality characteris- tics of IP trafﬁc. Three fundamental strategies and approaches exist to handle QoS in the Internet, which are quite different in their principles, mechanisms, architectures, deployment, and difﬁculty.  A prerequisite for the deployment of various services originating from commu- nicating objects based on heterogeneous technologies and interconnected in a het- erogeneous way is a sort of middleware that will enable self-discovery, connectivity, and information exchange between objects, object networks, and users as well as the traceability of transactions which will be required in a trusted environment. This will require solving a number of technical issues, among which: self-discovery of object capabilities at various semantic levels, interoperability between heterogeneous pro- tocols based on various technology environments, and technical solutions to handle end-to-end trust chain through different operators having an administrative respon- sibility to manage the objects; this would guarantee to the user the reliability and trustworthiness of the services, protection of sensitive private data, easy and secure authentication mechanisms, and traceability of operations.  Architecture studies should also be carried out, in particular the issues between centralized and distributed architectures, service oriented, resource oriented, user oriented approaches. The applications will require the objects to be mobile keeping connectivity through operated network infrastructures and, when required, through spontaneous ad hoc networks between objects as machine-to machine network.  Finally, the designed communication model either between objects or from the objects to the network as Internet, will have to integrate the necessary credentials and security mechanisms again energy and resource aware to ensure information conﬁdentiality, trust, and also privacy. More research issues are detailed in [10, 14, 21].  Regarding the standardization, the Internet of Things can be viewed as a subset of a future Internet in which communication capabilities will become ubiquitous. How- ever, it is widely acknowledged that the Internet of Things suffers from a fragmenta- tion of standards [20]. For example, EPCglobal, ISO as well as Japan’s Ubiquitous   9 Internet of Things: From Real to Virtual World  187  ID Center have deﬁned formats for tag data. At the same time, other organizations have been active in deﬁning local and wide-area network connectivity standards. It is therefore necessary to consider the technology and standards produced in the four areas that are converging and how these technologies can be integrated in a complete system with end-to-end connectivity. For instance, the standardization of sensor networks is relevant to the broader picture of standardization activities in this area. Home networking also provides an example of how RFID, sensor net- works, wireless and ﬁxed  e.g. PLC  communication links and the more familiar applications of the Internet might be integrated. And some of the standards relating to ubiquitous networking in Next Generation Networks  NGN  are relevant in this context. More details are provided in [CHA-10]. Note that the ITU approved new standards concerning the Internet of Things and M2M. Standardization of the IoT is absolutely necessary to ensure interoperability at different layers of the technologies and architectures. ITU’s new standards are an indication of global consensus on the technical environment to strengthen IoT.  For instance, ITU-T Y.2060, “Overview of the Internet of Things”, marks ITU members’ approval of a deﬁnition of IoT, terming it: “A global infrastructure for the Information Society, enabling advanced services by interconnecting  physi- cal and virtual  things based on existing and evolving, interoperable information and communication technologies”. ITU-T Y.2061, “Requirements for support of machine-oriented communication applications in the NGN environment”, provides an overview of machine-oriented communication. ITU-T Y.2063, “Framework of Web of Things”, and Y.2069, “Terms and deﬁnitions for Internet of Things”.  In addition, ITU-T’s new Focus Group on the M2M Service Layer  FG M2M  has just begun its work to identify the standardization demands of a common M2M service layer, focusing initially on the healthcare sector [19].  9.11 Conclusion  We conclude this chapter by saying that after the identiﬁcation of the main Inter- net of Things enabling technologies, the issues, and the challenges, the next step is the design of the network architecture and framework to efﬁciently support the fu- ture Internet of Things applications and this might also shape the future networking concepts and functionalities of the future Internet. Only the future will enlighten us how successful Internet of Things services will be! Meanwhile current society is not very welcoming in the majority for certain services of Internet of Things, especially those services proposing to use RFID technology for some automatic tasks without a clear view of protecting the person’s privacy from person’s tracking or any other privacy related information. But other Internet of Things services are very close to the market as touch a tag applications or sensor-based monitoring services or home networking.   188  References  H.

Chapter 10 Communication Issues in the Internet of Things  IoT   Oladayo Bello and Sherali Zeadally  The Internet of Things  IoT  is a paradigm that is rapidly gaining momentum in the ﬁeld of wireless communication. The enabling factors of this concept are the pervasive and ubiquitous deployment of a wide variety of wireless devices  such as Radio-Frequency IDentiﬁcation  RFID  tags, sensors, actuators, mobile phones  around us. Many of these devices are able to interact communicate with each other to reach common goals. A major driving force behind this promising paradigm is the ability to integrate several different devices, technologies, platforms, and communi- cations solutions. We focus on an analysis of the communication issues that support the IoT ecosystem. First, we review recent standardization efforts on the IoT pro- tocol stack. We compare four recently proposed protocol stacks implemented on resource constrained devices in the IoT. We analyze different types of communi- cation, such as device-to-device, device-to human and device-to-data storage, that need to be supported in the IoT ecosystem. Based on this analysis, we highlight challenges and constraints that need to be addressed at the inter-domain communi- cation level when developing current and future IoT solutions and applications. We also propose solutions that can be developed to address the challenges. Finally, we discuss the impact of emerging technologies on the IoT ecosystem.  O.

Bello and S. Zeadally  The Internet of Things  IoT  is said to be an extension of the Internet into the physi- cal world, in which physical entities  objects devices things  are interconnected [1]. There are already many more “things” than “people” and the integration of the Inter- net with the physical world will be a challenge for the future Internet technology [2]. This will be a challenge because the Internet has been operating with human in- tervention, and the integration of the physical world with the Internet requires a self-conﬁguring network in which devices may have to take decisions and operate without human intervention. The challenges that will need to be addressed include dealing with the identiﬁcation of devices, mobility of wireless devices, providing security and quality communication between devices. The IoT paradigm will make it possible for virtually any device  “thing”  around us to exchange information and work in synergy with each other in order to dramatically increase the quality of our lives [2]. Intelligent day-to-day devices will inter-operate and exchange information between each other seamlessly via the Internet. These devices have sensing capabil- ities and are able to initiate communication or request data to take decisions  human guided or non-human guided decisions . Communication could be device-to-device and device-to human and device simultaneously.  There are several deﬁnitions for the IoT in general. Basically all the deﬁnitions share the fact that the main components of the IoT are the devices or objects, the wired wireless networks and the Internet; and the information knowledge  data  storage facility. Devices are the major building blocks of an IoT ecosystem [3]. They bridge the real world of physical entities with the digital world of the Internet. They have monitoring, sensing, actuation, computation, and processing capabilities. Devices can be classiﬁed as sensors, tags or actuators. Sensors provide information about the physical entity they monitor. The information from sensors can be stored for later retrieval. Tags are specialized sensors known as readers which enable iden- tiﬁcation processes. Actuators can modify the physical state of a physical entity. However, some actual devices are a combination of several of these types. For in- stance, a sensor node often contains both sensors  e.g., movement sensing  as well as actuators  e.g., room-light switch  [3]. The devices are visible and traceable  i.e. they can be monitored and tracked . In addition, the status and current location of the devices can be obtained because they are addressable and have unique identities within the IoT. They are able to interact with each other, access each other’s infor- mation, store, and retrieve data via the Internet in order to create information for different purposes.  The wired or wireless networks include the autonomous ﬁeld networks and the wide area networks. The smart day to day devices in the IoT form part of the short range ﬁeld networks that exist autonomously. These autonomous ﬁeld networks are seamlessly interconnected together via any available long range wired or wireless access network which facilitates access to information available through the Inter- net. Examples of ﬁeld networks are the Radio-Frequency IDentiﬁcation  RFID  networks, where RFID tags, labels, and readers are the devices, wireless sensor networks with sensors and actuators as the devices, and vehicular networks with   10 Communication Issues in the Internet of Things  IoT   191  cars as the devices. Other ﬁeld networks include WiFi  Wireless Fidelity  networks, Bluetooth or ZigBee, where devices may be smart mobile phone, laptops, and home appliances. The third component of the IoT is the information data storage facil- ity including cloud computing environments or a data repository available via the Internet.  Some popular applications areas of the IoT include: smart grid  automatic me- ter reading , home automation, intelligent transport systems, vehicle monitoring and tracking, industrial applications such as inventory, supply chain, retail, logis- tics, healthcare, personal, and public security, and agriculture. References [2, 4, 5], and [6] provide detailed descriptions of these IoT application areas.  Though various research efforts within the academia and industry are actively working on the IoT concept, yet the lack of standards on the architecture of the IoT is deterring major developments. The current status quo is that there is an intranet of things where many islands of ﬁeld networks exist in silos with each providing solutions for different IoT applications. Thus there are only several decentralized architectures and no unifying architecture yet for the IoT. It is explicit that a major attribute of the IoT will be the heterogeneity of network technologies and the hetero- geneity of devices. Another major attribute is the interoperability between network technologies and between devices. Interoperability is the ability of devices or net- works to provide service to and receive services from other devices or networks [7]. These services enable the devices to effectively operate together and collaborate to achieve some common goal in the IoT. The common goal could be that a major decision needs to be taken in the healthcare application or the smart grid system and it requires retrieving information from other devices located elsewhere within the IoT ecosystem. It could also be the case that we need to provide information or data that have been requested. It is expected that the IoT will encompass different types of device. These devices will belong to different ﬁeld networks and operate using different networking standards. In addition, these devices and networks will be ex- pected inter-operate with each other. These two attributes increase the challenge to provide seamless communications within the IoT ecosystem. Efforts that success- fully address the challenging communication issues within the IoT will enable the full beneﬁts of IoT applications to be reaped through successful worldwide and in- teroperable deployments [8]. We therefore focus on major communication issues within the IoT ecosystem to achieve its beneﬁts in a broader context.  Since the advent of the IoT concept, several authors have presented surveys on IoT. For example, Atzori et al. in [9] presented a general survey on the Internet of Things. The authors elaborated extensively on the applications of the IoT and cov- ered issues related to standardization, addressing networking and security privacy in IoT. Atzori et al. discussed issues that need to be addressed to make the IoT concept a success. However, our work takes the survey on IoT further by focus- ing speciﬁcally on the communication issues in the Internet of Things. The goal of this chapter is to provide comprehensive information on the communication issues within the IoT  e.g. device-to-device or device-to-human communication . In partic- ular, we present detailed information on the IoT communication protocol stack, the   192  O. Bello and S.

In addition, we also discuss some of the challenges and research opportunities at the inter-domain communication level of the IoT ecosystem.  The rest of the chapter is organized as follows. In Sect. 10.2, we present a re- view of the standardization efforts on the IoT protocol stack. Section 10.3 discusses a generic IoT communication protocol stack and compares a few recently pro- posed protocol stack models that have been implemented on constrained devices. In Sect. 10.4, we present an analysis of the various types of communication, the expected communication trends and the challenges at the inter-domain communica- tion level within the IoT ecosystem, and we propose solutions to these challenges. This section also provides a discussion of the impact of emerging technologies on the IoT. Finally, Sect. 10.5 presents some concluding remarks.  10.2 Standardization Efforts of the IoT Protocol Stack  The general TCP IP architecture consists of ﬁve layers namely, the application, transport, network, data-link layer, and the physical layer. Although the standardiza- tion effort on the IoT protocol stack is not ﬁnalized, yet there are silos of standards being developed at different levels of the TCP IP model, which are applicable to the IoT. As stated in [10], these standards can be layered on top of one another to form a protocol stack as in Table 10.1. In this section, we provide a brief discussion of each of these applicable standardization efforts and summarize the relevance of each to the IoT.   10 Communication Issues in the Internet of Things  IoT   193  10.2.1 Physical Layer and Media Access Control Layer  IEEE 802.15.4-2006 deﬁnes the PHYsical layer  PHY  and the MAC sublayer spec- iﬁcations for low-data-rate wireless connectivity with ﬁxed, portable, and mobile devices with no battery or very limited battery consumption requirements [11]. The IEEE 802.15.4 is designed to run on closely located low-cost devices, with very low-voltage hardware and with low-speed communication capability including sev- eral types of embedded systems, sensors, and actuators [12]. The communication range of such devices is assumed to be about 10 meters with over-the-air data rates of 250 kbps, 100 kbps, 40 kbps and 20 kbps [11]. According to [11], the devices have been classiﬁed into two basic categories. A device may be a Full-Function Device  FFD  or a Reduced-Function Device  RFD . An FFD can play the role of network coordinator and therefore can communicate with RFDs or other FFDs. FFDs man- age the network and route messages. To keep the RFDs from colliding with each other, FFDs deﬁne ﬁxed, predictable slots for data transmission with the use of a synchronization schedule. An RFD can communicate only with an FFD and cannot become a network coordinator. An RFD is intended for extremely simple applica- tions such as a light switch or a passive infrared sensor. These devices do not have the need to send large amounts of data and may only associate with a single FFD at a time and thus use minimal resources and memory capacity.  As shown in Fig. 10.1, the physical layer provides two services: the PHY data service and the PHY management service. The PHY management service interfaces to the Physical Layer Management Entity  PLME  Service Access Point  SAP   known as the PLME-SAP . The PHY data service enables the transmission and reception of PHY Protocol Data Units  PPDUs  across the physical radio channel. Likewise, the MAC sublayer provides two services: the MAC data service and the MAC management service interfacing to the MAC subLayer Management Entity  MLME  Service Access Point  SAP   known as MLME-SAP . The MAC data ser- vice enables the transmission and reception of MAC Protocol Data Units  MPDUs  across the PHY data service [11].  The PHY layer is responsible for the activation and deactivation of the radio transceiver, Energy Detection  ED  within the current channel, Link Quality In- dicator  LQI  for received packets, channel selection and Clear Channel Assess- ment  CCA . It also enables data transmission and reception across the physical medium [11]. The MAC sublayer is responsible for handling all access to the phys- ical medium using the Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance  CSMA-CA  mechanism for channel access. It generates network beacons if the device is a coordinator and supports device security. In addition, it provides syn- chronization to network beacons, handles, and maintains the Guaranteed Time Slot  GTS  mechanism, performs frame validation, frame delivery acknowledgement, association, and disassociation services.  The IEEE802.15.4e standard deﬁnes the MAC amendment to the IEEE802.15.4- 2006 standard. The major enhancements and functionality added by the 802.15.4e standard is Time Synchronized Channel Hopping  TSCH , which signiﬁcantly in- creases robustness against external interference and persistent multi-path fading.   194  O. Bello and S. Zeadally  Fig. 10.1 IEEE802.15.4-2006 PHY and MAC layers [11]  TSCH allows nodes to send successive packets on different frequencies using a pseudo-random hopping pattern [13] with nodes being synchronized on a com- mon timing pattern. IEEE802.15.4e does not change the data frames format of the IEEE802.15.4-2006, but redeﬁnes the acknowledgment frame and does not use bea- con frames. Time correction is used by a sender node to synchronize the acknowl- edgment received from the receiver.  10.2.2 Adaptation Layer  6LoWPAN   The Internet Protocol Version 6  IPv6  over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks  6LoWPAN  concept originated from the idea that “the Internet Proto- col could and should be applied even to the smallest devices” [14]. 6LoWPAN is a protocol that enables IPv6 packets to be carried over LoWPANs, speciﬁcally IEEE 802.15.4.6. A Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Network  LoWPAN  is a simple low cost communication network that allows wireless connectivity for applications with limited power and throughput requirements [14]. If IP can be applied to small devices then these low-power devices with limited processing capabilities can par- ticipate in the Internet of Things.   10 Communication Issues in the Internet of Things  IoT   195  The 6LowPAN technology adopts PHY and MAC layer standards of IEEE802. 15.4, and IPv6 is chosen as the networking technology. Since the payload length supported by MAC in IPv6 is much bigger than the one provided by 6LowPAN lower layers, to implement the seamless connection of MAC layer and network layer, 6LowPAN working group adds an adaptation layer between the MAC layer and the network layer. The adaptation layer helps to achieve the header compression, fragmentation, and reassembly and mesh route forwarding [14]. As stated in [15], interoperability is one of the very basic requirements of providing IP connectivity to 6LoWPAN.  10.2.3 Network Layer  Routing   The Internet Engineering Task Force  IETF  IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks  RPL  is a routing protocol designed for Low Power and Lossy Wireless Networks  LLNs . A particular instantiation of LLN will be the LoW- PANs [16]. LoWPANs are formed by devices that comply with the IEEE 802.15.4 standard [11]. LLNs consist of constrained nodes with limited processing power, memory, and energy. The nodes are interconnected by links, which may be char- acterized by high loss rates, low data rates and instability [17]. RPL is designed with a consideration to practically support the implementation of IPv6 on devices which operate under severe resource constraints. RPL supports the use of multi- ple paths, where duplicated trafﬁc may be sent along diverse paths. It also supports advanced features such as Class of Service  CoS -based routing, or simple load bal- ancing among a set of paths. Load balancing could be useful when the network needs to spread trafﬁc load and avoid fast energy depletion on some nodes. The design of RPL also supports constraint-based routing based on a set of routing met- rics. Trafﬁc may be directed along the appropriate constrained path based on trafﬁc marking within the IPv6 header. Nodes running RPL can autonomously and inde- pendently discover their network topology, compute and install routes, without re- quiring any further administrative interaction. RPL provides efﬁcient routing paths for three trafﬁc patterns namely, multipoint-to-point, point-to-multipoint, and point- to-point trafﬁc in LLNs [18]. RPL uses a form of Gradient Routing, where nodes acquire a “rank” based on their distance to the collecting node and messages follow the gradient of ranks [13]. Full details about the operations of RPL can be found in [17, 19–21].  10.2.4 Transport Layer  Transmission Control Protocol  TCP   Versus User Datagram Protocol  UDP    TCP  Transmission Control Protocol  is a connection-oriented protocol and uses vir- tual connection sessions between the client and the server to ensure successful and   196  O. Bello and S. Zeadally  reliable delivery of packets. These sessions are created using a handshake mecha- nism between the client and the server. TCP is a protocol that will be inadequate for use in the IoT because of the following reasons:  1. TCP requires data buffering at the source and destination: since IoT devices have very limited memory and energy, TCP cannot be employed efﬁciently in such devices. In [22], Ko et al. provide details on how the limited ﬂash Read Only Memory  ROM  and Random Access Memory  RAM  of a device would limit the implementation of TCP in the IoT.  2. TCP ﬂow control mechanisms are not well suited for low-power and low data  rate devices [23–25].  3. TCP incurs a lot of overheads which are considered too high for short-lived trans-  actions such as those that occur in IoT applications.  4. TCP involves connection set up: since most of the communications within the IoT will involve the exchange of a small amount of data, the connection setup phase will be only for a short portion of the session time, thus a TCP connection setup mechanism will be unnecessary [9]. In addition, the handshake procedure will cause rapid energy depletion in the IoT devices.  5. TCP’s end-to-end congestion control mechanisms: such mechanisms may not be applicable to the IoT because of the wireless medium, which will be mostly used by majority of devices within the IoT and it is already known that the wireless environment is a challenging one for TCP operations [26].  At the transport layer, the User Datagram Protocol  UDP  is the main alternative to TCP. UDP is a simple connectionless protocol and does not require the creation of connection sessions between communicating peers. UDP’s mechanism allows the sending of data without requiring whether or not the data packet has been suc- cessfully or reliably delivered. Some major features of UDP that make it a suitable alternative to TCP for IoT include:  1. UDP does not need to maintain a connection state, so it can be very useful in resource-constrained environments, where memory and energy usage is an issue.  2. UDP does not incur any overhead when compared to TCP. 3. UDP is applicable mainly for real-time performance which is typical of most IoT  applications.  10.2.5 Application Layer  Constrained Application Protocol  CoAP  versus Hypertext Transfer Protocol  HTTP    The Constrained Application Protocol  CoAP  is the IETF Constrained Representa- tional State Transfer  RESTful  Environments  CoRE  Working Group web transfer protocol [27]. CoAP provides several Hypertext Transfer Protocol  HTTP  func- tionalities which have been re-designed for constrained network devices. HTTP is known to rely on TCP while CoAP is built on top of the UDP and therefore has sig- niﬁcantly lower overhead and is capable of multicast support. In addition, the HTTP   10 Communication Issues in the Internet of Things  IoT   197  protocols stack needs to be optimized from scratch for use in constrained devices. However, CoAP is the key technology which has been optimized for accessing con- strained environments devices from Web applications [28]. Other features of the CoAP that are relevant to IoT as stated in [27] include the following.   It is optimized for resource constrained networks typical of IoT applications.   It takes into account the low processing power and energy consumption con- straints of small embedded devices such as sensors.   Message exchanges are asynchronous.   It has low header overhead and parsing complexity.   It uses the Universal Resource Index  URI  and Content-type support. In the con- text of IoT, where device-to-device communication without human intervention may occur, these features allow the representation of different resources on de- vices in XML, HTML, and plain text.   It has simple proxy and caching capabilities. In IoT, with several ﬁeld networks  constrained networks , diverse devices exist and not all of these devices will have the ability to perform all functions. Thus, proxy devices can perform some requests on behalf of other devices. Proxies can also be used to support secu- rity functions for such function-limited devices. CoAP supports the caching of responses in devices so that they can efﬁciently fulﬁll requests.  Table 10.2 presents a summary of the applicability and the relevance of each stan- dard discussed in this section to the IoT.  10.3 Proposed IoT Communication Protocol Stack  Speciﬁcally, the IoT protocol stack must be lightweight in order to support the con- strained devices which are the main components of the IoT ecosystem. It must also allow convenient interoperability between networks. Diverse protocol stacks have been proposed and implemented in some ongoing projects. However, these protocol stacks are quite speciﬁc as they are tailored towards certain applications only. Most of them have chosen some speciﬁc protocol to operate on each layer. A discussion of these protocols at all layers and their relevance to the IoT is provided in Sect. 10.2. In this section, we provide a summary of the functions of each layer of the generic protocol stack presented by Bauer et al., and then state the IoT requirement for each layer. We also discuss some proposed speciﬁc IoT protocol stack, which have been proposed or implemented in resource constrained devices. A comparison of these protocol stack based on the generic stack by Bauer et al. is also presented.  10.3.1 A Generic IoT Protocol Stack  The IoT-A communication protocol model proposed by [3] shown in Fig. 10.2 is comparable to the ISO OSI stack, but focuses more on the IoT system requirements and characteristics. It is a reference communication stack for connecting the IoT   Table 10.2 Summary of the applicability of relevant standards to the IoT  Goal  Feature applicable to IoT Relevance to IoT  198  Applicable standard  CoAP  Provide a generic application layer protocol optimized to meet the special requirements of constrained network devices  UDP  Reduce the overhead for short-lived transactions  IETF RPL  Routing in networks which consists of devices operating under severe resource constraints  Constrained web protocol with low header overhead and parsing complexity.

A summary of the functions and the IoT requirement for each layers is outlined  in Table 10.3.  10.3.2 Application Speciﬁc Protocol Stacks for IoT  The general goal of IoT is to enable smart environments through the creation of applications such as smart buildings, smart energy, smart living  homes , smart health, smart cities, and smart transport. In this sub-section, we discuss a few pro- tocol stacks that have been proposed for devices that will be used in some of the aforementioned applications. These applications will eventually form the fabric of the IoT ecosystem. Speciﬁcally, this section focuses on devices used in creating Wireless Personal Area Networks  WPAN , smart homes  Home Area Networks  HAN  , smart home energy management  including smart grid applications  and smart health  electronic health  e-Health  systems . An analysis of how the protocol stack for each category of devices ﬁts with the generic IoT protocol stack is pre- sented in Table 10.4. The table shows the layers that have been speciﬁed by these protocol stacks compared to the generic IoT protocol stack and the capabilities pro- vided based on the requirement expected of each layer.  10.3.2.1 IEEE 802.15.4 LR-WPAN  Piccolo et al. [22] proposed the protocol stack  shown in Fig. 10.3  which has been deﬁned for IEEE 802.15.4 devices taking into account their hardware constraints. At the MAC layer, IEEE 802.15.4 is used. These modules, which reside above the MAC layer, include the automatic address assignment module, which is introduced as a self-conﬁguring address assignment mechanism and it operates in conjunction   200  O. Bello and S. Zeadally  Table 10.3 Functions and IoT requirements for each layer of the generic IoT protocol stack  Layer  Function  IoT requirement  Physical layer  Performs the same function as deﬁned in the OSI model  Link layer  Addresses the heterogeneity of networking technologies represented in the IoT ecosystem  ID layer  Enables a framework for the IoT by leveraging on uniform interfaces provided by the link layer  Network layer  Provides the same functionalities as that of the OSI stack  End-to-end layer  Data layer  Takes care of translation functionalities, proxies gateways support and tuning conﬁguration parameters when the communication crosses different networking environments Provides a high-level description of the data pertinent to the IoT  It must include any available technology and should not prevent emerging ones from being integrated into the reference model It must allow diversity so that IoT systems can achieve full interoperability It must allow the IoT devices to support heterogeneous technologies and a comprehensive security framework. It has to provide upper layers with uniform interfaces It must allow security, authentication, and high-end services to provide uniform addressing to different devices and technologies in the IoT ecosystem. It must allow device discovery and device capabilities discovery It must support global manageability, interoperability, and scalability, it must provide a common communication paradigm for every possible network within the IoT. It must provide support for multicasting, broadcasting, and quality of service It must provide the ﬁnal building block to achieve a global communication model by enabling reliable message transport and delivery  Enables applications that will allow diverse data integration and its interpretation  with the adaptation layer and the IPv6 LoWPAN module. The protocol stack also in- tegrates the Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector  AODV  routing algorithm to sup- port multihop routing. As stated by Piccolo et al., some of the reasons for selecting AODV are because of its simplicity, low signaling overhead, and low memory load. AODV can also be used for automatic address assignment and duplicate address de-   10 Communication Issues in the Internet of Things  IoT   201  Fig. 10.3 Protocol stack for IEEE 802.15.4 Low Rate Wireless Personal Area Network  LR-WPAN  [22]  Fig. 10.4 Protocol stack for the OMEGA project [29]  tection. A separate module  which interacts with other modules  is implemented to allow automatic network discovery and service discovery procedures.  10.3.2.2 Home Area Network  OMEGA Project   The home area network will play a role in extending the concept of the IoT into homes. Home focused devices  consumer appliances  operating with different tech- nologies can be integrated as a network. Such devices include entertainment devices, communication devices and remote health care devices.  For the Home Area Networking  HAN  environment, Masser et al. introduced another layer between the network and MAC layers of the OSI protocol stack as illustrated in Fig. 10.4. They termed this extra layer a layer 2.5 solution called the Inter-MAC layer. The additional layer deals with the problem of co-existence of di- verse technologies within the heterogeneous home area network. It serves as a global   202  O. Bello and S. Zeadally  resource manager over the heterogeneous technologies in the HAN. The purpose of Inter-MAC is to allow a seamless interaction between upper and lower layers, pro- vide QoS features, secure communication, service continuity, and backward com- patibility [30]. The Inter-MAC layer is technology independent and has technology adapters that translate technology dependent MAC speciﬁc events into technology independent ones. The information received from underlying technologies is used to select the most appropriate one to ﬁt a particular service requirement. Despite the protocol diversity in the upper layers and technology-diversity in the lower layers of the model, the Inter-MAC is a control point that every data ﬂow must pass through. In the OMEGA protocol stack  shown in Fig. 10.4 , the presentation, session, and transport layers are all encapsulated within the middleware layer. The stack also includes a Universal Plug and Play  UPnP  QoS framework which performs discovery of devices in the network and coordinates their collaboration activities in a standard way, allowing simple interoperation among entities. The UPnP QoS framework also provides a standard way for the setup of QoS for trafﬁc ﬂows [29]. More information on the OMEGA project can be found in [29, 31] and [32].  10.3.2.3 Energy Management in Home Appliances  AIM Project   Automating home energy utilization will also contribute to the IoT ecosystem. This application will consist of sensors and actuators that operate remotely to monitor and automatically control home energy consumption in real time.  The AIM project [33] focuses on the development of a uniﬁed technology for managing, monitoring, and controlling the energy consumption of domestic appli- ances in residential environments. Energy consumption information of appliances is collected from the home network. Information is provided to a virtualization layer for energy management services for the residential users [5]. This project concen- trates on white goods  e.g. refrigerators, kitchens, washing machines, and driers , communication devices  e.g. cordless phones and wireless devices for domestic use  and audiovisual equipment  e.g. TV Sets and Set-top-boxes  [33].  The key component of this project is the AIM Gateway which is depicted in Fig. 10.5. For the home network domain, there are additional layers above the trans- port layer  or UDP layer . IP communication is used between the energy saving services of the gateway, user applications, and domestic appliances. The use of IP ensures interoperability across home and wide area networks as well as the deploy- ment of services over any home network infrastructure [34]. The universal energy management protocol offers a uniﬁed way of implementing communication between the AIM Logic and the connected appliances. It introduces a generic message for- mat for control and status commands. The Machine-to-Machine  M2M  interface enables interoperability between different functions supported by the connected ap- pliances [35]. The M2M interface deﬁnes a novel mechanism which enables the gateway to manage all connected devices without the need of user involvement [36]. The Universal Plug and Play  UPnP  protocol allows automated identiﬁcation of the connected appliances. The identiﬁcation includes their function type  fridge,   10 Communication Issues in the Internet of Things  IoT   203  Fig. 10.5 Protocol stack for the AIM project [5]  washing machine, TV, dryer, kitchen, etc.  and supported functions  programs . The bridging function of the UPnP serves all connected appliances simultaneously and acts as a concentrator and a responder of requests coming from the Device Virtu- alization Environment  DVE . An identity management module is responsible for user authentication identiﬁcation and for providing personalized applications to the user [36]. The OSGi is an open, license-free software environment that enables easy and rapid implementation of user services for home applications. It gives program- mers the freedom to add new protocol implementations above the IP stack, thereby enabling creation of application-centric solutions [5]. The DVE is practically a web page through which AIM system users are able to access, monitor, and conﬁgure energy monitoring and management functions. The communication between the gateway services and the home user is realized through Web service calls using HTTP [34].  10.3.2.4 Healthcare Application  The authors of [37] focused on how the IoT can be a suitable framework for e-Health communication and in particular how low-cost and low-power devices can enhance the quality of life of people. This protocol stack, shown in Fig. 10.6, adopts the pro- tocols that have been discussed in Sect. 10.2. As stated by Bui et al., providing data, functionalities, and services as web services allows for a complete horizontalization of the protocol stack across any modern IT system in the health sector.   204  O. Bello and S. Zeadally  Fig. 10.6 Proposed health care application protocol stack [37]  10.3.3 Comparison of Proposed IoT Protocol Stack  Implementations  Table 10.4 shows an analysis of the various protocol stacks discussed in the previous section. This analysis is done in relation to the generic IoT protocol stack presented earlier and the requirement expected of each layer.  10.3.4 Communication in the Internet Versus Communication  in IoT  As we mentioned previously, major beneﬁts of a standard IoT protocol stack in- clude enabling interoperability among IoT applications and the creation of a broad development community through an open process. Since the Internet and the Inter- net of Things have several differences, it is worthwhile pointing out some major differences between communication within the Internet and the IoT. We list some of these differences below.   Communication is between connected devices: in IoT, the bulk of the communi- cation is between the devices within the network. These devices can be described as the users of the network, akin to the way humans are the users in the Internet. Unlike in the Internet, where devices only assist with communication, in IoT, the devices themselves communicate and initiate communication among themselves via other IoT network components.   10 Communication Issues in the Internet of Things  IoT   205  Table 10.4 Comparison of proposed IoT protocol stack implementations  IoT requirement on each layer  Implementation IEEE 802.15.4 LR-WPAN  Home area network  Energy management in home appliances  Health application  Physical layer  Integration of technologies   PHY layer is speciﬁed  Supports the integration of technologies  Speciﬁes the physical interface for technologies such as wireless, Ethernet, and powerline communication Supported by the M2M module.

Bello and S. Zeadally    Automatic communication and interaction between devices without human inter- action: automated communication may happen in IoT without human interaction.   A large number of communicating devices  more than humans : communication within IoT will be between 50–70 billion devices of which only 1 % is connected today [4] based on the assumption that every human is surrounded by ∼10 de- vices on average. In fact, Cisco IBSG in [38] shows that there are already more connected devices than humans. It was also predicted that there will be 25 billion devices connected to the Internet by 2015 and 50 billion by 2020.   Number of connected communicating devices increases: the number of devices within the IoT will continually increase with hardware improvements, and the size of devices gets reduced below the threshold of visibility to the human eye. These devices may be mobile  e.g. health application devices  or stationary and will be of highly heterogeneous.   The number of devices-triggered communication will be higher than the number of human-triggered communication.   The services supported differ from those of the Internet: the Internet and the IoT differ also in the types of service they support. In the Internet, the services sup- ported are human-centered  e.g., the World Wide Web  WWW , email, ﬁle trans- fer and sharing, video, chatting, telephony, and online shopping . In the IoT, the services that will be provided will be device-centered and will almost completely exclude humans from direct intervention [39]. Such services include tracking of items, alarm triggers, exchange of near real time physical world information  temperature, humidity  for monitoring purposes, automated and real time video applications  such as in Intelligent Transportation Service  ITS  . In most IoT- applications, smart devices communicate amongst each other and with computers over the Internet and when users need to be involved  e.g., for decision making  it will be via personal computers and mobile phones [39, 40].   IoT imposes new trafﬁc pattern: the trafﬁc in the IoT network involves queries about unique identiﬁers which will be many times higher than typical DNS queries in the current Internet [2].   Existence of the heterogeneity of communicating devices: in the Internet, the com- munication is between collections of rather uniform devices. However, in the IoT ecosystem, devices of totally different functionality, technology, and application ﬁelds will belong to the same communication environment [41]. Therefore, het- erogeneous network technologies are expected to be able to inter-operate while heterogeneous devices are expected to be able to communicate.  10.4 Communication Within the IoT Ecosystem  10.4.1 Types of Communication in the IoT  Generally, the literature on IoT focuses on all or one of the three main areas that describes it: the devices  things , the network, and the information  data . By con- sidering the IoT reference model presented in [3], we abstract the three areas of   10 Communication Issues in the Internet of Things  IoT   207  Fig. 10.7 Representation of the components within the IoT  focus of this research paper. The IoT reference model presented in [3] captures and deﬁnes the integral models that make up the IoT ecosystem. These models are the domain model  describes the entities objects within the IoT , the information model  deals with the retrieval and storage of information  and the communication model  deﬁnes the communication paradigm for connecting the entities deﬁned in the do- main model .   Sensing or Perception Level: The sensing or perception level consists of passive and active ﬁeld devices. All of these or some of these devices are the intelligent objects or things that collect and gather physical information such as tempera- ture, humidity etc. The interconnection of these devices forms the ﬁeld network such as RFID networks, sensor networks, etc. These ﬁeld networks are termed constrained networks because the nodes that constitute the network are limited in terms of resources such as computational power, memory, and energy and data rate. A constrained network is deﬁned as a network of devices with restricted capabilities regarding storage, computing power, and or transfer rate [1].   Communication Level: This layer is composed of the communication technolo- gies and topologies that facilitate for the transportation of data from the percep- tion layer  sensing devices  to the management layer through the use of the In- ternet protocol. These include the Long Term Evolution  LTE , 3G, Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access  WiMAX , Zigbee etc. These technolo- gies need to be reliable, have high data rates and interwork with each other. The gateway is located at this level. In Fig. 10.7, the Internet and Wide Area Net- work  WAN  are networks that enable the connection of devices in different con- strained networks. The communication level is divided into intra-domain com-   208  O. Bello and S. Zeadally  munication or inter-domain communication. Intra-domain communication refers to communication that occurs between devices in the same constrained network. Inter-domain communication refers to communication between devices in differ- ent constrained networks and is facilitated by the IoT gateway.   Management Level: This layer is mainly responsible for storing, analyzing, and processing the information received from the devices through the communication level. This layer deals with large quantities of things  devices  and information. It manages and processes potentially large data sets. The main components of the Management Layer may include databases, intelligent processors, cloud comput- ing, and ubiquitous computing.   Constrained Networks: These are networks formed by constrained devices  e.g. sensors, actuators, mobile devices, RFID tags , and the communication between the devices can be based on different protocols and require additional processing at the gateways. The nodes that constitute the network are limited in terms of resources such as computational power, memory, energy, and data rate [3]. The characteristics of each network can have a signiﬁcant impact on the overall end- to-end communication.   Unconstrained Networks: These are networks that are of high resources capacity, coverage, transfer rates and of different technologies and architectures [1]. An unconstrained network connects several constrained networks and retrieves data from the constrained networks via the IoT gateways.   Gateway: The gateway is the core network element within the IoT. It facilitates the communication and data exchanges between devices. It can handle incoming and outgoing trafﬁc of the unconstrained and constrained networks. IoT gateways have the interface of the constrained and the unconstrained networks. They under- stand the addressing format between these networks. The Internet and WAN are networks that enable the connection of devices in different constrained networks and the collection and storage of data from the devices at the management level.  This work discusses the communication issues  as depicted in Fig. 10.7  with a focus on how data trafﬁc will be exchanged at the inter-domain communication sub-level. According to [8], the IoT is expected to interconnect an incredibly high number of devices. These devices will initiate communication through the creation of data con- tent  generation of data trafﬁc , retrieval of stored data content  create a demand for data trafﬁc , and the exchange of data. The trafﬁc generated as a result of the com- munication could be for the purpose of fulﬁlling the major requests from devices in varying IoT applications areas  e.g. healthcare, transport, or logistics applications . Therefore, it is pertinent to study the manner in which the network resources will be managed among the trafﬁc generated. As stated in [9], diverse trafﬁc will be gener- ated within the IoT and since it is expected that the pattern of such data trafﬁc will be signiﬁcantly different from those observed in the current Internet, the charac- teristics of the trafﬁc is completely unknown. The trafﬁc pattern complexity within the IoT arises from the fact that the large amount of data trafﬁc that will traverse the network will be generated by heterogeneous devices which have been deployed for different IoT applications areas such as the smart grid, telemetry, and healthcare applications.   10 Communication Issues in the Internet of Things  IoT   209  As mentioned earlier, one of the major challenges of communication within the IoT is the co-existence of heterogeneous technologies in terms of the devices and the networks. These technologies are expected to be able to inter-operate seam- lessly. Thus, the IoT has to be able to support interoperability between existing and emerging technologies.  Due to the existence of several types of IoT application, diverse communication trends also exist in the IoT. These trends, which are presented in [2] are analyzed  in Table 10.5  in terms of the IoT network elements that will be involved, the purpose of the communication, and the type of communication.  Trafﬁc is generated for different purposes  as outlined in Table 10.5  and the information or data communicated for these purposes could be stored data or real- time data. The communication process in IoT generates different types of trafﬁc  as shown in Fig. 10.8 . Before an interaction can exchange, retrieve or store informa- tion, a series of requests and responses are performed between the devices involved. Such interactions could be event-driven or polling-based. An interaction would be event-driven if it is triggered by the occurrence of a particular event, and it will be polling-based if it takes place in predeﬁned time intervals [5]. Such information can generate different types of trafﬁc with varying delay or throughput depending on whether the trafﬁc is generated by a time-critical or life-critical application  e.g., obtaining real time health information of a patient . Signaling operations are exe- cuted before request and response communication messages are exchanged between devices in the IoT ecosystem as depicted in Fig. 10.9.  10.4.2 Inter-domain Communication Within the IoT: Challenges  and Opportunities  In this section, we present some of the issues, challenges, and opportunities at the inter-domain communication level within the IoT ecosystem that we have identiﬁed.  10.4.2.1 Lack of a Standardized Framework for the IoT Protocol Stack  The lack of a standard for the IoT protocol stack leads to incompatible products and applications for the IoT. Moreover, the lack of standard is also a barrier to the integration of several IoT technologies into a homogeneous IoT ecosystem. Several recent efforts have proposed IoT frameworks and architectures, but there is still no universal agreement on a uniﬁed, standard architecture. The number of communica- tion technologies, from high speed backbone networks to access technologies such as WiFi or Bluetooth and data gathering technologies such as sensor networks con- tinue to proliferate at a fast pace. This trend is likely to continue and has prompted the emergence of the IoT concept [42]. Therefore, a pragmatic approach to the de- velopment of standards, architectures, and protocol that can handle the diversity in the IoT ecosystem is needed.   210  O. Bello and S.

Existing communication protocols are inadequate in meeting the requirements of the IoT paradigm. It is expected that the IoT will exhibit a much higher level of hetero- geneity than the Internet because devices of totally different functionality, technol- ogy, and application ﬁelds will belong to the same communication environment [6]. Within the same ﬁeld network, the intra-communication processes among devices may not be as challenging because the devices’ communication architecture oper-   10 Communication Issues in the Internet of Things  IoT   211  Fig. 10.8 Generic communication process between devices in IoT  Fig. 10.9 Representation of a generic signaling operation between IoT network devices  ates using similar standards. However, in the case of inter-communication among, several challenges still remain to be addressed. The IoT paradigm will compose of diverse devices operating with varying communication standards, thus communi- cation protocols that will enable inter-domain communication and interoperability among all devices are required. In some cases, the communication protocol must have security features, be energy efﬁcient and also have localization or distance   212  O. Bello and S. Zeadally  measurement capabilities [39]. Protocols are also needed to provide and support reliable message delivery mechanisms which can be used by the IoT applications that require it [5]. Since the IoT ecosystem will include several constrained devices and communication between the devices can be based on different protocols, it may be desirable to develop open and generic communication protocols. These protocols may serve to bridge between different protocol stacks of autonomous ﬁeld networks.  10.4.2.3 Scalable Resource Management Protocols  Network resources are being stretched to their limits as more devices are added to the IoT ecosystem and the amount of trafﬁc generated increases. This is because the number of devices that need to communicate with each other will be at least an order of magnitude larger than the devices connected to the current Internet [2, 42]. Efﬁcient mechanism should be in place to manage and handle the trafﬁc explosion caused by the retrieval and exchange of information at the inter-domain communi- cation level within the IoT. Such mechanisms should be able to optimize and per- form fair allocation of network resources for the trafﬁc generated by different IoT applications. In addition, the mechanisms should be scalable in order to meet the ever-increasing trafﬁc demand. To efﬁciently allocate, manage, and optimize net- work resources at the IoT gateway, the inclusion of a control layer as a vertical or horizontal component within the protocol stack should be able to handle dynamic resource management for the trafﬁc generated by the communication processes and the signaling operations.  10.4.2.4 Signaling Trafﬁc  As illustrated in Fig. 10.3, the data exchange, storage, and retrieval processes re- quire signaling support. Since the amount of connected devices is expected to in- crease, the push pull of information data will also increase the number of requests and responses associated with the setup and tearing down of sessions. Thus, it is expected that there will be an increase in the signaling trafﬁc between devices and the IoT gateway which will worsen congestion at the IoT gateway  in addition to congestion caused by autonomous ﬁeld networks . Scalable algorithms need to be developed to manage signaling trafﬁc during communication within the IoT. Such algorithms may take advantage of information from other layers by using cross lay- ered techniques. Moreover, in order to reduce the delay experienced during the sig- naling operations within the IoT, signaling channels of cellular networks could also be used to carry the signaling trafﬁc generated by IoT devices.  10.4.2.5 Quality of Service  Apart from security, addressing identiﬁcation, billing, and location, Quality of Ser- vices  QoS  for trafﬁc within the IoT is also a major concern. Different QoS levels   10 Communication Issues in the Internet of Things  IoT   213  need to be supported for various types of trafﬁc [44]. To ensure QoS for trafﬁc, it is necessary to be able to identify, differentiate, and prioritize trafﬁc ﬂows. Trafﬁc differentiation could be done by classifying trafﬁc based on their delay and through- put requirements. For trafﬁc identiﬁcation, devices should be able to append special headers which provide information about the kind of trafﬁc being transported. In addition, the gateways must also be able to interpret the headers. Prioritization may be based on different schemes, which may use different criteria to classify trafﬁc. For example, a prioritization scheme may be based on the level of criticality of applications. Such applications may be classiﬁed as time sensitive, life-critical or normal applications. QoS is an issue because different devices enable different IoT applications and belong to different ﬁeld networks. In addition, as stated in [3], it is important to be able to distinguish between communication interactions that involve humans and those that only happen between non-human entities  e.g. devices . In an interaction that involves human, it is important to address the quality of the commu- nication in terms of QoS, quality of the data and the Quality of Experience  QoE  as judged by humans [45]. In the case of interactions between devices QoE is not normally assessed but meeting QoS requirements and having data with good quality could make a difference in the decision to be taken within an IoT application  e.g. healthcare, transport or smart grid .  10.4.2.6 New Trafﬁc Management Protocols for Buffering, Queuing,  and Scheduling of Trafﬁc at the IoT Gateway  For adequate QoS provisioning, trafﬁc management protocols are needed within the IoT gateway. These protocols need to employ relevant mechanisms for buffer- ing, queuing, and scheduling trafﬁc during inter-domain communications in order to ensure and maintain QoS and the quality of data. To improve QoS for trafﬁc within the IoT, content-based scheduling within the IoT gateway is recommended. Content-based scheduling is a technique that schedules trafﬁc based on their data content. For example, trafﬁc that contains a security related information or health related information may be prioritized in the scheduling process. In a content-based scheduling system, trafﬁc may be represented as data object. The system can com- prise an identiﬁer generator, which generates an identiﬁer for the data object on the basis of its data content and the identiﬁer gives information about the impor- tance of each data objects waiting to be scheduled. In this way, the system is able to schedule trafﬁc based on the data sensitivity and delay tolerance of the requesting application [43].  10.4.2.7 Maintaining Connectivity Within the IoT While Trafﬁc Is Generated  in Real Time  An example would be maintaining connectivity in scenarios where devices are wire- lessly connected, mobile, and permanently attached to human. Such devices may   214  O. Bello and S. Zeadally  experience intermittent connectivity to the network, which may not be favorable for the IoT application. It is also worth noting that instances where some devices within the IoT ecosystem may not be able to connect directly to their ﬁeld network’s sink or access point or the IoT gateway are likely to occur. In such situations we will have to rely on other devices that have more reliable connectivity. Therefore, communica- tion protocols, which are resilient to disruption within the network, are needed. The communication protocols may be connectivity-aware or connectivity-based proto- cols in which connectivity is taken as a function of other underlying network fac- tors such as interference, mobility, energy-level, etc. To ensure connectivity, it is therefore desirable to deploy connectivity-aware protocols based on opportunistic paradigms to allow seamless connectivity between IoT devices.  10.4.2.8 Energy-Efﬁcient Communication Protocol  Communication protocols in IoT will be required to be energy savvy and energy efﬁcient. Devices may have to maintain inter-domain communication links for a fairly long period of time and in addition may be required to relay information for other devices within the network  e.g. in some sensor networks . An energy-efﬁcient communication protocol will allow devices to be able to retain connectivity for a longer period. It is also important that communication protocols employ minimal signaling operation between devices so as to efﬁciently utilize the battery power of IoT devices.  10.4.3 Impact of Emerging Technologies on the IoT  IoT encompasses a diverse range of technologies  existing and emerging , systems and applications that constantly are being developed [4]. Although these technolo- gies and applications are heterogeneous in nature, they will be seamlessly intercon- nected and interoperable through the capabilities provided by the IoT ecosystem. As new technologies evolve, the trend will be for them to be a part of the IoT ecosys- tem. New devices will be developed with capabilities that will ensure that they can operate within the IoT. We discuss below the impact of emerging technologies on IoT deployment and adoption.  Machine-to-Machine  M2M  communication, cloud computing, IPv6, and the evolution of miniature devices are some of the emerging technologies that are really going to spur the integration of IoT into different facets of our lives. The opportuni- ties that these technologies present are motivating the adoption of IoT applications. It is well known that M2M communication is one of the major drivers and an es- sential part of the IoT concept. The term M2M refers to systems that enable devices to communicate with back-end information systems and or directly with other de- vices, in order to exchange or access real-time data [5]. These devices can be seen as the IoT end-points and therefore facilitating reliable and secure communication   10 Communication Issues in the Internet of Things  IoT   215  between them is essential for the IoT ecosystem. Most industries such as the retail, transport  road, automobile, and vehicle tracking , logistics, consumer electronics, health, home security, industrial automation  the use of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition  SCADA   and energy  smart grid  make use of diverse devices such as sensors, actuators for some form of data collection or the other. These de- vices are less visible and even more pervasive than personal communication devices. Therefore, connecting them together using the M2M communication concept will make it possible to achieve the IoT objective, which is to enable devices to share in- formation seamlessly in order to ease operational processes and improve the quality of decisions being made. The IoT will allow the interoperability of these heteroge- neous devices.  The concept of cloud computing offers a dynamic way of accumulating and stor- ing huge volume of data. Typically, cloud computing can offer infrastructure, plat- forms or software as a service to less resource capable devices [46, 47]. The majority of the IoT devices are generally constrained in terms of resources such as memory and these devices are required to churn-out information almost every time. Cloud computing provides data storage capacity for large volumes of data produced and also eases the process of data access and data analysis for decision making anytime. In addition, the security of data can be well managed through the cloud thereby im- proving data quality. The evolution in the area of network processor architectures will increase processing power and thus leads to massive parallel processing of data through the cloud computing infrastructure at low cost.  IoT will greatly beneﬁt from the rapid deployment of IPv6 [4, 48]. The adoption of IPv6 into the IoT protocol stack is another main driver that will make it possible to connect 50 to 100 billion devices by 2020 as envisaged. It will be the basis for which every device within the IoT ecosystem will have a unique address for identiﬁcation purposes.  In the area of devices, the evolution of tags such as the RFID and the minia- turization of devices will also enable the adoption and implementation of the IoT concept. In addition, new generation devices with low-power and energy harvest- ing capabilities continue to evolve. The development of ultra low-power processors and microcontrollers’ cores will enable the design and production of such devices. These future devices will integrate different communication standards and proto- cols, operate at different frequencies and allow different architectures  centralized or distributed . This will make seamless inter-communication between devices pos- sible as global and well deﬁned standards emerge [6].  10.5 Conclusion  IoT has been receiving a lot of attention in the last couple of years. The interest in IoT continues to be strong because there are still many challenges that need to be addressed as we pointed our earlier. In this work, we focus on communication issues within the IoT. Our analysis reviewed recent protocol stack standardization efforts   216  O. Bello and S. Zeadally  for the IoT. We discuss the requirements imposed by constrained devices on the layers of the IoT protocol stack. We also present the various types of communication and communication trends we expect in the IoT ecosystem. We identiﬁed some of the forthcoming challenges at the inter-domain communication level within the IoT ecosystem.  The various analyses we present in this work are necessary to enable the de- velopment and the deployment of the IoT in a broader context. In particular, the communication challenges outlined in this work are of utmost importance. If these challenges are not addressed with innovative solutions, the IoT ecosystem will be affected by network congestion, reduced reliability of communication processes, re- duced quality of data information and low QoS for the various types of trafﬁc gener- ated and delivered. These issues will in turn affect the efﬁcacy of the IoT ecosystem in general.  References  1. Bassi, A.  2011 . IoT-A: main architectural reference model concepts.

Chapter 11 Machine-to-Machine Communications  Thomas Bourgeau, Hakima Chaouchi, and Pinar Kirci  11.1 Introduction  Machine-to-machine  M2M , or machine-type communication  MTC  as it is named by the cellular networks community, refers to data communication between ma- chines in an autonomous way meaning without human intervention [12]. These ma- chines are electronic devices such as computers, smart sensors or mobile devices that have the ability to compute and communicate autonomously through different access network technologies. Network technologies differ from short range commu- nication such as Zigbee, Bluetooth, and WiFi to wide area network such as wired xDSL, and ﬁber FTTH, or wireless such as 3G, and LTE. These are all possible facilities to enable available and seamless connectivity among communicating ma- chines. It is clear that in M2M network, one has to face heterogeneity of devices and networks. Therefore, one of the key points of the M2M success to harmonize standards and technologies between this wide range of organization and business actors to realize a seamless and ubiquitous communication modules for smart ob- jects. Note that a common M2M architecture is not yet envisioned. However, each designed architecture shares similar key concepts and features as the aim of M2M is to allow different kinds of device as sensors to send information to the network to other devices or applications. Also, devices as actuators should receive actions from the network. Other features should exist, such as supporting huge amount of nodes  T.

Bourgeau et al.  with power efﬁciency solution on devices and seamless inter-operability between different network technologies with self-organization of autonomous smart devices. The idea of M2M communication is not new as it began in the early 2000s with several industrial proposals and research papers [18, 30]. Nowadays, semiconduc- tor industry has achieved chips size miniaturization, thus making electronic devices cheaper and more efﬁcient. Furthermore, the advance in network technologies has brought a seamless communication anywhere and anytime allowing ubiquitous con- nectivity for the connected machines. It is important to mention before going further, that the M2M concept can be seen as a subset of functionalities necessary for the design of some Internet of Things applications. This means that Internet of Things has to be seen as a much broader concept than M2M communication, as it involves different other technologies such as nanotechnology, robotics, artiﬁcial intelligence, etc. It is worth mentioning that in the literature sometimes those two concepts, M2M and IoT, are presented as almost synonyms [2].  What makes M2M communication important lately, is the various market re- search forecasts [26], where it has been estimated that by the end of 2020 there will be 50 billion connected devices worldwide; thinking mainly about sensor nodes and RFID tags in addition to the classical devices as phones or computers. These pre- dictions might be seen as great opportunities to business verticals as it offers new possibilities for new stakeholders entrants, it also offers new revenue possibilities for diverse industrial actors such as operators, manufacturer, service providers, etc. Despite its impacts on user daily life and business actors, leveraging the current network infrastructure to the scale of a billion of seamless communication devices poses new challenges and important technological changes.  M2M have already started to emerge in various sectors and M2M systems ﬁnds application in many different areas such as ehealth, smart grid, security, automo- tive, telemetric, smart homes, environmental monitoring, industrial automation, to mention a few of them [15, 40]. Each of these applications imposes their own re- quirements in terms of power, bandwidth, latency, security, and mobility. For ex- ample, smart grid application would require ﬁxed meters that interacts with low power sensor devices that are tolerant to low bandwidth and high latency in case of aggregating monitoring energy consumption. Automotive application such as crash detection needs to be mobile with cellular access and are not tolerant to low latency as it is an emergency application.  As showed in [7, 15], M2M architecture might be decomposed in three main domains. The M2M device domain is dedicated to making devices communicate in the same domain through different kinds of wired or wireless network technologies. This can be done through a capillary networks such as an ad-hoc mesh network or a dedicated M2M Gateway can be the central aggregation point. As devices may use different kinds of network technologies  802.11, Zigbee, PLC , the M2M Gateway will have a central role to make these protocols interoperate. The M2M network domain is the link between the M2M device domain and the outside world. In fact, devices have several possibilities for sending data either through the M2M gateway that is connected directly to the M2M network domain using an access network technology  FTTH, ADSL, etc.  or by connecting directly to M2M core network   11 Machine-to-Machine Communications  223  through cellular technology  3G, LTE, WiMax, etc. . Finally, the Application do- main serves at delivering end user services or server applications to analyze and react to receive device information. As described in [26, 37], the M2M application domain is connected to the M2M network or can be embedded in the cloud. Cloud- based application using Big Data analytics are becoming popular in various M2M services offerings  Smart Grid, eHealth, etc.  as it offers affordable and scalable so- lution for storing and analyzing M2M data. As we will see throughout this chapter, M2M communication brings new challenges and opportunities to support a world of interconnected automated electronic devices. However, this new trend of commu- nications address key issues such as scalability, interoperability, privacy, and power consumption, which have to be addressed to make this technology widely adopted.  11.2 M2M Enabling Technologies  M2M is based on very common and ubiquitously used technologies such as wireless sensors, mobile networks, and the Internet network.  Among the available technologies to serve machine-to-machine communications are either wired such as Ethernet, xDSL, Fiber, PLC, and wireless technologies such as WiFi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, but also and more recently wireless cellular networks such as 3G and beyond. In this section we will provide very brieﬂy the most impor- tant aspects of these technologies. It is important to mention that depending on the available machine’s resources, the processing and the communication, technologies will differ. The machine-to-machine-based applications and services will rely on the choice of the appropriate machines type and communication support.  Regarding the cellular networks, brieﬂy, the ﬁrst generation  1G  mobile net- works developed in North America is the AMPS network  Advanced Mobile Phone System . It is based on FDM multiplexing  Frequency Division Multiplexing . A data service was then added on the telephone network, it is the CDPD network  Cellular Digital Packet Data . It uses TDM multiplexing  Time Division Multiplex- ing . The network could offer a rate of 19.2 kbps and exploit periods of inactivity of traditional voice channels to carry data.  The second generation  2G  mobile network is mainly GSM  Global System for Mobile Communications . It was ﬁrst introduced in Europe and then in the rest of the world. Another second-generation network is the PCS network  Personal Communi- cations Service  or IS-136 and IS-95; PCS was developed in the United States. The standard IS-136 uses TDMA  Time Division Multiple Access  while the IS-95 stan- dard uses CDMA  Code Division Multiple Access  for sharing the radio resource. The GSM and PCS IS-136 employ dedicated channels for data transmission.  The ITU  International Telecommunication Union  has developed a set of stan- dards for mobile telecommunications system of third generation  3G  network under the IMT-2000  International Mobile Telecommunication-2000  for creating a global network. They are scheduled to operate in the frequency band around 2 GHz and   224  T. Bourgeau et al.  Fig. 11.1 The evolution of cellular networks  offer data transmission rates up to 2 Mbps. In Europe, ETSI  European Telecommu- nications Standards Institute  has standardized UMTS  Universal Mobile Telecom- munications Systems  as the third generation network.  The fourth generation of mobile networks is already here. The ITU has stated the ﬂow expected by this generation should be around 1 Gbps static and 100 Mbps on mobility, no matter which technology or mechanism adopted.  In order to meet the requirements of 4G LTE-Advanced such as peak data rates of up to 1 Gbit s, more spectrum bands are needed. Besides the existing carriers for 3G networks, spectrum bands located at 450–470 MHz, 698–790 MHz, 2.3–2.4 GHz, and 3.4–3.6 GHz can be used for the deployment of LTE and LTE-Advanced net- works [9, 42]. Moreover, LTE-Advanced has been deﬁned to support scalable carrier bandwidth exceeding 20 MHz, potentially up to 100 MHz, in a variety of carriers for deployments. The current RAN for LTE-Advanced consists of a single node, i.e., the eNodeB  eNB , which provides the user plane and control plane protocol terminations towards the user equipment  UE .  Figure 11.1 gives an idea of evolving standards of cellular networks. Despite their diversity, their goal has always been the same; it is to build a network capable of car- rying both voice and data respecting the QoS, security, and above all cheaper service for the user as well as for the operator. Now, they have also to consider transporting M2M related applications’ trafﬁc which goes beyond Human-to-Human communi- cation. As billion of devices may be connected, the cellular networks have to be adapted to this kind of heavy loaded network. To enhance and help design future radio devices and core network without changing the entire equipments, employ- ing Software Deﬁne Radio  SDR  [35] may be a reasonable choice as new radio’s operating features and capability at the physical layer can be added through pro- grammable ﬁrmware with no needs for new hardware. Furthermore, dynamic spec- trum management through cognitive radio [24] could also beneﬁt to new cellular M2M technologies.  In parallel to cellular networks, many standards for wireless communication are being developed day after day as well as the price of their equipments becomes very attractive  see Table 11.1 . Such characteristic will contribute to the success of these technologies. We show in the following brieﬂy the IEEE standards that are the basis of many wireless networks and will also serve for machine-to-machine communications.  To these machine-to-machine cellular and wireless technologies we can add radio frequency communication  RFID  that aim to introduce automatic identiﬁcation. Special attention has to be given to sensor and RFID technologies in the design of   11 Machine-to-Machine Communications  225  Table 11.1 The different IEEE 802 standards Standard Description  802.11a  802.11b  802.11e  802.11f  802.11g  802.11i  802.11k  This standard is an amendment to the IEEE 802.11 speciﬁcation that added a higher throughput of up to 54 Mbit s by using the 5 GHz band. IEEE 802.11a speciﬁes eight operating channels in this band of frequency.  This standard uses the radio signaling frequency  2.4 GHz  as the original 802.11 standard with 13 channels in France. This standard allows a range of 300 m in an outdoor environment.  This standard deﬁnes a set of Quality of Service enhancements for wireless LAN applications through modiﬁcations to the Media Access Control  MAC  layer. Such enhancement allow the best transmission quality for voice and video applications  IEEE 802.11F or Inter-Access Point Protocol is a recommendation that describes an optional extension to IEEE 802.11 that provides wireless access-point communications among multi-vendor systems. This protocol allows the users to change their access point when handover occurs. This was replaced by IEEE 802.11r which is proposing fast authentication and thus fast handover during mobility.  IEEE 802.11 is a set of standards for wireless local area network  WLAN  computer communication operating in the 5 GHz and 2.4 GHz public spectrum bands.  IEEE 802.11i is an amendment to the IEEE 802.11 standard specifying security mechanisms for wireless networks. IEEE 802.11i makes use of the Advanced Encryption Standard  AES  block cipher, whereas WEP and WPA use the RC4 stream cipher. It proposes different type of encryption protocols for transmission.  IEEE 802.11k-2008 is an amendment to IEEE 802.11-2007 standard for radio resource management. It deﬁnes and exposes radio and network information to facilitate the management and maintenance of a mobile Wireless LAN. In a network conforming to 802.11k, if the AP having the strongest signal is loaded to its full capacity, a wireless device is connected to one of the underutilized APs. Even though the signal may be weaker, the overall throughput is greater because more efﬁcient use is made of the network resources  802.11n  802.11n is a proposed amendment which improves upon the previous 802.11 standards by adding multiple-input multiple-output  MIMO  and many other newer features. It improves signiﬁcantly network throughput increase in the maximum raw  PHY  data rate from 54 Mbit s to a maximum of 600 Mbit s.  802.15.1  It speciﬁes the Bluetooth technology  802.15.3  IEEE 802.15.3a is an attempt to provide a higher speed UWB  Ultra-Wide Band  physical layer enhancement amendment to IEEE 802.15.3 for applications which involve imaging and multimedia.  802.15.4  It is the basis for the ZigBee, WirelessHART, and MiWi speciﬁcation, which further attempts to offer a complete networking. It offers a low data rate with a low price.   226  Table 11.1  Continued   Standard Description  T. Bourgeau et al.  802.16a  IEEE 802.16a speciﬁes the global deployment of broadband Wireless Metropolitan Area Networks. It delivers a point to multipoint capability in the 2–11 GHz band. The standard is extended to include Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex  OFDM  and Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access  OFDMA .  802.16d  Revision standard for the 802.16, 802.16a standards  802.16e  This standard adds the mobility capability to the IEEE 802.16d by adding advanced features to the MAC and PHY layers.  802.16p Machine-to-machine Working Group  802.20  802.21  802.22  IEEE 802.20 or Mobile Broadband Wireless Access  MBWA  enables worldwide deployment of affordable, ubiquitous, always-on, and interoperable multi-vendor mobile broadband wireless access networks that meet the needs of business and residential end user markets.  IEEE 802.21 or Media Independent Handover  MIH  is developing standards to enable handover and interoperability between heterogeneous network types including both 802 and non-802 networks.  IEEE 802.22Wireless Regional Area Networks  WRAN  aim is to develop a standard for a cognitive radio-based PHY MAC air interface for use by license-exempt devices on a non-interfering basis in spectrum that is allocated to the TV Broadcast Service.  machine-to-machine-based services [8]. Recent efforts combine both by designing an RFID sensor device at a cheap cost. Note the billion of devices expected in the M2M era are precisely related to sensors and RFIDs, but other devices are also possible. These technologies are very short range, and need to rely on multihop techniques to ensure connectivity; they can also rely on the available large coverage networks such as cellular networks. In one case or another M2M architecture will be different [12]. Also, one of the consequences is to adapt the core network to receive the expected trafﬁc from a big number of machines. This would be under the condition that the network cellular operator should adapt its business model to welcome the trafﬁc generated by a huge number of machines without disturbing the classical available services on these networks.  Wireless sensor networks  WSNs , gain ever increasing attention because of the developments in sensor technology. In many applications like medium, disaster, bat- tleﬁeld supervision, and tracking, WSN is preferred as a convenient, economic, and functional solution. In emergency situations, determining the target sensor positions are so crucial, to be able to manage the catastrophic facts or save affected peoples’ lives. During these incidents, with the help of the data collected from the sensor nodes that know their positions, this may be used for monitoring, redirecting, and conducting. Device or machine localization and positioning are among the important   11 Machine-to-Machine Communications  227  functionalities to be supported in the M2M architecture. In [31], the authors present possible localization techniques by combining RFID and sensor technologies.  The sensors in a WSN are used to sense and gain speciﬁc data about an area considering the outlying circumstances around themselves, also to convert these collected data into signals to transmit and process. The distributed sensor nodes transmit the gathered information to the sink over a multihop structure on the sensor ﬁeld. WSN is widely used in many areas like security, health, distributed computing, stock monitoring, and collecting information about temperature, motion or voice and rescue managements. In a WSN there might be thousands of sensors collecting, processing, and transmitting data. A sensor node is composed of many functional parts like sensing part, processor, transmitter, mobilizer, position ﬁnding system, and power units.  In addition to these wireless technologies, Power Line Communication technolo- gies  PLC  [4] are used to transmit communication signals, at high or low bit rate, on the electrical support of the so-called “indoor” or “in-home” environment, that is to say, in any electrical network known as “private” as opposed to electrical networks using medium or high voltage and operated by electrical power providers. The great advantage of PLC technologies lies in the simplicity of its implementation since it uses existing electrical network and makes any electrical access communicating. These technologies have grown signiﬁcantly in recent years with the success of In- ternet access offerings such as “triple-play”  Internet, phone, TV  and the provision of “Internet box” by ISPs, these boxes require “indoor” technologies to be connected in networks. The proposed theoretical speeds can raise up to 200 Mbps for Home- Plug AV standard and 14 Mbps for HomePlug 1.0 standard. As PLC technologies provides ubiquitous access to the network through the electric grid it should be a major candidate in the area of Smart Homes and Smart Grid applications.  Note that home networks to be managed by a femtocell [11, 41], a miniature cellular base-station connected to an IP-based backhaul with support of local net- work protocols, are already found within the home. Mobile devices would no longer need to support multiple physical links because they could connect to the femtocell with their cellular radio interface. The femtocell would then serve as M2M Gateway between the deployed sensors and the backhaul network.  11.3 M2M Architectures  M2M architectures need to be designed to support the new type of trafﬁc generated by massively connected devices. For instance, the sensor with all measurable param- eters  location, pressure, speed, temperature, etc.  converts the analog signal onto a digital interface. The data are being aggregated for further transmission, encrypted, and sent via wireless  WIFI, GPRS, UMTS, LTE, etc.  or wire line  LAN, etc. . It is also necessary to allow remote problem detection with terminals and the possibility to reboot update ﬁrmware remotely as well.   228  T. Bourgeau et al.  Different features should be fulﬁlled in designing M2M architecture depending on the application, thus the optimization and the subscription pricing should be adapted by the service provider depending on the type of requirement needed [26]. Some of the M2M requirements are listed here; interested readers can found more detail in [12, 32, 40]:   Latency: M2M application such as smart grid are not requiring high latency as the monitored information can be aggregated and sent later on. However, extremely low latency is mandatory for any emergency situation  ehealth, Intelligent Trans- port System  where the information has to be sent straight away after detection of emergency situation.   Bandwidth: Regarding this feature, M2M application’s data structure and amount will deﬁne the bandwidth needed. For instance in simple sensor network, min- imum bandwidth might be sufﬁcient to send few bytes of captured temperature or pressure. However, a high bandwidth will be needed if high quality captured video data are transported.   Reliability: connectivity and reliable transmission must be guaranteed regardless of operating environment  e.g., mobility, channel quality . This feature is required in emergency situations or scenarios where privacy is extremely important  e.g., healthcare, remote payment .   Access priority: Some application may need access priority for some kinds of emergency situation. For example, a security alarm signal should be sent with higher priority than the temperature information in the home. Moreover, the need to adapt the network to a varying capacity requirement in real time is another example of access priority requirement. Thus the M2M QoS requirement has to be speciﬁcally addressed, depending on the use cases and services to offer.   Power consumption: devices that have no or limited access to power sources, waking only on demand, experiencing infrequent human or system interaction, require updates to control signaling, idle, and sleep mode, link adaptation, and uplink  UL  power control.   Mobility: Many M2M use cases involve stationary or low mobility devices  e.g., payment, metering, and retail . It provides simpliﬁed or optimized mobility man- agement in order to reduce power consumption and signaling overhead. Changes to the signaling related to handover preparation and execution may be required to take advantage of low no mobility.   Scalability: A simultaneous transmission attempt to the access network’s base station from an extremely large number of M2M devices is a great challenge. It requires enhancements to the network entry re-entry and bandwidth request protocols, link adaptation,  hybrid  automatic repeat request, and changes in the frame structure. Addressing extremely large numbers of devices may require ex- tending the addressing space or updating the addressing scheme.   Security: The nature of M2M deployments makes the deployed system vulnera- ble to attacks on hardware and software ﬁrmware, compromise of credentials and conﬁguration, and network attacks  e.g., hacking and denial of service . The de- vices may be physically corrupt by changing its hardware if they are accessible and they can also be compromised by remote access when conﬁguration occurs.   11 Machine-to-Machine Communications  229  Moreover, for application such as ehealth, metering, the system should employ cryptographic and authentication features to make private data transfer more se- cure.   Trafﬁc control: M2M trafﬁc has to be controlled to enables power saving reduc- tions in the bandwidth request, and network access, by using idle sleep mode protocols. Time-tolerant trafﬁc can support signiﬁcant delays in data transmis- sion and reception. This implies that the system can give lower access priority to or defer data transmission of time-tolerant trafﬁc. Furthermore, devices can be conﬁgured to only send data to a sink node or a server; this one-way trafﬁc may require changes to the network entry and addressing protocols which would enable simpliﬁcations to the bandwidth request allocation protocol. Infrequent trafﬁc may enable sleep idle mode improvements that save power and channel resources.  The literature regarding the possible M2M architectures is divided into two ap- proaches, one is distributed without any infrastructure interaction between the con- nected machines, and one is centralized by connecting each machine to the infras- tructure either in a wired or in a wireless cellular way. Both M2M distributed and centralized approaches might use a speciﬁc M2M gateway to connect to the in- frastructure mainly via wired or wireless cellular networks as these technologies are offering large connectivity coverage. In case where M2M gateways are not used, the end-to-end M2M communication approach is desirable. It is also possible to build a hybrid architecture combining both distributed and centralized approaches depend- ing on the applications’ needs. The distributed approach is also named capillary M2M; either wired or wireless cellular capillary architecture. The gateway-based M2M architecture is hierarchical.  Capillary M2M wireless cellular network includes mostly embedded design, and short-range communication between machines. Power consumption is a major issue as we cannot generalize the harvesting mechanism. Wireless sensor network is a good example of a capillary wireless M2M network. It is including different aspects of the M2M network, such as small devices aware of power consumption optimiza- tion, networking techniques such as efﬁcient multihop routing, and efﬁcient data processing.  Non-capillary M2M networks as wired or cellular M2M on the other hand as-  sume connectivity of each machine to the infrastructure.  Note that large cells provide ubiquitous coverage to M2M devices and support high mobility; while smaller network elements such as relays and pico femto ac- cess points  APs  bring connectivity closer to the devices, improving link reliability and increasing system capacity [3]. The lower cost of smaller APs makes them an attractive method of adding capacity.  Both capillary and non-capillary M2M architectures might use M2M gate- ways [15, 41] to connect to another network such as Internet. These gateways need to support one or more of the local network protocols as well as the backhaul con- nection to the Internet. The backhaul connection may be Ethernet, cable, DSL, ﬁber, or cellular, or local networks  802.15.4  ZigBee , 802.11  WiFi , Bluetooth . The   230  T. Bourgeau et al.  Fig. 11.2 Gateway-based M2M architecture [5]  Fig. 11.3 IETF-based capillary M2M  6LOWPAN  and end-to-end-based architecture  gateways need to support also other functionalities such as capillary routing, net- work address translation, M2M management and control, security, etc. Figures 11.2 and 11.3 show examples of gateway-based and end-to-end-based M2M architec- tures.   11 Machine-to-Machine Communications  231  In M2M architectures, M2M devices have very low power requirements, and devices are expected to last years, without replacement of batteries. One applied rule is that battery power devices should be in sleep mode or consume low power [33]. Devices can remain in sleep mode for a long time until an event occurs. Long sleep cycles have a signiﬁcant impact on M2M routing algorithms. In order to con- serve energy, the IETF ROLL [38] working group recommends that the home net- work avoid using any battery powered devices for routing. When battery powered devices are used for routing, the network topology will continuously change due to nodes going into and out of sleep. Other events, such as changes to the RF channel and the movement of devices through the home, will also change network topology; such as ZigBee, which uses an Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector  AODV  rout- ing protocol. Many low power protocols, in a network that uses AODV, with nodes that are not a part of active communication paths neither maintain any routing in- formation nor participate in any periodic routing table exchanges. Routing can be established on availability basis where the routes can be based on whatever nodes are awake and able to communicate. Nodes that are not part of active communica- tions can sleep while the rest of the network communicates. Additionally, the device that initiates the information exchange performs most of the computational work in the routing protocol. Finally, the application and services are located at the edge of the core network or embedded in the Internet when offering cloud-based ser- vice [8, 28]. The application servers are dedicated to gather data of the devices and offers services to users such as data analytics. Furthermore, the service application can also contact M2M devices such as actuators to react to triggers or changed event sent by sensors.  11.4 M2M Applications  We focus our description on a subset of possible applications such as smart grid, ehealth, intelligent transport systems, vehicular, security, and remote control [12, 40].  11.4.1 Smart Grid  A smart grid [14, 28] refers to an electrical grid that integrates communications technology in the energy providers and consumer utilities in order to monitor and control the delivery and usage of distributed energy. Some keyed smart grid appli- cations are distribution network automation, smart homes or smart metering.  Electricity providers can improve the reliability, efﬁciency, and sustainability of their production and distribution in regard to the real consumption demand. For decentralized power generation such as wind power and solar panels, the smart grid offers monitoring information, billing, and accounting and brokerage services for   232  T. Bourgeau et al.  third party operators. In the context of smart homes, connected devices and sensors can monitor the overall energetic consumption as electric power, gas, and water to enable enhanced energy management.  New solutions based upon the use of wireless and cellular networks as UMTS, the use of wired networks as Power line Communications, and xDSL enable smart me- ters to transmit their metering data, receive tariff information and provide additional information to customers. The P2P-based communication model is also selected to ease data exchange and exploitation.  Smart meters are immobile devices with very long maintenance intervals  sev- eral years , which is a real challenge for maintenance issues. The current design of smart grid has a light requirement on latency as energy consumption can be aggre- gate in smart meters before being sent. However, future smart power grids might offer much shorter latency  time intervals  with the ability to control and adapt the power grid faster. The issue related to robustness, distributed architecture, and se- cure data transfer should hold in order to cover the demands on smart metering, energy management, and electric mobility. The home area network may hold many potential protocols for the communicating devices and the connection to the smart meter  M2M Gateway  could cope with several short-range wireless technologies such as WiFi, PLC Home-Plug, ZigBee, or even 3G 4G if used with femtocell tech- nology.  11.4.2 eHealth  eHealth refers to medical services offered remotely to enhance the quality of patient care while reducing healthcare cost. The sensors devices can monitor the patients’ health state as heart beat rate and blood pressure and report changes of the patient’s physical condition directly to the hospital network. Exchange of medical data be- tween patients, doctors, and medical groups lower transaction’s cost, and improves patient care. Services include telemedicine, emergency monitoring or shared care information.  This is an M2M application where reliable high-speed connectivity such as 4G cellular is required. Medical sensors have diverse resource limitations, includ- ing power, sensing, communications, and computation. The device information on blood pressure and heart beat rate, can be aggregated in the device and transmitted as bulk results for long term analysis. However, the device could react to emergency events implying stronger requirements on latency and transmission reliability. These applications necessitate having access priority and short latency as they are critical to the health of the patient. In terms of data transfer, the aggregation of monitor- ing data will not produce heavy bandwidth requirement on the network, but access priority must be addressed and security must be addressed for safety and billing reasons [22].   11 Machine-to-Machine Communications  233  11.4.3 Intelligent Transport Systems  ITS   ITS reﬂects the use of communicating devices to enhance transport efﬁciency and security. For instance trafﬁc and speed cameras can be connected to motorways ser- vices to inform users about trafﬁc jams or accidents. Traceability and logistics are also possible use cases allowing tracking assets location, to optimize ﬂeet manage- ment, to monitor critical parameters as temperature, GPS position, and movement and report transportation courses.  For this type of application, strong requirements are related to latency and mo- bility. In case of cameras’ usage, they may require simultaneous secure local wire- less local area network  WLAN  connectivity to the next camera down the road when measuring average speed for instance. Mobility issue such as fast handover and roaming agreements should be addressed as assets can move through dif- ferent countries that allow diverse cellular technologies. Moreover, security is of paramount interest as the sensors may be easily accessible. Preventing theft and leverage sensors remote access for maintenance are mandatory features for these applications [37].  11.4.4 Vehicular  Most vehicular applications use various devices and communication technologies to offer services that ﬁt into the following: diagnostics, security, safety, entertainment or navigation. Diagnostics of car failure can be captured by sensors and diagnostics information that can be relayed to mechanic staff. Automatic crash notiﬁcation can be detected by car sensors and location of the accident sent to the emergency service. Furthermore, vehicular telematics can automate motorway crossing billing when cars are identiﬁed by using for instance RFID technology [10].  Many vehicular M2M applications require a combination of short-range low- power low-throughput wireless access such as Zigbee for sensing processes and local connectivity within the vehicle, and long-range low-latency high-throughput wireless access such as 3G 4G for reporting functions and Internet access for media content services.  11.4.5 Public Safety  Public safety illustrates all possible cases of private and public surveillance appli- cations where control devices monitor a dedicated area and transmit constantly or report any trigger events to a control center. The devices can be video cameras, in- trusion sensors, or locker. The requirements on public safety applications should enforce high reliability  for intrusion detection, the device should continue to work   234  T. Bourgeau et al.  even if a burglar cut electric power , low latency  alerts may be sent as soon as trig- gering events are detected , low mobility  normally the sensor devices as camera are located in a deﬁned area  and high bandwidth  video streaming  [23].  11.4.6 Remote Control  Remote control refers to the ability to control remote actuators as industrial ma- chines, lights, heating systems using the information received from sensing devices as industrial sensors, temperature sensors, light detectors. The applications can be deployed in the industry to control industrial process or in the private area to create smart home scenarios where the home environment is fully automated. For instance, Zodianet Zibase solution offers to control different sensors at home remotely via its mobile phone [43]. The application provider has to offer secure, reliable, and easy to use solutions to facilitate user adoption.  11.5 M2M Standardization  M2M as shown earlier covers a wide range of applications, including smart me- tering, healthcare monitoring, ﬂeet management, tracking, remote security sensing, and on-demand business-charging transactions. Note that there are many types of M2M device, running various M2M applications, thus generating trafﬁc in the net- work. Current wireless networks are optimally designed for human-to-human  H2H  communications, but less so for M2M. Many challenges for Wireless M2M have to be faced. Just as in H2H networks, M2M networks need to be reliable, scalable, secure, and manageable. An important number of devices need to be supported in a M2M network more than in a H2H-based network. Consequently, optimizations are needed to avoid network congestion and system overload. Note that trafﬁc pat- terns of M2M devices are quite different from those of H2H networks. Also, M2M devices might frequently access the network, only to transmit small bursts of data. It is necessary also to adapt and optimize resource management and allocation for low-mobility or ﬁxed devices and offer advanced mechanisms for security. It is also important to minimize battery power usage for low-power M2M devices. Finally, one of the objectives is to offer M2M services and devices at a low cost level, mean- ing that M2M open new challenge in subscription management and billing. All the above mentioned requirements and challenges need to be solved but also standard- ized to ensure interoperability and ease of use of the M2M devices and applications. M2M development concerns both the device processing, the air interface and network architecture, device, and network manageability, but also the services and applications. Each of these concerns are addressed in different standardization bod- ies such as 3GPP [1] responsible for UMTS, LTE and LTE-A, IEEE [19] cover- ing the 802.16 Wireless MAN  mobileWiMAX , the 802.11.x LAN MAN wireless   11 Machine-to-Machine Communications  235  and the 802.15 WPAN standards, European Telecommunications Standards Institute  ETSI  [13], the Telecommunications Industry Association  TIA  [34], the Wi-Fi Alliance  WFA  [39], the GSM Association  GSMA  [16], the Open Mobile Al- liance  OMA  [29], and the ITU [21].  Standardizing aims at establishing a set of common software and hardware plat- forms to substantially reduce development costs and ensure device interoperability and service ﬂexibility. Horizontal developments in the M2M industry are essential for realizing the ubiquitous computing vision. For M2M to be successful, the de- velopment of new technologies that scale with the growth of M2M markets, and a broad standardization effort in system interfaces, network architecture, and imple- mentation platforms are needed.  The standardization process starts with the enhancements related to ﬁrmware and software such as medium access control modiﬁcations to adapt to the huge number of machines accessing the media. The standardization follows with more extensive modiﬁcations to the PHY and MAC, which will accommodate advanced require- ments such as those for the M2M gateway, which serves as a bridge between multi- ple protocols. M2M is dependent on many technologies across multiple industries. In such a heterogeneous context, standardization is signiﬁcantly needed to ensure interoperability and ease of deployment, and usage of M2M-based networks and applications.  As summarized in [15], 3GPP2 is a partnership project developing global speciﬁ- cations based upon the ANSI TIA EIA-41 network. Three major activities in 3GPP2 are related to the M2M work developing an M2M study report, investigating the im- pact of existing numbering schemes used as device and subscription identities for M2M devices over a code division multiple access  CDMA  network, and working on network enhancements to accommodate future M2M devices. In October 2010, the 3GPP2 Service and System Aspects Technical Speciﬁcation Group  TSG-S  completed the draft of the study report on “Machine-to-Machine  M2M  Commu- nications for 3GPP2 Networks”.  The scope of the S.R0141-0 report is to evaluate the aspects of M2M communi- cations required to ensure that the 3GPP2 infrastructure is a viable communication network alternative for M2M business segments. Note that this study of M2M com- munications is focused on exploiting the characteristics of the M2M data communi- cation services on 3GPP2 networks, and is not for speciﬁc M2M applications. The study also reports that architectural enhancements, such as various M2M communi- cation models, need to be considered for efﬁcient network operation.  Another M2M activity at the 3GPP2 Steering Committee  SC  level is to in- vestigate the impact on the current addressing and numbering schemes due to the presence of a large number of M2M devices in the cdma2000 network. The scope of this work includes investigating M2M numbering issues and coordinating with industrial M2M committees. Some of the issues that are under discussion include the “Subscription ID” in the packet-switching domain, the “Calling Number” for M2M devices, and coordination with the Alliance for Telecommunications Indus- try Solutions  ATIS  on the efﬁciency of International Mobile Equipment Identity  IMEI  assignment.   236  T. Bourgeau et al.  In the IEEE 802 LAN MAN Standards Committee as described in [7], several task groups  TGs  are addressing the impact of M2M communication on the radio access network. The IEEE 802.16p TG aims at enhancing of the mobile WiMAX base standards IEEE 802.16e and IEEE 802.16m for M2M, identifying a number of requirements for mainly MAC-related functions such as network entry, group, and device addressing, etc. Other working groups addressing M2M communications include IEEE 802.11 and IEEE 802.15.4, which is the base standard for the ZigBee standard family used in sensor networks.  Note that IEEE 802.16p was formally approved as an 802.16 task group in  November 2010 and had been expected to complete its standard by July 2012.  The unique requirements that 802.16p is intended to address low power con- sumption, a large number of devices, short-burst transmissions, and device tam- pering, detection, and reporting. The IEEE 802.16p-10 0005 “Machine-to-Machine  M2M  Communications Technical Report” has been completed [7, 27].  The ETSI Technical Committee  TC  M2M was created in January 2009, which aims to provide an end-to-end view of M2M standardization. The ETSI TC M2M standardization work mainly focuses on the service middleware underlying layer and network transmission technologies. M2M services will be implemented on top of the M2M service platform, M2M gateway, and M2M terminals. To support a wide range of M2M applications, the ETSI TC M2M is deﬁning a set of standardized service capabilities that provide functions that are shared by these different M2M applications.  In addition to these telecommunication standardization bodies, there are mainly three other major standards that have been deﬁned for facilitating the applica- tion layer multimedia discovering, searching, and sharing in home M2M net- works: UPnP [36], DLNA [32], and Intelligent Grouping and Resource Sharing  IGRS  [20]. The standard speciﬁcations aim to build a world of connected machines and enable a ﬂexible multimedia sharing environment for mainly home machine-to- machine networks.  As described in [41], UPnP is deﬁned by the UPnP Forum, which is organized by a number of vendors in the ﬁelds of electronics, computation, home automa- tion, appliances, computer, mobile services, security, and entertainment. UPnP is essentially a technology in the application layer with the support of TCP IP proto- col stacks in the lower layers. There are two logical devices in UPnP: controlled devices  CDs  and control points  CPs . When a new device is added to a network, it will ﬁrst obtain its IP address and then advertise its services to CPs via a multi- cast Simple Service Discovery Protocol  SSDP . The DLNA standard is essentially an intermediate layer based on the original network framework. In particular, the DLNA Home Networked Device Interoperability Guidelines adopt the UPnP AV architecture for media management and control between networked devices. The key of the DLNA protocol is media management. DLNA deﬁnes two classes of me- dia format: compulsory and optional. The DLNA standard deﬁnes two main classes of device: digital media servers  DMSs  and digital media players  DMPs . Finally, IGRS intends to offer seamless resource sharing and service collaboration among devices for communication terminals, core protocols, application proﬁles, and basic   11 Machine-to-Machine Communications  237  applications. One of the key features of IGRS is taking into account the security issue.  In addition, ITU-T’s new Focus Group on the M2M Service Layer  FG M2M  has just begun its work to identify the standardization demands of a common M2M service layer, focusing initially on the healthcare sector. More details on standard- ization activities are described in [12, 15].  11.6 M2M Open Issues  Every new and pervasive technology presents challenges in implementation, deploy- ment, and exploitation. M2M deployment challenges are mainly related to the areas of reliability, robustness, latency, security, privacy, authorization, heterogeneity, and cost. Data security is one of the most important considerations while designing an M2M solution as it has to be considered in every phase of the development. It is ex- pected that advanced solutions including “security-on-chip” will be developed [6]. Note that devices should be able to communicate over short distances using less power, or over long distances using bridges with power supply. Good data process- ing capability is required, with support for real time processes, and device miniatur- ization will also help in large scale deployment of M2M system.  Flexibility is another requirement, which can allow easy and unobtrusive recon- ﬁguration. Efﬁcient middleware is required which can allow for on the ﬂy reconﬁg- uration of the sensor network or remote maintenance of devices.  Communication dominates energy consumption, and energy efﬁciency can be increased by wisely adjusting transmission power  to the minimal necessary level , and carefully applying algorithmic and distributed computing techniques to design efﬁcient communication protocols  e.g., routing protocols [7, 25] . Mobile cellular systems are primarily designed for human communication. Challenges which arise from the different M2M trafﬁc types are the scaling issue and deployment charac- teristics.  The evolution of cellular systems for M2M is expected to increase in data volume and, more important, number of connections. M2M trafﬁc in conjunction with the massive number of devices raises a wide range of requirements on mobility, latency, reliability, security, and power consumption.  Unlike traditional human-to-human  H2H  services, such as voice and web streaming, M2M services often have very different requirements on a communi- cation system due to their speciﬁc features. For example, the mass of expected con- nected devices cannot hold in the current cellular deployment.  Different M2M architectures are possible; either wired or wireless cellular capil- lary or non-capillary networks using a speciﬁc gateway or following an end-to-end approach. The main objective of all these architectures is to offer reliable, secure, and seamless end-to-end M2M communication and services. One of the major chal- lenges to M2M as mentioned in the previous section is the standardization facing the heterogeneity involved in the system. Currently, there is no global consensus   238  T. Bourgeau et al.  of cross standardization among all players. As mentioned in a recent survey [26], collaboration among standardization bodies leads to a high expectation to allow seamless and ubiquitous M2M communication.  From a business point of view [26], Telco cites partnerships as the biggest chal- lenge to M2M success as the M2M value chain should span all business verticals such as electronic design, network access providers or application service providers. Developing partnerships with other ecosystem players is the biggest challenge that must be overcome in order for operators to succeed in the M2M space. Working out a viable business model is another important challenge even without mentioning that all these efforts should be supported by convincing end users of the beneﬁts of adopting M2M services and applications because someone has to pay for it. Over the next following years, we expect more and more M2M applications  New challenges for LTE-Advanced cellular networks [9] are demanding signif- icant improvements in the efﬁciency of radio resource utilization. Meanwhile, new M2M services have to have little or even no impact on existing human-to-human services in cellular networks.  The evolution of the devices design is also important, as it intends to improve the energy consumption and the processing resources. For instance, usage of future elec- tronic devices such as MEMS  Micro Electro Mechanical Systems  and nanosensors will improve performance, and reduce latency and cost [17]. Furthermore, MEMS and nanotechnology can enable sensors and actuators to be miniaturized, allowing for easy deployment. An important new class of low data rate machine-to-machine  M2M  devices is a key to this highly connected home. Finally, the recent trends in cloud computing encompass the standard vision of client-to-server application with a ﬂexible approach allowing dedicated resources on the ﬂy. As M2M services would require big data analytics and large storage requirements, the cloud comput- ing approach is well situated to offer the best of broad integrated service for the end user.  11.7 Conclusion  Based on the promising M2M market forecast, network operators  ﬁxed and mobile  have foreseen the interest of getting such technology and applications in the com- munication chain by introducing new connected devices interacting with existing ones such as mobile phones, allowing developing new services; thus generating new revenues with the new trafﬁc transported by these networks. The technical issues re- lated to integrating M2M devices in the existing network  e.g. Internet, cellular, etc.  such as the complexity of including a big number of devices generating small packets in a random way  e.g. trafﬁc routing, securing, etc.  are left to the research community and the standardization bodies. At this point only few applications can emerge such as home automation, smart grid, etc. and trigger some actions keeping the network model unchanged as the Internet, and not facing yet the scalability and heterogeneity problems of connecting a billion of different machines as expected by the M2M market.   11 Machine-to-Machine Communications  239  M2M paradigm brings new challenges in both the vertical and horizontal M2M value chain. The M2M vertical value chain consists of providing users with global M2M solutions resulting as the union of several market actors such as electronic device makers, network operators, service application builders. Its technical chal- lenges regard how these different actors will design generic solution within one service. The constraints are mainly interoperability, sustainability, and pricing of their approach. On the other hand, each M2M horizontal value chain will have to address technological issues to several M2M solutions. For the device maker, power consumption, security of assets, and self-conﬁgured devices should be enhanced. The network actors have to enhance the network solution with new techniques that would cope with the scale of M2M communication. Moreover, seamless and ubiq- uitous communication should be possible to allow M2M devices to inter-operate through different communication protocols  Zigbee, 802.11, 3G, etc. . Finally, the application business model should take into account the privacy issues when using data collected at user side and also design solutions that necessitate minimum oper- ation for the end-user. Several standardization organizations  3GPP, ETSI, IETF, etc.  are addressing most of the above mentioned challenges but no harmoniza- tion between these different standards has been planned as to offer a generic M2M framework.

Chapter 12 Security in Emerging 4G Networks  Jacques Bou Abdo, Hakima Chaouchi, and Jacques Demerjian  12.1 Fundamentals in Wireless Networks’ Security  12.1.1 Introduction  Wireless networks and security might be perceived as oxymoron. Indeed it is hard to believe in security when it is so easy to access the communication media such as wireless radio media. However, the research community in industry and academia has for many years extended wired-based security mechanisms or developed new security mechanisms and security protocols to sustain this marriage between wire- less mobile networks and security. Note that the mobile communication market is signiﬁcantly growing for different services and not only mobile phone service. That why securing wireless and mobile communications is crucial for the perennial of the deployment of services over these networks.  Wireless and mobile communication networks have had tremendous success in today’s communication market, both in general and professional usage. In fact, get- ting communication services anytime, anywhere, and on the move has been an es- sential need expressed by connected people. This becomes true thanks to the evo- lution of communication technologies from wired to wireless and mobile technolo- gies, but also the miniaturization of terminals. Offering services to users on the move  J.B. Abdo  B   Notre Dame University, Deir el Qamar, Lebanon e-mail: Jbouabdo@ndu.edu.lb  H.

Abdo et al.  has signiﬁcantly improved productivity for professionals and ﬂexibility for general users. However, we cannot ignore the existence of important inherent vulnerabil- ities of these unwired communication systems, which gives the network security discipline a key role in convincing users to trust the usage of these unwired commu- nication systems supported by security mechanisms.  Privacy, integrity, conﬁdentiality, and other security concerns were considered optional and upgradable features in the design of legacy technologies, as it was easier to develop architectures and protocols without the security constraint. Even when stricter features were implemented  ex: using cryptography in GSM , many laws worldwide were not yet available to accept these upgrades [32–34]. On the contrary, Emerging technologies are being developed having security as a core con- cern and built-in feature and the new designed systems compose with security from the start. The development environment for securing emerging mobile technologies is based on:   Experience from previously developed technologies.   Highly tested cryptographic algorithms.   Sufﬁcient computation capabilities at client mobile side.   Identiﬁed security needs of the communicating entities.  Against all expectations, emerging mobile technologies have proven to be severely vulnerable and these vulnerabilities are becoming increasingly expensive due to the increase in transported assets.  Network’s overall security level is directly proportional to two parameters, user security level  communicating peers  and access network technology security level. Each of the above parameters can be subdivided into speciﬁc measurement points. Security of the core network is considered as high, since it is seen as a black box from the point of view of access of users. User security measurement points are:   Capability of implementing complex computation  ex: cryptographic computa- tion .   Used Applications.   Release Rate of correction patches Access network security measurement points are:   Access medium’s susceptibility against eavesdropping and active attacks.   Network heterogeneity.  The latest mobile network technology, EPS  Evolved Packet System-4G  scores  low in the network security related measurement points as shown in Table 12.1.  This chapter discusses the emerging 4G security threats and mechanisms. First we identify the areas of generic threats applied to wireless networks. Then we present state-of-the-art attacks against 4G networks categorized into peer side and network side attacks.  Later we conclude by describing possible threats in future underdevelopment  technologies.   12 Security in Emerging 4G Networks  245  Table 12.1 EPS Security measurement points evaluation  Measurement point  High Low  Comment  Susceptibility against attacks Network heterogeneity  Low  Low  EPS uses the air interface as access medium, which is susceptible to passive and active attacks [24] The adaptation of hotspots and HeNBs will decrease EPS’s score, since backward compatibility forces EPS to accept handover requests from predecessor technologies and support vulnerable algorithms [33].  12.1.2 Basic Concepts  When it comes to secure a system, it is about mainly ensuring its availability, access control, conﬁdentiality, integrity, and authentication. The standard X.800 [X800] deﬁnes the security properties, services, and mechanisms.  It is commonly known that security threats are due to the inherent vulnerabilities that are spread across all layers in a system, from hardware up to application layer. These vulnerabilities differ by the difference in the type and the properties of the studied system  stand-alone operating system, network connection, etc. .  Wireless and mobile networks features are client mobility, low processing capa- bilities, delay sensitivity, power limitation, and using a vulnerable communication channel  air interface . Any vulnerability exploitation can breach at least one of se- curity’s generic attributes, which will be deﬁned next as well as its application in mobile networks; this will be used as an introduction to the emerging attacks on 4G networks. More information about generic security concepts in mobile networks can be found in [24].  Security has generic features which are applicable in all studied systems. In this chapter, we will only identify the important features in mobile communication se- curity:   Conﬁdentiality: “The property that information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities or processes” [24]. AS  Access Stratum  and NAS  Non-Access Stratum  Conﬁdentiality is ensured in 3GPP  3rd Gen- eration Partnership Program  using generated keys and cryptographic mecha- nisms [15, 33], while GUTI  Globally Unique Temporary Identity  and RNTI  Radio Network Temporary Identity  are used to ensure identity conﬁdentiality. More on conﬁdentiality is discussed in Sect. 12.1.2.2.   Integrity: “The property that the message is not altered by a third party” [33]. More on integrity is discussed in Sect. 12.1.2.1.   Proof-of-origin: “The property that the received message is indeed sent by the intended sender origin” [33]. More on integrity is discussed in Sect. 12.1.2.1.   Availability: “The property of being accessible and usable upon demand by an authorized entity” [24]. Attacks against availability focus on preventing the user from acquiring a new channel  reserving all possible subcarriers, ﬂooding the shared medium, etc. , dropping reserved channels  jamming  or attracting users   246  J.B. Abdo et al.   masquerading as legitimate eNB  evolved Node B  with very good signal and drop any handover requests causing the users to lose their reserved channels . More on Availability is shown in Sect. 12.2.2.1.   Non-repudiation: “The property that the sender cannot later deny having sent a message” [33]. Non-repudiation is considered outside the scope of this chapter, because all the proposed techniques are purely cryptographic and applicable in any communication technology. More on non-repudiation is found in [24].   Identiﬁcation and authentication: “Identiﬁcation refers to an entity  user, equip- ment  claiming its identity by providing an identiﬁer  name, pseudonym, email address, IP address, domain name , or the procedure to ﬁnd the identity of a user among N users known by the systems under several features” [24]. The attacker can identify himself with a victim’s legitimate identity  masquerading attack . It is up to the destination node to make sure that the requester’s identity is con- founded with the presented. “Authenticity is the property of being able to conﬁrm the claimed identity” [24]. More on identiﬁcation and authentication is discussed in Sect. 12.1.2.3.   Trust: Trust is a vital aspect in security, where no secure connection can be es- tablished in absence of trust. Example: PKI  Public Key Infrastructures  certiﬁ- cates cannot be used securely, unless signed by a trusted CA  Certiﬁcation Au- thority . In any coverage area belonging to a commercial network, users from different operators exist. Users trust neither each other nor the serving network and vice versa [29]. Inter-operator communication falls under the “minimal trust” policy [33]. More on trust is discussed in Sect. 12.1.2.4.  Integrity is the state where the read information is confounded with the information written by the legitimate sender. Integrity can be ensured in transmitted data, stored data, established session, etc. and for each of these situations a different integrity deﬁnition can be stated.  12.1.2.1 Integrity  Data Integrity  3GPP has ensured the integrity of transmitted data using NAS  Non-Access Stra- tum  and AS  Access Stratum  integrity mechanisms [15]. After ﬁnishing the au- thentication and key agreement mechanism, UE  User Equipment  and MME  Mo- bility Management Entity  share a key “KASME” which will be used to generate AS and NAS integrity keys  KUPint and KNASint, respectively  as shown in Fig. 12.1. Since EPS was designed to be a long term evolution, 3GPP has implemented modu- lar selection mechanism to choose among available integrity protection algorithms. New integrity algorithms can be adopted with no modiﬁcation on the selection mechanism. UE and eNB select the best suiting algorithm common to both by shar- ing the EIA  EPS Integrity algorithm  code of the supported. Each EPS Integrity   12 Security in Emerging 4G Networks  247  Fig. 12.1 Key hierarchy in E-UTRAN [15]  Algorithm  EIA  will be assigned a 4-bit identiﬁer. Currently, the following values have been deﬁned [15]:   “00002” EIA0 Null Integrity Protection algorithm   “00012” 128-EIA1 SNOW 3G   “00102” 128-EIA2 AES   “00112” 128-EIA3 ZUC  Proof-of-Origin  The transmitted data might not get modiﬁed, but these data can be routed to an un- intended receiver. “Proof-of-origin is the state where the communicating parties are same as what they are expecting”. Although it is not an integrity feature, the result of breaching “proof-of-origin” affects the overall integrity of a connection. New attacks breaching proof-of-origin EPS AKA  Evolved Packet System Authentica- tion and Key Agreement  [3, 15] have recently been proposed where the successful attacker can masquerade [24] the identity of a victim user.  12.1.2.2 Conﬁdentiality  As stated in Sect. 12.1.2, conﬁdentiality is “The property that information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities or processes”. It is not sufﬁcient to ensure conﬁdentiality of the transmitted data, but also the identity of the destination peer and control plane messages  such as GUTI reallocation and handover . GUTI and RNTI are temporary user identiﬁers, pushed by the network  MME  eNB, respectively . It will be shown in Sect. 12.1.2.3 that conﬁdentiality of GUTI reallocation messages is critical for user identity privacy, and if violated might result in user tracking and other privacy breaching attacks. 3GPP has given   248  J.B. Abdo et al.  Fig. 12.2 EPS security architecture  user privacy a great deal of importance as can be shown from the number of used conﬁdentiality protection procedures across different layers:   AS trafﬁc is conﬁdentiality protected between UE and eNB using “KUPenc”   NAS trafﬁc is conﬁdentiality protected between UE and MME using “KNASenc”   Data trafﬁc is conﬁdentiality protected between eNB and S-GW MME using IPSec.  KUPenc and KNASenc are derived from KASME as shown in Fig. 12.1.  Figure 12.2 shows the coverage of each conﬁdentiality protection mechanism.  12.1.2.3 Identiﬁcation and Authentication  A telecom operator offers restricted services to its customers and roaming users from other operators  if a roaming agreement exists with the user’s home network . The operator has to ﬁlter out illegitimate users, and be able to bill those who beneﬁt from the offered services. The procedure for identifying and authenticating users is shown in Fig. 12.3.  The conceptual algorithm shown in Fig. 12.3 is used to deﬁne an abstract call  ﬂow having the following operations fulﬁlled sequentially:   User identiﬁcation   Network authentication   Mobile authentication Network authentication  serving network authentication  was ﬁrst added in EPS. The above call ﬂow is valid for UMTS if network authentication is removed.   12 Security in Emerging 4G Networks  249  Fig. 12.3 Identiﬁcation and authentication conceptual algorithm   250  J.B. Abdo et al.  In UMTS and its predecessors, after authentication, the user can only assure “that he is connected to a serving network that is authorized by the user’s HE to provide him services; this includes the guarantee that this authorization is recent” [17]. Se- curity network authentication was considered unnecessary in UMTS, since there was an assumption of mutual trust among UMTS operators [33].  In LTE this assumption is considered not valid, thus serving network authenti- cation was added to ensure that the serving network’s identity is really confounded with what it is claiming. In other words, the user is connecting to the same net- work which its home operator has generated the AV  Authentication Vector; check Sect. 12.1.2.3 a   to.  The protocol responsible for identiﬁcation and authentication in 3GPP mobile technologies is called AKA  Authentication and Key Agreement . More information on 3GPP EPS AKA is presented next.   a  Authentication and Key Agreement  EPS identiﬁes subscribers permanently using a unique identiﬁer called IMSI  Inter- national Mobile Subscriber Identity  [33]. Size of IMSI is 15-digits and divided into 3 digits for MCC  Mobile Country Code , 2 for MNC  Mobile Network Code  and 10 for MSIN  Mobile Subscriber Identiﬁcation Number .  Capturing a user’s permanent identiﬁer transmitted over the air channel can be used to detect the user’s current position in addition to user tracking and other pri- vacy breaching attacks. 3GPP has tried to overcome these attacks by introducing a new temporary identiﬁer, GUTI  Globally Unique Temporary UE Identity , to pro- vide an unambiguous identiﬁcation of the UE [I1]. GUTI is only relevant in the serving MME’s area, thus it is sent by the network over a non-access stratum layer connection when conﬁdentiality and integrity protected.  A user’s GUTI is not expected to be constant over a long period of time, since it can then be used in user tracking instead of IMSI. GUTI might be updated in an at- tach accept message, tracking area update accept message [I1] or GUTI reallocation command [J6]. This modiﬁcation is presented in using GUTI instead of previously used TMSI  Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identity .  As mentioned above, GUTI is only transmitted when the NAS layer connection is conﬁdentiality and integrity protected. Conﬁdentiality and integrity protection is enabled only after key sharing which is a late step in the access control mechanism. Conceptual steps in access control are: identiﬁcation, authentication, authorization, key sharing, and ﬁnally enabling secure access. It can be seen from the discussed steps that identiﬁcation occurs before establishing a secure connection, thus user identities are transmitted in plain text. Conﬁdential identiﬁcation is a very expen- sive task when compared to conﬁdential data exchange in a security established connection, thus a compromise has to be made between additional costs resulting from ID hiding and high level of privacy. This dilemma faced the designers of GSM, UMTS, and ﬁnally LTE.   12 Security in Emerging 4G Networks  251  Authentication and Key Agreement procedure  AKA  is responsible for user identiﬁcation, user authentication, network authentication and generation of mas- ter keys, which will be used to derive the keys used in deriving the conﬁdentiality and integrity keys. This procedure includes UE  User equipment , eNB  evolved NB , S-MME  Serving network’s MME  and H-HSS  Home network HSS  as seen in Fig. 12.4.  LTE-AKA Procedure 1. UE → S-MME: NAS Attach Request  IMSI   A user interested in connecting to a network, if the user has no previous tem- porary identiﬁer, has to identify himself by transmitting his permanent identiﬁer  IMSI  in a NAS attach request. If the user has a temporary identiﬁer from a pre- vious connection, he can send his GUTILAI RAI. The S-MME will contact the MME serving the LAI sent by the user; if it succeeded in retrieving GUTI IMSI couplet it proceeds to step 2, else it requests the user to send his permanent iden- tiﬁer.  2. S-MME → H-HSS: Authentication Info Request  IMSI, SNID   S-MME retrieves MCCMNC from IMSI and route the request to H-HSS concatenated with the serving network’s ID  IMSISNID . It then concatenates its ID to the request send by the user and forwards it to the corresponding HSS. 3. H-HSS → S-MME: Authentication Info Answer  RANDXRESKASMEAUTN  The H-HSS fetches for IMSI K SQN triplet in its database. A random variable named RAND is generated. The remaining variables in the AV  Authentication vector  are derived according to the following scheme:   MAC = f1 K, AMF, SQN, RAND    AK = f5 K, RAND    AUTN = SQN xor  AKAMFMAC    CK = f3 K, RAND    IK = f4 K, RAND    KASME = KDF CK, IK, SNID,  SQN xor AK     XRES = f2 K, RAND    AV = RANDXRESKASMEAUTN AV is then sent back to S-MME.  4. S-MME → UE: Authentication Request  RANDAUTN   MME forwards a challenge towards UE containing RAND and AUTN. UE veriﬁes AUTN to authenticate legitimacy of the serving network. If the request is legitimate, RES is generated in addition to the conﬁdentiality and integrity keys.  5. UE → S-MME: Authentication Reply  RES   UE replies to S-MME’s challenge with RES. S-MME compares RES  from UE  and XRES  from H-HSS , if they are equal then the user is authenticated, keys will be derived, NAS security context will be established, and S-MME sends eNB the needed keys to establish AS security context.   252  J.B. Abdo et al.  Fig. 12.4 EPS authentication and key agreement protocol   b  User Privacy  It is a basic right for a user not to have his private information leaked to unauthorized parties. The private information is not limited to:   Location: “It shall be possible to provide no disclosure, at any level of granularity, of location, location-related information, e.g. geographic and routing information, or information from which a user’s location can be determined, to unauthorized parties, including another party on a communication” [14].   Identity: “The Evolved Packet System shall be able to hide the identities of users from unauthorized third parties” [14].   Communication details: “The privacy of the contents, origin, and destination of a particular communication shall be protected from disclosure to unauthorized parties” [14].  In this chapter we will be discussing requirements and possible threats on location and identity privacy.  Location Privacy and UE Tracking  3GPP has reported many threats leading to user tracking, and each threat exploits different vulnerability. Full threat list can be seen in [2]. The two threats related to temporary identiﬁers are shown next.   12 Security in Emerging 4G Networks  253  Tracking User Temporary ID All users’ temporary identities, in the attacked area, can be recorded in  temporary identity, location, time-stamp  triplets. The at- tacker waits one of the victims to reveal his real identity, and then his real and temporary identities can be linked. Permanent identity, location, time-stamp are the needed information to track a user over a time period. One of the methods to make a user reveal his real identity is: “waiting for the user to connect to a server belonging to the attacker and insert the user’s name”. The proposed countermeasure has three requirements which are:   NAS signaling should be conﬁdentiality and integrity protected.   TMSI shall be stored sufﬁciently long.   UE  User Equipment  shall give priority to use the last received TMSI over IMSI IMEI when identiﬁcation towards MME  Mobility Management Entity  is needed.  User Tracking Due to Linkability of IMSI TMSI and RNTI The attacker can record the track of all the temporary identiﬁers transmitted over air interface. When the user connects to a fake BTS  eNB , this eNB  eNodeB  can force the user to transmit its IMSI, thus the attacker can recover backwards the track of the user. The proposed countermeasure is that every user shall be allocated a new TMSI on each LTE_ACTIVE.  Identity Privacy and IMSI Catching  The ﬁrst step in any AKA protocol is identiﬁcation. The identiﬁcation process in 3GPP AKA is designed to transmit the IMSI  International Mobile Subscriber Iden- tity  in plain text over the air channel, if no temporary identiﬁer is valid. Attack- ers can collect this permanent identiﬁer in special areas  e.g. in airport , where all newcomers switch on their mobiles, thus triggering the identiﬁcation process. IMSI catching will become easier with out-of-band authentication and smart cards connected via USB sticks [2]. Two countermeasures were proposed by 3GPP [2]. The ﬁrst countermeasure is the public key-based approach, where the IMSI gets encrypted using asymmetric algorithm [13] before being transmitted. The second countermeasure is the pseudonyms-based approach, where TMSI gets generated by a shared key and a transmitted pseudonym  3GPP believes that this countermeasure is not feasible .  12.1.2.4 Trust  Since no secure connection can be established in absence of trust, it is considered a vital aspect of security. Below are some trust issues each requesting different secu- rity measures:   Secure connection is requested between two entities that do not have valid se- curity information about each other, i.e. do not trust each other. To make this   254  J.B. Abdo et al.  connection possible, an intermediate trusted entity should be used such as CA  Certiﬁcation Authority  in PKI.   A user needs to trust the server with his private information; it must not be dis- closed to unauthorized third parties. A privacy contract is needed to bind both parties.   Two processes need to communicate securely, within the same system without exposing any information if hardware test is implemented. Trust platform should be used in hardware.  The above requirements can be divided into two major categories: trusting enti-  ties over the network and trusting entities within the same platform.   a  Network Trust  This section is dedicated to discuss trust issues between different NEs  Network Elements  across the EPS mobile network.  User’s Trust in the Operator AV  Authentication Vector : is a set of creden- tials generated at the home network, and delivered to the serving network. In EPS, AV is used to for mutual authentication between UE and serving network. More information about AV can be seen in Sect. 12.1.2.3 a .  UE-Network trust requirements are:  1. UE should trust its Home network that generated AV will be delivered only to  trusted parties.  2. UE should trust serving networks with valid AV.  The authentication and key agreement protocol shown in Sect. 12.1.2.3 a  is a mechanism to decide if the corresponding serving network is trustworthy based on the requirement shown above.  Inter-operator Trust Inter-operator trust is not a pure technical issue, since pol- itics and economics affect roaming agreements, trafﬁc routing and other collabora- tion aspects. Technical inter-operator trust issues are:   Home network should trust the serving network that none of the received AVs will be disclosed to non-authorized third parties.   Serving network should trust the home network to send correct authentication vectors [33].   Home network should trust the serving network: it must generate correct charging bills.  Since none of the operators control the applied security mechanisms in other operators, trust has to be limited to strict required functionalities, thus the inter- operator relationship falls under the ‘minimal trust’ policy.   12 Security in Emerging 4G Networks  255   b  NE Trust  Possible threats resulting from physically tampering MEs  Mobile Equipments  and other NEs are:   Eavesdropping communicated data between entities inside the same equipment. – Encrypting the communication channel can be useless if one of the encryp- tion termination points is tampered. Plain text data can be eavesdropped before being encrypted of after being decrypted.   Modifying operations or communicated data. – Fake eNB attack utilizes tampered eNB to run malicious operations instead of  the legitimate built-in operations.  Many attempts have been made to develop a trustful platform that hinders phys-  ical tampering and eavesdropping.  Trusted Mobile Platform  TMP  The Trusted Platform Module  TPM  pro- vides trusted information on system’s internal state and stores conﬁdentially cryp- tographic keys and identities [19]. TC  Trusted computing  is widely implemented in PCs and other computing devices with relatively enough resources  power and computation . Using trusted computing is important in some devices such as Fem- tocells, where its absence might result in crucial security vulnerabilities. More about security in Femtocell is in Sect. 12.2.2.1.  TPM is implemented in mobile devices to ensure the following security require-  ments:   Protect hardware, software and OS integrity in mobile platform.   Implement access control data in ME USIM, thus ensuring conﬁdentiality and integrity of the stored data.   It shall protect the conﬁdentiality and integrity of data stored in the ME USIM or transported on the interface between ME and USIM [10, 11].   It shall retain the user’s identity as privacy to ME [10].   Prevent tampering ME to be used as an attack tool.  Most of TPM implementations have been hardware based, but software is also  available as shown in the coming sections [9, 20–22].  Hardware-based Hardware implementation of TPM is a tamper-resistant module equipped with its own Central Processing Unit  CPU  and secure memory area; it operates independently of the mobile terminal’s CPU and is equipped with various dedicated functions such as cryptographic operations [18]. TMP hard- ware architecture is shown in Fig. 12.5. This stand-alone module is composed of:   RAM   Flash   Memory Controller   256  J.B. Abdo et al.

Peripheral.  Software-based More information on software-based TMP can be found in [9, 21].  12.2 Emerging 4G Security  3GPP has proposed an evolved architecture in mobile communication building 4G, where enhancements mostly reached every layer and network element. Among oth- ers, enhancements can be categorized into the all-IP oriented approach network layer  all-IP backbone and backhaul network , the network element role  ﬂat archi- tecture and smaller number of network elements , and radio interface enhancements such as  OFDM, MIMO .  Other than the internal enhancements, 4G networks implemented interfaces to other 3GPP and non-3GPP technologies. Interconnection with other 3GPP and non- 3GPP networks, a.k.a. heterogeneous networks, will increase the operator’s capacity and malleability to implement QoS on different trafﬁc types over different access networks. Customer satisfaction should increase in heterogeneous network envi- ronments, and new applications can be used leading to higher revenues for service providers.  To be able to achieve these additional revenues and support the increasing data rates, operators have to re-dimension their networks and increase their investment in the deployed heterogeneous networks such as WiFi AP  Access Point , eNB, WiMax AP.  More recently, HeNB  Home eNB , speciﬁcally Femtocell, is a cost-effective solution to cope the increasing need on data rates, especially that it can be located close to users needing this service. HeNBs can be relocated with minimum effort to areas even not covered by the operator’s network. This short distance between the user and the HeNB allows the attacker to locate the victim with very high precision. User tracking in femtocells and other attacks resulting from network-based changes will be discussed in Sect. 12.2.2.  Mobile phones can access information about their geographical location from the serving network, and this information has been used by LBS  Location Based Services  to locate nearby points of interest of the mobile user. These points of interest are not limited to recommended social events such as parties or friend gath-   12 Security in Emerging 4G Networks  257  Fig. 12.5 Hardware architecture for trusted mobile platform  ering, or the nearest business or service, such as an ATM [35], a restaurant, a hotel, etc.  The LBS trend is being motivated by the widespread of smartphones [36, 37], especially in that high processing applications are also becoming locating depen- dent. Example: in some games, the user’s location is part of the game play [35]. Other critical applications have been developed, such as ﬁnding the nearest doctor in case of medical emergency [35]. LBS has really proven to be very handy and can support customers from leisure to emergency rescue, but paved the way for emerg- ing privacy-breaching attacks by exploiting vulnerabilities not tackled yet by the standard.  We can consider that emerging 4G security threats are due to either the emerging  mobile-based services or the network-based changes as described hereafter.   258  J.B. Abdo et al.  12.2.1 Emerging Mobile-Based Services  12.2.1.1 Location-Based Service [1, 4]   a  What Is a Location-Based Service?  Location-based service is a computer-level online service that utilizes the user’s current position as a critical input for the application providing this service [35]. Location coordinates can be delivered through GPS equipped mobile devices [4], or through the mobile user’s operator. If a multilateration positioning technique is used in the serving network, then the exact location of the user can be speciﬁed. If multilateration is not used, then only the distance to the serving eNB is delivered in addition to the eNB’s coordinates; in other words, the user knows that it belongs to the circumference of a circle centered at serving eNB; its radius is the user’s distance to the center. Note that:  – Location-dependent query is a user triggered request to a location-based service. – Nearest neighbor query is a location-dependent query requesting the address of  the nearest point of interest.   b  What Are the Types of Location-Based Services [1]?  Location-based services are categorized based on the frequency of exposing their location data to application servers or adversaries [1]. They might be:  – Continuous [1]: if the exposed locations are being updated continuously. – Sporadic [1]: if the exposed locations are discrete.  LBS categories are identiﬁed since each group has compatible attack counter- measures. Further differentiation between the above two categories is shown in Sect. 12.2.1.1.   c  What Are the Threats Exploiting Location-Based Services?  Before being able to request any information from location-based services, the mo- bile user has to update his location by sending the coordinates to the LBS server, which in turn replies with the requested information. Security of the location re- lated information transmitted over the air channel is considered outside the scope of this chapter due to the implemented conﬁdentiality and integrity protection at the AS  Access Stratum  layer. We will only consider last mile eavesdropping  between P-GW  PDN Gateway  and LBS server , carried out by outside attackers or the ser- vice providers themselves. Capturing insecure identities and location information allow the attacker to breach the user’s privacy by being able to know if the user is in a certain area, and where precisely he is.   12 Security in Emerging 4G Networks  259  Fig. 12.6 Anonymization using pseudonym  Fig. 12.7 Anonymization using K-anonymity  Anonymization was proposed using pseudonym identities, as a cost effective way to ensure location privacy. Identity anonymization is implemented at the mobile level, where a pseudonym is generated to replace the username in the LBS query as shown in Fig. 12.6. Pseudonym anonymization failed to ensure the required degree of anonymity [36, 37] because each user has a limited number of restricted areas which are known by the attacker and allow him to create a predetermined victim behavior. These restricted areas are places visited regularly by the victim, such as home, ofﬁce, home-ofﬁce road, etc. In other words, the anonymizing technique is vulnerable to correlation attacks. Although the username is anonymized other re- maining attributes called quasi-identiﬁers can still be mapped to individuals e.g.: age, sex, and city [4, 12]. Pseudonym anonymization will be part of a more concrete mechanism as treated in Sect. 12.2.1.1.  The scenario behind Fig. 12.6 is that user A currently found at location 01001 is interested in ﬁnding a certain service which is returned by the LBS server as located at 01110.  K-anonymity [5] is another proposed method to ensure location privacy, where a location-dependent query is considered private if the attacker is able to identify the requester with probability less than 1 K. K is a threshold required by the user [37]. This method uses an intermediate trusted server called anonymizer as shown in Fig. 12.7.  Every subscribed user has to register with a trusted anonymity server  anonym- izer  by updating its identity and location. This anonymizer maintains an updated database of user’s current location. Each triggered NN  Nearest Neighbor  query passes by the anonymizer; it replaces the user’s location by a CR  Cloaking Region    260  J.B. Abdo et al.  and forwards the request to LBS server. CR contains in addition to the real user, K − 1 users belonging to its neighborhood. The attacker knows that one within this vicinity has requested this NN query, but the probability of identifying the right user equals 1 K. The LBS server replies with a list containing the identity of each user from CR with its corresponding POI  Point of Interest . The anonymizer then ﬁlters the POI corresponding to the real user and passes it to the requester [36, 37].  K-anonymity also has drawbacks [36, 37]:  – The anonymizer is considered a single point of failure and bottleneck, thus the  probability of full outage is higher than that in pseudonym anonymization.  – Malicious users can be physically located near the victim, thus the anonymizer will add these users in its CR. Since the eavesdropper knows the malicious users, it can predict the user’s identity with probability > 1 K.  – K-anonymity is also vulnerable to correlation attacks. – K-anonymity’s security level is directly proportional with the frequency of users’ location update. It is not practical and scalable to request location updates peri- odically from all users.  – It is more proﬁtable for idle users not to update their location, since moving from LTE_IDLE to LTE_ACTIVE to send this update message will cause higher bat- tery consumption and excess signaling on core level. – Generated core trafﬁc is K − 1 times more than needed. – Only identity privacy is ensured but not location privacy. – It is difﬁcult to support continuous LBS.   d  Location-Privacy Preserving Mechanisms  LPPMs  [1]  Location-privacy preserving mechanisms are the mechanism used to distort user’s LBS queries inside a secure system before being eavesdropped by an adversary.  LPPMS can be implemented in different architectures:  – Centralized: Uses an intermediate trusted server which implements LPPM at its level, similar to what was discussed in K-anonymity or to mix zones which will be discussed in section Sect. 12.2.2.1.  – Distributed: Implements LPPM at mobile level, similar to what was discussed in  pseudonym anonymity.  – Hybrid: HiSC claimed load balancing between AS and mobile clients, by dividing cloaking services into centralized requests with AS and peer-to-peer requests with other mobile clients [8].  Many LPPMs have been proposed trying to offer a cost effective, practical, scal- able, and secure transfer of LBS queries. Some of the latest proposed mechanisms are presented in the following.  1. Anonymization and obfuscation [1, 4–7]  Anonymization is applying pseudonym anonymization on the username part of the LBS query, while obfuscation is responsible for distorting the LBS query’s second   12 Security in Emerging 4G Networks  261  part  location . Obfuscation is divided into three transformations that are imple- mented at different timings:   Location pseudonym: instead of sending an anonymized username concatenated with the location as shown in pseudonym anonymization, the user will generate n − 1 pseudonym regions in addition to its real region. Pseudonym usernames in addition to n regions are concatenated inside the LBS query to be transmitted towards the LBS server. The attacker can then identify the current location with probability of 1 n. The LBS server will reply back with a list, where each entry corresponds to one of the n sent regions.   Fake-location injection: When the user is not exposing anything, fake location- pseudonyms can be injected at random timing. This mechanism makes it harder for data mining algorithms to detect the correct identity and trajectory of users.   Hiding LBS events: Location exposing events can be hidden, thus making it harder for attackers to track the mobile user.  2. Private Information Retrieval  PIR  [37]  In PIR, the user sends an encrypted request to the LBS server which in turn returns an encrypted reply. The LBS server will not be able to identify the sender, the re- quest, nor what particular information the client has requested. It is computationally intractable for an attacker to ﬁnd the value of the request from the server’s reply; while it is easy for the user to retrieve the information he was looking for from the server’s reply. For more details on the cryptographic algorithms used, see [37]  3. Footprints [36]  Footprint mechanism is very close to K-anonymity, but this time the anonymizer contains not only the list of users and their location, but also the list of users who have been at each location during the past period P. The anonymizer receives the real request, replaces the user’s location by a CR  Cloaking Region , and forwards the request to LBS server. CR contains in addition to the real user, K − 1 users who are currently or have been within the past period p in the area where the user is sending the request form. The remaining of this mechanism is similar to K-anonymity. An attacker may be able to identify all the users who were in that area, but will not know who was there at what time.  The advantage of footprints vs. K-anonymity are:  – Active attack using malicious users has less possibility to succeed, since it is hard to estimate the location where the user will request a service, and spread the malicious users for a period p before the user’s arrival to the estimated area.  – Footprint is immune against correlation attacks [36]. – The is no need for extra signaling or frequent location update. – Identity privacy and location privacy are ensured. – It is difﬁcult to support continuous LBS. – In case of sporadic LBS, each cloaking region needs to be as small as possi-  ble [36].   262  Fig. 12.8 Offer-demand closed ring  J.B. Abdo et al.  – contain footprints from at least K different users.  In case of continuous LBS, each trajectory disclosed must be a K-anonymity trajec- tory  KAT  [36].  4. Feeling-Based Approach [36]  Feeling-based approach focuses on identifying a public region and request that her disclosed location must be at least as popular as that space. This public region should have at least K visitors, where K is considered the required level of protection.  12.2.2 Network-Based Changes  Technology platforms and user demands form a closed ring as shown in Fig. 12.8, since newer technology platforms offer better services, higher bandwidth, and the capability of hosting new applications that satisfy users’ needs. Previous experience with the technology market has shown that demand increases to meet the offered services  if prices are correctly adjusted  until it exceeds what the current technology can offer; so more investment is used to create more powerful platforms and so on. Data trafﬁc is enormously increasing in mobile networks, where it is expected to increase by 18-folds in 2016 when compared to 2011 [38]. Mobile networks have their bottleneck at the radio interface, which is a very expensive and scarce resource. Any expectation to support the multiplicative increase in data trafﬁc should have a radical solution for access technologies. 3GPP has proposed three techniques to be used by operators interested in increasing access capacity, and these techniques can be used in any combination:  – Spectrum refarming [38]: Governments allocate frequency spectrum to be used by operators under the terms of a license. Spectrum refarming is using these al- located frequencies by technologies with better efﬁciency than the one currently   12 Security in Emerging 4G Networks  263  used. This technique offers a very limited range of capacity enhancement, and has low capacity investment ratio.  – Heterogeneous networks: EPS has provided interfaces with other 3GPP and non- 3GPP wireless technologies allowing the use of heterogeneous networks. It will offer higher availability, better trafﬁc classiﬁcation  quality of service , and wider range of service for the user to choose from. Heterogeneous networks provide better services, thus resulting in higher customer satisfaction [14]. This technique offers a very broad range of capacity enhancement, but has an average capac- ity investment ratio.  – HeNB  ex: Femtocell : “A HeNB is a Customer-premises equipment that con- nects a 3GPP UE over EUTRAN wireless air interface to a mobile operator’s network using a broadband IP backhaul” [13]. HeNB can be implemented in spe- ciﬁc area where concentrated data trafﬁc is needed, without the necessity of re- planning the operator’s eNB location. This technique offers a very broad range of capacity enhancement, and has a very high capacity investment ratio.  Heterogeneous networks and HeNB are very practical techniques to cope with the continuously increasing trafﬁc demand, but each result in a set of privacy-related vulnerabilities that can easily be exploited. Resulting vulnerabilities are discussed next.  12.2.2.1 Femtocell and Hotspot  Femtocell technology is achieving excellent sales results and is doubling every year. Operators are also increasingly adopting HeNB systems in their networks [39]. Due to the expected massive presence of femtocells in the coming years, each vulnera- bility found will be considered on a short term a large-scale problem for operators. Some of the identiﬁed weaknesses are as follows.  1. User Tracking [26]  In order to ensure location privacy, 3GPP has proposed the usage of GUTI  Globally Unique Temporary ID  as a way to anonymize user identity using a pseudonym. This suggestion is still valid when used in macrocells and microcells in cellular networks, since the number of subscribers inside the studied cell is assumed to be high. The attacker’s precision in identifying the victim is 1  number of users in a cell , which is fair enough under the above assumption. Femtocells offer small coverage and low capacity cells as shown in Fig. 12.9; thus attackers are able to locate the victim accurately.  In legacy and emerging mobile technologies  including EPS , user temporary identities are pushed by the network under special circumstances. 3GPP’s procedure for reallocating GUTI  user’s temporary identiﬁer in EPS  is shown in Fig. 12.10. More on GUTI is in [16].   264  J.B. Abdo et al.  Fig. 12.9 Microcell and Femtocell eNB  Fig. 12.10 GUTI reallocation procedure  3GPP has proposed two criteria for GUTI reallocation which are:  In Fig. 12.10 the GUTI reallocation procedure is shown [15] where we can easily deduce that only the core network can trigger GUTI reallocation, if one of its criteria is met.   “Inter-Domain Location Area Update” [33], i.e. moving from one MME’s domain to another.   “In state LTE_IDLE and LTE_ACTIVE there exists a security association be- tween the UE and MME, which can be used for protecting TMSI reallocations. But in LTE_IDLE the eNB does not possess a security association with the UE. The TMSI needs to be disclosed every time the UE has to contact MME from state LTE_IDLE” [1]. To ensure user privacy, GUTI reallocation is triggered after each time the user moves from LTE-IDLE to LTE-ACTIVE state.  Inter-femtocell handover or moving to from a femtocell does not satisfy any of the two criteria, so GUTI will not change. It is much easier for an attacker to tamper a cheap femtocell in the attacker’s premises than a production level eNB at a rooftop. If the attacker was able to collect the user’s GUTI from the femtocell, it will become easier for him to track the user after moving to another cell.   12 Security in Emerging 4G Networks  265  Dynamic and context-aware location privacy protection mechanisms are suitable  solutions for this emerging threat.  Dynamic and context-aware location privacy protection mechanisms allow a user to change his identiﬁer based on context and surrounding changes. For the sake of clarity, we will divide these mechanisms into two sub-procedures and discuss each in a stand-alone manner. The sub-procedures are:   Context change detection: UE has different interfaces allowing it to detect changes in surrounding context. Possible usage of the interfaces are: ◦ The transmitted cell broadcast messages allowing the UE to detect neighbor- ing eNBs. Network planners assign more eNBs to areas with high population density and less eNBs to rural areas, thus the UE is able to correlate population density with the number of received broadcast messages [26]. If the number of neighboring eNBs changes, then the UE is moving towards a more less dense area. The user is able to detect context change through broadcast channels. ◦ Peer-to-peer communication technologies, such as WiFi and Bluetooth [27], can be used to identify the number of neighboring devices, and to plan with these devices for simultaneous ID reallocation [26].    Identiﬁer re-allocation: to prevent an attacker from tracking a user as shown in Sect. 12.2.2.1, every user detecting context change should trigger identity reallo- cation. Two modes of identity reallocation are possible: ◦ Collaborative identiﬁer reallocation: a user triggered procedure that suggests to the neighboring devices to participate in a simultaneous ID reallocation using pseudonym. Identiﬁer reallocation is triggered whenever a UE detects context change. Mix Zone is an example of collaborative identiﬁer reallocation. ◦ Single-user identity reallocation: a user triggered procedure that changes the identity of the requester, without affecting other devices. This procedure failed to ensure the requested security level [26].  2. Conﬁdentiality Attacks  Femtocells moved Radio Network Elements  eNB  from the operator’s secure premises to attacker’s private lab where all the needed equipments and resources are available. Due to its low price, even amateur attackers can now afford trying to tamper femtocells, as a start for launching privacy and conﬁdentiality breaching attacks. Production-level eNBs were sold to well-known customers  operators, uni- versities, governments, etc. , thus any launched attack caused by a tampered eNB can be traced back to the attacker. To the contrary, femtocell vendors are not able to keep an updated list of all its sold equipments, especially, so that reselling and stealing these products is possible. Femtocell’s IP interface and cheap components makes it more suited for reverse engineering [26], and launching attacks, some of which are mentioned next.   266  J.B. Abdo et al.  Physical Tampering of Femtocell [26] Access stratum conﬁdentiality protec- tion is terminated at the femtocell, thus it has the used encryption algorithms and generated keys. The attacker can breach data conﬁdentiality, if he is capable of:   tampering the femtocell and reaching the used keys   snifﬁng the data just after being decrypted from over-the-air conﬁdentiality pro- tection and before being encrypted in IPSec.  Device Impersonation [26] More severe tampering of a femtocell allows the attacker to impersonate a legitimate eNB, thus any user close enough from this fem- tocell will be handed over to this tampered access point. 3GPP allows the serving MME to request a user’s permanent identiﬁer:   during AKA  Authentication and Key Agreement Procedure    and the presented GUTI LAI couplet is not linkable to a valid IMSI.  Succeeding to do so, the attacker can breach the user’s identity privacy and  conﬁdentiality.  3. Fake Location Reporting  Each operator has a spectrum license granting it the ownership of a speciﬁc fre- quency spectrum for a speciﬁc period of time over a speciﬁc location. So it is not allowed for a femtocell to be activated outside its operator’s coverage area. If IP- only geo-localization techniques are used [26] then false location reporting can eas- ily be implemented, since IP spooﬁng needs no physical tampering of femtocell’s components.  4. Distributed Denial of Service Attacks DDoS Attacks Against Security Gateway [26]  Mobile network’s view of internet changed from being a separate network with min- imum interaction  through GGSN’s interface  into a vital transport network, neces- sary for supporting a continuously increasing demand as shown in Fig. 12.11. This change added not just internet’s malleability, coverage, and extremely superior re- sources but also a full range of attacks that mobile networks were safe from. DDoS  Distributed Denial of Service attacks  can be implemented against SeGW  Security Gateway  leading to complete outage in femtocell services. More information about DoS attacks can be found in [24].  5. DoS on the Air Channel  Attackers can hinder a legitimate user from accessing operator’s services over the air interface. These attackers use availability breaching attacks named Denial of Service. DoS attacks can be divided into four categories [30].   Jamming attacks: creating noise signals on frequencies used by the operator. Physical channel quality will deteriorate until attack ﬁnishes, then the system will return stable.   12 Security in Emerging 4G Networks  267  Fig. 12.11 Femtocell system architecture    Flooding attacks: exhaust a resource  shared channel , by sending numerous mes- sages towards a receiver.   Semantic attacks: “exploit protocol weaknesses by transmitting valid protocol messages with forged message ﬁelds” [30].   Implementation speciﬁc attacks: Other than theoretical attacks, product-related attacks are mounted on physical devices to evaluate its capabilities. More infor- mation about physical attacks can be found in [28].  6. Detection Methods [30, 31]  Flooding attack usually covers a very limited number of cells. The operator can detect ﬂooding attacks, if the trafﬁc distribution among contiguous cells varies with unexpected standard variation.  In wireless communication, it is very hard for the transmitter to detect a collision since it gets blinded by its transmitted power. Jamming attack detection requires an unexpected transmission stoppage, where the attacker can listens to its used channel. If it is also used, then collision might have occurred. This method is not perfectly secure and cannot be used as a security mechanism. A more secure collision detec- tion algorithm was proposed in [31], where the silent periods are equivalent to the hash of the delivered data. In this method, the users are able to detect a collision  jamming attack  if one occurred.  12.2.2.2 Heterogeneous Networks  Wireless heterogeneous networks are composed of different radio technologies con- nected to one core network. This core network is responsible of billing, authentica- tion, gateway, and handover in some scenarios. In this section, EPC is considered the core network connecting various technologies as seen in Fig. 12.12. In addition   268  J.B. Abdo et al.  Fig. 12.12 Heterogeneous network in loose coupling  to WiMAX, Wi-Fi, UMTS, and EPS, other wireless broadband technologies can also be integrated with EPC.  Integration can be implemented on different levels, each deﬁning the service ef- ﬁciency and speed. If the integration between different technologies is close, the provisioning of the service is more efﬁcient and the choice of the mode in order to ﬁnd the best radio access as the well as the handover procedure is faster. However, a high level of integration requires considerable effort in the deﬁnition of interfaces and mechanisms able to support the necessary exchange of data and signaling be- tween different radio access networks [25]. More on network integration can be found in [25].  Existing wireless technologies happened to be complementary and it can be seen from the below characteristics that   EPS offers acceptable bandwidth, high mobility but have high cost per bit if com- pared with WiFi.   UMTS offers low bandwidth, high mobility but very high cost per bit.   12 Security in Emerging 4G Networks  269    WiFi offers high bandwidth, low cost per bit but limited mobility.   WiMAX offers acceptable bandwidth, acceptable mobility and acceptable cost per bit.  Next generation networks can only satisfy the increasing trafﬁc demand by taking advantage of the strong points in each radio technology. In addition to optimized resource management, heterogeneous networks present new security threats one of which is the following.  Security Threats on Authentication and Key Agreement Protocol in Heterogeneous Networks  The open architecture of heterogeneous networks will create security threats during authentication and handover [23].  Security in wireless heterogeneous networks starts with authentication and key agreement protocol, where the size of the stored secret, the randomness of the used random generator, used key derivation algorithm, . . . is crucial for security preserv- ing. Even when a user is authenticated and shares a key with the serving network, the used encryption algorithm is very critical in preserving the conﬁdentiality and integrity of the transmitted data.  If a GSM user is connected to an EPS network, he will not be able to utilize the advanced security features in 4G networks. Similarly an LTE user when connected to GSM will have GSM’s security level.  These weaknesses can be exploited by forcing vertical handovers into a less se- cure technology, thus allowing the attacker to exploit vulnerable used encryption algorithms.  12.3 Conclusion  Wireless networks, by their nature, which facilitate access to the radio, are more vulnerable than wired networks and need to encrypt communications to deal with snifﬁng and continuously check the identity of the mobile nodes. The mobility fac- tor adds more challenges to security, namely monitoring and maintenance of secure trafﬁc transport of mobile nodes. This concerns both homogeneous and heteroge- neous mobility  inter-technology , the latter requires homogenization of security level of all the networks visited by the mobile.  From the terminal’s side, it is important to protect its resources  battery, disk, CPU  against their misuse and ensuring the conﬁdentiality of its data. In an ad-hoc or sensor’s network, it becomes essential to ensure its integrity as it plays a dual role of router and terminal.  The difﬁculty of designing security solutions that could address these challenges is not only to ensure robustness facing potential attacks, or to ensure that it does not   270  J.B. Abdo et al.  slow down communications, but also to optimize use of resources in terms of band- width, memory, battery, etc. More important in this open context is that the unwired network is to ensure the anonymity and privacy, while allowing traceability for le- gal reasons. Indeed, the growing need for traceability is now necessary for the ﬁght against criminal organizations and terrorists, but also to minimize the plundering of copyright. We are therefore facing a dilemma, that is, of providing a network support of free exchange of information while controlling the content of the communication to avoid harmful content. Actually, this concerns both wired and unwired networks. All these factors inﬂuence the selection and implementation of security tools that are guided by a prior risk assessment and security policy.  Finally, we are more and more thinking about trust models in the design of se- cured systems, which should offer a higher trust level than classical security mech- anisms, and it seems that future networks should implement both models: security and trust models.

Safran et al. offered the deﬁnition of EHRs as the information system including “personal data created, developed, maintained, and or provided by clinicians, providers, and allied health providers in direct patient care; an elec- tronic application containing health information about individuals that is used by clinicians, providers, and allied health professionals to provide direct care for the individuals” [1].  This chapter aims to describe beneﬁts of EHRs compared with its predecessor: a paper-based system followed by problems and the potential use of EHRs. Reha- bilitation for Persons with Disabilities  PWDs  will be used as an example in this chapter.  13.1 Beneﬁts of EHRs  There are a great amount of beneﬁts of EHRs both from patient side and the provider as well as the system side. EHRs may reduce the problem of patient non- adherence [2], could improve practitioner performance [3], caregivers’ decisions, quality of care and patients’ quality of life [4, 5]. The Obama administration al- located resources up to $27 billion in ten years through the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act  HITECH  to promote the use of EHRs among clinicians and hospitals [4]. The study was conducted to compare the service performances of physicians using EHRs in the US healthcare settings. Ten quality measures were used to measure the quality of care including:  1  data information set for patients with diabetes,  2  eye exams,  3  hemoglobin A1c test- ing,  4  low-density lipoprotein,  5  cholesterol testing and nephropathy testing,  S.

Tongsiri   6  breast cancer screening,  7  chlamydia screening,  8  colorectal cancer screen- ing,  9  medication for asthma and  10  children with pharyngitis testing and respi- ratory tract treatment. It was found that the settings where EHRs were implemented had signiﬁcantly higher performances on the measures than those settings with the paper-recorded system. This implied that EHRs could, to some extent, improve qual- ity of ambulatory care. Dorr et al. [6] conducted a review of the literature from 1996–2005 on the use of information systems to support the chronic illness care. The reviewed chronic illnesses mainly included diabetes, heart disease, and mental illnesses. The positive outcome related to the provision of EHRs, electronic sched- ule, computerized prompts, decision support and personal health records, however, the concerns should be directed to the implementation system regarding the costs, data privacy and security as well as the systematic workﬂow.  Health providers were required to create health records including personal data of the patient, vital signs, medications and allergies, problem lists and current di- agnosis, and smoking status to assist clinical decision making with the core quality measures as follows: blood-pressure, tobacco use and weight screening and follow- up. Health providers equipped with EHRs in their settings tend to have relatively higher quality of diabetes care [7]. Extensive analysis of cost-beneﬁt analysis of EHRs in primary care was reported [8].  Compared with the paper-based health record system, the EHR is more cost ben- eﬁcial or has a “positive ﬁnancial return” as reported by Samuel et al. [9]. Costs have been claimed to be a major barrier of the use of an electronic-based record system but the authors, on the contrary, suggested that the EHRs may not be what had been believed. Using the implementation of EHRs in a hypothetical primary ambulatory care setting in the US as a business case, it was shown that EHRs could bring cost averse and increase revenue by saving costs of paper chart retrieving and transcription, preventing accruing costs of not having proper medication utilization, supporting clinical decision, decreasing drug side effects, offering range of medica- tion rather than using only the expensive ones. The costs were shown to be reduced due to unnecessary laboratory charges and radiology tests. Increasing of revenue could be the case by correctly capturing medical procedures. Sensitivity analysis was also applied trying to alter multiple factors and looking at whether the costs and beneﬁts were changed and how much. In the 5-year time horizon, compared with the paper-based system, the electronic system yielded the net beneﬁt of $86,400 per provider in primary ambulatory care services. The largest proportion of this beneﬁt was attributed to saving in drug expenditure. The number of patients in the health- care security insurance plan was the most sensitive factor to the variation of the beneﬁts ranging from $8,400 to $140,100. The greatest large cost saving of approx- imately $202,200 was possible for a high proportion of registered patients in the capitation area coupled with avoiding expensive drug choices. The beneﬁts tended to be increased with the longer time horizon. The authors also suggested other ar- eas of cost savings not included in the study as follows: malpractice premium costs, storage and supply costs, generic drug substitutions, increased provider productivity, decreased staffs number, increase reimbursement, and decreased claims denials.  EHRs has a potential to improve quality of care in patients suffering from di- abetes. As reported by Randall et al. [7], the authors attempted to contribute with   13 Electronic Health Records: Beneﬁts and Contribution to Healthcare System  275  the scarce evidence of the adoption of EHRs in primary care providers by using the implementation of EHRs in the quality standards for the care of patients with diabetes in seven primary health care practice organizations between 2007–2010. Several laboratory tests to indicate quality of care for diabetes patients as well as the patient factors that would have, to some extent, inﬂuences on diabetic treatment including demographic data; insurance type; race; household income and educa- tion attainment level were taken into account. The composite components of care used as the output of the systems comprised measurement of glycated hemoglobin, kidney management, eye examination, and pneumococcal vaccination. Indicators of outcome composite are glycated hemoglobin, blood pressure, cholesterol level, and body mass index  BMI . Statistical analysis showed that, by comparing with the paper-based system, the settings with the EHRs practice have signiﬁcantly higher level of achievement for care and outcome across several insurance systems.  13.2 Challenges in the Changes to EHRs  The transition process from manual to electronic health records is very much of a challenge. We have a report from Ophthalmology Times: EHR: From paper to elec- tronic [10]. To successfully transform health records from paper to electronics, the following requirements should be considered: complexities, resistances from staffs, changes of human resources, software, hardware and how things are processed, in- formation technology  IT  plan and having the program tested and practiced before fully transforming the system from paper to electronic. Juan et al. [11] conducted a case study to assess the implementation of EHRs in a public health system in Mex- ico. Challenges to success in the EHRs implementation were as follows: resistance of healthcare providers, inappropriate attention on resources needed for the system maintenance, and political pressure from the government health development pro- grams. It is suggested that more commitment is essential for the sustainability of the EHRs implementation.  Fragmented data are collected by individual organizations responsible for reha- bilitation for PWDs. The data rarely are shared among stakeholders. EHRs accessi- ble for EHRs may enhance the multidisciplinary works.  13.3 Example of the Use of EHRs in the Rehabilitation Provision  for Persons with Disabilities  PWDs   The Persons with Disabilities’ Quality of Life Promotion Act  2007  stated that all registered PWDs are entitled for receiving extensive medical rehabilitation pro- grams including medicine, physical therapy programs, occupational therapy pro- grams and prostheses & orthoses [12]. Education and vocational rehabilitation pro- grams are also part of rehabilitation. The government provides compensation and   276  Fig. 13.1 Diagram of ICF concept  S. Tongsiri  beneﬁts for disabilities. To achieve these goals of rehabilitation, health data and in- formation systems are immensely important. Attention should be given to the ques- tion of how could this could happen amidst the lack of timely accessible database. The International Classiﬁcation of Functioning, Disability and Heath  ICF  may be used to assist the measurement of functions after home modiﬁcations. In 2001, the ICF was developed by the World Health Organization  WHO  [13]. The member countries have continuously been encouraged to use ICF to collect functioning data of persons with disabilities  PWDs  indicating interactions between body functions and body structures  b codes , activity and participation  d codes , environment fac- tors  e codes  and personal factors. Product and technology, natural environment, and human-made changes to environment are included in the ICF environmental factors. As can be seen from Fig. 13.1, the ICF conceptual framework encompasses interactions among multiple factors and could be used to explain multidimensional areas of health. ICF have been used in a number of research activities in medical contexts, community survey, and disability statistics [14]. The comprehensive data of quality of life of PWDs can be demonstrated using the ICF concept and codes. In 2012, Sirinart and Wachara conducted the survey using ICF to measure functions of PWDs living in a community [15]. Forty-six codes were utilized to represent func- tions of PWDs ranging from body functions and structure, activity and participation, and environment factors.  ICF can be used as part of patients’ outcome measures. An example of applying ICF to a patient could be as follows. An ICF code assigned to a man suffering from stroke and conﬁned to bed would be d450.4 where d450 represents walking function and qualiﬁer  .4  represents the absolute problem of walking function  unable to walk at all . After six months of extensive physical therapy with some recovery of the affected body part, the patient is able to walk independently with a single cane. The ICF code for his walking ability is now d450.2 where qualiﬁer  .2  represents a moderate problem of walking because he still has to walk with an assistive device, however, his improvement of walking function can be addressed by the change of qualiﬁer from  .4  to  .2 .  The comprehensive data of quality of life of PWDs can be demonstrated using the ICF concept and codes. In 2012, Sirinart and Wachara conducted the survey using ICF to measure functions of PWDs living in a community  16 . Forty-six codes were utilized to represent functions of PWDs ranging from body functions and structure, activity and participation, and environment factors. Results of the survey are demon- strated in Figs. 13.2 and 13.3, representing impairment in body functions structures   13 Electronic Health Records: Beneﬁts and Contribution to Healthcare System  277  Fig. 13.2 Number of PWDs according to impairment in body functions structures  Fig. 13.3 Number of PWDs according to ability to perform activities of daily living  ADLs   and level of difﬁculties in performing activities of daily living  ADL , respectively. The greater proportions of persons suffering from some forms of impairment were seen in walking and memory functions. Healthcare providers may use the data to give the rehabilitation services for walking and memory functions the higher pri- orities. It appeared that most persons have no difﬁculties in performing activities of daily living although more of those may encounter difﬁculties with standing up from sitting on the ﬂoor and standing up from sitting on a chair or bed.  Home environment modiﬁcations are also part of the rehabilitation programs given that mobility are the results of the interaction between body functions and home environment. Both indoor and outdoor mobility could be enhanced if the en- vironments were appropriately provided. Figures 13.4, 13.5 and 13.6 show a PWD’s   278  Fig. 13.4 General house condition  S.

Table 13.1 shows an example of the ICF-based functioning data of PWDs before and after home en- vironment modiﬁcation. The functions expected to be improved included getting up from squatting  d4101 , getting up from sitting  d4103 , moving around indoor  d460  and moving around outdoor using equipments  d465 . The ﬁrst two func- tions’ improvements were represented by the change from qualiﬁer  .3  to qualiﬁer  .0  meaning that the PWD would be getting up from squatting and sitting easier after the home modiﬁcation and the functions of moving around indoor and outdoor would be improved at the best because the PWD would be able to move indepen- dently compared with previous mobility difﬁculties.  EHRs would provide data in timely accessible and user-friendly fashion to guide the design of home environment to improve the quality of life of PWDs. However, some factors should be taken into account because data users may live in remote areas with the supply of technology and if PWDs would also like to access the data, attention should be paid to the procedure of information accessibility.  13.4 Conclusion  The implementation of EHRs is very much likely to be beneﬁcial to patients and health system. The beneﬁts included improvement in quality of patient care both in   280  S. Tongsiri  ambulatory care and of those with chronic illnesses. Costs of care would be saved at which, eventually, a greater proportion of revenue can be expected. However, to successfully implement the EHRs, multiple factors should be taken into account. In the beginning, staffs and patients may not be familiar with the EHRs, therefore, there might be resistances and slowness in services leading to productivity loss. Staffs must also be trained to increase their competency dealing with the systems. Hardware implementation and maintenance as well as the software update would be costly and if not well prepared, problems occur. EHRs could also be beneﬁts for the provision of rehabilitation for PWDs in that functioning data could be processed to enhance the accessibility of systematic and timely database.  13.5 Next Step  Further research should see that it is promising for EHRs to be used to record func- tioning of patients and PWDs and determine disability beneﬁts and compensations. To achieve the goals of rehabilitation, data should be used to assist broader areas of rehabilitation and assist the extensive coordination of services across different providers. Meaningful use should be discussed among users. Use of the records is not only in health but also in education, employment and social beneﬁts, which are truly following the WHO’s “health”.  More research should be conducted for the evidence of quality of care improve- ment in rehabilitation for PWDs by EHRs using meaningful measures comparing settings with paper records and those with EHRs. Cost saving and ﬁnancial returns should also be taken into consideration.  References  1. Safran, C., Bloomrosen, M., Hammond, W., Labkoff, S., Markel-Fox, S., Tang, P. C., et al.  2007 .
