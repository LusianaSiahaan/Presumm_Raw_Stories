He loves  enterprise software start-ups and has worked at companies including Puppet Labs  and Sonatype on problems encompassing configuration management, repository  management, and patch management. Ironically, his first foray into book authorship  has nothing to do with any of these.  In his leisure time, he runs, speaks, writes, and spends time with his family. He has  learned that there is nothing more painful than the end of an ultramarathon, more  nerve-racking than your first conference talk, or more satisfying than a long writing  project. One day, he may be foolish enough to start his own company, but for now,  he is content to hone his product designing skills in the midst of the start-up culture.  Home is the verdant landscape of the Pacific Northwest, but Daniel enjoys a bit of  travel now and then. Between travel, family, work projects, and the personality of an  INTJ, he doesn't have much of a social life. He has no illusions that writing a book  will change this much.  I would like to thank my wife, Audrey, for bearing with my  weekends and evenings spent on this project. I would also like to  thank my son for his patience and forbearance while his Papa spent  so much time writing this thing called a "book". Not least, I would  like to thank Randall Hansen for introducing me to UX design and  pushing me to write, speak, and be a better person.  www.it-ebooks.info   About the Reviewers  Abu S.

Do you want to learn about frameworks that   make cross-device synchronization easy? Do you need to communicate the value   and efficacy of designing for everyone and not just people with a fast, reliable  Internet connection?  If so, this book is for you. We'll start by talking about the realities of poor and   non-existent Internet connections, then develop an offline app using Sencha Touch,  and gradually convert it to a fully functional online experience that retains the  robustness of its offline roots. You'll learn valuable tips and techniques that you can  use in your own projects.  What this book covers Chapter 1, The Pain of Being Offline, illustrates the pain of a typical offline experience  with a story. It explains how this is caused by not designing for the worst-case  scenario; in this case, a lack of Internet connectivity. It proposes that a better way of  developing web apps is to assume that a reliable Internet connection will not always  be available and hence, build to this assumption. Chapter 2, Building a To-do App, takes you through the setting up of your development  environment. It implements a basic offline version of the to-do app using Sencha  Touch. It describes the principles of a great offline experience and summarizes the  ways in which the app must evolve in an online context to continue to adhere to  those principles. Chapter 3, Designing Online Behavior, talks about using offline behavior as a guide and  planning the online experience of the app. What superset of features will the to-do  app support when online? Think about the app in terms of a bunker versus beach  house analogy.  [ ix ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 4, Getting Online, discusses the available offline databases  including  PouchDB, remoteStorage, and Hoodie  and switches the app storage to PouchDB.   It shows you how to use IBM Cloudant to host and distribute the data in your app. Chapter 5, Be Honest about What's Happening, informs the user whether the to-do app  is offline or online. It assures the users that the changes that they make while offline  will be eventually saved, so they don't need to worry about data loss. When the  network is flaky, adjust the behavior to compensate, inform the user of the trouble,  and let them provide direction. Chapter 6, Be Eventually Consistent, takes you through the split-brain problem that  occurs in networks when two databases lose connectivity, resulting in different data  in each database. Sometimes, these conflicts can be resolved automatically when  the connection is restored, but most often, it's not. Make the to-do app handle these  situations gracefully. Chapter 7, Choosing Intelligent Defaults, investigates where our defaults fall short and  how to improve them. Up to now, we've stuck with the standard defaults provided  by our offline database. Learn to recognize the scenarios where our defaults are  insufficient and ask  or infer from  the users to guide the caching behavior. Improve  the empty states and error messages in our app. Chapter 8, Networking While Offline, talks about the ways we can extend the illusion of  being online through these additional mechanisms: mesh networking, peer-to-peer  sharing, and spatial context. When offline, it's possible for a device to network with  other devices via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. Chapter 9, Testing and Measuring the UX, takes you through creating a test for the to- do app, showing how it performs under different network conditions. It runs both  the offline app and online app, comparing the behavior of each. It shows you how  the new app retains the robustness of the offline version, while adding the flexibility  of online functionality. It suggests the ways in which it could be further improved  and ends with suggestions for further reading.  What you need for this book A laptop or desktop and  optionally  a mobile device running one of the major  mobile operating systems. The instructions in this book assume that you use the  Chrome browser and Apple products, but the development tools are cross-platform,  so any of the major browsers or operating systems should suffice.  If you want to deploy your app to an iOS device, you will need to purchase an   Apple Developer membership. We will discuss the details of this in Chapter 2,  Building a To-do App.  [ x ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Who this book is for This book is for mobile application designers and developers who work with  applications that rely heavily on Internet connectivity and who would like   to improve the robustness and ease of use of their applications through the   adoption of the offline-first paradigm.

[ xiii ]  www.it-ebooks.info   www.it-ebooks.info   The Pain of Being Offline  Susan Hopkins is the VP of design at a tech start-up in Silicon Valley. At 63 employees  and counting, her day is as much about hiring and culture as it is about design. In her  15-year career, she's seen plenty of both.  Right now, she's shepherding the design of the company's first 1.0 product. There are  a lot of moving parts shared among product, design, development, marketing, sales,  documentation, and support. She has to wear a lot of hats. She loves every minute of  it, but it's a challenging job.  Fortunately, Susan has to-do lists. Everything in her life is organized in this way:  shopping, work, personal projects, gift ideas, movies to watch, books to read, travel  destinations, and more. As long as she can create and check off items from her lists,  life is good.  Unfortunately, not all is well today. Her favorite to-do app, the place where she  stores all of her lists, behaves poorly when offline. When the Internet connection   goes down or becomes unreliable, Susan has the following problems:     Her to-do lists fail to load.    She doesn't have confidence that the to-do items she created on other devices   are being shown on this one.     The source of the truth is in the cloud. When she is offline, her devices tend   to diverge from this source in reconcilable ways.     Susan attaches photos and videos to her to-do items. Any data connection   slower than 4G is an exercise in patience.     She has been an evangelist for this app, which has gotten some of her friends   to use it. They like sharing items as a group, but when their phones are  offline, they can't.     The app has a tendency to show scary error messages. They make her think   that she's lost some data. Sometimes she has, but it's never easy to tell.  [ 1 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Susan closed her laptop lid. The conference's Wi-Fi was really bad this year. Susan  wasn't the kind to give up easily, but you can't be productive on an unreliable  Internet connection. Fifteen disconnections in one hour? Really? A few seconds ago,  her to-do app crashed, losing the last fifteen minutes of work. Just great! She opened her phone. No Signal showed prominently in the upper left corner. No  luck there either. Bother.  This seems to happen all the time lately. Her rural home is in a dead zone. Her  commuter bus spends twenty minutes out of every hour in tunnels and behind  mountain ridges. She encounters infamously bad Wi-Fi at every other Airbnb  accommodation. Even at work, her Internet connection seems to go down once a  week—and always at the worst times.  It wouldn't be so bad if my applications handled these situations gracefully, she  thought; but they don't. They crash, and stutter, and freeze, and lose my data, and  raise my blood pressure.  To be fair, not every application is that bad. E-mail is generally solid, e-readers have  all the content that I want, already cached, and my office suite doesn't care at all.  However, this to-do app drives me crazy, and it's not the only app that is unreliable.  Social apps, mapping apps, audio streaming apps—they all have the same problems.  A thought occurred to her.  What if a proper offline experience was the starting point? What if developers made  offline functionality their top priority instead of the first feature to get cut? What if  we lived in a world that was optimistic about fast, reliable, and ubiquitous Internet  connectivity but didn't assume its existence? People would find their apps more  useful and have less frustration in their day-to-day tasks.  Phone and laptop forgotten for now, Susan pulled out her sketch pad and a black  marker pen. She started drawing.  The offline paradigm Internet connectivity is only one part of the puzzle. Modern devices rely on different  types of wireless networks: GPS, LTE, 4G, 3G, Edge, GPRS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and RFID,  among others. If any of these go down, she mused, certain bad things can happen:      If GPS goes down, it can mess up your fitness tracking resulting in erratic  maps and false progress toward your fitness goals.     As your mobile connection degrades from 4G to GPRS, web browsing slows   and eventually stops. Wi-Fi has the same problem.  [ 2 ]  www.it-ebooks.info      Bluetooth is also important. It connects us to our keyboards, mouses,  headsets, and other devices. As the signal weakens, these accessories   become unreliable or cease functioning altogether.     NFC, while not ubiquitous today, certainly will be so in the future. We'll   depend on it for all or most of our Point of Sale  POS  financial transactions.  If it goes down, can we use other networks as backup?  Susan stopped writing and put down her pen. She gazed reflectively at the list. The  paper lay on top of her laptop as though mocking the brick that lay underneath.  So, with these failure cases, how might we develop our apps differently? More  importantly, is there a common set of principles that we can use in order to avoid  reinventing the wheel each time? What makes an excellent offline experience?  Hand reached for pen and she began a second list:  Principles for a great offline experience are as follows:     Give me uninterrupted access to the content I care about.    Content is mutable. Don't let my online offline status change that.    Error messages should not leave me guessing or unnecessarily worried.    Don't let me start something I can't finish.    An app should never contradict itself. If a conflict exists, be honest about it.    When the laws of physics prevail, choose breadth over depth when caching.    Empty states should tell me what to do next in a delightful way.    Don't make me remember what I was doing last. Remember for me.    Degrade gracefully as the network degrades. Don't be jarring.    Never purge the cache unless I demand it.  Susan put her pen down. A good list. She gave a contented nod, put the paper in her  bag, and walked out of the café, humming to herself. It was an interesting thought  exercise and possibly more. She would bring it up with her design team at their   10 o'clock review. Their project might benefit from these principles.  Developing for a worst-case scenario A common practice is to design for the happy path, a scenario where everything  works correctly and according to plan. These scenarios tend to paint an overly  optimistic picture of the real world. When the happy path meets real-world problems,  the charade is over and the app must undergo serious revision or a rewrite.  [ 3 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   This is bad for a number of reasons. Obviously, rewriting an app is costly. One of  the tenets of good software development is to fail quickly and rapidly. If you finish  your app, only to find that it doesn't work as advertised, you've failed far too late.  Even if you don't have to rewrite the app, bolting on fixes to address fundamental  problems with the underlying architecture can cause bugs that tend to linger until  the inevitable rewrite.  The alternative is to start by designing for a worst-case scenario. Worst-case  scenarios are more representative of the real world so apps are more likely to behave  as you expect. These scenarios tend to be harder to solve but result in a robust  solution that covers more edge cases. As a worst-case scenario is a superset of the  happy path, you get two solutions for the price of one.  This strategy can be employed in many other areas, such as security, responsive web  design, accessibility, and performance. The approach is simple. Pick one or more  worst-case scenarios that impact your app the most and build with these scenarios in  mind. A worst-case scenario is an excellent constraint. The more constraints you add,  the easier it is to design a great solution.  So, what is an offline user experience? We can boil down the principles from Susan's  list in the previous section to form a concise definition: An offline user experience bridges the gap between online and offline contexts by providing  equivalent functionality and content to the extent that technology and the laws of physics   will allow.  To design this experience, it's vital to understand the pain and frustration that people  encounter every day. There are a million ways to build an offline-first experience,  but the correct solution is formed by the needs of your audience. The story in the  previous section was one example but you can find an infinite number of scenarios.  Once you know who you're developing for and their pain points, devising a solution  is much simpler.  Let's go through a few more offline scenarios to get you going. Once you start  thinking about who your audience is, write scenarios such as these to describe how  the offline experience impacts them. Talk to people. Observe them in the real world.  Do research to see what others have found. These are all the things that can help you  build a more accurate picture of your target audience.  [ 4 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Going on an off-the-grid vacation Once a year, Carl disappears into the wilderness for a two-week trek along the  Pacific Crest Trail in the Western United States. He does this to get away from  technology. However, sometimes, due to the nature of his job, he has to respond to  an important e-mail or take the occasional phone call.  There is no cellular coverage out in the pines. To connect, Carl has to leave the forests  behind and hitch a ride to the nearest hotel. After a hot shower and some real food,  he powers up his Android and endures shoddy hotel Wi-Fi for the evening. It's an  inconvenience but a compromise that Carl is willing to accept.  Living in a third-world country Marsha owns an old Nokia phone with an i9 keypad. She has access to a slow GPRS  network, which often goes down. As modern websites are so bandwidth-intensive,  her phone so slow, and online connectivity so tenuous, she turns off images and  media when she browses.  In the next town, the mobile network is slightly better but it's a five-mile walk. When  Marsha needs to e-mail photos, she composes draft e-mails and queues them on her  phone. Once a week, she treks into town to deliver milk from their small herd of  cattle. During this time, she is able to send those e-mails. It's a slow and frustrating  experience but she can't do much about it.  Commuting on public transportation Elizabeth travels on a bus for an hour each way on her daily commute. The bus  doesn't have Wi-Fi and encounters several dead zones on the route. She is a  dedicated bibliophile, so these routes are a great opportunity to feed her reading  addiction. As she reads 1-3 books a week, she often runs out of reading material.  When this happens on the bus, she can't usually do anything about it. Her life is  so busy that she mostly doesn't have time to think about downloading new books  before her commute. Maybe she'll bring a paperback along next time for something  to do.  Working on a Wi-Fi only device Shawon is 14. On his last birthday, his parents bought him an iPod touch. He wanted  an iPhone for the coolness factor, but, oh well. It's fine. It doesn't have GPS or a  mobile plan but most of the time, it's as good as a real iPhone.  [ 5 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Like most kids, he relies on his parents for transportation and accompanies them on  their errands. As he has a Wi-Fi only device, he often goes somewhere new, only to  have to figure out what the Wi-Fi password is—if the place even has Wi-Fi. There  aren't many Wi-Fi networks without passwords these days.  When he can't find the password, he has to stay contented with the games and music  that are on his device. However, most of his games require an Internet connection,  which is odd, particularly for games with a single-player mode.  Sharing files between mobile devices Francine likes her world where file sharing is so easy and seamless. In 2005, you used  USB drives. In 2015, you share files wirelessly, with technology and services such as  Dropbox, Google Drive, and Airdrop. Unfortunately, when her Internet connection  dies, she's transported back to 2005.  Just last week, her editor asked for an update to an outline that she wrote. Traveling  at the time, she didn't have easy access to Wi-Fi. She made the changes on her laptop  but couldn't transfer the file to her phone in order to be e-mailed. After struggling  with this for several minutes, her Airbnb host replied with instructions to connect to  the network. Crisis averted.  Streaming a high-definition video from  YouTube Brian streams online videos, a lot. Most of this streaming is over his phone.  His mobile provider is kind of horrible, so he has to deal with dodgy Internet  connectivity. Most of the time, YouTube is very good about decreasing the quality   of the videos to compensate for bad network conditions, but it isn't always enough.  He wishes there was a way to get a transcription of the video or just wait for the  entire thing to download before playing it. YouTube won't download an entire video  when it's paused. Unfortunately, these features don't exist. Instead, Brian bookmarks  the videos to watch at home.  Online shopping with your phone Jasmine is not an organized person. She likes taking care of things in the moment, as  they come to mind. As a busy professional, she doesn't have the mental resources to  memorize lists and doesn't want to be tied to a to-do app or sheet of paper.  [ 6 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Shopping is one example. Throughout her day, she does a mental inventory as she  moves about. When she spots an item in short supply, she grabs her phone and  places an order with her Amazon app. When she's connected to the Internet, this  works great. When she's not, it frustrates her that she can't take care of things. If only  Amazon provided a better add-to-cart experience for people who want to buy things  while offline.  Getting work done at a conference Conferences are notorious for their abysmal Wi-Fi. Raphael is attending Whole  Design, along with 1,500 other attendees. It's a three-day, single-track conference.  On day two, with four hours to go, he is ready to be done fighting for bandwidth.  He hasn't gotten much done beyond seeing some great talks. Even his cell phone,  normally reliable, doesn't work here at all.  Every couple of hours, the attendees get a 30-minute break. Raphael uses these  opportunities to sprint outside the venue. Here, he can get a solid 3G connection.  This is enough to check his e-mail and chats and generally check in with his world.  At least, it should be. His apps behave as though there's a binary switch between no  bandwidth at all and enough to stream an HD video. A third option would be nice.  Principles of a good offline design Once you've compiled a few scenarios such as these, identify some common  principles to build your app around. Here are the principles that Susan identified at  the beginning of the chapter, with a more detailed explanation for each one. Give me uninterrupted access to the content I care about.  When offline, you don't want to open your app and have no content to consume or  interact with. You want to have lots of content available. As an extreme example,  a web browser that allows you to surf the entire Internet, as it appeared when you  were last online, would be a fantastic experience. This doesn't exist because the laws  of physics prevent such an experience.  Naturally, you can't provide an infinite amount of content for people. Instead,  provide as much content as possible without hurting the user experience in other  ways  that is, don't steal all their bandwidth, don't fill up all the space on their  device, don't let the performance suffer, and so on . Content is mutable. Don't let my online offline status change that.  [ 7 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   One common practice is to make content read-only while offline. When online, you  can edit, delete, or manipulate the content, but offline, the only thing that you can  do is view it. People want to work with their data regardless, but you're telling them  that they can't, usually for no good reason.  Instead, as much as possible, make online behavior match offline behavior. Once  you've decided what people can do with their data, try to apply these decisions to all  situations. You'll make their lives easier, and yours, as you only have to design and  build a single interaction paradigm. Error messages should not leave me guessing or unnecessarily worried. A cryptic error message is a bad error message. Well-designed applications should  be clear, using human language and a consistent vocabulary. Error messages should  be no different. Unfortunately, error messages are often overlooked in the design  process. When this happens, the application assumes two faces: a friendly face when  everything is fine and a distressing face when things go wrong.  The effect can be jarring and incomprehensible to some people. When their world is  falling apart, they need more reassurance and help from their tools, not less. Make  sure that you think about the wording in the error messages and how errors present  themselves visually. Don't let me start something I can't finish.  While performing a task, the further I get, the more vested I become in the outcome.  For example, let's say I start a task consisting of eight steps. On step seven, if you tell  me that I can't finish because I'm offline, I'll be frustrated. If you tell me that I can't  save my progress and will have to try again later, I'll be furious.  Don't do that. Be up front about what I can or cannot do. Don't let me proceed down  a path with a known dead end. An app should never contradict itself. If a conflict exists, be honest about it. In Chapter 6, Be Eventually Consistent we'll discuss split-brain scenarios. A split-brain  scenario occurs when two people change the same data at the same time, on different  devices. When the devices try to reconcile their data automatically, they can't. It's up  to people to decide what change to keep and what to throw away.  In a poorly designed application, several things can happen. The app can clobber  one of the changes without asking, resulting in confusion. It can show both of the  changes side by side without explanation, which is also confusing. It might also enter  a cryptic failure state, which leaves people even more confused and powerless.  [ 8 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Always get input from people when a conflict cannot be automatically resolved. If  you must show inconsistent data, always provide an explanation. When the laws of physics prevail, choose breadth over depth when caching. As mentioned in the first principle, infinite caching violates the laws of physics.  There will often be more data than you can reasonably cache. You have to make a  prioritization decision. What data is most valuable to people? Cache that data first.  In most applications, there are different types of data that can be cached. As older  data is usually less valuable than newer data, the more you cache, the value of  caching in a particular category goes down. At some point, continuing to cache a  particular data type is less valuable than switching to a different data type.  First, cache a small set of data across all the types. Then, go progressively deeper  across all the data types simultaneously, with the more valuable types prioritized.  As a result, no empty screens will appear when people skim the app. The UI will feel  data rich on the surface and deep in all the right parts, which is what they want. Empty states should tell me what to do next in a delightful way.  If there is nothing in the cache, you will have to show an empty state. There is very  little that people can do with these states, which is a bad experience.  However, these states can be more than blank screens. They can tell people what  to do next. They can be delightful: providing a clever message, image, animation,  or video that people wouldn't ordinarily see. They can contain sample data, which  people can interact with to see how the screen would ordinarily work. They can even  keep people entertained with a game, puzzle, or other distractions.  Empty states are very easy to ignore. When engineering resources are tight, they are  among the first things to be cut. Figure out how often people will see these relative  to the other screens and then apply resources appropriately. During offline usage,  empty states are more likely to occur. Don't make me remember what I was doing last. Remember for me.  Context is king. If I close my app, preserve my current state. When I reopen the  app, I want to see what I was doing last or find it simple to get there. The more  complicated the app, the more important this is.  Many apps forget the context when switching from online to offline. They give  themselves permission to reset certain parts of the UI, which is jarring and easily  avoidable. As with most of these other principles, don't compromise on the attributes  of a good experience just because an app happens to be offline.  [ 9 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Degrade gracefully as the network degrades. Don't be jarring. Networks are not binary. There is a lot of gray area between not working at all and  working very well. One of the goals of an invisible design is to avoid speed bumps  in the user experience. An interface may switch abruptly from an online mode to an  offline one, or worse, toggle rapidly between the two states. If implemented poorly,  this will interrupt the flow and make it more difficult for people to get their work done.  Help the application see or anticipate an impending loss of connectivity. When  appropriate, it should scale back its bandwidth usage, avoid massive changes   to the interface, and gently nudge people if they are encountering any problems.  The goal is a smooth transition from online to offline that informs the user in an  unobtrusive way. Never purge the cache unless I demand it.  Cache is the most valuable aspect of an offline experience. If the cache goes away  while offline, people won't have any content. This is a bad experience. Protect   the cache at all costs. Don't clear it unless people ask for it explicitly  usually for  security reasons .  The latter implies an affordance to clear the cache. Web browsers have one but a lot  of apps don't. This is extremely important, particularly when login credentials are  involved. People may want to purge their data for a good many reasons. They may  even need to do it remotely from another device.  Making the case to yourself Unreliable and nonexistent Internet connectivity is a widespread problem, both  in highly developed nations and nations that are less developed. Consider a few  statistics from ITU, the United Nations specialized agency for information and  communication technologies  http:  www.itu.int en ITU-D Statistics  Documents facts ICTFactsFigures2015.pdf :     As of 2015, 4 billion people from developing countries remain offline    Only 9.5% of the people in the least developed countries  LDCs  use    the Internet  or faster     Only 29% of the people in rural areas have mobile coverage that is 3G       Only 1 in 100 people in Africa have a fixed broadband subscription  [ 10 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   If you optimize for a fast Internet connection, you are making an implicit decision  about who you're designing for. If you don't want Internet connectivity to dictate  who can use your app, design the offline experience first. Even if you're building  an application that only Americans will use, consider that potentially 3 out of every  100 people are eking out a mere 56 kbps. Every megabyte has a large impact on their  user experience and ISP bills. This doesn't mean that you have to build an app that looks like Craigslist. There are  intelligent ways to make an app scale its behavior based on the Internet connection  available. You can even use location services to become aware about the potential  dead zones in time to take preventative measures. We'll cover these strategies in  Chapter 8, Networking While Offline. Are you convinced that building with an offline-first mindset is a good idea? Great!  Now, how do you sell this vision to the decision makers around you? Many activities  have a negative impact on productivity in the short-term but a positive impact in the  long-term: writing tests, conducting user research, including good comments in the  source code, and so on. In the same way, switching to an offline-first paradigm can  be perceived as an unnecessary distraction, even though the long-term benefits are  clear. Let's address this now.  Making the case to others If offline usage is so important, why don't we optimize for it? One reason is internal:  it's hard to change our innate behaviors and habits. Developers are on the cutting  edge and have difficulty imagining a world where computers are slow and Internet  connections are flaky. Fortunately, there are tools to help us simulate that other world.  Even if we overcome this obstacle, there are still external hurdles to change:     We have to convince other developers that this will help us build better   products, more efficiently     We have to convince other designers that this will improve the user experience    We have to convince our boss or others in upper-level management that this   will increase our revenue  These are harder conversations to have but worthwhile. One of the goals of this  book is to provide the evidence that you need to convince the developers, designers,  and management in your organization. Offline-first development can improve your  ability to deliver in all of these areas.  [ 11 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Convincing other developers Developers care about efficiency and don't want to write more code than necessary.  The extra care that goes into an offline-first application can, at a glance, seem to  necessitate more code. You might get pushback that the team wants to build the  easiest thing first and leave the offline functionality for later. This is a mistake.  Instead, have a discussion about the architecture and tools that can ease the  development effort. In Chapter 4, Getting Online, we'll show how tools such as PouchDB, remotestorage. io, and Hoodie, custom built for offline use, can greatly reduce the amount of code  that your team will need to write. These tools allow you to write good offline code,  once. As applications are built, they gain complexity. This complexity makes them  more difficult to change in the future. Using the right tools up front can save days or  weeks of development time over the long run.  To make the case, show all the ways that an online app that is not optimized for  offline usage can fail. The following chapters will talk about these situations in detail.  Describe the pain that users experience while encountering these scenarios. If possible,  take an existing app and write a task-based script that exercises these scenarios.  If your team is still skeptical, find people willing to try offline tasks on the app that  you've built or a simple prototype. Invite your coworkers to attend. There's nothing  like a firsthand observation of people struggling with a key part of your app to  convert team members to your side.  Convincing other designers Functional designers care about how people solve problems using the app. The trick is  that there are many problems to be solved and you can't expect others to give offline  problems the priority that they deserve. One way to measure priority is by the number  of people affected by the problem. As offline problems are so widespread, you can  make a strong case that every person using your app will benefit to some extent.  To start the discussion, build a task flow diagram for your application. This will help  you see the scope of the app from a workflow perspective. In the diagram, point  out the offline error cases and how these will affect the experience that people have.  When functional designers see all the dead ends that their target audience might  experience, they will be motivated to join you.  [ 12 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Visual designers may be a bit harder to convince. They too care about the   experience of an app but care more about the clarity of the presentation rather   than the functionality. Take the task flow diagram that you built earlier and mock  rough screens that correlate to each step in the flow, including the error cases. Make  sure that everyone is aware of the total surface area to be designed, not just the  happy path. Often, designers don't see the whole picture up front because they're  working from a theoretical model of how things might work, not a model that has  been battle-tested in the real world. By building an accurate map of the world, your  designers become better equipped to design a clear and delightful interface.  Convincing your boss or the upper-level  management The business cares about generating revenue. This goal is often in opposition to  spending time on quality software that works well in a variety of adverse conditions.  Correspondingly, these are some of the hardest people to convince. You must show  that changing the way you do design and development will positively impact the  bottom line.  People have a very low tolerance for apps that don't function. Only 16% of those who  fail to use an app the first time will return  http:  techcrunch.com 2013 03 12  users-have-low-tolerance-for-buggy-apps-only-16-will-try-a-failing- app-more-than-twice  . If one of the 4 billion people that are without a regular  Internet connection tries to use your app and can't because they're offline, how long  will they stay with yours before uninstalling and switching to a competitor's app?  On the other hand, if you're the only app among your competitors to provide an  exceptional offline experience, you're more likely to gain market share and positive  reviews from the billions of people impacted by poor offline experiences.  Revenue aside, if there are people in the management chain who care about design,  your job is easier. The higher they are in the chain, the easier still. You can argue  with them about design on even terms as they're already convinced of its value. If  the CEO wants well-designed products, your job as a design emissary is done.  [ 13 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Summary In this chapter, we established a case for why you want to approach application  development with an offline-first mindset. In the next chapter, you will build a basic  offline to-do app. Each subsequent chapter will build on this base. By the end of  the book, you will have transformed this base into a fully capable online app that  translates seamlessly between the online and offline worlds.  Open your development environment and let's get started.  [ 14 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Building a To-do App  In Chapter 1, The Pain of Being Offline, we laid the foundation for why offline-first  development is important. Now, let's build an app with this approach. The app  that we'll be building is a to-do app that has been written using the Sencha Touch  JavaScript framework. As Sencha Touch is just JavaScript under the hood, you can  view it in any browser. Additionally, if you're a mobile developer, fear not. We'll   use Cordova to deploy your app to an iOS device as well. The section on Cordova   is entirely optional and works for Android as well, with minor modifications along  the way.  Let's start by getting your development environment configured. For simplicity,  I assume that you're running Mac OS X and Chrome. The instructions may differ  slightly with different operating systems and browsers. I'll call out the differences   as we go along.  Configuring the development tools There are three tools that we will use in most of the examples: a text editor for   the coding, a browser  preferably Chrome  to run and debug your app, and the  command line to run the web server and execute commands. Let's walk through  each of these tools.  A text editor If you have an existing editor that you like, use that. In this book, I will use   Sublime Text 3. You can download a free evaluation of Sublime for OS X,   Windows, and Linux. If you prefer to use a free editor, good choices include  Notepad++  Windows , Bluefish Editor  OS X and Linux , and GVIM  Linux .   To install Sublime, follow these instructions:  1.  Open www.sublimetext.com in your browser.  [ 15 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   2.  Click on Download. 3.  Click on Sublime Text 3. 4.  Choose the appropriate version for your operating system. 5.  Wait for the download to complete and run the installer.  You should be able to run Sublime now. It's a GUI-based editor that is very intuitive  and simple to use. If you're interested in getting more out of Sublime, check out the  documentation at www.sublimetext.com docs 3 .  A browser I recommend Chrome because it is cross-platform and has an excellent suite of  developer tools, including tools for mobile development. You can Download  Chrome from www.google.com chrome. Once Chrome is installed, start it. To open the developer tools, click on View   Developer  Developer Tools. Then, to enable the mobile app view, toggle the  device mode:  Mobile development toggle  [ 16 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   This gives you a grid and viewport sized to the dimensions of a mobile device. You  may need to resize the browser and refresh the page for the changes to take effect:  Mobile development mode  [ 17 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   A command line Use the default command-line tool that comes with your operating system. For OS  X, that's a terminal. For Windows, that's cmd.exe. For Linux, that's  usually  bash.  As we build the app, I'll provide most of the commands that you need to run, but  here are a few additional commands that you may find helpful when navigating and  manipulating the filesystem:  Command ls  dir on Windows  cd [. ..  ]  cd [.\..\C:\] on  Windows  mkdir dir_name ⌘ + C  Ctrl + C on Windows   Description This will list the contents of the current directory This is the change to a directory starting from  the current parent root directory This will create a directory named dir_name This will terminate the currently running  command  Homebrew There are a couple of non-native package managers that you will need later in  development. As OS X does not include a native package manager, Homebrew   was created to service this need. Let's install it now:  1.  Open www.brew.sh. 2.  Copy the Ruby command:  Copy the Homebrew install command  [ 18 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   3.  Paste the command in your terminal:  4.  Follow the installation instructions.  Install Homebrew  Now, when you need to install a package with Homebrew, use the following  syntax on the command line: $ brew install    npm What Homebrew is for OS X, npm is for JavaScript. It comes preinstalled as a part of  Node.js and as we'll need this library as well, let's install both now:  $ brew install node  Java You will need a Java Runtime Environment to run some of the commands in this  book. First, check to see if Java is already installed:  $ java -version  If Java is installed with version 1.7 or greater, you're ready to go. If not, install a  recent version of Java:  1.  Open www.java.com en download. 2.  Click on Free Java Download. 3.  Click on Agree and Start Free Download. 4.  Once the download is complete, open the file that you downloaded. 5.  Click on Continue.  [ 19 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   6.  Click on Install. 7.  Enter your credentials, if requested. 8.  After the installation is complete, click on Close.  Finally, verify that Java and its proper version has been installed:  $ java -version  Arranging your workspace Almost as important as the tools themselves is the way you arrange them on your  screen. The exact layout may vary depending on the size and number of your  screens, but on a 15-inch laptop, the following setup works well for me:  Workspace arrangement  On the bottom right-hand side is my command-line tool. I have two tabs that are  open. The first tab is where I run my web server. The second tab is where I input  other commands and is used more frequently of the two.  On the top right-hand side is my text editor, where I can browse the project files and  edit code. When I make a change, I use ⌘ + Tab  Win + Tab on Windows  to switch to  my browser and preview the change.  [ 20 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   On the left-hand side is my browser. I use this to preview changes to the code,  monitor the developer console for error and debug messages, and inspect the   DOM if I'm trying to troubleshoot a bug.  Additionally, not pictured, I have a separate fullscreen browser in order to browse  documentation and search Google for help when I run into problems. If you have a  second screen, it would be a great place to put this.  Now that you have your development tools and workspace configured, let's get the  toolchain up and running.  Configuring Sencha Touch Sencha Touch is a JavaScript-based MVC framework used to build cross-platform  mobile apps. It's a proprietary framework but free for open source projects, so we'll  use it for our to-do app. To get and configure it, follow these instructions:  1.  First we will download Sencha Touch:  1.  Open https:  www.sencha.com products touch  in your   browser.  2.  Click on DOWNLOAD FOR FREE. 3.  Fill out the contact form and click on DOWNLOAD TOUCH. 4.  Check your e-mail for a link to download Sencha Touch. 5.  6.  After the download is complete, extract the ZIP in its own folder. 7.  Open this folder  it should be named touch-2.4.1 or similar .

Next, we'll  prepare a directory for your application, start developing the application itself,   and commit it safely to GitHub.  Creating a Git repository This step is optional but highly recommended. It will prevent you from losing  progress when you accidentally delete files and allow you to easily revert changes or  try experiments without fear of diverging from the examples in the book.  You may also choose to use GitHub  or another code sharing site  to upload your  code. This protects your code from hard drive failure and makes it easier to share  and collaborate with others. Again, this step is optional but recommended. If you  want to use Git and GitHub, perform the following steps:  First, we will install GitHub. The following instructions are for OS X only. If you're  on Windows, download the GitHub client from windows.github.com and install it  the way you would install other Windows applications:  1.  Open mac.github.com in your browser. 2.  Click on Download GitHub Desktop. 3.  After the download is complete, open the application. 4.  Click on Move to my application folder. 5.  Click on Continue. 6.   If you don't have a GitHub account already, create one here; otherwise, log in  with your existing credentials.  7.  Click on Continue. 8.  Enter your name and e-mail address. 9.  Click on Install Command Line Tools. 10.  Click on Continue.  [ 23 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   11.  Click on Done:  Create a repository and upload it to GitHub:  GitHub tool  1.  Click the + icon to create a repository. 2.  Type todo-app for the repository name. 3.  Click on Choose…. 4.  Select a folder on your computer where you want to develop the app.  I   recommend creating a projects directory under $HOME.   5.  Click on Open. 6.  Click on Create Repository. 7.  Click on Publish to upload your new repository to GitHub. 8.  Type Initial commit in the description field. 9.  Click on Push Repository.  [ 24 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   That's it! After you publish to GitHub, you can log in to your GitHub account and  view these changes from any computer or device. You can download the repository,  share it with others, and even make changes directly through your browser. GitHub is free for open source software  OSS  projects. If you want to make the  repository private, GitHub charges a reasonable monthly fee. Alternatively, you can  choose not to use GitHub, but you'll want to make sure to back up your repository.  As we continue to develop the app, we'll prompt you to commit your changes to Git.  As a developer, committing to Git should be as common and natural as saving files  in your editor.  Designing the offline experience In the last section, you configured the tools necessary to make your app real. Now,  let's step back and design the app in the context of some of the offline scenarios that  we discussed in Chapter 1, The Pain of Being Offline.  What do users need from this app and why? Designers often employ user stories to break a scenario into chunks. Each user story  takes a person, describes a specific need that they have, and reveals the context  behind the need. The format that we will use in this book is as follows:     As [a person]       So that [context about the goal]  I want [to accomplish a goal]  Let's talk briefly about each clause. How do user stories help us understand what we  need to design and build?     As [a user]: This helps us understand who we're building for. If this person  works with other people, we can  and should  consider how they will work  together as a team. This is extremely important in communication-oriented  products. Our simple to-do app considers a single user, Susan, but you could  easily write additional stories that reference her friends, acquaintances,   and coworkers. I want [to accomplish a goal]: This helps us understand what the person  is trying to get done. It should focus on actions and goals with a concrete  outcome. By itself, this isn't enough to tell us what to build. We still lack the  context around the need. That's what the next clause informs us about.      [ 25 ]  www.it-ebooks.info      So that [context about the goal]: Unlike the As and I want clauses, there   may be multiple So that clauses in a single story. The context behind a need  may be complex so we should capture it fully. These help us understand the  motivation behind the need. Motivation is important because the same need  with different motivations can manifest itself in very different solutions. For  example, so that I don't lose my job will result in a very cautious, accident- averse solution as compared with so that I learn to fail quickly.  Once you've written one user story, write another. Depending on the complexity  of the scenarios and granularity of each story, an app may have as few as five user  stories or as many as fifty. However, it is unlikely that you will build all of them  at once. This is an exploratory phase to discover needs that are both primary and  ancillary to the app that you're building.  User stories do not live in isolation. If your app is at all complex, you should map  the stories relative to each other. This will help you spot patterns that may influence  the way you choose to implement them. Give each user story a brief title in order to  make it stand out at a glance, then group the stories by user, function, or complexity.  We won't map our to-do app stories as there are so few of them, but definitely read  about story mapping online if you want to learn more. Here are five user stories associated with Susan's scenario from Chapter 1, The Pain of  Being Offline:      Items should display while offline: As Susan, I want my to-do items to  always appear once they are downloaded so that I can remain productive  while offline, I don't have to worry about data loss, and I can learn to trust  my to-do app to Do The Right Thing™.     Keep all my devices in sync: As Susan, I want the to-do items on all my  devices to remain in sync so that I don't have to wonder whether a device  has a particular to-do item, I can just grab the nearest device and start typing,  and my source of truth is the list itself, not one of several devices.     Don't keep me waiting: As Susan, I want my to-do app to feel fast and ready   to go at all times so that editing my to-do list is as frictionless as pen on  paper, I never feel like I'm waiting, and I don't give up and neglect to write  something down.     Sharing with friends should be bulletproof: As Susan, I want to share items   easily with friends regardless of where we are so that we can coordinate  ourselves, sharing with friends who are close by feels visceral and physical,  and I don't have to rely on third-party solutions, hacks, or intermediaries.     Safeguard my data: As Susan, I want everything that I type in the app to be  preserved so that I don't lose anything accidentally, the app earns my trust,  and I can always go back, revert, undo, and so on and so forth.  [ 26 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   How will people accomplish their goals using  the app? User stories do two things: they point us in the direction of the final solution and  give us constraints that eliminate options. Both of these functions are valuable but  still very abstract. How do we flesh out the design in more detail?  One excellent approach is through workflows. Workflows describe a path, or paths,  through an application by which people can accomplish their goals  as illustrated in  the user stories . They are most often visualized as flowcharts.  The following flowchart describes the offline workflows through our to-do app.  The chart consists of two types of components: rectangles and circles. Rectangles  represent specific views in the application by which people can observe the state of  the UI and orient themselves to it. Circles represent specific actions that people may  perform on a view:  Workflow  [ 27 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   With this basic workflow in place, let's look at each user story and see how the  workflow maps to it. Some of the user stories imply an online experience and   thus won't be solved in the first offline version of the app. We'll note this   where appropriate.  Items should display while offline As the entire app is offline, this is a trivial problem to solve. Items created in the   to-do app are always stored locally and thus always available for display. We will  solve this more rigorously in Chapter 4, Getting Online for the online case.  Keep all my devices in sync As the first version of the app is offline, each instance of the app has its own local  database with no syncing required. In Chapter 4, Getting Online, we will introduce  multidevice support and add incremental improvements in Chapter 5, Be Honest   about What's Happening, Chapter 6, Be Eventually Consistent, and Chapter 8, Networking  While Offline.  Don't keep me waiting Again, this is trivial to solve in an offline context. Loading data from the local  storage is extremely fast. When we add online support, we will have to account for  network bandwidth and latency with delays of milliseconds  or even seconds . We  will address these concerns in Chapter 7, Choosing Intelligent Defaults and Chapter 8,  Networking While Offline.  From an interaction perspective, the workflow implies a maximum of three clicks for  any path. The worst-case scenario—editing an item—involves the following steps:     Click an item in the list to view it    Click to edit the item    Click to save the item  This is reasonable but could be improved to one or two clicks if we employed inline  editing or autosave. For the sake of simplicity, I will leave this as an exercise for   the reader.  [ 28 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Sharing with friends should be bulletproof Technically, sharing does not require an Internet connection. With Wi-Fi and  Bluetooth, it is possible to share to-do items without an Internet connection. We will  solve basic sharing over the Internet in Chapter 4, Getting Online with an exploration  of Wi-Fi and Bluetooth in Chapter 8, Networking While Offline.  Safeguard my data While offline, the phone is the source of truth for the data. As long as the phone has  regular backups, data is relatively safe. However, with an active Internet connection,  we can back up the data to the cloud at more frequent intervals. We will implement  a basic Internet backup solution in Chapter 4, Getting Online with improvements in  Chapter 5, Be Honest about What's Happening and Chapter 6, Be Eventually Consistent.  What does the app look like, roughly? In the workflow, we can see that there are three primary views in the app: a list of   to-dos, a form to create a new item, and a form to edit an existing item. Let's build  these with some basic wireframes.  It's often the case that you don't end up with a carbon copy of your initial design.  As you iterate on the design and turn it into code, you will discover obstacles, easier  ways to do something, or a better approach. As long as the finished solution works  and complies with your requirements in a well-designed way, it's actually better to  adjust your design to these realities as you go along.  As we build our to-do app, you'll notice some of this behavior. In this chapter,  compare our wireframes with the finished product. While we won't go into the  reasons behind the discrepancies, think about why these differences exist. Would it  have been better to stick with the original design or is the final app actually simpler  and better than it otherwise would have been?  [ 29 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   A list of to-dos This screen displays a list of outstanding to-do items. It allows you to create   new items, view the existing items, and restore the Deleted items. Here is one  possible solution:  ABC  3G  09:53 PM  Things to do  Add a todo item>  Eat food  Fetch slippers  Sit stay  Chew bone  Go for a walk Chase the mail carrier Things to do  Deleted items Play with Sparky  Howl at the moon Chase the cat  [ 30 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  To-do list wireframe  There are two lists. The top list contains all the active items and the bottom list  contains all the inactive items. To create a new item, click add todo item. To view an  existing item, click it. To restore a Deleted items  or delete an active item , drag it  from the bottom list to the top list  or from the top list to the bottom list .   Creating a new item This screen is used to add a new item to your to-do list. As the workflow doesn't  provide any insight into what a to-do item consists of, what are Susan's use cases?  She wants her to-do app to be quick and easy to interact with, so we'll add as few  fields as possible:     Text description. This is how Susan refers to her to-do items. The description   should be short and concise so a simple input field will suffice. Image: Susan is a visually-oriented person. She takes pictures of things to get  done on her iPhone and then tags her to-do items with the images.         Location: She doesn't want to have to check her to-do list all the time.   Instead, she wants her phone to notify her when she's in the same location as  a task that needs to be done.  With these criteria in hand, here's one possible solution for this screen:  ABC  3G  09:53 PM  <Add a todo item  Save  Description  Image  Select...  Location  Current location Home  New item wireframe  [ 31 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Click the Description field to set a description. Click on Select… to attach an Image  or video to the item. Choose a radio button to set a Location for reminders. Click on  Save to commit your changes or click Add a todo item to go back without saving.  Editing an existing item This screen is very similar to the new item screen. It is used to make changes to an  existing to-do item, which means that the design is identical, except that the fields  are prepopulated by whatever is assigned to the to-do item:  ABC  3G  09:53 PM  <Edit a todo item  Save  Description Chase the mail carrier  Image  Select...  Location  Current location Home  Edit item wireframe  [ 32 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Creating a skeleton application Now, let's switch from design to code and create a skeleton Sencha Touch application.  This will show us that the framework is functional and give us a base to start  converting our workflows and wireframes into code.  Generating files with Sencha cmd Using what you learned from setting up your development environment, switch to  the todo-app directory that you used to create a repository. Now, generate a new  application in this directory:  $ sencha -sdk  path to sdk touch-2.4.1  generate app TodoApp .  This will create a skeleton application with all the files needed. Now, verify that  everything works as expected. You'll want two command windows open: one for  the web server and the other for any commands that you need to run. In the first tab,  start the web server:  $ sencha web start  In the second tab, preview the page in your browser:  $ open http:  localhost:1841  If everything worked correctly, you should see the following sample app in your  browser. You may need to toggle the device mode first.  Welcome app  [ 33 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Use the GitHub client to commit your latest changes. Give the commit a  summary  and description, if you like , then click on Commit to master.  If you click the History tab, you can see your first commit. Click on Publish to upload  this commit to GitHub as well. As we proceed, we'll prompt you to commit after  completing a change. In general, it's a good habit to commit small chunks of code at  frequent intervals as this makes debugging easier  and reduces the risk of lost work .  Creating the main view Now, let's rip out the sample views and build our own. These views won't be very  interactive but enough to show the rough shape of the final app.  In Sublime, open the todo-app folder. This will expose all the files under this folder  for easy access in Sublime.  Now, open todo-app app view Main.js. This file contains the code that describes  the views in the skeleton application. Replace the existing code with the following:  Ext.define 'TodoApp.view.Main', {     extend: 'Ext.tab.Panel',     xtype: 'main',     requires: [       'Ext.TitleBar'     ],     config: {       tabBarPosition: 'bottom',        items: [         {           title: 'List',           iconCls: 'home'         },         {           title: 'Create',           iconCls: 'action'         },         {           title: 'Edit',           iconCls: 'action'         }         ]     } } ;  [ 34 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Downloading the example code You can download the example code files from your account at  http:  www.packtpub.com for all the Packt Publishing books  you have purchased. If you purchased this book elsewhere, you  can visit http:  www.packtpub.com support and register to  have the files e-mailed directly to you.  Refresh your browser. This code created three empty panels named List, Create, and  Edit, which you can open by clicking their respective icons in the toolbar. The toolbar  is temporary until we wire these views to each other directly:  View switcher  Adding the list view Now, let's recreate the wireframes by adding controls to each panel in turn. First, edit  the list panel to include the following code:  {     title: 'List',     iconCls: 'home',      xtype: 'list',      store: {       fields: ['name'],       data: [         {name: 'Eat food'},         {name: 'Fetch slippers'},         {name: 'Sit stay'},         {name: 'Chew bone'},         {name: 'Go for a walk'},         {name: 'Chase the mail carrier'},         {name: ''},         {name: 'Deleted items'},         {name: 'Play with Sparky'},  [ 35 ]  www.it-ebooks.info           {name: 'Howl at the moon'},         {name: 'Chase the cat'}       ]     },    itemTpl: '{name}',    items: [     {       docked: 'top',       xtype: 'titlebar',       title: 'Things to do',       items: {         align: 'right',         text: 'Add'       }     }   ] }  This should result in the following screen:  Mocked list screen  [ 36 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Adding the create view Now, edit the create panel with the following code:  {   title: 'Create',   iconCls: 'action',    items: [     {       docked: 'top',       xtype: 'titlebar',       title: 'Add item',       items: {         align: 'right',         text: 'Save'       }     },     {       xtype: 'formpanel',       height: '100%',       scrollable: true,        items: [         {           xtype: 'fieldset',           title: 'Description',         items: {           xtype: 'textfield',                     name: 'description'           }         },         {           xtype: 'fieldset',           title: 'Image',           items: {             xtype: 'button',             text: 'Select image…'           }         },         {           xtype: 'fieldset',           title: 'Location',           defaults: {  [ 37 ]  www.it-ebooks.info               labelAlign: 'right',             labelWidth: '240px',             xtype: 'radiofield',             name: 'location'               },           items: [             {value: 'here', label: 'Current location'},             {value: 'home', label: 'Home'},             {value: 'work', label: 'Work'}           ]         }       ]     }   ] }  This should result in the following screen:  Mocked add screen  [ 38 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Adding the edit view Finally, assign the following  nearly identical  code to the edit panel:  {   title: 'Edit',   iconCls: 'action',    items: [     {       docked: 'top',       xtype: 'titlebar',       title: 'Edit item',       items: {         align: 'right',         text: 'Save'       }     },     {       xtype: 'formpanel',       height: '100%',       scrollable: true,        items: [         {           xtype: 'fieldset',           title: 'Description',           items: {             xtype: 'textfield',             name: 'description',             value: 'Chase the mail carrier'           }         },         {           xtype: 'fieldset',           title: 'Image',           items: [             {               xtype: 'panel',               width: '100%',               height: 156,               style: 'background: AAAAAA'             },             {               xtype: 'button',               text: 'Remove image'             }  [ 39 ]  www.it-ebooks.info             ]         },         {           xtype: 'fieldset',           title: 'Location',           defaults: {             labelAlign: 'right',             labelWidth: '240px',             xtype: 'radiofield',             name: 'location'           },           items: [             {value: 'home', label: 'Home', checked: true},             {value: 'work', label: 'Work'},             {value: 'other', label: 'Other'}           ]         }       ]     }   ] }  This should result in the following screen:  Mocked edit screen  [ 40 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   When you start the application, you may notice a few warning messages in the  developer console about missing requires. Add these requires to Main.js under   the xtype attribute:  requires: [   'Ext.TitleBar',   'Ext.dataview.List',   'Ext.form.Panel',   'Ext.form.FieldSet',   'Ext.field.Radio' ],  Committing your changes At this point, you have mocked the wireframes in code. They don't do anything yet,  but you can toggle through the three main views with the bottom tab bar.  Now that the application is in a working state, commit these  changes to Git before proceeding.  Building an offline to-do app We cut some corners to put the wireframes in code. Let's get them the rest of the way  there, make the pages functional, and set up the backing storage. After we've done  this, we'll deploy the app to our phone and call it a day.  Breaking the views into their own files Create three empty files in todo-app app view :     List.js    New.js    Edit.js  Now, break out the code for each tab in Main.js and put each into a separate file in  the todo-app app view  directory with a few modifications.  [ 41 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   First, take the contents of the innermost items array for the List view and put it in  List.js in the following code block:  Now, do this for the New and Edit views as well. Copy the fields to create a new item  and drop them in New.js as follows:  Ext.define 'TodoApp.view.List', {     extend: 'Ext.Panel',     alias: 'widget.todo-list',      config: {     items: [       {         docked: 'top',         xtype: 'titlebar',         title: 'Things to do',         items: {           align: 'right',           text: 'Add'         }       },       { ...       }     ]     } } ;  Ext.define 'TodoApp.view.New', {   extend: 'Ext.Panel',   alias: 'widget.todo-new',    config: {     items: [       {         docked: 'top',         xtype: 'titlebar',         title: 'Add item',         items: [           {             align: 'left',             text: 'Back'         },           {             align: 'right',  [ 42 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Finally, copy the fields to edit an existing item and drop them in Edit.js as follows:              text: 'Create'           }         ]       },       { ...       }     ]   } } ;  Ext.define 'TodoApp.view.Edit', {   extend: 'Ext.Panel',   alias: 'widget.todo-edit',    config: {     items: [       {         docked: 'top',         xtype: 'titlebar',         title: 'Edit item',         items: [           {             align: 'left',             text: 'Back'           },           {             align: 'right',             text: 'Save'           }         ]       },       {        }     ]   } } ;  [ 43 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Now, convert Main.js to a regular panel view. As you only want to show one screen  at a time, manually verify that the screens display as before by inserting todo-list,  todo-edit, and todo-new, respectively, in the innermost items block:  Ext.define 'TodoApp.view.Main', {     extend: 'Ext.Panel',     xtype: 'main',     alias: 'todo-main',     requires: [         'Ext.TitleBar',         'Ext.form.Panel',         'Ext.form.FieldSet',         'Ext.field.Radio',         'Ext.List',         'TodoApp.view.New',         'TodoApp.view.Edit',         'TodoApp.view.List'     ],     config: {         layout: 'fit',         items: { xtype: 'todo-list' }     } } ;  Does it work? Great! Check your changes in Git:  A list of to-do items  [ 44 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Connecting the views together Note that we ditched the tab bar at the bottom of the screen. You won't use it to  navigate, you'll click on the individual to-do items and buttons at the top of each  screen. Let's wire these up now.  First, create a file under todo-app app controller  named Main.js. This is the  main controller for the application. Paste the following code:  Ext.define 'TodoApp.controller.Main', {   extend: 'Ext.app.Controller',   config: {     views: [       'List',       'New',       'Edit'     ],     refs: {       mainPanel: 'todo-main',       listPanel: {         selector: 'todo-list',         xtype: 'todo-list',         autoCreate: true       },       newPanel: {         selector: 'todo-new',         xtype: 'todo-new',         autoCreate: true       },       editPanel: {         selector: 'todo-edit',         xtype: 'todo-edit',         autoCreate: true       }     },     control: {       'todo-list button[action=new]': {         tap: 'showNewView'       },       'todo-list list': {         itemtap: 'showEditView'       },       'todo-new button[action=save]': {                 tap: 'showListView'       },  [ 45 ]  www.it-ebooks.info         'todo-edit button[action=save]': {         tap: 'showListView'       }     }   },   showView: function view  {     this.getMainPanel  .removeAll  ;     this.getMainPanel  .add view ;   },   showListView: function   {     this.showView this.getListPanel   ;   },   showNewView: function   {     this.showView this.getNewPanel   ;   },   showEditView: function   {     this.showView this.getEditPanel   ;   } } ;  To make the application see this new controller, edit todo-app app.js and add the  following under the views array:  controllers: [   'Main' ],  Notice how the controller identifies the buttons in each view by their action attribute.  If you add multiple buttons in the same view and assign different actions, you can  listen for their events with this method.  Test the new changes by starting the web server and clicking  through the application. Notice how the views change. Commit  your changes to Git.  Creating a store to populate the list view Now that you have the basic workflow in place, let's move the data from the view to  a store. This will give us flexibility and persistence as the view will simply read from  the store, which itself may be backed by any number of sources: an API, a database,  or local storage.  [ 46 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   As this app is offline, we must use a local form of storage. The easiest way to   do this is with a browser's local storage. To accomplish this in Sencha, create a   new model and store named todo-app app model Item.js and todo-app app  store Item.js, respectively:  todo-app app model Item.js: Ext.define 'TodoApp.model.Item', {   extend: 'Ext.data.Model',   requires: [     'Ext.data.proxy.LocalStorage',     'Ext.data.identifier.Uuid'   ],   config: {     identifier: {       type: 'uuid'     },     fields: [       'id',       'description',       'media',       'latitude',       'longitude'     ],     proxy: {       type: 'localstorage',       id: 'todoapp-items'     }   } } ;  Ext.define 'TodoApp.store.Item', {   extend: 'Ext.data.Store',   config: {     model: 'TodoApp.model.Item',     autoLoad: true   } } ;  [ 47 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  The model defines the fields in each to-do item, specifies how unique IDs will be  generated, and indicates that each to-do item is to be stored using the local storage.  Now let's create the accompanying store for this model, todo-app app store  Item.js model:   The store is used by views to point to the list of the to-do items. We could create  a new store each time we needed one, but by defining it here, we avoid repeating  ourselves. To make these new classes visible to the app, add references in todo-app  app controller Main.js below the views array:  Now that we've created the model, let's wire it up to the List view.  Edit todo-app app view List.js, where we will define the list, remove the  existing store definition, and point to the store that we just created:  models: [   'Item' ], stores: [    'Item' ],  {   xtype: 'list',   height: '100%',   store: 'Item',   itemTpl: '{description}' }  Now, reload the app. No items appear in the list because the store is empty, but we'll  fix this next.  In todo-app app controller Main.js, instead of just showing the list view when  the Create button is clicked, retrieve the form values and create a new record. To do  this, make a new function named createTodoItem and add it to the controller:  createTodoItem: function button, e, eOpts  {   var store = Ext.create 'TodoApp.store.Item' ;    store.add this.getNewForm  .getValues      store.sync  ;    this.showView this.getListPanel   ; },  'todo-new button[action=create]': {   tap: 'createTodoItem' },  [ 48 ]  In the control hash, make the todo-new button point to this function instead of the  showListView function:  www.it-ebooks.info   Add a selector to the refs array so that we can retrieve the form with getNewForm  :  newForm: 'todo-new formpanel',  Due to a bug in Sencha Touch, the autoLoad option for stores doesn't work on list  components. To avert this problem, add the following function to the List view:  initialize: function   {      Autoload appears to be broken for DataViews   Ext.getStore 'Item' .load  ;    this.callParent  ; }  Refresh your app, create a new item, and notice how it appears in the list. Pretty  easy, huh?  Adding buttons to each to-do item The next step is to hook up the edit and delete workflows. As there are two of these,  we have to create separate buttons for each list item. As Ext.List isn't flexible  enough to accommodate this, we'll need to switch over to Ext.dataview.DataView.  Change the type of the list to dataview, tell it to useComponents, and specify what  the default component type should be:  {   xtype: 'dataview',   height: '100%',   useComponents: true,   defaultType: 'todolistitem',   store: 'Item' }  [ 49 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   If you've been paying attention, you'll notice that we specified the defaultType  attribute in our DataView component. This default type doesn't exist yet so we need  to create it. Let's do this now. Create todo-app app view TodoListItem.js and  add the following lines:  Ext.define 'TodoApp.view.TodoListItem', {   extend: 'Ext.dataview.component.DataItem',   alias: 'widget.todolistitem',   requires: [     'Ext.Label'   ],    config: {     description: {       flex: 1     },     edit: {       text: 'Edit',       action: 'edit',       margin: '0 7px 0 0'     },     destroy: {       text: 'Delete',       action: 'delete'     },     padding: 7,     layout: {       type: 'hbox',       align: 'center'     },     dataMap: {       getDescription: {         setHtml: 'description'       },       getEdit: {         setData: 'id'       },       getDestroy: {         setData: 'id'       }     }   },    applyDescription: function config  {  [ 50 ]  www.it-ebooks.info       return Ext.factory config, 'Ext.Label',         this.getDescription   ;   },   updateDescription: function newDescription, oldDescription  {     if  newDescription  {       this.add newDescription ;     }     if  oldDescription  {       this.remove oldDescription ;     }   },    applyEdit: function config  {     return Ext.factory config, 'Ext.Button', this.getEdit   ;   },   updateEdit: function newButton, oldButton  {     if  newButton  {       this.add newButton ;     }     if  oldButton  {       this.remove oldButton ;     }   },    applyDestroy: function config  {     return Ext.factory config, 'Ext.Button', this.getDestroy   ;   },   updateDestroy: function newButton, oldButton  {     if  newButton  {       this.add newButton ;     }     if  oldButton  {       this.remove oldButton ;     }   } } ;  This defines three components for each item: a label so that you can see what the  to-do item is about and two buttons so that you can edit and delete the item. For  simplicity, checking an item off your list and deleting an item you don't intend to  complete is the same action.  [ 51 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Now, in todo-app app controller Main.js, add a reference to this new views so  that we can talk to it:  views: [   'List',   'New',   'Edit',   'TodoListItem' ],  Refresh your app and notice how the list works as before, but we now have an Edit  and Delete button, which do nothing. We'll fix this next:  List with buttons  Making the buttons functional In todo-app app controller Main.js, let's edit our control hash to detect when  one of these buttons is clicked:  'todo-list button[action=edit]': {   tap: 'editTodoItem' }, 'todo-list button[action=delete]': {   tap: 'deleteTodoItem' },  Let's create the handler functions, editTodoItem and deleteTodoItem now:  editTodoItem: function button, e, eOpts  {   var store = this.getListDataView  .getStore  ,     editPanel = this.getEditPanel  ,     editForm = this.getEditForm  ;    editForm.setRecord store.findRecord 'id', button.getData    ;    this.showView editPanel ; }, deleteTodoItem: function button, e, eOpts  {   var dataview = this.getListDataView  ,  [ 52 ]  www.it-ebooks.info       store = dataview.getStore  ,     record = store.findRecord 'id', button.getData   .erase  ;    record.erase  ;   store.load  ;   dataview.refresh  ; },  As with the newTodoItem function, these functions get the store, retrieve the record,  and either display it or make changes. In the case of delete, we stay on the List view.  In the case of edit, we load the Edit view.  Add two additional selectors to the refs array so that we can retrieve the dataview  and the edit form with getListDataView   and getEditForm  , respectively:  listDataView: 'todo-list dataview', editForm: 'todo-edit formpanel'  Finally, when the changes are made via the edit form, we need to persist these  changes when the user clicks Save. Let's add a new function to todo-app app  controller Main.js named saveTodoItem:  saveTodoItem: function button, e, eOpts  {   var store = Ext.create 'TodoApp.store.Item' ,     values = this.getEditForm  .getValues  ,     record = store.findRecord 'id', values.id ;    record.setData values ;   record.setDirty  ;    Needed otherwise update record will not sync   store.sync  ;  this.showListView  ; },  Hook this up to the save button by editing its control handler:  'todo-edit button[action=save]': {   tap: 'saveTodoItem' },  The Edit view needs a couple of small changes in order to work correctly.  Remember that each to-do item has a unique ID, which is generated automatically  by the framework. We need to add a hiddenfield to the edit form so that when we  submit the changes, we're able to associate the changes with an existing record.  [ 53 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Edit todo-app app view Edit.js and add the following field to the form:  {   xtype: 'hiddenfield',   name: 'id' },  requires: [   'Ext.field.Hidden' ]  Add a reference to the hiddenfield type in the requires array as a hint to   Sencha Touch:  Remove the fake value attribute from the description field in Edit.js. This field will  be automatically populated by the store. Refresh the app and try editing and deleting  your to-do items. This should work.  You may notice that we've neglected the image and location attributes in each to- do item. This was done on purpose. As we continue through the book, we'll see how  to implement these features in a way that respects the offline integrity of the app that  we have thus far.  Commit your changes to Git.  Deploying the app to a phone The final step in making our offline app real is to deploy it to a phone. You do not  have to complete this section but it is a great way to see how your app will work   on a phone.  We'll use iOS in this example. Note that you will need an Apple iOS Developer  account  $99 year  to do this.

Allow the code signing to take place. 10.  Unlock your phone and run the app. It should work as expected.   Congratulations, you've deployed your app to iOS!  Deployed app  Commit your changes to Git. You now have a functional   albeit basic  offline app. Let's compare it with our design  principles and see how it stacks up.  [ 58 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Comparing and contrasting with the  design principles Keep in mind that the to-do app is not finished. As we continue through the book,  we'll continue to add functionality. However, any improvements that we make will  be made with the offline behavior in mind. Let's pause and evaluate the app against  our list of offline principles.  How does it compare? For each of the ten principles, we'll assign a pass fail grade based on how well the  app adheres to that principle. Then, we'll count the number of passes to see how  close we came to a 10 10 score. Give me uninterrupted access to the content I care about.  This is a pass. As the app is offline, this principle is met. We only have to worry  about this when the data is separate from the device consuming that data. Content is mutable. Don't let my online offline status change that.  This is a pass. Again, this principle is met as there is no online functionality. You can  fully edit your to-do items offline. Error messages should not leave me guessing or unnecessarily worried.  This is a pass. Right now, the app has no error messages so this principle is met   as well. Don't let me start something I can't finish.  This is a pass. Also achieved. Without an online component, there's no need to worry  about being separated from your data and being unable to complete something. An app should never contradict itself. If a conflict exists, be honest about it.  This will be a pass. As we begin to see, when an app only has an offline functionality,  it cannot violate this principle. This means that choosing offline as a starting point is  a very robust decision. When the laws of physics prevail, choose breadth over depth when caching.  This is a pass. We're offline and so we have no caching. Everything that we've  created is in our local database and we don't have to share this with anybody.  [ 59 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Empty states should tell me what to do next in a delightful way.  This is a fail. We don't comply with this principle 100%. This could be improved.  When the app first loads, what should I do first? Don't make me remember what I was doing last. Remember for me.  This is a fail. We don't comply fully with this principle. When I close and reopen the  app, it dumps me out to the to-do list, so this interaction could be improved as well.  For example, if I start to create a new to-do item and my app crashes, I'd like to be  brought back to that screen when I restart the app. This doesn't currently happen. Degrade gracefully as the network degrades. Don't be jarring.  This is a pass. As the data resides on the device that consumes that data, there is no  network to worry about. Never purge the cache unless I demand it.  This is a pass. We could provide an option to reset all the data associated with the app  but as you can just delete the app to accomplish the same thing, this is a pass. Once our  data is separated from the app, an explicit purge option will become necessary.  Where does it need to improve? Our first version of the app complies with 8 10 of these principles. Not bad. This  evaluation should be performed early and often during development. Once a  baseline is established, it's much easier to spot the regressions and areas to improve.  Scoring 8 10 means we've set a strong foundation for future development.  The two items that we missed, empty states and remembering context, were missed  in the design phase. As mentioned in Chapter 1, The Pain of Being Offline, designers  often miss details such as these when the product exists as an idea in their head, a  sketch on a napkin, or a high-fidelity mock-up in Photoshop. Most of the time, it  takes actual development to suss out the cracks.  Fortunately, the earlier in development you spot these problems, the easier they are to  fix. We'll address these in the next chapter and see if we can get a 10 10 evaluation.  [ 60 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Using the app as a baseline for the future This isn't a one-time evaluation. At the conclusion of each chapter, we'll run through  the principles briefly to see whether we've had any regressions. If so, we'll decide  whether to fix them, and if not, explain our justification for not fixing them. In  general, we expect the app to slowly improve over time as we continue to pay  attention to the principles.  Our goal is to achieve perfect compliance with the principles by the end of the book.  As the complexity builds, we'll be able to spot the warning signs early. In a way,  these principles will serve as a meter for technical debt. We can choose not to fix the  bugs that violate these principles but at the risk of more work later on.  Summary In this chapter, we set up our development environment, designed the offline  experience of our to-do app, built this experience with Sencha Touch, and deployed  it to our device. We also evaluated the offline experience of the app against our  principles and found areas where the experience could be improved.  In the next chapter, we'll continue to add functionality, improve some of the   broken or neglected areas of the app, design the online flow of the app, and walk  through this flow in order to see well how it transitions between the offline and  online states. Then, we'll use Cloudant as an online store for our to-do data.  [ 61 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   www.it-ebooks.info   Designing Online Behavior  Now that we have built an offline to-do app, let's go one step further and decide  what the full online experience will be. As we progress, our goal is to migrate the  app to the Internet without compromising its offline behavior.  It's useful to think about this in terms of a bunker and beach house analogy. An  offline-only app is like a hardened bunker: invulnerable to what's happening above  the ground but quite isolated. It's not a place you'd want to spend all your time,  though you'll be glad to be able to retreat there when necessary.  An online-only app, in contrast, is more like a beach house. It's bright and cheery;  the kind of place you'd want to invite your friends to hang out. However, if an  earthquake or tsunami should happen, you'll quickly forget about all the nice aspects  of your building as you flee for the hills.  What we're trying to do is marry these two concepts and create a hybrid building.  A beach house when things are great and a bunker when you need to hunker down.  The problem is that most developers optimistically focus on the bright, cheery  outdoors and then find it difficult to retrofit their foundations to support a hardened  bunker mode. Our approach is the opposite. In Chapter 2, Building a To-do App, we built the  beginnings of our bunker mode. Now, we can start erecting our above-ground abode.  We won't neglect the bunker, however. It's not finished. Now that the essentials are  in place, we can easily go back and forth and make modifications to either building  as needed.  This continuous iteration is one of the most important aspects of developing a robust  experience. As you build the beach house, you'll discover aspects that you want  available whether above- or below-ground. When this happens, we'll modify both  the offline underpinnings and online experience in tandem.  [ 63 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Designing the online workflow As you'll recall, this is the offline workflow that we designed in Chapter 2, Building a  To-do App:  Workflow  [ 64 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   This workflow is the offline nucleus of our app. We may add additional  functionalities but it is not allowed to impinge on the offline integrity of this basic  workflow. We will visualize this nucleus as follows in the next few diagrams, with  the offline functionalities shaded in grey:  Offline nucleus  The existing screens are available for us to extend in the online mode but the core  workflow remains unchanged. What additional functionalities should we enable  while online? Let's review the user stories from Chapter 1, The Pain of Being Offline:  Items should display while offline.  1.  2.  Keep all my devices in sync. 3.  Don't keep me waiting. 4.  Sharing with friends should be bulletproof. 5.  Safeguard my data.  Of these user stories, 2, 4, and 5 have requirements that are not currently satisfied   by our offline-only experience. Let's see how we can extend the current workflow   to accommodate these stories.  [ 65 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Keep all my devices in sync Susan owns multiple devices. She would like to install the to-do app on each device.  These devices should be synchronized with each other so that her to-do list is  available, no matter which device she chooses. She wants one list, not several.  Synchronization is largely a background operation. We shouldn't expect Susan to  click a Sync button whenever she adds a to-do item. This operation should happen  automatically. However, if Susan wants to be sure that her items are synced, we  should provide an affordance to do so. This affordance should give her reassurance  about which items have been synced so that she doesn't feel compelled to click it in  normal usage:  Device synchronization  In our updated workflow diagram, synchronization is triggered on Save. As it is an  automatic operation, not normally triggered by a human, I've outlined the related  elements with dashes. On Save, this New item or Existing item is sent to the other  devices connected to the current list.  [ 66 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Sharing with friends should be bulletproof Susan is an organized person. She can't force her friends to be organized as well but  she can employ tools to help them be more organized. Each of her close friends has  installed the to-do app on their phones. When they share lists with each other, the  items on these lists are synced automatically.  Our offline app has only one to-do list. We'll need to provide a way to manage  additional lists, share them easily with others, and keep them all in sync. As this is  a similar, but larger, problem to the second user story, we'll solve this next. Also, as  we can't guarantee that all of her friends have Internet connectivity, we'll need to  investigate ways to synchronize their devices when Internet is not available:  List management  I've added a couple of additional views  in grey  with their associated actions to the  Offline nucleus: List of lists and New list. The other new view, Sharing settings, is  only available online or with appropriate online alternatives  for example, Bluetooth,  Wi-Fi, and so on .  [ 67 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Safeguard my data Susan worries constantly about data loss. An offline app is pretty safe but she doesn't  always remember to back up her devices. If she drops her phone in the pool, her data  is gone. Of course, it is unlikely that she will drop all of her devices in the pool at  the same time, so synchronization can help us somewhat. However, in this unlikely  event, can we do anything to preserve her data, regardless?  Most synchronization tools have a remote server where all the data is stored. When  a device needs to retrieve or update the data, they ask the server. As we can't assume  that Internet is always available, we should allow offline synchronization but employ  an online data store to serve as an authoritative backup.  There is an additional complexity behind all of these stories. We'll need lightweight  management to differentiate between different people and to transfer their data  to the server. We must design this in such a way that the app does not become  inoperable when it goes offline:  Web backup  [ 68 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Note that all of these views are online views. If the app is offline, none of these  operations can be performed. There are two parts to this workflow. On the left, a  device may Sign up for a new account, which allows it to sync to-do items to a Web  Server. On the right, a device may log in to an existing account, linking it to the Web  Server as well. When items are synced, they will first attempt to be sent directly to all the linked  devices. They will then be sent to the Web Server. If a linked device is offline during  this process, it will download any to-do items that were synced in the interim when  it comes online.  The online offline transition Now that we've designed the online and offline behavior, let's talk about the transition  between these two states. As the ninth principle states, the UI transition as the network  degrades should not be jarring. How is this reflected in our workflow diagrams?  As mentioned, an online functionality is highlighted in white, while an offline  functionality is highlighted in grey. The transition points are the lines between white  and grey. We need to think about what happens when someone is in the white space  and their Internet connection goes down, or when they are in the grayspace and  want to do something that is reserved for online use only. How do we be transparent  about what's going on?  Being informative about what can or cannot  be done When people are offline, they may want to do something that may only be done  online. This is a reasonable desire but we can't defy the laws of physics, so what do  we do? There are a few strategies that we can take. Going from the most restrictive to  least restrictive, they are as follows:     Tell people that they have to wait until they're online    Let people set a reminder for themselves to complete the activity when online    Let people complete the offline parts, leaving the online parts for later  In general, allow people to do as much as possible offline. Let them save their  progress and complete or submit it when online. As we continue, we'll choose   one of these three strategies for each piece of functionality that we will implement.  [ 69 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Graceful degradation When people are online, they may be in the middle of something that's important or  critical. As we cannot guarantee that their Internet connection will remain reliable  until they're done, we need strategies to cope with this. There are a few approaches  that we can take:     Warn people that the Internet connection is weak    Anticipate an impending lack of connectivity and give people a time estimate    Make the app less bandwidth-hungry when the bandwidth is limited  These strategies are not on a continuum. They can be employed separately or  together, depending on the importance of the task at hand. We'll choose from these  strategies as we continue to implement the app.  Recovering when things go horribly wrong When people are online, sometimes the unexpected happens and the Internet  connection just dies, completely, without warning. If it doesn't come back right  away, we don't want to force people to keep the app open. We need to give them  closure and a sense of security about their work so that they don't stress about losing  it. There are a few strategies here as well:     Tell people what happened and save a draft of what they were working on    Let people submit their work and promise to post it when online    Let people know when the Internet died so that they know exactly what was   posted and what wasn't  As we'll discuss in Chapter 6, Be Eventually Consistent, split-brain is another problem  that can cause chaos when a person does something offline. The app tries to reconcile  that change when the app goes back online and fails. We'll discuss this problem  separately in that chapter.  Example scenarios Now, we'll pick a few scenarios from our workflows and figure out how best to  address them with the strategies mentioned previously. We won't cover all of the  scenarios but we'll reference this list later in the book when required.  [ 70 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Susan creates a to-do item while offline Creating a to-do item is part of the offline nucleus. Thus, we shouldn't force Susan to  click a button to acknowledge that it hasn't been synced. Instead, let's use lightweight  styling to tell her what's going on and remove the styling when the app goes online  and synchronizes successfully:     After Susan creates a to-do item, the app tries to synchronize itself    As the app is offline, this fails     Instead, it shows the to-do item in light grey with the word pending  underneath to indicate that it has not been synchronized     When Susan goes online, the app synchronizes successfully and the to-do   item reverts to the normal styling treatment  Susan tries to share a to-do item while offline Unlike creating an unshared to-do item, this is not something that can be done  successfully while offline. Susan has a number of shared lists. As the primary use  case of these lists cannot be achieved while offline, we should give her more notice  when we run in trouble but still don't require interaction on her part:     After Susan creates a shared to-do item, the app tries to synchronize itself.    As the app is offline, this fails.     Instead, it shows the to-do item in the offline treatment as before. In addition,  it puts a bold 1 Item Not Shared message at the top of the list in order to make  Susan aware that her friends can't see it yet.     When Susan goes online, the app synchronizes successfully, the to-do    item reverts to the normal styling treatment, and the message at the   top of the list disappears.  Susan synchronizes her lists over a weak  connection Susan hates waiting. In her to-do app, she interacts most with the text, then the  location, and then the photos and videos attached to each item. She wants these  attributes downloaded in this order and available for use immediately. She doesn't  want to wait for the least-used attribute to download before she can access the most- used attribute:     After Susan opens the to-do app, it starts to download the updated lists.  [ 71 ]  www.it-ebooks.info      First, it downloads the text for each item, making this text available to be   read or modified as soon as it is downloaded.     Next, it downloads a map for each item  that has a location , making this   data accessible as well.     Finally, it downloads the photos or videos attached to each item.    While any piece of information is downloading, it gets a spinner. This   spinner is removed once the download is complete.  Susan adds a video attachment over a weak  connection We shouldn't prevent Susan from doing this but we should warn her that it might take  awhile. In fact, we should give her an estimate so that she can judge this for herself.     Susan edits an existing to-do item     In the photo video section, we mention that the Internet connection is weak  and so adding new media could take awhile     She clicks Add Photo Video anyway and chooses a video to attach    As the video uploads, we show how long the upload will take    Susan doesn't want to wait that long so she closes the app    When she reopens the app, we show the video upload as paused    When the Internet connectivity is 4G, LTE, or Wi-Fi, we resume the video   upload automatically  Susan adds multiple to-do items while offline As in a single case, we shouldn't make it difficult for Susan to do this. However, if  there are more than five items in a list that are not synchronized, we should let her  know that she is accumulating significant unsaved work.     Susan adds more than five to-do items while offline    We put a bold 5+ Items Not Synchronized message at the top of the list     If she clicks on the message, we display We'll save your to-do items as soon as  you're online. Consider running a backup if you're going to be offline for awhile    When Susan runs a backup or goes online, we reset the warning message  [ 72 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Adding an online data store In the next chapter, we will start to improve the to-do app to support our revised  workflow. Before we do this, we need a place to store our data online, which  supports device syncing and user sharing. We'll use CouchDB for this. CouchDB is a NoSQL database that makes certain things very easy: database  synchronization, data access  via a built-in REST endpoint , and user management.  There are several places to get a free CouchDB database online. We'll use IBM  Cloudant to provide this service.  Creating a Cloudant account IBM Cloudant is an online database host. It's free as long as your monthly usage is  less than $50. One alternative is Iris Couch  www.iriscouch.com , which works in  basically the same way. For now, let's use Cloudant:  1.  Open www.cloudant.com in your browser. 2.  Click on Sign Up. 3.  Choose your credentials. 4.  Click on I agree, sign me up. 5.  Click on Add New Database. 6.  Name your database lists. 7.  Click on API URL to copy the link to your new database. 8.  Paste the link in a new tab. 9.  Enter your credentials, if requested, and authenticate. 10.  You should see an output similar to this:  11.  Go back to your Cloudant dashboard.  Working CouchDB  [ 73 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   12.  Select your lists database, if not already selected. 13.  Click Permissions. 14.  Click Generate API key. 15.  Save the key and password. You will use these to authenticate in the future   so that you don't need to share your master password.  16.  Check the Reader, Writer, and Replicator boxes for the key that you created.  Your new database is ready to go. Next, let's define our data structures and decide  what the constraints should be.  Data structures and validation Before we write code, let's go through the data that we need. I'll mock this out in  JSON as it's easy to read and what we'll end up using anyway. We need a structure to store each to-do list. The first attribute is the unique ID for the  structure. The list of to-do items is an array under items:  {   id:  ,   name:  ,   owner:  ,   collaborators: [ ],   items: [     {       id:  ,       description:  ,       media:  ,       latitude:  ,       longitude:       },    ] }  As CouchDB comes with authentication built-in, we don't need to create a separate  structure for the user information. Pretty sweet!  That's it! A to-do list has references to the people that own and collaborate around it  and a reference to the list that owns it. In a traditional app, we would let the database  manage these relationships and any constraints, but it's simpler to keep this logic  in the app. Obviously, if you wanted to build a production-ready application, you  would want to enforce all this on the server side; so keep this in mind.  [ 74 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Our web service should allow people to perform basic CRUD operations on these  structures. This data has the following constraints:     A to-do list must have a name that is a string.    A to-do list must have an owner.    The owner field must be set to the current user's ID.    The owner field cannot be changed once it is set.    Only the owner can delete the list.    The collaborators field, if present, must be an array of strings.    Only owners and collaborators can view and edit a to-do list.    The items field, if present, must be an array of objects.    Each to-do item must have a description that is a string.    Each to-do item must have an ID that is a string.    Each to-do item can have a media field. If present, it must be a string.    Each to-do item can have a latitude and longitude field. If one is present, the   other must be as well and both must be numbers.  Now that we've outlined the requirements, let's write some code.  Writing a validation function In the Cloudant dashboard, perform the following steps:  1.  Select your database. 2.  Click the + icon next to All Design Docs. 3.  Click New Doc to create a new design document. 4.  Prefix the value of the _id key with _design .  This should appear as    _design e106bcd….   You've created a new design document. In CouchDB, we can create something  called a validate_doc_update function, which validates any requests made to the  database. This is used to ensure that any validation requirements are met.  [ 75 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   To do this, add another key to the design document named validate_doc_update.  Then, click the edit button next to the field to input the validation function:  In the editor that appears, create an empty function as follows:  Cloudant field editor  function newDoc, oldDoc, userCtx  { }  If you saved this as is, any request made to the database would succeed, which is the  default behavior. Now, insert each of the following sections into the function in the  order given:  if  !newDoc['name']  {   throw {forbidden: 'todo list must have a name'} ; } if  typeof newDoc['name'] !== 'string'  {   throw {forbidden: 'todo list name must be a string'} ; }  This ensures that each to-do list has a name attribute and it is set to a string  not an  array, a number, or an object .  Now, let's set requirements for ownership of the list:  if  !newDoc['owner']  {   throw {forbidden: 'must have an owner field'} ; } if  !oldDoc && newDoc['owner'] != userCtx.name  {   throw {forbidden: 'must set the owner field to your own ID'} ; } if  oldDoc && newDoc['owner'] != oldDoc['owner']  {   throw {forbidden: 'may not change the owner field once set'} ; } if  newDoc['_deleted'] && newDoc['owner'] != userCtx.name  {   throw {forbidden: 'only the owner may delete the list'} ; }  [ 76 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   This ensures that every list has an owner, which the owner cannot change, the person  who creates the list is the owner, and only the owner has the privilege to delete the  list. This is very restrictive and we may want to loosen these requirements in the  future. For example, it might be useful to transfer ownership of a list to another  person or let a person create lists on behalf of someone else.  Next, let's set some requirements for collaboration:  if  newDoc['collaborators']  {   if  Object.prototype.toString.call newDoc['collaborators']  !==      '[object Array]'  {     throw {forbidden: 'collaborators field must be an array'} ;   }   for  var i = 0; i < newDoc['collaborators'].length; ++i  {     if  typeof newDoc['collaborators'][i] !== 'string'  {       throw {forbidden: 'collaborators field must be an array of  strings'} ;     }   } }  This ensures that the collaborators field, if set, is an array that contains strings  the  IDs of the other users with permission to view and edit this list . Now, let's ensure  that only the owner and collaborators can view and edit lists:  if  newDoc['owner'] != userCtx.name && newDoc['collaborators'] &&    newDoc['collaborators'].indexOf userCtx.name  === -1  {   throw {forbidden: 'only the owner and collaborators may view or  edit'} ; }  Pretty easy! Next, let's define the fields in each to-do item:  if  newDoc['items']  {   if  Object.prototype.toString.call newDoc['items']  !==      '[object Array]'  {     throw {forbidden: 'items field must be an array'} ;   }    for  var i = 0; i < newDoc['items'].length; ++i  {     if  typeof newDoc['items'][i] !== 'object'  {       throw {forbidden: 'items field must be an array of          objects'} ;     }     if  !newDoc['items'][i]['id']  {       throw {forbidden: 'todo item must have an id field'} ;  [ 77 ]  www.it-ebooks.info       }     if  typeof newDoc['items'][i]['id'] !== 'string'  {       throw {forbidden: 'todo item id must be a string'} ;     }     if  !newDoc['items'][i]['description']  {       throw {forbidden: 'todo item must have a description         field'} ;     }     if  typeof newDoc['items'][i]['description'] !== 'string'  {       throw {forbidden: 'todo item description must be a string'} ;     } if  newDoc['items'][i]['media'] && typeof newDoc['items'][i]['media']  !== 'string'  {       throw {forbidden: 'todo item media field must be a string'} ;     }  Each to-do item must have an id field and a description field, both strings. They  may optionally have a media field, also a string.  The location is a bit more complicated. Let's add this next:  if  newDoc['items'][i]['latitude'] &&    !newDoc['items'][i]['longitude']  {   throw {forbidden: 'todo item is missing longitude'} ; } if  newDoc['items'][i]['longitude'] &&    !newDoc['items'][i]['latitude']  {   throw {forbidden: 'todo item is missing latitude'} ; } if  newDoc['items'][i]['latitude'] && typeof    newDoc['items'][i]['latitude'] !== 'number'  {   throw {forbidden: 'todo item latitude must be a number'} ; } if  newDoc['items'][i]['longitude'] && typeof    newDoc['items'][i]['longitude'] !== 'number'  {   throw {forbidden: 'todo item longitude must be a number'} ; } } }  A to-do item may optionally have a location defined by the latitude and  longitude fields. It doesn't make sense to have only one of these, so we   require both if either is present. They must also be numbers.  [ 78 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   That's it for the requirements. Pretty easy, huh? Click Save and Save again and your  validation function is now live. Don't worry about how you'll manage user accounts  for now. In the next chapter, we'll use a plugin to add user management to our app,  such as creating accounts, logging in, changing passwords and e-mail addresses, and  deleting accounts.  Testing the validation function Now, let's check our database to see how well it handles validation. To do this,  you'll need your command-line terminal, curl, and API key and password that you  generated earlier. Type the following commands to save the redundant bits of the  curl commands for future use:  $ export DOC=https:  [key]:[password]@username.cloudant.com lists test  $ export ARGS="-X PUT -H 'Content-Type: application json'"  Now, let's test our validation function. We'll start by passing a blank object and then  address the errors individually until they pass:  $ curl $ARGS -d '{}' $DOC  {"error":"forbidden","reason":"todo list must have a name"}  As expected, this fails. Let's add a name:  $ curl $ARGS -d '{"name": {}}' $DOC  {"error":"forbidden","reason":"todo list name must be a string"}  Let's change the name to a string:  $ curl $ARGS -d '{"name": "household"}' $DOC  {"error":"forbidden","reason":"must have an owner field"}  The name validates; now for the owner field:  $ curl $ARGS -d '{"name": "household", "owner": {}}' $DOC  {"error":"forbidden","reason":"must set the owner field to your own ID"}  The owner can't be just anybody, so let's change the ID to our API key:  $ curl $ARGS -d '{"name": "household", "owner":  "thistrompecoughtsideneet"}' $DOC{"ok":true,"id":"test","rev":"1-07b69f3e 296bb5bec26670e002bbbe0a"}  [ 79 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   This worked. So, the minimum fields necessary to create a new to-do list are the name  and owner. Now, let's verify that the owner field is immutable:  $ curl $ARGS -d '{"name": "household", "owner": "differentowner", "_rev":  "1-07b69f3e296bb5bec26670e002bbbe0a"}' $DOC  {"error":"forbidden","reason":"may not change the owner field once set"}  You can't, as designed. Now for the collaborators field; it's optional, but once we  decide to set it, what are the restrictions?  $ curl $ARGS -d '{"name": "household", "owner":  "thistrompecoughtsideneet", "collaborators": {}, "_rev": "1-07b69f3e296b b5bec26670e002bbbe0a"}' $DOC{"error":"forbidden","reason":"collaborators  field must be an array"}  The collaborators field only takes an array. Let's give it one:  $ curl $ARGS -d '{"name": "household", "owner":  "thistrompecoughtsideneet", "collaborators": [{}], "_rev": "1-07b69f3e296 bb5bec26670e002bbbe0a"}' $DOC  {"error":"forbidden","reason":"collaborators field must be an array of  strings"}  Each element of the collaborators array must be a string. Let's provide this:  $ curl $ARGS -d '{"name": "household", "owner":  "thistrompecoughtsideneet", "collaborators": ["george"], "_rev": "1-07b69 f3e296bb5bec26670e002bbbe0a"}' $DOC  {"ok":true,"id":"test","rev":"2-e70405607c52024ca615da1a8ed9f0b1"}  This worked. Perfect! Up until now, all of our edits have been with the owner of the  list. Let's make sure that the collaborators can edit the lists as well  but nobody else .  To do this, let's create a couple of additional users in the Cloudant dashboard:  1.  Select the lists database. 2.  Click Permissions. 3.  Create two new API keys.  Click Generate API Key twice.  4.  For each key, save the key and password for future reference. 5.  Make sure that both the users have read and write permissions.  Now, add the first user to the to-do list as a collaborator:  $ curl $ARGS -d '{"name": "household", "owner":  "thistrompecoughtsideneet", "collaborators": ["george"], "_rev":  "5-e4e63ef94ea8e1dceb7d47d5ff0feba3"}' $DOC  {"ok":true,"id":"test","rev":"6-1a4b906bfac10b11303e5ddaebbd9cb6"}  [ 80 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   If we set the validation function correctly, the first user should be able to edit the list  but not the second user:  $ export DOC=george:password@djsauble.cloudant.com lists test  $ curl $ARGS -d '{"name": "household", "owner":  "thistrompecoughtsideneet", "collaborators":  ["mrsedgerindogedgedgerady"], "_rev":  "7-ecb03521c54567d78ec262070d06f6f7"}' $DOC  {"ok":true,"id":"test","rev":"8-20d3d307d5d6f93d322eb999faa7249b"}  As expected, the first user is able to retrieve the document. How about the   second user?  $ export DOC=clarissa:password@djsauble.cloudant.com lists test  $ curl $ARGS -d '{"name": "household", "owner":  "thistrompecoughtsideneet", "collaborators":  ["mrsedgerindogedgedgerady"], "_rev":  "8-20d3d307d5d6f93d322eb999faa7249b"}' $DOC  {"error":"forbidden","reason":"only the owner and collaborators may view  or edit"}  The second user cannot do so. This is exactly what we want. All the to-do items   are public, in that anyone can view them, but only the owners or collaborators   can make changes.  Finally, let's validate that only the owner can delete a to-do list:  $ export DOC=mrsedgerindogedgedgerady:SNoJan2kuPSvVnlw7LeoBgSF@djsauble. cloudant.com lists test  $ curl $ARGS -d '{"_deleted": true, "name":  "household", "owner": "thistrompecoughtsideneet",  "collaborators": ["mrsedgerindogedgedgerady"], "_rev":  "8-20d3d307d5d6f93d322eb999faa7249b"}' $DOC  {"error":"forbidden","reason":"only the owner may delete the list"}  Collaborators cannot delete a list that they don't own. That's good.  $ export DOC=https:  thistrompecoughtsideneet:VW6uPL3kNHbdlHuoovjWVCUX@ djsauble.cloudant.com lists test  $ curl $ARGS -d '{"_deleted": true, "name":  "household", "owner": "thistrompecoughtsideneet",  "collaborators": ["mrsedgerindogedgedgerady"], "_rev":  "8-20d3d307d5d6f93d322eb999faa7249b"}' $DOC  {"ok":true,"id":"test","rev":"9-ca30bb170b17ad818acf90b6f447c3bf"}  The owners can delete their lists. Great!  [ 81 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   We're done! The validation function might seem like overkill but it serves a very  important purpose. Yes, you could implement client-side validation in your app  and call it good. However, as CouchDB exposes a REST API that anyone can use, it's  a good idea to put the validation as close to the data as possible. It assures us that  regardless of where the data comes from, it's well-formed and easily consumed by  any app we write.  As you went through the commands, you may have noticed an extra attribute named  _rev. The revision attribute is used to track the changes. Similar to Git, all the older  versions of a document are preserved unless you explicitly delete them. When we  make updates to a document, we must specify which revision is the latest. This  attribute changes every time a successful update occurs.  The reason for the attribute is to help us solve the problem that occurs when two  separate databases, with different changes for the same document version, try to  reconcile their changes. We'll walk through this problem  and the solution  in   Chapter 6, Be Eventually Consistent.  Implementing image support We left a few features unfinished in the last chapter. Currently, you cannot attach  images to a to-do item or choose a location from the map. Let's implement the first   of these now.  Installing the Cordova camera plugin As Sencha Touch is a platform-agnostic framework, it doesn't have hooks in any of  the native capabilities of your devices, including the camera. The downside is that  there isn't a platform-independent way to attach photos. You have to implement  separate solutions for different platforms. To keep things simple, we'll implement a  solution for iOS. You'll be able to continue using the app with your desktop browser;  you just won't be able to attach photos. In Chapter 2, Building a To-do App we used Cordova to package our Sencha Touch app  and deploy it to iOS. Cordova provides you with the ability to integrate with your  phone's native capabilities through a plugin system. We'll use the camera plugin to  give the app access to the images on your device.  Open your command-line terminal. In the todo-app  project folder, switch to the  cordova  directory and install the plugin:  $ cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-camera  [ 82 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   This will install the necessary files in your project folder. Now, we can access the  methods that it exposes directly in our app. Let's open Sublime Text and make the  necessary changes.  Creating a custom image component In new.js and edit.js, we added a placeholder for the image functionality  wrapped in a fieldset. We'll remove these placeholders and create a new file  containing a custom image component along with the logic to select and save  images. Create a new file under todo-app app views  named image.js and   make the following changes.  1.  First, provide the name of the new component and derive it from    Ext.form.FieldSet: Ext.define 'TodoApp.view.Image', {   extend: 'Ext.form.FieldSet',   alias: 'widget.todo-image', } ;  2.  Under the alias attribute, define the configuration for the component,   including the title of the fieldset and components that live under the fieldset: config: {   title: 'Image',   items: [     {       xtype: 'hiddenfield',       name: 'media'     },     {       xtype: 'panel',       layout: 'fit',       html: 'No image loaded'     },     {       xtype: 'button',       text: 'Select'     },     {       xtype: 'button',       text: 'Remove',       hidden: true     }   ] },  [ 83 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The hiddenfield component will hold the Base64-encoded image, to be  submitted as a part of the form. The other controls are used to display and  select this image. The buttons, select and reset, are mutually exclusive; only  one will be shown at a time.  3.  Under the config block, let's add functions to select and remove images. We'll   link to these from the button handlers in a bit. First, remove the following: removeImage: function scope  {   scope.down 'hiddenfield' .setValue '' ;   scope.down 'panel' .setHtml 'No image loaded' ;   scope.down 'button[text=Select]' .setHidden false ;   scope.down 'button[text=Remove]' .setHidden true ; },  4.  This function clears the hiddenfield component, provides text to indicate   that no image is loaded, and shows the Select button while hiding the  Remove button. Let's add the selectImage function next: selectImage: function scope  {   navigator.camera.getPicture      function dataUrl  {    Success       var media = 'data:image jpeg;base64,' + dataUrl;       scope.down 'hiddenfield' .setValue media        scope.down 'panel' .setHtml '<img src="' + media + '"          alt="todo image" width="100%" >' ;       scope.down 'button[text=Select]' .setHidden true ;       scope.down 'button[text=Remove]' .setHidden false ;     },     function message  {    Failure       scope.down 'panel' .setHtml message ;     },     {    Options       quality: 50,       destinationType: navigator.camera.DestinationType.DATA_URL,       sourceType: navigator.camera.PictureSourceType.PHOTOLIBRARY,       CameraUsesGeolocation: true     }    ; },  [ 84 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   This function is a little more complicated. It uses the Cordova camera  plugin that we installed earlier to select an image from your device. If this  is successful, it sets the value of hiddenfield to the Base64-encoded image,  displays the image in an img tag, and shows the Remove button. It also specifies  a few options to decrease the image size, request an image from the photo  library, and use the geolocation information from the JPEG, if available.  5.  The last thing that we need to do in this file is hook up the button handlers with   these two functions. In the config block, add handler to the Select button: {   xtype: 'button',   text: 'Select',   handler: function button  {     var parent = button.up 'todo-image' ;     parent.selectImage parent ;   } },  6.  This causes the selectImage function to be called whenever the Select  button is clicked, with a reference to the parent  Ext.form.FieldSet .   Now, do the same for the Remove button configuration: {   xtype: 'button',   text: 'Remove',   hidden: true,   handler: function button  {     var parent = button.up 'todo-image' ;     parent.removeImage parent ;   } }  Great, you've defined a custom image control. Now, let's wire it up to the rest of the  to-do app.  Enabling image support As mentioned, new.js and edit.js contain placeholders for the image controls.  Remove the image fieldset block in these files and replace it with the following code:  {   xtype: 'todo-image' },  [ 85 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Then, to load the necessary classes, add a reference to the image component in the  requires array for each file:  requires: [   'TodoApp.view.Image' ],  That's it! Now, when you run your app, you can Create a new item, select an image  from your device, and attach it to the item:  To-do app with image support  [ 86 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   There's just one thing left to do. When you edit the item, the image doesn't display.  The image is automatically loaded in the hiddenfield component, but we haven't  provided the logic to automatically display the image. Let's do this now. Edit todo- app app controller main.js and modify the editTodoItem function:  editTodoItem: function button, e, eOpts  {   var store = this.getListDataView  .getStore  ,   editPanel = this.getEditPanel  ,   editForm = this.getEditForm  ,   imagePanel = editForm.down 'todo-image' .down 'panel' ,   record = store.findRecord 'id', button.getData   ,   mediaData = record.get 'media' ;    editForm.setRecord record ;       Show the associated image   if  mediaData  {     imagePanel.setHtml '<img src="' + record.get 'media'  + '"        alt="todo image" width="100%" >' ;   }    this.showView editPanel ; },  Now, run your app and edit an item with an image attached. Notice how the image  is displayed correctly.  Implementing mapping support The map is the other big chunk of functionality that's currently missing. When you  create a new to-do item, you should have the option to select a point on the map.  When you near this point, your phone will remind you of the related item on your  to-do list.  [ 87 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Creating a custom map component As with the image selector, we'll create a custom map component to replace the  temporary fieldset that we created when we were mocking the views. Create a new   file in todo-app app view  named Map.js and give it the basic component structure:  Ext.define 'TodoApp.view.Map', {   extend: 'Ext.form.FieldSet',   alias: 'widget.todo-map',   requires: [     'Ext.Map'   ] } ;  Sencha Touch provides a map component, which wraps the Google map API. We  require the Ext.Map class here but we also need to include the JavaScript that is  backing this API. Add the following element to the js array in todo-app app.json:  {   "path": "http:  maps.google.com maps api js?sensor=true" }  Now, back in Map.js, add a config attribute to define basic config options:  In the items array, add fields to hold the values for latitude and longitude:  config: {   title: 'Location',   items: [] }  {   xtype: 'hiddenfield',   name: 'latitude' }, {   xtype: 'hiddenfield',   name: 'longitude' },  {   xtype: 'panel',   layout: 'fit',  Now, add a placeholder panel to hold the Ext.Map instance. We'll add the map  dynamically, for reasons that we'll discuss later:  [ 88 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Finally, add buttons to Set and Clear the location for a given to-do item:    width: '100%',   height: 300 },  {   xtype: 'button',   text: 'Set' }, {   xtype: 'button',   text: 'Clear',   hidden: true }  {  }    xtype: 'todo-map'  'TodoApp.view.Map'  Open todo-app app view Edit.js and replace our placeholder fieldset with a  reference to the new map component:  Add a dependency to the requires array at the top of the file:  Now do the same for todo-app app view New.js. Pretty simple!  Adding logic to the view Now that we've defined the components in our custom view, let's add the logic  necessary to make the map load and display correctly. First, we need to add a way   to set a marker on the map indicating the alert location. Add the following function:  setMarker: function me, latitude, longitude  {   var map = me.down 'map' .getMap  ,     position;    if  map.mapMarker  {     map.mapMarker.setMap null ;   }    if  latitude && longitude  {     position = new google.maps.LatLng latitude, longitude ;  [ 89 ]  www.it-ebooks.info     } else {     position = map.getCenter  ;   }    map.mapMarker = new google.maps.Marker {     position: position,     map: map   } ;    me.down 'button[text=Set]' .setHidden true ;   me.down 'button[text=Clear]' .setHidden false ;   me.down 'map' .setUseCurrentLocation false ;   me.down 'map' .setMapOptions {     center: map.mapMarker.getPosition  ,     draggable: false   } ;   map.mapCenter.setVisible false ; },  There's a lot going on here but it's pretty simple. First, we reset any previous marker  on the map. Next, if a latitude and longitude is provided, we create the marker   at that position; otherwise, we create it at the center of the map. Next, we instantiate  the actual marker, pointing it at the position and the map itself. Finally, we the  show hide buttons, fix the map to its current position, and hide the marker  placeholder  more on this later .  Next, we need a method to clear the marker from the map and use a placeholder  instead  to show where the marker would be positioned, if set :  clearMarker: function me  {   var map = me.down 'map' .getMap  ;    if  map.mapMarker  {     map.mapMarker.setMap null ;   }    me.down 'button[text=Set]' .setHidden false ;   me.down 'button[text=Clear]' .setHidden true ;   me.down 'map' .setMapOptions {draggable: true} ;   map.mapCenter.setVisible true ; }  This method also clears any existing marker. It frees the map so that it can be  dragged around. It also displays the placeholder for the center of the map. Next,  we'll implement the method that sets this up.  [ 90 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   So, we have methods that set and clear our map marker. Now, let's implement a  method that initializes the map when it first renders:  onMapRender: function obj, map  {   var mapPanel = obj.up 'todo-map' ;    if  !map.mapCenter  {     map.mapCenter = new google.maps.Marker {       map: map,       opacity: 0.5     } ;     map.mapCenter.bindTo 'position', map, 'center' ;   }    if  !mapPanel.mapRendered  {     map.mapRendered = true;     mapPanel.onMapAdd obj, map ;   } },  When someone sets a location on a to-do item, a marker appears at the center of the  map. However, we want people to know precisely where the marker will appear. To  solve this, we add a ghost marker at the center of the map. As the map is dragged  about, the marker updates its position. Once the location has been set, the ghost  marker is hidden and the real marker is displayed in its place.  The other purpose of this method is to kick-start the onMapAdd method, which we  will add next. This method checks for the latitude and longitude data in the form  and sets the marker, if it exists. Let's implement this method now:  onMapAdd: function obj, map  {   var mapPanel = obj.up 'todo-map' ,     longitude =        mapPanel.down 'hiddenfield[name=longitude]' .getValue  ,     latitude =        mapPanel.down 'hiddenfield[name=latitude]' .getValue  ;    if  map.mapRendered  {     if  longitude && latitude  {       mapPanel.setMarker mapPanel, latitude, longitude ;     } else {       mapPanel.down 'map' .setUseCurrentLocation true ;       mapPanel.clearMarker mapPanel ;     }   } },  [ 91 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   As mentioned, this method checks for latitude and longitude in the form. If  the map has been rendered, we set the marker appropriately. If no data has been  provided, we let the map snap to the user's current location in order to make it   easier to select a location in the future.  If the map has not been rendered, we do nothing. This is fine as the method will be  called as soon as the map has rendered.  See onMapRender.   Now that we've defined these methods, let's hook them up to the event handlers   that call them. In the items array of Map.js, add event handlers to the panel and   two buttons:  When a map is dynamically added to the panel, display it and set the markers  appropriately. Now, for the Set button, do the following:  listeners: {   add: function obj, item, index  {     var parent = obj.up 'todo-map' ;     parent.onMapAdd obj, item.getMap   ;   } }  {   xtype: 'button',   text: 'Set',   handler: function button  {     var parent = button.up 'todo-map' ,     map = parent.down 'map' .getMap  ;      parent.setMarker parent ;      var position = map.mapMarker.getPosition  ;     parent.down 'hiddenfield[name=latitude]' .setValue        position.lat   ;     parent.down 'hiddenfield[name=longitude]' .setValue        position.lng   ;   } },  When clicked, set the map marker appropriately and attach latitude and longitude  to the appropriate fields. When the form is saved, this data will be persisted.  Finally, for the Clear button, do the following:  {   xtype: 'button',   text: 'Clear',  [ 92 ]  www.it-ebooks.info     hidden: true,   handler: function button  {     var parent = button.up 'todo-map' ;     parent.clearMarker parent ;   parent.down 'hiddenfield[name=latitude]' .setValue null ;     parent.down 'hiddenfield[name=longitude]' .setValue null ;   } }  When clicked, clear the map marker and nullify latitude and longitude. When the  form is saved, the location will be cleared.  Wiring up the controller This is it for Map.js. Now, we need to make a few changes to the Main controller.  Our app follows the MVC pattern, which means that we need to link our views to  the backing data by means of a controller class. Remember how the map markers  are set when the map is dynamically added to its panel? Let's implement these  dynamic operations now.  Edit todo-app app controller Main.js and make the following changes to the  showView method:  showView: function view  {   if  !this.mapResource  {     this.mapResource = Ext.create 'widget.map', {       xtype: 'map',       width: 'auto',       height: 300,       mapOptions: {         zoom: 15       },       listeners: {         maprender: function obj, map  {           var parent = this.up 'todo-map' ;           parent.onMapRender obj, map ;         }       }     } ;   }   var map = this.getMainPanel  .down 'todo-map' ;   if  map  {     map.down 'panel' .remove this.mapResource, false ;   }   this.getMainPanel  .removeAll  ;  [ 93 ]  www.it-ebooks.info     this.getMainPanel  .add view ;   map = this.getMainPanel  .down 'todo-map' ;   if  map  {     map.down 'panel' .add this.mapResource ;   } },  Here's where the magic happens. We attach a map resource to the controller. This  resource is a singleton. It is created once and added to our custom component as  needed. The reason for this is that an application may only have one instance of a  Google map. Add another map and the app fails to display either map correctly.  Every time the view is changed, we check for usages of our map resource. If used,  we remove it from the associated panels. If the new view has a map, we add it to the  panel. Due to our onMapAdd handler method, it reads the data from this component  and sets the markers appropriately when the map is added to a new component:  To-do app with basic map support  [ 94 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Refine the map.  The map works, kind of, but it's not optimal. The map is a little small; we really  want it to be fullscreen. Also, scrolling feels rough as both the page and map scroll  vertically at the same time. Let's fix this now by implementing a fullscreen map view,  used when setting the location.  Building the map view First, let's create this new view:  Ext.define 'TodoApp.view.Location', {   extend: 'Ext.Panel',   alias: 'widget.todo-location',   requires: [     'Ext.Map'   ],    config: {   layout: 'fit',     items: [       {         docked: 'top',         xtype: 'titlebar',         title: 'Set location',         items: [           {             align: 'left',             text: 'Back',             action: 'back'           },           {             align: 'right',             text: 'Set',             action: 'set'           }         ]       },       {         xtype: 'panel',         layout: 'fit',         listeners: {  [ 95 ]  www.it-ebooks.info             add: function obj, item, index  {             var parent = obj.up 'todo-location' ;             parent.onMapAdd obj, item.getMap   ;           }         }       }     ]   },    onMapAdd: function obj, map  {     var mapPanel = obj.up 'todo-location' ;         Resize the Google map     google.maps.event.trigger map, 'resize' ;      if  map.mapRendered  {       mapPanel.clearMarker mapPanel ;     }   },    clearMarker: function me  {     var map = me.down 'map' .getMap  ;      map.mapMarker.bindTo 'position', map, 'center' ;      me.down 'map' .setMapOptions {draggable: true} ;   } } ;  Next, let's add a reference to this new view in the views configuration of our   Main controller:  Next, let's add a selector to the refs array in this controller:  views: [   …   'Location', ],  locationPanel: {   selector: 'todo-location',   xtype: 'todo-location',   autoCreate: true }  [ 96 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   As our app is now three levels deep  the list view, edit and new views, and location  view , we need to rethink how we will drill down. Let's switch our main view to use  a card layout. Each card represents another level in the hierarchy.  Ext.define 'TodoApp.view.Main', {   …   config: {     layout: 'card',     items: { xtype: 'todo-list' }   },   activeIndex: 0 } ;  Adding drilldown support to the controller Now, we need to modify the showView function in the Main controller. Instead of just  swapping the views in and out, it needs to be aware of the card layout, preserve the  cards that come before the current view, and remove the cards that fall after. To start,  let's refactor some of the map logic in their own functions for simplification:  createMapResource: function   {   var me = this;   if  !this.mapResource  {     this.mapResource = Ext.create 'widget.map', {       xtype: 'map',       mapOptions: {         zoom: 15,         disableDefaultUI: true       },       listeners: {       maprender: function obj, map  {       mapPanel = obj.up 'todo-map'   obj.up 'todo-location' ;        map.mapMarker = new google.maps.Marker {         map: map       } ;           Trigger a resize when the bounds of the map change       google.maps.event.addListener map, 'bounds_changed',          function   {           var panel = obj.up 'todo-map'   obj.up              'todo-location' ;  [ 97 ]  www.it-ebooks.info               panel.onMapAdd obj, map ;       } ;        if  !mapPanel.mapRendered  {         map.mapRendered = true;         mapPanel.onMapAdd obj, map ;       }       }       }     } ;   } }, unloadMapResource: function   {   var map = this.getMainPanel  .down 'map' ;    if  map  {     map.up 'panel' .remove this.mapResource, false ;   } }, loadMapResource: function   {   var map = this.getMainPanel  .getActiveItem  .down 'todo-map'        this.getMainPanel  .down 'todo-location' ;    if  map  {     map.down 'panel' .add this.mapResource ;   } }  Now, let's reference these functions in the body of the showView function and add  our card management logic:  showView: function view, index  {   this.createMapResource  ;   this.unloadMapResource  ;    for  var i = this.getMainPanel  .getItems  .length - 1; i >=      index; --i  {     this.getMainPanel  .remove this.getMainPanel  .getAt i ,        false ;   }   this.getMainPanel  .add view ;   this.getMainPanel  .setActiveItem index ;   this.getMainPanel  .activeIndex = index;    this.loadMapResource  ; },  [ 98 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   This is all well and good to show new views, but what if we just want to go back?  That's a similar operation but we don't actually need to add or remove any views   besides the shared map resource . Let's add a goBack function now:  goBack: function   {   this.unloadMapResource  ;    if  this.getMainPanel  .activeIndex > 0  {     this.getMainPanel  .activeIndex--;   }   this.getMainPanel  .setActiveItem      this.getMainPanel  .activeIndex ;    this.loadMapResource  ; },  Wiring up the map view With these new functions in place, let's rewire the listeners in the control object now.  The back buttons should point to the goBack function and we have new buttons  related to the Location view, so let's wire these up at the same time:  'todo-new button[action=back]': {   tap: 'goBack' }, 'todo-edit button[action=back]': {   tap: 'goBack' }, 'todo-map button[action=set]': {   tap: 'showLocationView' }, 'todo-location button[action=back]': {   tap: 'goBack' }, 'todo-location button[action=set]': {   tap: 'setLocation' }  Obviously, we haven't implemented the showLocationView or setLocation views  yet, so let's do this next. The first is used to show the fullscreen map view and the  second is used to take the selection and apply it to whichever view comes previously  in the card layout  either the todo-new or todo-edit views :  showLocationView: function   {   this.showView this.getLocationPanel  , 2 ;  [ 99 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   }, setLocation: function   {   var panel = this.getLocationPanel  ,     position,     map;    position = panel.down 'map' .getMap  .mapMarker.getPosition  ;   this.goBack  ;    panel = this.getMainPanel  .getActiveItem  .down 'todo-map' ;   panel.down 'hiddenfield[name=latitude]' .setValue      position.lat   ;   panel.down 'hiddenfield[name=longitude]' .setValue      position.lng   ;   panel.hideMap panel, false ;   panel.setMarker panel, position.lat  ,      position.lng   ; },  Finally, we need to tweak a few of the existing functions in order to adapt them to  the card layout as well. Previously, in the process of swapping views in and out,  the removed views were destroyed and then recreated on demand. This meant that  we started from a clean slate each time that we opened a view. Now, the views are   mostly  persistent, which means that we need to manage certain aspects manually.  The createTodoItem function is now responsible for refreshing the list of to-do  items when a new item is created:  createTodoItem: function button, e, eOpts  {   var store = Ext.getStore 'Item' ;    store.add this.getNewForm  .getValues      store.sync  ;   store.load  ;   this.showListView  ; },  [ 100 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The editTodoItem function is now responsible for clearing any existing image in  addition to loading them. Edit the mediaData block:     Show the associated image if  mediaData  {   imagePanel.down 'panel' .setHtml '<img src="' +      record.get 'media'  + '" alt="todo image" width="100%" >' ;   imagePanel.down 'button[text=Select]' .setHidden true ;   imagePanel.down 'button[text=Remove]' .setHidden false ; } else {   imagePanel.down 'panel' .setHtml 'No image loaded' ;   imagePanel.down 'button[text=Select]' .setHidden false ;   imagePanel.down 'button[text=Remove]' .setHidden true ; }  The showNewView function is now responsible for resetting itself, including any  displayed image whenever it is shown:  showNewView: function   {   var newPanel = this.getNewPanel  ,     newForm = this.getNewForm  ;       Reset the new panel   newForm.reset  ;   newForm.down 'todo-image' .down 'panel' .setHtml 'No image loaded' ;   newForm.down 'todo-image' .down      'button[text=Select]' .setHidden false ;   newForm.down 'todo-image' .down 'button[text=Remove]' . setHidden true ;    this.showView newPanel, 1 ; },  [ 101 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Refactoring the map views This is it for the Main controller. Now, we need to modify our Map view. As this view  shares much in common with the new Location view, we've abstracted out much  of the functionality and put it in the Main controller instead. The resulting view is  simpler than before.  First, let's add a container right after the hidden latitude and longitude fields, which  are displayed when no location has been selected  similar to the message when no  image has been selected :  Next, let's remove handler from the Set button and replace it with an action as this  logic is now handled by the Main controller:  Now, let's simplify handler for the Clear button by abstracting the logic into a  separate function named hideMap. The ability to hide the map is needed at multiple  points in the code, hence the reason for this:  {   xtype: 'container',   layout: 'fit',   html: 'No location selected' },  {   xtype: 'button',   text: 'Set',   action: 'set' },  {   xtype: 'button',   text: 'Clear',   hidden: true,   handler: function button  {     var parent = button.up 'todo-map' ;     parent.hideMap parent, true ;   } }  [ 102 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Now for the hideMap function as follows:  hideMap: function me, hidden  {   if  hidden  {     me.down 'hiddenfield[name=latitude]' .setValue null ;     me.down 'hiddenfield[name=longitude]' .setValue null ;   }    me.down 'container' .setHidden !hidden ;   me.down 'panel' .setHidden hidden ;   me.down 'button[text=Set]' .setHidden !hidden ;   me.down 'button[text=Clear]' .setHidden hidden ; }  Now you can delete the onMapRender and clearMarker functions as these functions  are now handled by the Main controller. As we have separate views to handle the  viewing and setting of the location, we don't need multiple markers attached to our  Google map, just the one. This means that we can simplify the setMarker function   as well:  setMarker: function me, latitude, longitude  {   var map = me.down 'map' .getMap  ,     position;    map.mapMarker.setPosition new google.maps.LatLng latitude,      longitude  ;    me.down 'map' .setMapOptions {     center: map.mapMarker.getPosition  ,     draggable: false   } ; },  Last, we need to trigger a resize of the Google map whenever its container changes  its size. The todo-map and todo-location views are 300 pixels high and fullscreen,  respectively, so we should trigger a resize whenever we switch between them. Add  the following code to the onMapAdd function right after the variable initialization:     Resize the Google map google.maps.event.trigger map, 'resize' ;  [ 103 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   You're done! Your fullscreen map view should appear as follows:  To-do app with a fullscreen map  [ 104 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Comparing and contrasting with the  design principles We added two new features in this chapter: attaching an image to a to-do item and  specifying a location on a map. Let's put our phone in the airplane mode and do  another quick evaluation against the principles with the same pass fail scoring   as before. Give me uninterrupted access to the content I care about.  One of the major shortcomings of our app is that the map functionality does not  work offline. When you try to view or edit the map, you get a rather unfortunate  error message:  Offline map error  [ 105 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   This error occurs because the app can't load the required Google Maps API script,  which prevents us from viewing maps or changing our coordinates. The basic  problem is that Google does not let you cache their maps without paying for this  ability. To get around this, you can use open maps, which have no such restriction.  Unfortunately, doing this is complicated and outside the scope of this book, so  I leave it as an exercise for the reader. However, to prevent this problem from  affecting how we score against the design principles, I won't count it against us. Pass. Content is mutable. Don't let my online offline status change that.  This is a fail. Due to the error mentioned previously, it is impossible to change the  map coordinates when offline because we depend on a JavaScript file that is available  only online. We'll show how to cache the JavaScript  and maps  in the next chapter. Error messages should not leave me guessing or unnecessarily worried.  This is a fail. The map error is not especially clear. It doesn't explain that the source  of the problem is that I'm offline. It also doesn't tell me what to do to resolve the  problem. Finally, while the message isn't particularly worrisome, it isn't very  reassuring either. Don't let me start something I can't finish.  This is a pass. You can still save changes to the to-do items while offline, even though  the map doesn't work. An app should never contradict itself. If a conflict exists, be honest about it.  This is a pass. It's bad that we don't give you any map coordinates while offline but  it's good that we don't try and show you the wrong thing. When the laws of physics prevail, choose breadth over depth when caching.  This is a fail. We don't cache the map at all so this principle is moot in a bad way.  We'll introduce caching in the next chapter. Empty states should tell me what to do next in a delightful way.  This is a fail. We still don't provide much guidance when you're filling out a to-do  item for the first time. Don't make me remember what I was doing last. Remember for me.  This is a fail. We haven't yet provided a way to keep the context sticky. We'll address  this problem in the next chapter. Degrade gracefully as the network degrades. Don't be jarring.  [ 106 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   This is a pass. The mapping behavior is very sane as the network degrades. Once  the mapping library has loaded, it displays any cached maps with no problems,  regardless of the network state. Never purge the cache unless I demand it.  This is a fail. The Maps API has a short-term cache but is cleared when the app quits.  We want the maps to persist between loads of the app so that people don't have to  worry about it disappearing.  Where does it need to improve? We didn't do nearly as well this time around. Our app only meets 4 10 of the  principles, down from 8 10 in the previous chapter. This is entirely due to the  Google Maps API. As we rely on a library and data that is external to our app, we're  technically "online" but in the most naive way possible.  In the next chapter, we'll introduce caching. This will help us improve in most of  these areas. Additional improvement is needed in our error messaging, which we'll  also address soon.  Summary In this chapter, we designed the online behavior for our app, looked at state transitions  and their effects on the workflow, and customized Cloudant, which we will use in the  following chapters to support synchronization and list sharing. We also continued to  refine our offline app by adding support for images and map locations.  In the next chapter, we will talk about the different libraries that are available for  offline caching, pick one, connect our app to our web service, and improve the  design and readability of the default error states. This will allow us to do another  round of evaluation against the principles and set us up to continue adding  functionalities in the following chapters.  [ 107 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   www.it-ebooks.info   Getting Online  We've seen that adding a little bit of online capability can really hurt our adherence  to the offline design principles. By default, most libraries and frameworks don't  handle being offline very gracefully, so we need to implement our own handling of  these situations. In this chapter, we'll do exactly this.  Caching enables the illusion of being online when you're not. However, there  are two types of caching: short-term caching, which is persistent per session, and  long-term caching, which is persistent across sessions. In the context of mobile app  development, restarting the app will clear the short-term cache but should leave the  long-term cache intact. Most apps support short-term caching by default. To enable  long-term caching, you'll need to do a bit more work.  Fortunately, solving the long-term caching problem is relatively straightforward.  There are a great number of libraries and tools to make this easy. We'll discuss a few  of them in this chapter, including PouchDB, remoteStorage, and Hoodie. Of course, whether you have a cache or not, the data has to come from somewhere.  In our to-do app, the data is persisted in the browser's local storage. This is a simple  offline storage solution, adequate for most needs. However, as we need to share data  with our friends and multiple devices, we need to make our data more accessible.  That's why we configured a CouchDB database on Cloudant in the last chapter. We'll  need to reconfigure our app to pull data from this service directly, thus making it a  truly online experience.  However, sharing and syncing has its own set of problems. We'll need to support  user accounts and multiple devices per account. Both of these are features that  you can manage only while online, so how do we make this clear in the UI? A first  attempt at getting online can create more issues than it can solve.  [ 109 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   In this chapter, we'll investigate some options for offline database caching, connect  our app to our Cloudant instance, and implement user, sharing, and notification  features that only function while online. In addition, we'll shore up some of the  shortcomings in the to-do app with our newfound caching knowledge, noting the  error messages as we go.  By the end of this chapter, the to-do app will be fully online. The rest of the book   will be spent polishing the rough edges and improving the offline experience.   Let's get started.  Offline databases There is really only one requirement of a good online database: synchronization. If a  database solves the problem of making multiple databases eventually consistent, it's  probably an option worth considering. There are many choices available: derby.js,  Lawnchair, Firebase, remotestorage.io, Sencha Touch, Hoodie, PouchDB, and others. Some of these are pure databases; others provide end-to-end offline-first  development frameworks. For simplicity, we will focus on four: Sencha Touch,  PouchDB, remotestorage.io, and Hoodie.  Sencha Touch We've chosen Sencha Touch to build our offline app. As we saw in Chapter 2,   Building a To-do App, Sencha Touch provides support for multiple types of backing  stores and makes it trivial to swap between them. Some of these backing stores,   such as LocalStorage, are offline-based. In a way, Sencha Touch is less about storing  data offline and more about providing an easy interface layer between the frontend  and data.  Why isn't LocalStorage sufficient? As it is restricted to a single browser, it can't be  used for any kind of meaningful sharing or synchronization across devices. At least,  not without help. It's too restrictive. While it makes an excellent option to build the  offline nucleus of your app, it's inadequate once you need to hybridize the online  and offline worlds.  Once you decide to craft a hybrid solution that functions both online and offline,  what is needed? You still need a local backing store for the caching. Without  LocalStorage, you've lost all of your data as soon as your app goes offline. However,  you also need an authoritative remote source for the data. That's why we created  a hosted CouchDB database in the last chapter. It's a place where data for multiple  users and devices can be consolidated, flowing in and out as needed.  [ 110 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   This ebb and flow implies at least two databases, a local cache and remote source  of truth, which talk to one another. Synchronization between a local backing store  and the remote source of truth is the critical thing. A traditional database isn't  accustomed to sharing but an offline app absolutely demands sharing. It can't  assume connectivity to a remote database but must have local access to the data at  all times. This is why we used CloudDB because it is built from the ground up for  synchronization. MySQL, PostgreSQL, and even other NoSQL databases such as  MongoDB are not. Not to say that you can't use a traditional database to build an offline-first app. It's  just harder. We're going to stay with the path of least resistance in this book.  So if LocalStorage isn't adequate for a local caching database, what other local  backing stores does Sencha Touch support out of the box? The only other choice is  MemoryProxy, which isn't better as it just stores records in memory instead of in a  cookie. We need to look beyond the Sencha ecosystem for other alternatives. Let's  inspect our remaining options.  PouchDB Where Sencha Touch is a frontend framework that can interface with storage,  PouchDB is a backend database that can interface with a frontend framework. It's a  JavaScript-based implementation of the CouchDB API with the goal of near-perfect  emulation. As with CouchDB, it supports synchronization, revision history, and  provides a native REST API with no additional protocols or drivers needed.  The revision control is worth an additional mention. It is similar to Git, so every  update must include an attribute with the revision ID. When conflicts arise, you get  to choose how to resolve them: either automatically or by letting the user decide. As  revisions are never deleted, you have a complete history and can undo or view this  history quite easily.  Obviously, storing history can consume a lot of space. PouchDB allows you to  compact the database, which deletes the history, or delete the database altogether.  However, the revision history will still exist on the remote database so you can query  it, if needed.  Development tools for PouchDB are available on Chrome and Firefox. The database  itself is installed and managed with npm and has only two dependencies: CouchDB  and Cross-Origin Resource Sharing  CORS .  [ 111 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The killer feature of PouchDB is its support for live database replication. When a  change is committed, all the apps with a connection to the remote database get an  instant receipt of the change. This allows you to warn users when they're editing  something that has changed underneath them. Alternatively, you can simply note  the fact and provide an option to overwrite or undo after the change is made. When  an app goes offline, database replication stops but you can configure PouchDB to  resume the synchronization once the app goes online again.  This seems like exactly the kind of database that we need. It provides  synchronization and will interface easily with both Sencha Touch and our CloudDB  web service. Let's see if either of the two remaining alternatives match what  PouchDB has to offer.  The remotestorage.io library While PouchDB is clearly a straightforward option, remotestorage.io seems to cater  to a different crowd. First, it bakes the concept of users into the solution. Every  user has data that they own and may even decide where this data should be stored.  Out of the box, remotestorage.io has support for multiple backing stores, including  Dropbox, Google Drive, IndexedDB, LocalStorage, and in-memory storage. If you  write multiple apps, they can share data among themselves, so you'll only need to fill  out your profile once!  Unlike other NoSQL databases, it supports folders and files as first-class data types  along with the more traditional JSON objects. It supports synchronization and  sharing but not as nicely as PouchDB.  One interesting quality is that remotestorage.io has several different caching  strategies: FLUSH where only outgoing changes are cached until they're actually  submitted, SEEN where only the documents that have been read or written are  cached, and ALL which is more proactive and caches anything that is not in the  process of being changed.  In general, it seems that remotestorage.io is an excellent solution if you want a choice  about where your data is stored and you want this data to be freely accessible from  other apps. However, it does not seem like a simple solution nor quite as robust as  PouchDB. We'll pass on it for now.  [ 112 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Hoodie Where PouchDB and remotestorage.io are very database focused, Hoodie  encompasses all aspects of an offline-first experience. Hood.ie is an inspirational  website, so you should definitely browse it even if you decide not to use their tools.  However, it's also a disorganized website, difficult to wrap your mind around or get  specific usage examples. PouchDB is still better in this regard. Hoodie has both a frontend component  Hoodie.js  and backend component   hoodie-server . There is also an interface for PouchDB, so if you don't want to   use Hoodie's database, you can choose an alternative. One of the nicest perks is   that Hoodie takes care of the infrastructure around user accounts, sharing, and   even e-mails. This requires an account on Hood.ie and deploying your app to   this domain.  However, as we're building our app with Sencha Touch, Hoodie is a bit more  than we need. PouchDB fills the one crucial gap that we have and has excellent  documentation, so it's going to be the best option for us. This said, if you're  interested in an end-to-end solution to design, build, and deploy an offline app,   give Hoodie a look.  Connecting to our Web API With PouchDB as our offline database of choice, let's switch over from LocalStorage  and connect it to our remote CouchDB database. We'll need to download PouchDB,  add it to our Sencha Touch app, and configure it properly.  Adding PouchDB to the app First, download PouchDB and copy it to your app folder:  1.  Open www.pouchdb.com in your browser. 2.  Click Download at the top of the page. 3.  Copy this file  named pouchdb-3.6.0.min.js or similar  to the    todo-app  folder.  Next, edit app.json and add this file to the js array:  {   "path": "pouchdb-3.6.0.min.js" }  [ 113 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Finally, add an init function to the Item store, where you'll initialize both the local  and remote PouchDB databases. The local database will use LocalStorage and remote  database will use the Cloudant database that we created in the previous chapter:  remoteDB: null, localDB: null, initialize: function   {   var me = this;    me.remoteDB = new PouchDB       'https:  username:password@subdomain.cloudant.com lists' ;   me.localDB = new PouchDB 'lists' ; }  Note that we will not change where Sencha Touch stores its data by default. This  will remain untouched. Instead, whenever records are loaded, added, removed, or  updated, we will copy these changes to our local PouchDB and then sync them to the  remote PouchDB. It should look as follows:  Data stores  When the app first loads, it should display whatever exists in LocalStorage. Next, it  kicks off replication between the local and remote PouchDB instances. After this is  complete, it overwrites LocalStorage with the contents of the PouchDB local . The  advantage of this is that we always show the user something while our PouchDB  instances are working in the background.  Enabling live synchronization Normally, PouchDB will only replicate to other databases when you specifically  request it. This is fine for most usages but we want to be notified when our to-do  items change on another device. To support this, PouchDB provides us with a live  replication mode so that changes on one device are automatically propagated to the  other devices.  [ 114 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Add the following code to the end of the store's initialize function:  me.localDB.sync me.remoteDB, {   live: true,   retry: true } .on 'change', function  change  {   if  change.direction == "pull" && change.change.docs.length > 0  {     console.log "Change occurred. Synchronizing." ;     me.load  ;   } } .on 'paused', function  info  { } .on 'active', function  info  { } .on 'error', function  err  { } ;  The live attribute enables the live replication mode while retry tells PouchDB not  to error when the connection temporarily fails  such as in the offline mode . The on  clauses are triggered whenever a change occurs or when synchronization pauses,  resumes, or errors out. As we've enabled retry, errors should not occur but we  include it for completeness.  Update PouchDB when changes occur Now, we'll edit the configuration object in our store and add the following code  to ensure that PouchDB is populated when anything changes in the underlying  LocalStorage. First, let's enable autoSync so that we don't have to call sync    manually in the controllers:  Next, let's create an empty listeners block. The rest of the code in this section will  live in this block:  autoSync: true,  listeners: { }  The first event that we'll handle is load, which fires whenever the underlying store  is loaded:  load: function store, records, successful, operation  {   store.localDB.get '1' .then function  doc  {        Add all documents to the store     store.setData doc.items ;   } ; },  [ 115 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   First, we retrieve the document that stores our list. Then, we override LocalStorage  with the items array in this document.  Next, let's create an event handler. An event handler ties actions with logic. For  example, Ext.data.Store has an action named addrecords, which fires whenever  items are added to the store. Let's attach logic to this action now:  addrecords: function store, records  {   var toadd = [];      Get the document from the remote store   store.localDB.get '1' .then function  doc  {     for  var i = 0; i < records.length; ++i  {       if  doc.items.every function e  { return e.id !=           records[i].getData  .id }   {         toadd.push records[i].getData   ;       }     }     if  toadd.length > 0  {       doc.items = doc.items.concat toadd ;       store.localDB.put doc ;     }   } ; },  As before, we start by loading our to-do list document from the local store. Next, we  iterate through the items in this list. If any of the records being added don't already  exist in the list, we append them to the temporary toadd array. If any of the records  are new, we add them to the document and save it; otherwise, we do nothing.  Next, let's handle the removerecords event, which is fired whenever a record is  deleted from the underlying store:  removerecords: function store, records, indices  {   store.localDB.get '1' .then function  doc  {     for  var i = 0; i < records.length; ++i  {       doc.items = doc.items.filter function e  { return e.id !=           records[i].getData  .id; } ;     }     store.localDB.put doc ;   } ; },  Similar to the previous handler, we load the document and iterate through it.  However, this time, we use the filter function to remove all of the referenced  records from the array and then save the document.  [ 116 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Finally, let's handle the updaterecord event, which is fired whenever an existing  record is updated:  updaterecord: function store, record, newIndex, oldIndex,  modifiedFieldNames, modifiedValues  {   if  modifiedFieldNames.length == 0  {        No changes, don't bother updating the list     return;   }   store.localDB.get '1' .then function  doc  {     doc.items = doc.items.map function e  {       if  e.id == record.getData  .id  {         return record.getData  ;       } else {         return e;       }     } ;     store.localDB.put doc ;   } ; }  In this handler, we start by checking whether there's anything to change. If not, we  do nothing. If there are changes to be made, we get the document as before and then  update the items array, replacing any updated items with their new content.  At this point, our store fully supports our PouchDB instances. Let's make a few  changes to our Main controller to wrap this up.  Tweaking how the store is used We made some significant changes to how the store works. Let's adjust our controller  to accommodate these changes. First, remove the calls to sync   and load   from  createTodoItem:  createTodoItem: function button, e, eOpts  {   var store = Ext.getStore 'Item' ;    store.add this.getNewForm  .getValues   ;      this.showListView  ; },  [ 117 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   As our store has enabled both autoLoad and autoSync, these calls are unnecessary.  Next, replace the calls to erase  , load  , and refresh   with a call to remove   in  deleteTodoItem:  deleteTodoItem: function button, e, eOpts  {   var dataview = this.getListDataView  ,     store = dataview.getStore  ,     record = store.findRecord 'id', button.getData   .erase  ;    store.remove record ; },  As the data view is bound to the store, changes to the store are reflected in the data  view automatically. We don't need to call refresh  . Additionally, to trigger our  new store events, we need to delete record from the store directly and not via the  model. This is done using the store.remove   function.  Sharing lists between devices You're done! Now it's time to test your changes. First, on the command line, rebuild  your changes:  $ sencha app build native  Now, open the app in your browser and on your phone. First, notice that both the  instances of the app load the same list. This is because all the data is coming from a  single data source: the Cloudant database that you created in the last chapter.  Second, notice that whenever you create, edit, or delete an item on one device, the  other device updates the same way after a second or two. This is because of the live  replication that you set up earlier. At this point, our to-do app is really online. All  that's left is to start implementing the offline-only features.  Third, after you've synchronized with the online database, put your phone into  airplane mode. Then, make a change in the web browser. Notice how the lists differ  as the phone lacks Internet connectivity. Now, turn off the airplane mode and wait  for a few seconds. The lists reconcile, which is just the behavior that we want.  Before you go any further, be sure to commit your changes.  [ 118 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Adding online-only features In the last section, we connected our app to the Internet. Now, let's start to  implement the online-only features, which we outlined in the previous chapter.  PouchDB gives us some of this for free; namely, synchronization between devices.  However, this assumes that all of the devices are linked to a single, hard-coded user  account. Let's inject some flexibility into this.  First, it should be possible to manage your user account and keep your lists separate  from the lists belonging to other users. Next, it should be possible to share lists  between users for collaboration purposes. As with synchronization, both of these use  cases are online-only so we shouldn't expose them when we're offline.  User account management In a typical app, you need to handle user account management in the app itself.  Most of these tasks—creating an account, changing passwords, deleting the account,  and others—are neither relevant nor interesting in the context of offline-first app  development. Consequently, we're not going to build these features. We'll use  the Cloudant dashboard to manage all of this and focus on the one aspect of user  account management that is very relevant to the offline user experience: signing in.  As signing in isn't something that you can do while offline, it's important that it  should not prevent the user from getting value out of the app. However, once the  user does sign in, we can't just discard any items that they've already created. These  items must be preserved and linked to the new or existing account.  Generating credentials Before we begin, let's create an additional user with read write access to the lists  database. You will use these credentials to sign in using the app. Open the Cloudant  dashboard in your browser and do the following:  1.  Choose the lists database. 2.  Click Permissions. 3.  Click Generate API key. 4.  Save the Password. 5.  Grant this user read and write permissions.  There are now two users with access to the lists database  in addition to the  administrator . Each of these users will own a list, which they can edit independently  from each other.  [ 119 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Expanding the stores Once a user logs in, we should remember their credentials for the next time the app  is loaded. To do this, we'll create another model store pair in Ext JS, which is used  to store credentials in a persistent fashion. Create todo-app app model User.js  and add the following:  Ext.define 'TodoApp.model.User', {   extend: 'Ext.data.Model',   requires: [     'Ext.data.identifier.Uuid',     'Ext.data.proxy.LocalStorage'   ],   config: {     identifier: {       type: 'uuid'     },     fields: [       'id',       'username',       'password'     ],     proxy: {       type: 'localstorage',       id: 'todoapp-users'     }   } } ;  Ext.define 'TodoApp.store.User', {   extend: 'Ext.data.Store',   config: {     model: 'TodoApp.model.User',     autoSync: true,     autoLoad: true   } } ;  [ 120 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  This model stores the current user's username and password in LocalStorage. As the  proper security and authentication mechanisms are out of scope for this book, I've  compromised by storing the password in clear text. For any production app, hash  any passwords you store locally so that they can't be compromised.  Next, let's make the store that exposes this model to the application. Create todo- app app store User.js and add the following:   Pretty simple. Note that we added the autoSync and autoLoad attributes so that we  don't need to worry about calling load   and sync   manually, which will simplify  our code elsewhere.  Creating the sign in view Now, let's create a new sign in view for our app. This is where the user will enter the  username and password that we've generated for them in the Cloudant dashboard.  Create todo-app app view SignIn.js and add the following:  Ext.define 'TodoApp.view.SignIn', {   extend: 'Ext.Panel',   alias: 'widget.todo-sign-in',   requires: [     'Ext.TitleBar',     'Ext.field.Email',     'Ext.field.Password'   ],    config: {     items: [       {         docked: 'top',         xtype: 'titlebar',         title: 'Sign in',         items: {           align: 'left',           text: 'Back',           action: 'back'         },       },       {         xtype: 'formpanel',         scrollable: false,         height: '100%',         items: [           {             xtype: 'emailfield',             name: 'username',             label: 'Username'           },           {             xtype: 'passwordfield',             name: 'password',  [ 121 ]  www.it-ebooks.info               label: 'Password'           },           {             xtype: 'button',             text: 'Sign in',             action: 'submit'           }         ]       }     ]   } } ;  {   align: 'left',   text: 'Sign in',   action: 'signin' }, {   align: 'left',   text: 'Sign out',   action: 'signout',   hidden: true },  You should recognize the view as being similar to the others in our app. It  has a toolbar at the top with a back button and a form with an emailfield,  passwordfield, and submit button. This view is accessed from the list view, so let's  edit todo-app app view List.js now. Change the titlebar items attribute to an  array and add the following to the beginning of this array:  By default, the Sign in button is shown while the Sign out button is hidden. Once  a connection is made, this is swapped. Only one button is visible at a time.  Updating the controller references Now, let's make a variety of changes to our Main controller. Edit todo-app  app controller Main.js and reference the new SignIn view from the views  configuration:  'SignIn',  [ 122 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Now, add the User model and User store to the models and stores configurations,  respectively:  models: [   'User',   'Item' ], stores: [   'User',   'Item' ],  Next, create new selectors in the refs configuration:  signInPanel: {   selector: 'todo-sign-in',   xtype: 'todo-sign-in',   autoCreate: true }, signInForm: 'todo-sign-in formpanel'  'todo-list button[action=signin]': {   tap: 'showSignInView' }, 'todo-list button[action=signout]': {   tap: 'signOut' }, 'todo-sign-in button[action=back]': {   tap: 'goBack' }, 'todo-sign-in button[action=submit]': {   tap: 'signIn' }  The last configuration item that we need to change is the control configuration. Add  the following listeners:  All that's left to do is add controller functions to implement the functions that  we've referenced here. First, let's add a single instance to this controller right after  the config hash:  syncHandler: null,  This variable is very important. It contains a reference to any sync operation in  progress. When we sign out, we'll call cancel   on this variable to end the sync   and reset our databases in a graceful fashion.  [ 123 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Adding the handler functions Immediately after this variable, define an init function for the controller:  init: function   {   var me = this,     store = Ext.getStore 'Item' ,     record = Ext.getStore 'User' .first  ,     data;    store.localDB = new PouchDB 'lists' ;    if  record  {     data = record.getData  ;     store.username = data.username;     me.connect data.username, data.password ;   } },  When your app starts, this function initializes our local PouchDB database and   checks to see if the user credentials are already present. If they are, it connects   to the remote database.  Next, add the showSignInView function:  showSignInView: function   {   this.showView this.getSignInPanel  , 1 ; },  When the Sign in button is clicked, this button shows the appropriate view. Now,  let's wire up the signIn button in this view. Add the following function:  signIn: function   {   var values = this.getSignInForm  .getValues  ;   this.getSignInForm  .down 'passwordfield' .reset  ;   this.connect values.username, values.password ;   this.showListView  ; },  This method retrieves the credentials from the form, resets the passwordfield, and  attempts to connect to the remote database. It then returns to the list view. We'll  implement the connect function in a bit but first, let's wire up the signOut button:  signOut: function   {   this.disconnect  ; },  [ 124 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   This method is very simple. It merely undoes what connect   sets up. Now, let's  implement the final methods in the controller: connect  , disconnect  , and  startSyncing  . First, connect the following:  connect: function username, password  {   var itemStore = Ext.getStore 'Item' ,     userStore = Ext.getStore 'User' ;  This method takes username and password and adds these credentials to userStore   removing any credentials already in the store . It then adds the credentials as instance  variables to itemStore for reference by the methods in that class. Finally, it starts the  sync operation, first calling cancel on an existing sync operation, if necessary.    userStore.removeAll  ;   userStore.add {     username: username,     password: password   } ;    itemStore.username = username;   itemStore.password = password;    if  this.syncHandler  {     this.syncHandler.cancel  ;   } else {     this.startSyncing this ;   } },  Now, let's implement disconnect  :  disconnect: function   {   var itemStore = Ext.getStore 'Item' ,     userStore = Ext.getStore 'User' ;    if  this.syncHandler  {     userStore.removeAll  ;     itemStore.removeAll  ;     itemStore.username = 'nobody';     itemStore.password = null;     this.syncHandler.cancel  ;   } },  [ 125 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   If a sync operation is in progress, it removes all the items from both userStore and  itemStores. This accomplishes two things. First, it prevents the user from being  automatically signed in when the app is refreshed. Second, it ensures that the next  person to use the app will not have access to items belonging to someone else.  Finally, the disconnect   method resets the temporary credentials in itemStore  and cancels the sync operation. Now, let's create the startSyncing   method:  startSyncing: function me  {   var me = this,   store = Ext.getStore 'Item' ;    store.remoteDB = new PouchDB 'https:  ' + store.username + ':' +       store.password + '@djsauble.cloudant.com lists' ;   me.syncHandler = store.localDB.sync store.remoteDB, {     live: true,     retry: true   } .on 'change', function  change  {     if  change.direction == "pull" && change.change.docs.length >         0  {       console.log "Change occurred. Synchronizing." ;       store.load  ;     }   } .on 'paused', function  info  {   } .on 'active', function  info  {   } .on 'error', function  err  {   } ;   me.syncHandler.on 'complete', function  info  {     store.localDB.destroy  .then function   {       store.localDB = new PouchDB 'lists' ;       me.syncHandler = null;       me.getListPanel  .down 'button[action=signin]' .show  ;       me.getListPanel  .down 'button[action=signout]' .hide  ;       if  store.username && store.password  {         me.startSyncing me ;     }   } ; ..} ;   setTimeout function   {     me.getListPanel  .down 'button[action=signin]' .hide  ;     me.getListPanel  .down 'button[action=signout]' .show  ;   }, 50 ; }  [ 126 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The first thing that we do is connect to the remote database using the credentials  provided. Next, we start live syncing while storing a handle to the operation in  syncHandler. Next, we handle the 'complete' event of syncHandler, which allows  us to do a cleanup once the operation is canceled. Finally, we show the signout  button  and hide the signin button  after a brief delay, which gives the page enough  time to render.  Tweaking the item store We're almost done. The last thing that we need to do is make a few changes to our  Item store. As we've moved the store initialization logic to the controller, it's no longer  needed here. Edit todo-app app store Item.js and delete the initialize function.  Finally, we need to ensure that the list document has been created for each user when  they need it. Previously, we assumed its existence but this is no longer something that  we can take for granted. Add the following function to the Item store:  doWithDoc: function func  {   var me = this;    me.localDB.get me.username + '_1', function  error, doc  {     if  error  {          Document doesn't exist yet. Create it.       me.localDB.put {         '_id': me.username + '_1',         'name': 'list',         'owner': me.username,         'items': []       } .then function   {         me.localDB.get me.username + '_1', function  error, doc  {           console.log doc ;           func doc ;         } ;       } ;     } else {       func doc ;     }   } ; }  [ 127 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   This method first attempts to retrieve the document. If this fails, we create a new,  empty document, get it, and then pass it to the provided function as an argument.  If the document already exists, we also pass it as an argument. Now, we can replace  the existing get logic in each of our event handlers with a reference to this function.  In load, addrecords, and removerecords, we have the following line:  store.localDB.get '1' .then function  doc  {  Replace this with the following line:  this.doWithDoc function doc  {  Then, to ensure that the username variable is always set, add an additional instance  variable to the store immediately after the remoteDB and localDB variables:  username: 'nobody',  You're done! Using the credentials that you created earlier, you should be able to log  in to each account, add items, and observe that the items are restricted to that user's  list alone. Additionally, if you add items to the list before signing in, these items are  appended to any existing list once you sign in.  Commit your changes.  Multiple lists Now that we have support for multiple user accounts, we can expand the app to  support multiple lists per user account. This will become important in the next  section when we implement sharing. People want to keep their private and public  lives separate.  Previously, we dealt with a single list; now we're dealing with multiple lists per  account. At a minimum, we'll need a way to see all of the lists associated with our  account and a way to create new lists. Also, we'll need to tweak the existing views  slightly in order to accommodate the expanded workflow.  Unlike the other additions in this chapter, the ability to manage multiple lists should  be available while offline. Thus, we'll need to consider the offline online transition  as we did in the last section.  [ 128 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Refactoring our views In an ideal world, we'd write code perfectly to start with and never have to change  it. Unfortunately, this is not the case. Code is imperfect and changes constantly. To  accommodate this reality, we engage in periodic refactoring. Refactoring is a practice  where you move code around or restructure it to make it easier to modify and extend  in the future.  In our app, we have a lot of views under todo-app app view . Let's break these  into a couple of categories to make them easier to manage. First, switch to the view  directory and create two subdirectories:  $ cd todo-app app view   $ mkdir item  $ mkdir list  Now, move the views related to items and views related to lists into item  and  list , respectively:  $ git mv Edit.js Image.js Location.js Map.js New.js DataItem.js item   $ git mv List.js list   Next, edit the Main controller and change the class references under the views  attribute from relative to absolute paths:  views: [   'SignIn',   'TodoApp.view.list.List',   'TodoApp.view.item.New',   'TodoApp.view.item.Edit',   'TodoApp.view.item.Location',   'TodoApp.view.item.DataItem' ],  Then, open the file for each view and modify the Ext.define   statement to match  these absolute paths.  Implementing new views Now, you're ready to create the new list views with their supporting models and  stores. Start by creating todo-app app view list Lists.js, the view that displays  all of the lists owned by the current user:  Ext.define 'TodoApp.view.list.Lists', {   extend: 'Ext.Panel',   alias: 'widget.todo-lists',  [ 129 ]  www.it-ebooks.info     requires: [     'Ext.TitleBar',     'Ext.dataview.DataView'   ],    config: {     items: [       {         docked: 'top',         xtype: 'titlebar',         title: 'My Lists',         items: [           {             align: 'left',             text: 'Sign in',             action: 'signin'           },           {             align: 'left',             text: 'Sign out',             action: 'signout',             hidden: true           },           {             align: 'right',             text: 'Add',             action: 'new'           }         ]       },       {         xtype: 'dataview',         height: '100%',         useComponents: true,         defaultType: 'todo-list-dataitem',         store: 'List'       }     ]   },    initialize: function   {        Autoload appears to be broken for dataviews  [ 130 ]  www.it-ebooks.info       Ext.getStore 'List' .load  ;      this.callParent  ;   } } ;  This view is very similar to the List view except that it uses a different store and  data item view. Note that we moved the signin signout buttons here as this will  become the view that people see by default when they open the app.  Let's make these changes now. Edit todo-app app view Main.js and change the  item in the card layout from todo-list to todo-lists. Next, edit todo-app app  view List.js and replace the signin signout buttons with a back button:  {   align: 'left',   text: 'Back',   action: 'back' },  Finally, create the new data item for the Lists view. You'll notice that this is very  similar to the data item for the Item view. Create a copy of todo-app app view  item DataItem.js and put it in the list  folder. Now, make the following changes:     Change the Ext.define name to TodoApp.view.list.DataItem    Change alias to widget.todo-list-dataitem     In config, replace the description, edit, and destroy items with the  following code: name: {   flex: 1 }, edit: {   text: 'Edit',   action: 'edit',   margin: '0 7px 0 0' }, destroy: {   text: 'Delete',   action: 'delete' },  [ 131 ]  www.it-ebooks.info      Now, replace the contents of the dataMap object with the following code:  getName: {   setHtml: 'name' }, getEdit: {   setData: '_id' }, getDestroy: {   setData: '_id' }     Delete all of the other functions in the file and replace them with the following:  applyName: function config  {   return Ext.factory config, 'Ext.Label', this.getName   ; }, updateName: function newName, oldName  {   if  newName  {     this.add newName ;   }   if  oldName  {     this.remove oldName ;   } }, applyEdit: function config  {   return Ext.factory config, 'Ext.Button', this.getEdit   ; }, updateEdit: function newButton, oldButton  {   if  newButton  {     this.add newButton ;   }   if  oldButton  {     this.remove oldButton ;   } }, applyDestroy: function config  {   return Ext.factory config, 'Ext.Button', this.getDestroy   ; }, updateDestroy: function newButton, oldButton  {   if  newButton  {     this.add newButton ;   }   if  oldButton  {     this.remove oldButton ;   } }  [ 132 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The last new view that we need is when the user creates a new list. As with the  others, this view is very similar to the existing New view. Duplicate todo-app app  view item New.js and copy it to list , then make the following changes:     Change the Ext.define name to TodoApp.view.list.New    Change alias to widget.todo-list-new    Change title of the title bar to Add list    Change title of the form panel to Name    Replace the value of the items array with the following code:  {   xtype: 'textfield',   name: 'name' }  Creating the backing store With the bones of the new views in place, let's create the new List store, used by the  Lists view that we just created. Open todo-app app store List.js and replace  the contents with the following:  This should look very similar to the Item store. The main difference is that we've  added a load event handler in order to populate the store. Next, let's add a few  instance variables after the configuration block:  Ext.define 'TodoApp.store.List', {   extend: 'Ext.data.Store',   config: {     model: 'TodoApp.model.List',     autoSync: true,     listeners: {       load: 'onLoad',       addrecords: 'onAddRecords',       removerecords: 'onRemoveRecords',       updaterecord: 'onUpdateRecord'     }   }, }  remoteDB: null, localDB: null, username: 'nobody', password: null, currentListId: null,  [ 133 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   These variables point to our PouchDB instances, the current user's credentials, and  current list's ID. Next, let's define a few instance methods, starting with doWithDoc:  doWithDoc: function func  {   var me = this;    me.localDB.get me.currentListId, function  error, doc  {     if  error  {          Document doesn't exist yet. Create it.       me.localDB.put {         '_id': me.currentListId,         'name': 'list',         'owner': me.username,         'items': []       } .then function   {         me.localDB.get me.currentListId, function  error, doc  {           func doc ;         } ;       } ;     } else {       func doc ;     }   } ; },  This method takes the current list ID, creates the list if it doesn't already exist, and  then passes the contents of the list to the specified callback. Next, let's define the  doWithDocs method:  doWithDocs: function func  {   var me = this;      me.localDB.allDocs {     include_docs: true,     attachments: true,     startkey: '_design \uffff',     }, function  error, result  {       func result.rows.filter          function e  {           if  e.doc.owner == me.username  {              return true;           }           if  !e.doc.collaborators  {             return false;  [ 134 ]  www.it-ebooks.info             }           return e.doc.collaborators.some              function c  {               return c == me.username;             }            ;         }        .map function e  {         return e.doc;       }  ;   } ; },  This method is similar but instead takes the contents of all the lists that the current  user owns or collaborates with and passes them to the specified callback. With these  helper methods out of the way, let's implement the event handlers.  First, create the onLoad method:  onLoad: function store, records, successful, operation  {   this.doWithDocs function lists  {     var toadd = [];     for  var i = 0; i < records.length; ++i  {       var data = records[i].getData  ;       if  lists.every function l  { return l._id != data._id }   {         var model = new TodoApp.model.List {           _id: data._id.replace  .*_ , store.username + "_" ,           name: data.name,           owner: store.username,           items: data.items         } ;         toadd.push model ;       }     }     if  toadd.length > 0  {       lists = lists.concat toadd ;     }     store.setData lists ;   } ; },  Whenever the list store is loaded, this method is called and it refreshes the store  based on the contents of our PouchDB database. It is not a destructive method.   If any lists already exist in the store, they are preserved and added to PouchDB.  [ 135 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Next, create the onAddRecords method:  onAddRecords: function store, records  {   this.doWithDocs function lists  {     var toadd = [];     for  var i = 0; i < records.length; ++i  {       if  lists.every function l  { return l._id !=           records[i].getData  ._id }   {         toadd.push records[i].getData   ;         }     }     if  toadd.length > 0  {       lists = lists.concat toadd ;       store.localDB.bulkDocs toadd ;     }   } ; },  Whenever a list is added to the store, this method is responsible for adding it to  PouchDB. The sister method is onRemoveRecords:  onRemoveRecords: function store, records, indices  {   this.doWithDocs function lists  {     for  var i = 0; i < records.length; ++i  {       lists = lists.filter function e  { return e._id ==           records[i].getData  ._id; } ;     }     for  var i = 0; i < lists.length; ++i  {       lists[i]._deleted = true;     }     if  lists.length > 0  {       store.localDB.bulkDocs lists ;     }   } ; },  This method does the opposite. Whenever the lists are removed, this method is  responsible for clearing them from PouchDB.  Finally, let's define the onUpdateRecord method:  onUpdateRecord: function store, record, newIndex, oldIndex,  modifiedFieldNames, modifiedValues  {   if  modifiedFieldNames.length == 0  {        No changes, don't bother updating the list     return;  [ 136 ]  www.it-ebooks.info     }   this.doWithDoc function doc  {     var newDoc = record.getData  ;     newDoc._rev = doc._rev;     store.localDB.put newDoc ;   } ; }  This method handles the case when an existing list is edited. It retrieves the old list  from PouchDB, updates the fields, and saves the changes.  You should notice a lot of similarities with the Item store. The primary difference  is that this store maps documents directly to our remote Cloudant database. As  a result, the Item store no longer needs a load handler and its other handlers are  merely proxy requests to the List store.  Removing sync logic from the item store Edit todo-app app store Item.js and replace its content with the following:  Ext.define 'TodoApp.store.Item', {   extend: 'Ext.data.Store',   config: {     model: 'TodoApp.model.Item',     autoSync: true,     listeners: {       addrecords: 'onAddRecords',       removerecords: 'onRemoveRecords',       updaterecord: 'onUpdateRecord'     }   },   currentListStore: null,   currentListRecord: null,   onAddRecords: function store, records  {     if  store.currentListStore && store.currentListRecord  {       var data = store.currentListRecord.getData  ,       toadd = [];       if  !data.items  {         data.items = [];       }       for  var i = 0; i < records.length; ++i  {         if  data.items.every function e  { return e.id !=             records[i].getData  .id }   {           toadd.push records[i].getData   ;         }  [ 137 ]  www.it-ebooks.info           if  toadd.length > 0  {           data.items = data.items.concat toadd ;           store.currentListRecord.setData data ;           store.currentListRecord.setDirty  ;           store.currentListStore.sync  ;         }     }     }   },   onRemoveRecords: function store, records, indices  {     if  store.currentListStore && store.currentListRecord  {       var data = store.currentListRecord.getData  ;       for  var i = 0; i < records.length; ++i  {         data.items = data.items.filter function e              { return e.id != records[i].getData  .id; } ;       }       store.currentListRecord.setData data ;       store.currentListRecord.setDirty  ;       store.currentListStore.sync  ;     }   },   onUpdateRecord: function store, record, newIndex, oldIndex,       modifiedFieldNames, modifiedValues  {     if  modifiedFieldNames.length == 0  {          No changes, don't bother updating the list       return;     }     if  store.currentListStore && store.currentListRecord  {       var data = store.currentListRecord.getData  ;       data.items = data.items.map function e  {         if  e.id == record.getData  .id  {           return record.getData  ;         } else {           return e;         }       } ;       store.currentListRecord.setData data ;       store.currentListRecord.setDirty  ;       store.currentListStore.sync  ;     }   } } ;  [ 138 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   This store contains all of the items for the currently selected List model. When an  item is added, removed, or updated, we retrieve the parent model and update the  items array.  Giving the list store a model The Item model itself doesn't change at all but we now need a model for the list  store. Create todo-app app model List.js and add the following:  Ext.define 'TodoApp.model.List', {   extend: 'Ext.data.Model',   requires: [     'Ext.data.identifier.Uuid',     'Ext.data.proxy.LocalStorage'   ],   config: {     identifier: {       type: 'uuid'     },     idProperty: '_id',     fields: [       '_id',       '_rev',       'name',       'owner',       'collaborators',       'items'     ],     proxy: {       type: 'localstorage',       id: 'todoapp-lists'     }   } } ;  Adding logic to the controller The last file that we need to change is the Main controller. Open it now and add the  new List model and List store to the relevant arrays. Next, add selectors to the  refs array:  listsPanel: {   selector: 'todo-lists',   xtype: 'todo-lists',  [ 139 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Next, edit the control configuration and change the signin signout handlers to  reflect their move from todo-list to todo-lists:  Add additional handlers for the todo-lists and todo-list-new views:    autoCreate: true }, listsDataView: 'todo-lists dataview', newListPanel: {   selector: 'todo-list-new',   xtype: 'todo-list-new',   autoCreate: true }, newListForm: 'todo-list-new formpanel',  'todo-lists button[action=signin]': {   tap: 'showSignInView' }, 'todo-lists button[action=signout]': {   tap: 'signOut' },  'todo-lists button[action=new]': {   tap: 'showNewListView' }, 'todo-lists button[action=edit]': {   tap: 'editList' }, 'todo-lists button[action=delete]': {   tap: 'deleteList' }, 'todo-list-new button[action=back]': {   tap: 'showListsView' }, 'todo-list-new button[action=create]': {   tap: 'createList', },  Due to the shuffling that we've done, many of the methods that point to the Item  store should now point to the List store. Change this for the init, connect,  disconnect, and startSyncing methods.  Additionally, as the todo-lists view is now the first view that people see, all of  the other views are offset by one. Add one to showView in the following methods:  showNewView  , showEditView  , showListView  , and showLocationView  .  [ 140 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Now, let's implement these new handler functions that we defined in the preceding  control configuration. First, let's write the method responsible for creating a new list:  createList: function button, e, eOpts  {   var store = Ext.getStore 'List' ;    var model = new TodoApp.model.List this.getNewListForm  . getValues   ;   model.setId store.username + '_' + model.getId   ;   model.set 'owner', store.username ;   store.add model ;    this.showListsView  ; },  Next, the method responsible for setting a particular list as the current list  and  updating the Item store appropriately  is as follows:  editList: function button, e, eOpts  {   var listStore = Ext.getStore 'List' ,   record = listStore.findRecord '_id', button.getData   ,   items = record.getData  .items,   listPanel = this.getListPanel  ,   listDataView = this.getListDataView  ,   itemStore = Ext.getStore 'Item' ;    listStore.currentListId = button.getData  ;   itemStore.currentListStore = listStore;   itemStore.currentListRecord = record;   itemStore.removeAll  ;   if  items  {     itemStore.add items ;   }    listPanel.down 'titlebar' .setTitle record.get 'name'  ;   this.showListView  ; },  Next, the method that deletes an existing list is as follows:  deleteTodoItem: function button, e, eOpts  {   var dataview = this.getListDataView  ,   store = dataview.getStore  ,   record = store.findRecord 'id', button.getData   .erase  ;    store.remove record ; },  [ 141 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Next, here is the method that shows the Lists view:  showListsView: function   {   this.showView this.getListsPanel  , 0 ; },  Finally, the method that shows the New view to create a new list is as follows:  showNewListView: function   {   var newListPanel = this.getNewListPanel  ,   newListForm = this.getNewListForm  ;       Reset the new panel   newListForm.reset  ;    this.showView newListPanel, 1 ; },  We're almost done. As we moved sign in to the Lists view, we should return to this  view after signing in. Edit the signIn   method and change this.showListView    to this.showListsView  .  You're done! Commit your changes and then start the server and try signing in to  the accounts that you created earlier. It should just work. Note that if you create lists  without being signed in, these lists will automatically migrate to the first account that  you sign in to. Pretty neat, huh?  Sharing lists At this point, we have a bunch of different user accounts floating around, each with  a number of lists tied to the account. However, they're all isolated from one another.  We should fix this in such a way that people who want to share lists can do so. This  implies that we need a way for people to choose a list and decide who to share it with.  Creating share views Let's start by creating a new folder under todo-app app view  named  collaborator . We'll put the views associated with sharing in this folder. As these  views are very similar to the existing views, we'll just duplicate the existing views  and make some minor modifications.  [ 142 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   First, create a copy of todo-app app view item DataItem.js and put it in the  collaborator  folder. Now, make the following changes:     Change the Ext.define name to TodoApp.view.collaborator.DataItem    Change alias to widget.todo-collaborator-dataitem     In config, replace the description, edit, and destroy items with the  following code: name: {   flex: 1 }, unshare: {   text: 'Unshare',   action: 'delete' },     Now, replace the contents of the dataMap object with the following code:  getName: {   setHtml: 'id' }, getUnshare: {   setData: 'id' }     Delete all of the other functions in the file and replace them with the following:  applyName: function config  {   return Ext.factory config, 'Ext.Label', this.getName   ; }, updateName: function newName, oldName  {   if  newName  {     this.add newName ;   }   if  oldName  {     this.remove oldName ;   } }, applyUnshare: function config  {   return Ext.factory config, 'Ext.Button',       this.getUnshare   ; }, updateUnshare: function newButton, oldButton  {   if  newButton  {     this.add newButton ;   }  [ 143 ]  www.it-ebooks.info     if  oldButton  {     this.remove oldButton ;  } }  Now, make a copy of todo-app app view list List.js, move it to the  collaborator  folder, and make the following changes:     Change the Ext.define name to TodoApp.view.collaborator.List    Change alias to widget.todo-collaborator-list    Change title of the title bar to Users    Change action of the Add button to add    Change defaultType of the data view to todo-collaborator-dataitem    Change store of the data view to Collaborator  Finally, duplicate todo-app app view list New.js, copy it to collaborator ,  and make the following changes:     Change the Ext.define name to TodoApp.view.collaborator.New    Change alias to widget.todo-collaborator-new    Change name of the create button to Share    Change action of the create button to share    Change title of the title bar to Add user    Change title of the form panel to Name    Change name of the text field to name  Modifying the existing views With these new views in place, let's turn our attention to a few of the existing views.  They need some modifications in order to work with these new views. First, edit  todo-app app view list DataItem.js and make the following changes:     Add the following code under the name object in config:  share: {   text: 'Share',   action: 'share',   margin: '0 7px 0 0' },  [ 144 ]  www.it-ebooks.info      Add the following code under getShare in the dataMap object:  getShare: {   setData: '_id' },     Finally, add the following two functions to the component:  applyShare: function config  {   return Ext.factory config, 'Ext.Button', this.getShare   ; }, updateShare: function newButton, oldButton  {   if  newButton  {     this.add newButton ;   }   if  oldButton  {     this.remove oldButton ;   } },  Adding a model Now, we need a new model and store to handle local persistence of the data backing  these new views. A model is the M part of Model View Controller  MVC . It defines  the data attributes and describes where this data is stored. First, create todo-app  app model Collaborator.js and add the following:  Ext.define 'TodoApp.model.Collaborator', {   extend: 'Ext.data.Model',   requires: [     'Ext.data.identifier.Uuid',     'Ext.data.proxy.LocalStorage'   ],   config: {     identifier: {       type: 'uuid'     },     fields: [       'id'     ],     proxy: {       type: 'localstorage',       id: 'todoapp-shares'     }   } } ;  [ 145 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Adding a store Let's make the store for this model. Create todo-app app store Collaborator.js  and add the following:  Ext.define 'TodoApp.store.Collaborator', {   extend: 'Ext.data.Store',   config: {     model: 'TodoApp.model.Collaborator',     autoSync: true,     listeners: {       addrecords: 'onAddRecords',       removerecords: 'onRemoveRecords',       updaterecord: 'onUpdateRecord'     }   },   currentListStore: null,   currentListRecord: null,   onAddRecords: function store, records  {     if  store.currentListStore && store.currentListRecord  {       var data = store.currentListRecord.getData  ,       toadd = [];       if  !data.collaborators  {         data.collaborators = [];       }       for  var i = 0; i < records.length; ++i  {         if  data.collaborators.every function id  { return id !=             records[i].getData  .id }   {           toadd.push records[i].getData  .id ;         }         if  toadd.length > 0  {           data.collaborators =               data.collaborators.concat toadd ;           store.currentListRecord.setData data ;           store.currentListRecord.setDirty  ;           store.currentListStore.sync  ;         }       }     }   },   onRemoveRecords: function store, records, indices  {     if  store.currentListStore && store.currentListRecord  {       var data = store.currentListRecord.getData  ;       for  var i = 0; i < records.length; ++i  {  [ 146 ]  www.it-ebooks.info           data.collaborators = data.collaborators.filter             function id                { return id != records[i].getData  .id; } ;       }       store.currentListRecord.setData data ;       store.currentListRecord.setDirty  ;       store.currentListStore.sync  ;     }   },   onUpdateRecord: function store, record, newIndex, oldIndex,        modifiedFieldNames, modifiedValues  {     if  modifiedFieldNames.length == 0  {          No changes, don't bother updating the list       return;     }     if  store.currentListStore && store.currentListRecord  {       var data = store.currentListRecord.getData  ;       data.collaborators = data.items.map function id  {         if  id == record.getData  .id  {           return record.getData  .id;         } else {           return id;         }       } ;       store.currentListRecord.setData data ;       store.currentListRecord.setDirty  ;       store.currentListStore.sync  ;     }   } } ;  Modifying the list store Finally, we need to make a few changes to our list store. Previously, we were able   to load just the documents associated with the current user. Now, we need to load   all the lists and filter out all the lists for which the current user is neither the owner  or a collaborator.  Edit todo-app app store List.js and replace the doWithDocs function with the  following:  doWithDocs: function func  {   var me = this;      me.localDB.allDocs {  [ 147 ]  www.it-ebooks.info       include_docs: true,     attachments: true,     startkey: '_design \uffff',   }, function  error, result  {     func result.rows.filter        function e  {         if  e.doc.owner == me.username  {           return true;         }         if  !e.doc.collaborators  {           return false;         }         return e.doc.collaborators.some            function c  {             return c == me.username;           }          ;       }      .map function e  {       return e.doc;     }  ;   } ; },  Adding logic to the controller We're almost done. The last thing to do is wiring up the behavior in our Main controller.  Edit todo-app app controller Main.js and make the following changes:     Add references for our new views to the views configuration:  'TodoApp.view.collaborator.List',  'TodoApp.view.collaborator.New',  'TodoApp.view.collaborator.DataItem'     Add a reference to the collaborator model and store to the models and   stores configurations, respectively.     Add references for the panels and forms to the refs configuration:  collaboratorsPanel: {   selector: 'todo-collaborator-list',   xtype: 'todo-collaborator-list',   autoCreate: true }, collaboratorsDataView: 'todo-collaborator-list dataview',  [ 148 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   newCollaboratorPanel: {   selector: 'todo-collaborator-new',   xtype: 'todo-collaborator-new',   autoCreate: true }, newCollaboratorForm: 'todo-collaborator-new formpanel',     Add handlers to the control configuration:  'todo-lists button[action=share]': {   tap: 'shareList', }, 'todo-collaborator-list button[action=back]': {   tap: 'goBack' }, 'todo-collaborator-list button[action=add]': {   tap: 'showNewCollaboratorView' }, 'todo-collaborator-list button[action=delete]': {   tap: 'deleteCollaborator' }, 'todo-collaborator-new button[action=back]': {   tap: 'goback' }, 'todo-collaborator-new button[action=share]': {   tap: 'createCollaborator' },     Add a new function to initialize the collaborator list. To do this, copy the   editList function and make the following changes:  1.  Change the name of the function to editList. 2.  Set the items variable to record.getData  .collaborators. 3.  Set the listPanel variable to this.getCollaboratorsPanel  . 4.  Set the listDataView variable to this.  getCollaboratorsDataView  .  5.  Set the itemStore variable to Ext.getStore 'Collaborator' .  [ 149 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   6.  Finally, because we need to transform the list of collaborators to a list  of objects, set the argument of itemStore.add to the following code: collaborators.map    function c  {     return {id: c}   }    7.  Add another function that creates a new collaborator based on the   values in the related form: createCollaborator: function button, e, eOpts  {   var store = Ext.getStore 'Collaborator' ;    store.add this.getNewCollaboratorForm  .getValues   ;    this.showCollaboratorsView  ; },  8.  Now, create a function to delete the collaborators, as needed:  deleteCollaborator: function button, e, eOpts  {   var dataview = this.getCollaboratorsDataView  ,   store = dataview.getStore  ,   record = store.findRecord 'id',       button.getData   .erase  ;    store.remove record ; },  9.  Finally, we need two trivial functions that show the collaborator list   and new collaborator views: showCollaboratorsView: function   {   this.showView this.getCollaboratorsPanel  , 1 ; }, showNewCollaboratorView: function   {   this.showView this.getNewCollaboratorPanel  , 2 ; },  [ 150 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   At this point, start the application, choose a list, and share it with a collaborator. Use  one of the other credentials that you created as the username. When you log in as  this user, you should be able to view and edit the list that was shared with you as  well as add additional collaborators:  Sharing with collaborators  There are a lot of rough edges here but we've taken our previous offline app and put  it online in a way that Just Works. We'll continue to refine this experience in the next  few chapters.  [ 151 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Comparing and contrasting with the  design principles We added a lot of new features in this chapter. Syncing lists with an online database,  support for user accounts, multiple lists per user, and sharing lists between user  accounts. Let's put our phone into airplane mode and do another quick evaluation  against the principles with the same pass fail scoring as before. Give me uninterrupted access to the content I care about.  This is a pass. Besides maps, the entire app works as expected while offline. Thanks  to PouchDB, even when we can't talk to the online database, our offline database  works just fine. Content is mutable. Don't let my online offline status change that.  This is a pass. The content in our app is perfectly mutable; again, thanks to PouchDB. Error messages should not leave me guessing or unnecessarily worried.  This is a fail. Even though we're not supporting offline maps in our app, we should  provide a better error message. Additionally, there are a bunch of errors that only  appear in the developer console and not in the app itself, so sometimes it appears  that nothing happened when in reality, we just ran into an error. We'll improve   error messaging soon. Don't let me start something I can't finish.  This is a pass. You can still save changes to the to-do items while offline. An app should never contradict itself. If a conflict exists, be honest about it.  This is a pass. However, when conflicts do exist, we should show an error message  and let you resolve the problem. That's not something that we do right now. When the laws of physics prevail, choose breadth over depth when caching.  This is a fail. Caching is still pretty dumb. By default, PouchDB caches everything,  which works for now, but it isn't scalable. Empty states should tell me what to do next in a delightful way.  This is a fail. We still don't provide much guidance when you're filling out a to-do  item for the first time. Let's address this in the next chapter. Don't make me remember what I was doing last. Remember for me.  [ 152 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   This is fail. We haven't yet provided a way to keep the context sticky. We'll address  this problem soon. Degrade gracefully as the network degrades. Don't be jarring.  This is a fail. When the network goes offline, we're completely silent about it. This  isn't jarring right away but we aren't setting clear expectations either. Never purge the cache unless I demand it.  This is a pass. When you sign out, we purge the cache for you.  Where does it need to improve? Thanks to PouchDB, we improved from 3 10 to 5 10 in this round, even with the  added complexity of being online. As we continue to refine the experience, we can  only improve. Most of the current low-hanging fruit is around messaging, which  we'll address soon.  Summary In this chapter, we put our app online. Thanks to PouchDB, we didn't have to  sacrifice any of our offline resiliency and got a lot of nice online functionality for not  too much extra effort. If you don't have a user account, you can still get value from  the app, and if you do have an account, your lists will stay backed up and can be  easily shared with others.  In the next chapter, we'll make the app more communicative about errors and   set better expectations when switching between the online and offline modes.   This will build trust and help the users to not wonder what's going on during   the synchronization process.  [ 153 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   www.it-ebooks.info   Be Honest about   What's Happening  In the last chapter, we put our fledgling app online. Currently, it's a bit tone-deaf.  We don't communicate anything that's happening under the hood so there's a lot of  is it working? I really hope it's working. We also don't attempt to compensate for bad  network connectivity. In this chapter, we'll address both of these concerns.  A lot of what differentiates a bad offline experience from a good offline experience is  the way an app communicates with people. With two functionally-equivalent apps,  the one that comes across as most transparent and honest will win every time. This  is particularly important in a first impression scenario. Over time, you may learn to  accommodate an app's quirks and foibles, but if people don't stick around after their  first bad experience, you've lost.  Fortunately, PouchDB gives us a lot of information about what's happening.  We've ignored these events thus far, but in this chapter, we'll be able to pass this  information on to people in an unobtrusive way, adding a layer of trust that's  currently missing.  Exposing the system state to the user The first step towards being transparent is to tell people about what's going on in  the background. We know when synchronization starts, pauses, and ends. Let's  put this data to good use by creating an indicator that shows the current status of  synchronization. When errors occur, let's show them too.  [ 155 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Creating an online offline indicator Let's override these PouchDB events that we've ignored up until now. When we  enabled live synchronization, we set up a bunch of empty handlers that listen for  different synchronization events. The first thing that we should do is modify our  views in order to show off this data regardless of where the user is in the app.  Adding a global toolbar First, we need a toolbar that is always visible. This toolbar can't be tied to any  individual view, so we'll attach it to the Main view instead. To do this, edit todo- app app view Main.js and replace the contents of config with the following code:  layout: 'vbox', items: [   {     xtype: 'panel',     layout: 'card',     itemId: 'todo-main-panel',     items: { xtype: 'todo-lists' },     flex: 1   },   {     xtype: 'toolbar',     docked: 'bottom'   } ]  This nests the card view in panel with toolbar docked to the bottom of this panel.  We'll display any global messages here.  Next, edit the Main controller and change refs accordingly. Delete the mainPanel  ref and add the following instead:  main: 'todo-main', mainPanel: 'todo-main-panel',  [ 156 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Adding indicator logic With the view in place, we need to wire up the controller to display messages in  the toolbar. The first thing that we'll implement is a basic message that tells us  whether the app is online or offline. In the startSyncing method, edit the call to  store.localDB.sync  . Immediately after the live and retry attributes, add the  following code:  back_off_function: function  delay  {   me.online = false;   me.setIndicator "offline :- " ;   return 1000; }  Whenever the app goes offline, this method will trigger once every second, setting  me.online to false. This variable will be used elsewhere in the controller to indicate  whether the app is currently online or not. This method also displays a message in  the global toolbar to this effect.  If this is where me.online is set to false, we obviously need to set it to true  elsewhere; otherwise, the app will never show as being online. In the .on 'paused'   clause, add the following code:  me.online = true; me.setIndicator "online :- " ;  Now, after each sync operation  or when the app is first loaded , we'll set the variable  to true and display a message indicating that the app is online and operating normally.  Finally, let's create the setIndicator method and define the online variable. Add  the following code after the startSyncing method:  online: null, message: null, setIndicator: function message  {   var me = this;    if  me.message != message  {     me.getMain  .down 'toolbar[docked=bottom]' .setTitle message ;     me.message = message;   } }  [ 157 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   This is all pretty straightforward. After we display the message, we set the me.message  variable to the current message. As our back_off_function method is called each  second while the app is offline, this avoids redundant component queries.  Commit your changes and then start your web app. Once the app is loaded and  you've signed in, you should see a screen similar to the following:  Displaying error messages In addition to the event handlers, we have a catch-all method for any errors that  take place. Right now, we just dump this to the browser log but this isn't normally  something that people see. Instead, we can modify the status indicator in the last  section to display these errors when they occur but in an unobtrusive way.  Online app  [ 158 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Building trust through up front  communication There are two forms of communication: passive communication, which is  making people aware of what's going on and active communication, which  means responding to events in a clear, proactive way. We made use of passive  communication in the first section. Our online offline indicator is always present,  letting us know when we're online or offline. However, when people click save or  the lists  re load, there's no feedback from the app. We can do better.  The easiest way to address this is to add a spinner and or message when people  add a new list, collaborator, or item. As each of these actions involves a round-trip  to Cloudant, a reasonably expensive and  comparatively speaking  slow event, we  should let people know that this is happening and when it finishes successfully    or fails .  This is actually trivial to do using our existing framework. Simply add the following  code to the .on 'active'  clause of the store.localDB.sync   and call in the  startSyncing method:  me.setIndicator "Syncing…" ;  That's it! Now, whenever you make a change, the app displays a syncing indicator  until the operation is complete  at which point, it will revert to the online message .  Predicting the future Up until now, we've assumed a uniform view of the world. Internet connection,  when present, is always strong and reliable. If the app is online, we assume that it  can synchronize with little or no trouble. Obviously, this is not always the case. The  first step to embracing this is to make the app aware of dead zones in the real world.  When a phone goes from good Internet connectivity to bad or no Internet connectivity,  make a note of this for future reference. When the phone nears this location again, use  passive communication to warn people of impending network troubles.  [ 159 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Writing a predictive algorithm We'll use location services for this. Our algorithm works as follows:  Is our location accurate within 50 meters? If not, exit.        Are there any points in our database? If not, save the current position  and   online offline state  and exit.     Are we more than ten meters away from the closest point in our database? If   so, save the current position and online state.     Are we within ten meters of the closest point in our database? If so, update   the online state of this point.     Do we have a velocity over one meter per second? If not, exit.    Calculate where people will be in ten seconds based on their current velocity.   If the closest point to this location is offline, post a warning.  Let's implement this step by step. First, edit the Main controller and add a method  named predictBandwidth under the init method:  predictBandwidth: function   {   var me = this;   me.geo = Ext.create 'Ext.util.Geolocation', {     listeners: {       locationupdate: function geo  {       }     }   } },  This method creates a Geolocation instance, which triggers the locationupdate  event every few seconds with the user's current position. As this is done only once,  let's add a reference to the method at the end of our init   method when the  application starts:  me.predictBandwidth  ;  Now, define the geo variable, next to the syncHandler variable that we defined in  the last chapter:  geo: null,  Finally, let's switch back to the predictBandwidth method and flesh out the  algorithm. Put each of the following code snippets into the locationupdate   event handler in the given order.  [ 160 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Is the location accurate enough? The first step is to ensure that our location is accurate enough. For our purpose, we  want to have an accuracy within 50 meters with 90% confidence:  if  !geo._accuracy  geo._accuracy > 50    return;  We choose 50 meters for a few reasons. Our algorithm creates a map of points,  showing whether there's online offline connectivity at each point. Wi-Fi is  commonly understood to have a 46-meter range while indoors, so our 50-meter  threshold accounts for this.  Creating a seed location Initially, our database is empty. As our algorithm expects at least one point for this to  work, we need to populate it in case none exist:  var store = Ext.getStore 'Position' ; if  !store.getCount    {   store.add {     latitude: geo._latitude,     longitude: geo._longitude,     offline: me.offline   } ;   return; }  You'll notice that we use a store called Position. This store does not exist yet. We'll  do this in a bit.  Adding additional points At this point, we have at least one point in our database. The next step is to add  additional points, given that they are at least ten meters apart:  var records = store.getData  .all,   closest = null,   closestDistance = null; records.forEach function e  {   var distance = Math.sqrt Math.pow  e.data.latitude -       geo._latitude , 2  + Math.pow  e.data.longitude -         geo._longitude , 2  ;   if  !closest  distance < closestDistance  {     closest = e.data;     closestDistance = distance;  [ 161 ]  www.it-ebooks.info       return;   } } ; if  closestDistance > 10  {   store.add {     latitude: geo._longitude,     longitude: geo._latitude,     offline: me.offline   } ; }  One obvious question is how much space this will take. Over time, the store will  grow, without bounds. Though we could add some kind of purge algorithm, how  much space are we talking about here?  Each point consists of two 8-byte floats and a 4-byte Boolean. Thus, each time a point  is added to the store, it grows by 20 bytes. For 20 megabytes  one million points   with points separated ten meters apart in a rectangular layout, this is enough to  cover an area of 10,000 square meters  247 acres .  Additionally, consider the rate at which new points are created. In a worst-case  scenario  when driving along a road, for example , new points are created each time  the locationupdate event handler is called, once every three seconds. Creating one  million points at this rate would take 35 days of continuous use of the app.  There's much we could do to optimize this, but for our purposes, this is good  enough. I'll list some of the ways you could further improve this if you're interested  in developing this algorithm further.  Updating the existing points So, if we create new points when we're further than 10 meters away from the   closest existing point, what about when we're less than 10 meters away? As the  online offline status is not static, let's update the closest point with our current  online offline state:  if  closestDistance < 10 && closest.online != me.online  {   var record = store.findRecord 'id', closest.id ;   record.set 'online', me.online ;   store.sync  ; }  [ 162 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Note that the points themselves remain fixed. They don't drift in space. This is to  prevent the map from being skewed. For example, if I have ten points in a line  that are ten meters apart, I could conceivably drag them away from their origin by  updating them in this way.  Ensuring that the velocity is significant enough This is the final check before we project whether people will go offline soon. As GPS  coordinates tend to drift, we'll minimize false positives by requiring people to be  moving at one meter per second or greater in order to trigger the warning. This is a  casual walking pace.  if  !geo._speed  geo._speed < 1    return;  Predicting future connectivity Now, we can detect where people will be in ten seconds. If they're using the app, this  will give them enough time to pause and finish what they're doing before they go  out of range.     Determine where user will be in 10 seconds var R = 6367444.7,    Earth's radius in meters   distance = geo._speed * 10,    Current velocity times 10  seconds    dx = distance *  Math.sin geo._heading * Math.PI   180  ,   dy = distance *  -Math.cos geo._heading * Math.PI   180  ,   dlng = dx    R * Math.cos geo._latitude  ,   dlat = dy   R   newLng = geo._longitude + dlng,  newLat = geo._latitude + dlat;     What is the closest point to that location?  nearest neighbor     search  closest = null; closestDistance = null; records.forEach function e  {   var distance = Math.sqrt Math.pow  e.data.latitude - newLat , 2        + Math.pow  e.data.longitude - newLng , 2  ;   if  !closest  distance < closestDistance  {     closest = e.data;     closestDistance = distance;     return;   }  [ 163 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   } ;     Was the closest point offline? Post a warning… if  !closest.online  {   this.setIndicator "Going offline soon. :- " ; }  There are three stages here. First, we calculate their future latitude and longitude  based on their current position, velocity, and the radius of the Earth. Second, we  check our database to see which point is closest to this future location. Third, if this  closest point is offline, we warn people that they risk losing connectivity.  Setting our online offline state You may have noticed a couple of references to me.online. We need to set this  variable to let the algorithm know our online offline state. Edit the Main controller  and make the following changes to the startSyncing method.  First, set this variable to false whenever the back_off_function handler is called.  Add the following code to this handler:  Next, set this variable to true whenever the synchronization is completed successfully.  Add the following code to the paused clause of the localDB.sync   call:  Finally, define the variable on the Main controller itself. Add the following code  immediately after the syncStarted variable definition:  me.online = false;  me.online = true;  online: null,  Creating the position store The last thing that we need to do is create a store for our location data. Create a new  file named todo-app app store Position.js and add the following:  Ext.define 'TodoApp.store.Position', {   extend: 'Ext.data.Store',   config: {     model: 'TodoApp.model.Position',     autoSync: true,     autoLoad: true   } } ;  [ 164 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Now, let's create the corresponding model for this store. Create todo-app app  model Position.js and add the following:  Ext.define 'TodoApp.model.Position', {   extend: 'Ext.data.Model',   requires: [     'Ext.data.identifier.Uuid',     'Ext.data.proxy.LocalStorage'   ],   config: {     identifier: {       type: 'uuid'     },     fields: [       'id',       'latitude',       'longitude',       'online'     ],     proxy: {       type: 'localstorage',       id: 'todoapp-positions'     }   } } ;  Last, edit the Main controller and add references to these new classes to the models  and stores arrays. You're done! The unique thing about this store is that it's not  synced to the cloud. One reason is that different devices have different capabilities  to go online. Your phone has Wi-Fi and a cellular network, whereas your laptop  probably only has Wi-Fi. Thus, it doesn't make sense to share.  The downside is that if you switch phones or laptops, you have to rebuild the  database from scratch. That's not an awesome experience. In the future, we could  modify the algorithm to record other details with each location, such as the device  that was online and its capabilities. This is outside of the scope of this book.  Commit your changes and start your app. Walk around for a bit to gather location  data. Notice how the app learns and warns you when you're about to go out of range.  [ 165 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Letting users provide direction Sometimes, we can't handle these scenarios automatically. We need to capture  people's attention and ask them for input. This should be done sparingly and only  after we've made a reasonable attempt to handle flaky network conditions ourselves.  Letting the users know when encountering  turbulence For the purposes of this book, we'll define turbulence as any situation where   people are actively writing new information to the app and we haven't been   able to successfully persist this for the past 30 seconds.  In this scenario, we should bump our notification from passive to active and let people  know that we've tried and failed to save their changes. Still, we should keep these  notifications unobtrusive and not interrupt anything that they're currently doing.  The simplest way to do this is to display updates at regular intervals in order to  keep the user apprised of the current state of any synchronization operation. We'll  provide updates at 10 seconds, 30 seconds, 1 minute, and 10 minutes. Similar to  the predictBandwidth method, we'll create a function that checks the state of the  synchronization at regular intervals and updates our global messaging accordingly.  Displaying messages at regular intervals Edit the Main controller and create a new method named checkForTurbulence. Put  the following code in this method:  checkForTurbulence: function   {   var me = this;    return setInterval function   {        Are we online and syncing?     if  !me.online  !me.syncStarted          me.message.indexOf 'offline soon'  !== -1        return;      var duration =  new Date   .getTime   - me.syncStarted;     if  duration > 10 * 60 * 1000  {       me.setIndicator "Are you on GPRS?" ;     }     else if  duration > 60 * 1000  {       me.setIndicator "Find faster Internet?" ;     }  [ 166 ]  www.it-ebooks.info       else if  duration > 30 * 1000  {       me.setIndicator "Still working…" ;     }     else if  duration > 10 * 1000 &&         me.oneTimeMessage === false  {       me.setIndicator "Please be patient…" ;     }   }, 1000 ; },  First, this method uses setInterval to check every second whether the app is online  and syncing. If so, it calculates the duration since the sync operation started and  displays an appropriate message.  Now, at the end of the init method, add a reference to this method to initialize it:  me.checkForTurbulence  ;  Creating a timestamp when the sync starts The entire algorithm hinges on when the sync operation started. Let's update the  syncStarted variable whenever a sync operation starts. First, add the variable  definition immediately before the startSyncing method:  syncStarted: null,  Now, edit the startSyncing method and set this variable to the current time when a  sync operation starts. Add the following code to the active clause:  me.syncStarted =  new Date   .getTime  ;  Finally, when the sync operation is complete, you'll need to reset this variable. Add  the following code to the active clause:  me.syncStarted = null;  That's it. Commit your changes. If you're using Chrome's device mode, set the  network speed to GPRS or regular 2G. Now do something bandwidth-expensive,  such as attaching an image to a to-do item. After the sync operation starts, note the  messages that appear as the sync continues.  [ 167 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Getting user guidance If we haven't managed to save anything for 30 minutes, we'll interrupt people briefly  to tell them this. Alternatively, you could give people options such as don't remind me  again if they know they'll have Internet connectivity eventually and don't want to be  bothered or remind me in 30 minutes if they want to remain apprised of the situation.  Note that these options are possibly overkill for a simple to-do app. In a   mission-critical app, with heavy, ongoing communication by multiple users,   you'll want to take a more prominent role in re-establishing communication.   For our to-do app, this kind of active solicitation is unnecessary so we'll just   display a simple modal.  Adding modal to the app Edit the checkForTurbulence method and add the following condition at the top of  the if tree:  if  duration > 30 * 60 * 1000 && me.oneTimeMessage === false  {   Ext.Msg.show {     title: "Fasten your seatbelt",     message: "We've been trying to sync for 30 minutes, but no         dice. Your data is safe, but you'll want to connect to         better Internet eventually.",     buttons: Ext.MessageBox.OK   } ;   me.oneTimeMessage = true; }  Unlike the other if statements, this one displays a modal with an OK button to  dismiss it. We only want to display this message once per sync operation, so there's  a oneTimeMessage variable to ensure this. Let's initialize this variable immediately  before the checkForTurbulence method:  oneTimeMessage: false,  Showing the modal once per sync As with the syncStarted variable, we need to reset the oneTimeMessage variable  every time a sync operation is complete. Add the following code to the paused clause  in the startSyncing method:  me.oneTimeMessage = false;  [ 168 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Other approaches are to show this modal once per session, once per user account, or  provide a way for people to turn it off if they don't want to be reminded. The correct  approach depends on the importance of being online. For a to-do app, a modal  probably isn't necessary at all; while for online multiplayer games, you probably want  to nag people more heavily or disable functionality until the connection is restored.  30 minute warning  Staying functional in bad network  conditions Beyond good, two-way communication with people, there are algorithmic things  that we can do to compensate for bad Internet connectivity. This boils down to  prioritization. In any nontrivial app, there is a large amount of data that we can  cache. However, when network bandwidth is limited, we need to decide which   data is most important and send this first.  [ 169 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   In our to-do app, there are three types of data: images, maps, and text. Of these, text  is low-bandwidth, maps are medium-bandwidth, and images are high-bandwidth. In  addition, text is the highest priority and maps and images are the lowest priorities.  Thus, we should transmit text first. As maps and images are of equal priority but  images are substantially larger, we should transmit maps second and images third.  That's the relative priority of each format, but how do we decide which lists items   to cache?  One approach is to keep track of the most commonly viewed lists and cache these  first. Another approach is to determine which list is currently being viewed and  cache all of the items in this list before any other. A third approach is to cache each  data format successively in the order mentioned. These approaches are not mutually  exclusive so we'll implement all of them.  First, we'll need to change the way that data is structured in our Cloudant database  in order to allow for data retrieval that is as granular as possible. To do this, we'll  split our current lists database into four: one for the list metadata, one for the text,  one for the map coordinates, and one for the images. In the app itself, we'll sync   with each of these databases independently. We could get as granular as the  following diagram:  Order of synchronization  [ 170 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   However, for simplicity, we won't differentiate between different types of lists, only  the types of data stored in each list: Metadata, Text, Maps, and Images. Figuring out  how to prioritize the data retrieval by different types of lists is left as an exercise for  the reader.  This is how each document is structured. The metadata documents are named with  the ID of the list and consist of the following fields:     The list name    The owner    The collaborators    Last viewed     The item ID    The description     The item ID    The latitude    The longitude     The item ID    Media  The text documents are named with the ID of the list, followed by their own ID, and  consist of the following fields:  The map documents are named with the ID of the associated text document,  followed by their own ID, and consist of the following fields:  The image documents are named with the ID of the associated text document,  followed by their own ID, and consist of the following fields:  [ 171 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The relationship between these documents looks as follows:  Document synchronization priority  Creating new databases and users Open your Cloudant dashboard and create four new databases: metadata, text,  maps, and images. Take the API users that you created for the lists database and  share each of the other databases with them, granting permissions to the reader,  writer, and replicator.  The metadata database is what ties everything together. Currently, the app   live-syncs with the lists database. Changes are downloaded automatically.  However, as we now have five databases with different priority levels, we don't  want them to sync willy-nilly. Now, only the metadata database will live-sync and  trigger synchronization of the other databases manually  and in the correct order ,  depending on what needs updating.  Refactoring the Main controller Now, it's time to implement the code that talks to these new databases. First,   because our synchronization code has grown quite large, let's refactor it into   its own controller. Create todo-app app controller Sync.js and put in the  following code:  Ext.define 'TodoApp.controller.Sync', {   extend: 'Ext.app.Controller',  [ 172 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   This controller needs access to some of the views, models, and stores from our  Main controller. We'll add these to the config object. First, add the following views:  views: [   'TodoApp.view.SignIn' ],  Next, add a few models:    config: {   } }  models: [   'Item',   'List',   'User',   'Position' ],  stores: [   'Item',   'List',   'User',   'Position' ],  Finally, add the stores for these models:  Similarly, this controller needs access to some of refs and events used by the Main  controller. Add these to the config object as well:  refs: {   main: 'todo-main',   listsPanel: {     selector: 'todo-lists',     xtype: 'todo-lists',     autoCreate: true   },   signInForm: 'todo-sign-in formpanel' },  Now, add a couple of events to handle the sign in sign out actions:  control: {   'todo-lists button[action=signout]': {     tap: 'signOut'  [ 173 ]  www.it-ebooks.info     },   'todo-sign-in button[action=submit]': {     tap: 'signIn'   } }  This is it for the config object. Let's pause and do a little cleanup in the Main  controller, removing references that are no longer needed by the controller. In the  models and stores configurations, remove the references to Item. In the control  configuration, remove the references to 'todo-lists button[action=signout]'  and 'todo-sign-in button[action=submit]'.  The next part of the refactoring is to move methods and instance variables that relate  to the synchronization. Take the following variables and move them from the Main  controller to our new Sync controller:  Now, do the same with the following methods:     geo    syncHandler    oneTimeMessage    online    message     init    predictBandwidth    checkForTurbulence    signIn    signOut    connect    disconnect    startSyncing    setIndicator  The only method that needs a change is signIn. As we still need access to our   view-switching logic, we'll need to be explicit about where this function resides.   Edit the signIn method and replace the last line with the following:  this.getApplication  .getController 'Main' .showListsView  ;  [ 174 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Finally, we need to make the application aware of our new controller. Add Sync to  the controller's array in todo-app app.js. Commit your changes. Start the app and  verify that the behavior hasn't changed.  Updating the Item store The Item store needs a lot of work in order to accommodate the new CouchDB  databases that we've created. Previously, this store let the List store manage it.  Now, it will talk directly to Cloudant. When we're done, this store will look very  similar to the List store.  Defining new databases Previously, the Item store had only a pointer to currentListStore and  currentListRecord. Remove these and replace them with the following   database definitions to be used by the methods that we will define next:  remoteMetaDB: null, remoteTextDB: null, remoteMapsDB: null, remoteImagesDB: null, localMetaDB: null, localTextDB: null, localMapsDB: null, localImagesDB: null, currentListId: null,  Don't worry about the fact that they're all null. We'll instantiate them in the Sync  controller later.  Retrieving the data from the databases First, we need a way to retrieve all the items of a given type for the current list.  The following method does exactly this. You provide a store to read and a callback  method for any documents that are read. Let's define this method now. Open the  Item store and add the following method:  doWithDocs: function store, func  {   var me = this;    store.allDocs {     include_docs: true,     attachments: true,     startKey: me.currentListId + "_",  [ 175 ]  www.it-ebooks.info       endKey: me.currentListId + "_\uffff"   }, function  error, result  {     func store, result.rows.map function e  {       return e.doc;     }  ;   } ; },  The reason that we return only the items from the current list is efficiency. The app  would still work properly, but we'd be passing far more data back and forth than  actually needed. At a large scale, the performance would fall apart entirely.  Flagging the databases for sync As metadata is the only database that live-syncs, we need a way to trigger the  synchronization of the other databases manually. The key is to have a method that  updates metadata and triggers the synchronization logic when the live-sync occurs.  In the Item store, add the following method:  flagStoreForSync: function store  {   var me = this;   me.localMetaDB.get store, function error, doc  {     if  !doc  {       me.localMetaDB.put {         '_id': store       } ;     } else {       me.localMetaDB.put doc ;     }   } ; }  All this method does is it updates a document in the metadata database  or creates it  if it doesn't exist . This bumps the _rev attribute of this document and triggers a live- sync, which is handled in the Sync controller. The rest of the synchronization logic  lives in the controller.  Piecing items together from multiple databases First, add the following event handler to the listeners configuration:  load: 'onLoad',  [ 176 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The onLoad method will do the work of concatenating the text, maps, and images  databases into a single Item model, creating new models as needed. Create this  method now:  onLoad: function store, records, successful, operation  { },  In this method, add the following code snippets in the order that they appear. First,  let's define a closure that retrieves all the images for the current list and attaches  them to the appropriate records in the Item store:  var me = this; var updateImages = function docsArray  {   me.doWithDocs store.localImagesDB, function pouchdb, docs  {     for  var i = 0; i < docs.length; ++i  {       docsArray = docsArray.map function e  {         if  e._id == docs[i]._id  {           e.media = docs[i].media         }         return e;       } ;     }     store.setData docsArray ;   } ; };  Now, let's add another closure that does the same thing for the map coordinates.  Notice how this closure calls updateImages   when it finishes. As we don't want  race conditions, each database is queried in a sequence:  var updateMaps = function docsArray  {   me.doWithDocs store.localMapsDB, function pouchdb, docs  {     for  var i = 0; i < docs.length; ++i  {       docsArray = docsArray.map function e  {         if  e._id == docs[i]._id  {           e.latitude = docs[i].latitude;           e.longitude = docs[i].longitude;         }         return e;       } ;     }     updateImages docsArray ;   } ; };  [ 177 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Next, let's define the last closure in this method, which retrieves the text for all the  items in the current list and attaches them to the appropriate records in the Item  store. In addition, it creates a new Image model if the ID doesn't exist and calls  updateMaps   when done:  var setData = function pouchdb, docs  {   var docstoadd = [];   for  var i = 0; i < records.length; ++i  {     var data = records[i].getData  ;     if  docs.every function l  { return l._id != data._id }   {       var model = new TodoApp.model.Item {         _id: data._id.replace  .*_ , me.currentListId + "_" ,         list: store.currentListId,         description: data.description,         media: data.media,         latitude: data.latitude,         longitude: data.longitude       } ;       docstoadd.push model ;     }   }   if  docstoadd.length > 0  {     docs = docs.concat docstoadd ;   }   updateMaps docs ; };  Finally, let's kick off this functionality with a call to doWithDocs  :  me.doWithDocs store.localTextDB, setData ;  Splitting items apart If onLoad joins bits from multiple databases in a coherent set of Item models,  onAddRecords does the opposite. When an item is added, it splits it into text,  coordinates, and images, then adds these pieces to the relevant PouchDB database.  Remove the existing method with this name and redefine it as follows:  onAddRecords: function store, records  { }  [ 178 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   As before, add each of the following code snippets to this method in the given order.  First, define a closure that splits the description from each to-do item:  var me = this; var addText = function pouchdb, lists  {   var toadd = [];   for  var i = 0; i < records.length; ++i  {     var data = records[i].getData  ;     if  data.description && lists.every function l          { return l._id != data._id }   {       toadd.push {         '_id': data._id,         'list': me.currentListId,         'description': data.description       } ;     }   }   if  toadd.length > 0  {     lists = lists.concat toadd ;     pouchdb.bulkDocs toadd, function   {       me.flagStoreForSync 'text' ;     } ;   } };  Nothing here should be too surprising, but notice the flagStoreForSync   method  near the end. This method updates the metadata database, which triggers a live-sync  and causes the given store  and only that store  to be updated. This will become  important later when we need to orchestrate the priority of the various stores.  Now, add a similar closure that splits the coordinates from each to-do item:  var addMaps = function pouchdb, lists  {   var toadd = [];   for  var i = 0; i < records.length; ++i  {     var data = records[i].getData  ;     if  data.latitude && data.longitude &&         lists.every function l  { return l._id != data._id }   {       toadd.push {         '_id': data._id,         'list': me.currentListId,         'latitude': data.latitude,         'longitude': data.longitude       } ;     }  [ 179 ]  www.it-ebooks.info     }   if  toadd.length > 0  {     lists = lists.concat toadd ;     pouchdb.bulkDocs toadd, function   {       me.flagStoreForSync 'maps' ;     } ;   } };  Last, define a closure that does the same thing for a to-do item's image:  var addImages = function pouchdb, lists  {   var toadd = [];   for  var i = 0; i < records.length; ++i  {     var data = records[i].getData  ;     if  data.media && data.media !== "" && lists.every         function l  { return l._id != data._id }   {       toadd.push {         '_id': data._id,         'list': me.currentListId,         'media': data.media       } ;     }   }   if  toadd.length > 0  {     lists = lists.concat toadd ;     pouchdb.bulkDocs toadd, function   {       me.flagStoreForSync 'images' ;     } ;   } };  You'll notice that these methods do not create documents needlessly. If a to-do item  does not have an image defined, the image will not be created. This saves bandwidth  and improves the performance by doing fewer syncs with the remote databases.  Finally, kick off this method with calls to doWithDocs  :  this.doWithDocs store.localTextDB, addText ; this.doWithDocs store.localMapsDB, addMaps ; this.doWithDocs store.localImagesDB, addImages ;  [ 180 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Unlike onLoad  , we don't need to worry about race conditions. A single store is  updating multiple databases and not the other way around, so each closure may be  executed in parallel. One downside is that if the Internet connection is poor, it would  be better to execute one request at a time. To do this, you could chain the methods  together  as onLoad does  and flag the metadata store for all three data types at once.  Removing the individual data items When an Item model is deleted, we need to delete the corresponding data in each  database. There's already an onRemoveRecords method in the Item store. Replace it  with the following:  onRemoveRecords: function store, records, indices  {   var me = this;   var func = function pouchdb, lists  {     for  var i = 0; i < records.length; ++i  {       lists = lists.filter function e  { return e._id ==           records[i].getData  ._id; } ;     }     for  var i = 0; i < lists.length; ++i  {       lists[i]._deleted = true;     }     if  lists.length > 0  {       pouchdb.bulkDocs lists, function   {         if  pouchdb === store.localTextDB  {           me.flagStoreForSync 'text' ;         } else if  pouchdb === store.localMapsDB  {           me.flagStoreForSync 'maps' ;         } else if  pouchdb === store.localImagesDB  {           me.flagStoreForSync 'images' ;         }       } ;     }   };    me.doWithDocs store.localTextDB, func ;   me.doWithDocs store.localMapsDB, func ;   me.doWithDocs store.localImagesDB, func ; },  You should recognize the patterns from onLoad   and onAddRecords  . We define  a closure that finds all the matching records, sets the _deleted attribute to true,  passes them to the appropriate database  with bulkDocs , and then flags the store   to be synchronized.  [ 181 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Updating the individual data items You're probably tired of this by now but we have one more case to cover: updating  the databases when an Item model is updated. Replace the contents of the existing  onUpdateRecord method with the following, one snippet at a time. First, verify that  there's something to update:  var me = this; if  modifiedFieldNames.length == 0  {      No changes, don't bother updating the list   return; } var data = record.getData  ;  If there's a description and it differs from the existing description, update the database:  if  modifiedValues['description']  {   store.localTextDB.get data['_id'], function error, doc  {     if  !doc  {       doc = {         '_id': data['_id'],         'list': me.currentListId       }     }     if  doc.description != data.description  {       doc.description = data.description;       store.localTextDB.put doc, function   {         store.flagStoreForSync 'text' ;       } ;     }   } ; }  Similarly, if there's an image and it differs from the current image, update this  database as well:  if  modifiedValues['media'] !== null  {   store.localImagesDB.get data['_id'], function error, doc  {     if  !doc  {       doc = {         '_id': data['_id'],         'list': me.currentListId       }     }     if  !doc.media  {       doc.media = "";  [ 182 ]  www.it-ebooks.info       }     if  doc.media != data.media  {       doc.media = data.media;       store.localImagesDB.put doc, function   {         store.flagStoreForSync 'images' ;       } ;     }   } ; }  Finally, do the same for the map coordinates. We don't bother to check whether the  coordinates exist. If they don't, we clear the coordinates instead of updating them:  store.localMapsDB.get data['_id'], function error, doc  {   if  !doc  {     doc = {       '_id': data['_id'],       'list': me.currentListId     }   }   if  doc.latitude != data.latitude  doc.longitude !=      data.longitude  {     doc.latitude = data.latitude;     doc.longitude = data.longitude;     store.localMapsDB.put doc, function   {       store.flagStoreForSync 'maps' ;     } ;   } } ;  Updating the list store The List store does not change as drastically as the Item store, but it still needs a  few modifications to work properly. We'll wire up the existing event handlers to  work with the flagStoreForSync   method, which works almost identically to   the method defined in the Item store.  Creating a pointer to the metadata database Open the List store. Immediately below the remoteDB and localDB variables, add a  reference to the metadata database:  localMetaDB: null,  [ 183 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   This is the same database as that used by the Item store. The flagStoreForSync    method will use it extensively.  Flagging the databases when they change In each of the event handlers  with the exception of onLoad , we need to let the Sync  controller know when a specific database needs to sync. In each call to bulkDocs    or put  , add a second argument with the following code:  function   {   me.flagStoreForSync  ; }  This will trigger a sync of the lists database immediately after any documents are  written to it. Now, define the flagStoreForSync   method:  flagStoreForSync: function   {   var me = this;   me.localMetaDB.get 'lists', function error, doc  {     if  !doc  {       me.localMetaDB.put {         '_id': 'lists'       } ;     }   } ; }  Updating models and views To support the changes in the store and reflect the fact that the Item store is tied  closely to its PouchDB counterparts, make the following changes to the Item model:     Add the idProperty attribute to the config object:  idProperty: '_id'     Change the id field to _id to match the equivalent PouchDB field    Add a _rev field to match the equivalent PouchDB document revision field    Add a list field to keep track of which list owns a particular to-do item  Now, let's edit a few of the views to match the changes that you made to the model.  First, edit todo-app app view item DataItem.js and change the id field to _id.  [ 184 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Next, edit todo-app app view item Edit.js and change the id field to _id. Add  the following two fields as well:  {   xtype: 'hiddenfield',   name: '_rev' }, {   xtype: 'hiddenfield',   name: 'list' },  {   xtype: 'hiddenfield',   name: 'list' },  Next, edit todo-app app view item New.js and add the following field:  Finally, edit todo-app app view list List.js and add the following method to  initialize the Item store:  initialize: function   {     Autoload appears to be broken for dataviews   Ext.getStore 'Item' .load  ;    this.callParent  ; }  Wiring up the Sync controller The last thing that we need to do is to make the Sync controller aware of all the  changes that we just made. One part of this is renaming the variables to match the  new naming convention, so be sure to pay close attention. Open the Sync controller  and let's get started.  Initializing the databases In the Sync controller, replace the init method with the following:  init: function   {   var me = this,   listStore = Ext.getStore 'List' ,   itemStore = Ext.getStore 'Item' ,  [ 185 ]  www.it-ebooks.info     record = Ext.getStore 'User' .first  ,   data;    listStore.localDB = new PouchDB 'lists' ;   listStore.localMetaDB = itemStore.localMetaDB =       new PouchDB 'metadata' ;   itemStore.localTextDB = new PouchDB 'text' ;   itemStore.localMapsDB = new PouchDB 'maps' ;   itemStore.localImagesDB = new PouchDB 'images' ;    if  record  {     data = record.getData  ;     listStore.username = data.username;     itemStore.username = data.username;     me.connect data.username, data.password ;   }    me.predictBandwidth  ;    me.checkForTurbulence  ; },  As before, this method is responsible for initializing the PouchDB databases and  kicking off various sync operations.  Tweaking the connection logic Now, edit the connect method. Both the Item and List stores need to know the  credentials of the current user. We don't have a central place for these at the moment,  so both of the stores get a copy. Add the following lines immediately before the  syncHandler check:  itemStore.username = username; itemStore.password = password;  Now, edit the disconnect method. As the Sync controller reads the username and  password from the Item store, we need to redirect the reset logic in this method.  Initialize a variable named itemStore with the Item store and then replace the  listStore.username and listStore.password lines with the following:  itemStore.username = 'nobody'; itemStore.password = null;  [ 186 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Changing how the syncing works Finally, edit the startSyncing method. This is where we connect our local PouchDB  instances with the remote Cloudant databases, so add the following lines after  listStore.remoteDB:  itemStore.remoteTextDB = new PouchDB 'https:  ' +     itemStore.username + ':' + itemStore.password +     '@djsauble.cloudant.com text' ; itemStore.remoteMapsDB = new PouchDB 'https:  ' +     itemStore.username + ':' + itemStore.password +     '@djsauble.cloudant.com maps' ; itemStore.remoteImagesDB = new PouchDB 'https:  ' +     itemStore.username + ':' + itemStore.password +     '@djsauble.cloudant.com images' ; itemStore.remoteMetaDB = new PouchDB 'https:  ' +     itemStore.username + ':' + itemStore.password +     '@djsauble.cloudant.com metadata' ;  Next, as live-sync occurs with the metadata database instead of the lists database,  point the sync to the localMetaDB database:  me.metaSyncHandler =     itemStore.localMetaDB.sync itemStore.remoteMetaDB, {  Next, in the complete handler of the syncHandler variable, reinitialize all of the other  PouchDB databases. Add the following lines after the listStore.localDB line:  itemStore.localTextDB = new PouchDB 'text' ; itemStore.localMapsDB = new PouchDB 'maps' ; itemStore.localImagesDB = new PouchDB 'images' ; itemStore.localMetaDB = new PouchDB 'metadata' ;  Finally, replace the listStore.load   line in the change handler with the following:  me.calculateSync change.change.docs ;  This method is where the magic happens. When a change is detected, this method is  responsible for determining which databases were affected, syncing these databases,  and loading the stores. Let's create this method now:  calculateSync: function metadata  { }  [ 187 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Add the following code snippets to this method in the given order. First, let's define  some variables:  var me = this,   itemStore = Ext.getStore 'Item' ,   listStore = Ext.getStore 'List' ,   syncLists = false,   syncText = false,   syncMaps = false,   syncImages = false;  These variables give us access to the stores and PouchDB instances and help us  determine which of these to sync. By default, we assume that nothing must be synced.  Next, we iterate through each document. Based on the ID of each document, we flip  the sync flag for the related store. Once we've iterated through all of the documents,  we know exactly which PouchDB instances to sync:  for  var i = 0; i < metadata.length; ++i  {   var store = metadata[i]._id;   if  store === "lists"  {     console.log "Sync lists" ;     syncLists = true;   } else if  store === "text"  {     console.log "Sync text" ;     syncText = true;   } else if  store === "maps"  {     console.log "Sync maps" ;     syncMaps = true;   } else if  store === "images"  {     console.log "Sync images" ;     syncMaps = true;   } }  Once done, all that's left to do is the sync operation itself. After the syncing, the  related store is reloaded, which ensures that the changes are reflected in the UI:  if  syncLists  {   listStore.localDB.sync listStore.remoteDB, function   {     listStore.load  ;   } ; } if  syncText  {   itemStore.localTextDB.sync itemStore.remoteTextDB, function   {     itemStore.load  ;  [ 188 ]  www.it-ebooks.info     } ; } if  syncMaps  {   itemStore.localMapsDB.sync itemStore.remoteMapsDB, function   {     itemStore.load  ;   } ; } if  syncImages  {   itemStore.localImagesDB.sync itemStore.remoteImagesDB,       function   {     itemStore.load  ;   } ; }  Note that these syncs are done in parallel and not prioritized as we eventually want.  We'll fix this in the next section.  Prioritizing the synchronization All that's left to do is prioritize the order in which our databases are synced. When  only one database changes, the behavior remains unchanged. It's only when multiple  databases are synced that we want to ensure the highest valued data is retrieved  first. Delete the last block of code that you wrote in the previous section and replace  it with the following:  me.doSync syncLists, syncText, syncMaps, syncImages ;  This method recursively iterates through each argument, syncs the database if true,  and then moves to the next. It ensures that lists are loaded first, followed by text,  then maps, and finally, images. Let's implement this method now:  doSync: function syncLists, syncText, syncMaps, syncImages  {   var me = this,     itemStore = Ext.getStore 'Item' ,     listStore = Ext.getStore 'List' ;    if  syncLists  {     listStore.localDB.sync listStore.remoteDB, function   {       listStore.load function   {         me.doSync false, syncText, syncMaps, syncImages        } ;     } ;   } else if  syncText  {     itemStore.localTextDB.sync         itemStore.remoteTextDB, function   {  [ 189 ]  www.it-ebooks.info         itemStore.load function   {         me.doSync false, false, syncMaps, syncImages ;       } ;     } ;   } else if  syncMaps  {     itemStore.localMapsDB.sync         itemStore.remoteMapsDB, function   {       itemStore.load function   {         me.doSync false, false, false, syncImages ;       } ;     } ;   } else if  syncImages  {     itemStore.localImagesDB.sync         itemStore.remoteImagesDB, function   {       itemStore.load  ;     } ;   } },  You're done! Commit your changes, start the app, and make some changes; ensure  that you add the images, text, and map coordinates. Then, open the app in a second  browser. Notice the order in which each data type loads.  Sending the follow-up communication If, in spite of all of our efforts, we fail to load all the cached data, we should clearly  communicate what data is available for use without relying on the spinner of death.  This is distinct from the turbulence communication in the last chapter as we're  successfully saving some data but just letting the user know what's available and  synchronized and what's not.  Comparing and contrasting with the  design principles Let's put our phone into airplane mode and do another quick evaluation against the  principles with the same pass fail scoring as before. Give me uninterrupted access to the content I care about.  This is a pass. Besides maps, the entire app works as expected while offline. Thanks  to PouchDB, even when we can't talk to the online database, our offline database  works just fine.  [ 190 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Content is mutable. Don't let my online offline status change that.  This is a pass. The content in our app is perfectly mutable, again thanks to PouchDB. Error messages should not leave me guessing or unnecessarily worried.  This is a fail. Even though we're not supporting offline maps in our app, we should  provide a better error message. Also, there are a bunch of errors that only appear in  the developer console and not in the app itself, so sometimes it appears that nothing  happened when in reality, we just ran into an error. We'll improve error messaging  in the next chapter. Don't let me start something I can't finish.  This is a pass. You can still save changes to the to-do items while offline. An app should never contradict itself. If a conflict exists, be honest about it.  This is a pass. However, when conflicts do exist, we should show an error message  and let you resolve the problem. That's not something that we do right now. When the laws of physics prevail, choose breadth over depth when caching.  This is a fail. Caching is still pretty dumb. By default, PouchDB caches everything,  which works for now, but it isn't scalable. Empty states should tell me what to do next in a delightful way.  This is a fail. We still don't provide much guidance when you're filling out a to-do  item for the first time. Let's address this in the next chapter. Don't make me remember what I was doing last. Remember for me.  This is a fail. We haven't yet provided a way to keep the context sticky. We'll address  this problem in the next chapter. Degrade gracefully as the network degrades. Don't be jarring.  This is a pass. We do a few things to help here. First, we predict when you're   about to go offline and warn you about it. Next, we retrieve and display the text first  and so in low-bandwidth conditions, you still get value from the app. In addition,  when the synchronization takes a long time, we let you know so that you're not  caught unawares. Never purge the cache unless I demand it.  This is a pass. When you sign out, we purge the cache for you.  [ 191 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Where does it need to improve? Thanks to the improvements in this chapter, we improved from 5 10 to 6 10 in  this round. Several of these items are extremely easy to fix, so we can expect the  experience to improve drastically in the remaining chapters.  Summary In this chapter, we exposed the underlying system state, implemented bi-directional  communication between the app and people using the app, predicted when the app  is about to go offline, made compensation for turbulent network conditions, and split  up the database to account for more granular caching behavior.  In the next chapter, we'll address the mother of all synchronization problems.   What happens when changes are made to an offline app on multiple devices?   Which change wins? How are these conflicts remediated? We'll investigate   strategies to deal with this split-brain problem and implement one of them.  [ 192 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Be Eventually Consistent  In this chapter, we'll finally address the question of what happens when two users  update the same piece of information while offline. This problem, known as split-brain,  is common to all distributed systems. When the apps finally get online, which change  wins? Do we resolve the conflict automatically or do we let the user decide?  Try this now. Open the app in two separate browsers. Using the mobile development  tools, put each app into offline mode. Now, make changes to the same to-do item  on each device and then put them online. Notice how the last change wins. This is  certainly a solution to the problem, but is it the best solution? Probably not.  We can't know which change is the correct change. Maybe both the users think that  their change should win or don't even consider the possibility that their change may  fail. We could let the owner win by default, but this doesn't address what happens  when two collaborators make changes. We should give users the final say on what  happens. When a conflict occurs, show each of them a notification that explains   what happened.  To resolve the problem, they have three options. They can either accept the other  person's change, overwrite it with their own change  letting the other user s  know ,  or create a new to-do item with their change intact, leaving the original to-do item  untouched. As we have revision history, a fourth option could be to go back to some  previous state. This is outside the scope of this book but an option worth considering.  By the end of the chapter, when split-brain occurs, your users should know exactly  what is going on and be able to easily remediate the problem. The to-do app was  already consistent but now it will be transparent about the process used to get to   this state.  [ 193 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   What is a split-brain? To illustrate the problem, here's a quick diagram:  Split-brain  We can mitigate this problem by increasing the granularity of our data storage. In  Chapter 4, Getting Online, the changes were made at the list level. Thus, two people  making changes to the same list while offline would always have their changes  conflicting. Thanks to the improvements that we made in Chapter 5, Be Honest about  What's Happening, each person would have to make a change to the same description,  map coordinate, or image for a conflict to occur.  This is vastly improved. However, when a conflict does occur, how do we resolve  it? At its core, there are three basic answers. Either Change A wins, Change B  wins, or both exist in perpetuity. In addition, depending on how much the owners  and collaborators of a list trust each other, we could either allow a single person to  resolve the conflict or require input from every person with edit privileges. Let's look  at both of these scenarios now.  [ 194 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   A collective agreement In this scenario, all the owners and collaborators must agree on the conflict  resolution. If a single member rejects the resolution chosen by the others, the conflict  will stand. This approach is useful in low-trust environments where we don't want a  single user to be able to vandalize a list or exert undue influence:  A collective agreement sequence diagram  We can see that the collaborators have the right to overwrite each other's changes.  Perhaps User B knows something that User A does not and wants the list to reflect  the current reality. However, overwriting someone else's change is not a silent  operation. The person who made the original change can see that their change was  overwritten and may choose to accept it, reject it, or save their original change as a  separate to-do item.  [ 195 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Trust is a vital ingredient in this approach. Collaborators should know each other  and have the ability to police themselves; otherwise, conflict resolution can degrade  to everyone continually overwriting each other's changes. Now, let's look at how  conflict resolution works at a workflow level:  A collective agreement workflow diagram  As long as both the users Reject any changes, the loop will continue infinitely.   There are two ways to end the loop and resolve the conflict. Either one user must  Accept the change made by the other or keep both the changes. In the latter case, this  creates a new to-do item with the user's changes intact and the original to-do item is  left as is.  This is a pretty complicated workflow. In cases where owners and collaborators trust  each other to do the right thing, can we simplify things? The answer is yes.  [ 196 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   A self-appointed dictator In this scenario, when a conflict occurs, the first person to address it causes   the conflict to disappear. Nobody else will be aware that a conflict ever existed.   This is a much lighter approach and one that we will take in our to-do app.  A self-appointed dictator sequence diagram  The nice thing about this is that it's exactly a subset of the collective agreement  approach. When you're developing an app, you can start with the lighter approach  and upgrade to a more rigorous conflict resolution algorithm as needed. The  workflow is simpler as well:  A self-appointed dictator workflow diagram  [ 197 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   All that is needed is a way for the user to select the correct change and the app will  synchronize this change to all the other users transparently. It accomplishes our goal  of making the conflicts visible with a minimum of effort. Before we implement this  feature, let's do a bit of refactoring to make these changes easier to implement and to  improve performance.  Refactoring the item store We've made a lot of changes to the Item store very quickly and without much  attention to the code duplication or sync efficiency. Before we go further, let's  refactor the store so that it's easier to change going forward.  Restricting sync to the user's lists Right now, when we flag each database to be synchronized, we flag it for all the  lists—even the lists that you don't have access to. As more people use the app, this  will result in an unacceptable hit to performance. Instead, let's restrict sync to the  lists that the current user owns.  Open the Item store and edit the flagStoreForSync method. Replace each usage of  store with the following code:  store + '_' + me.username  Now, open the List store and edit the flagStoreForSync method here as well.  Make the same substitution, but with 'list' instead:  'list' + '_' + me.username  Edit the Sync controller and modify the calculateSync method. Add the following  two variable definitions to the beginning of the for loop:  var store = metadata[i]._id.replace  _.* , "" ; var object = metadata[i]._id.replace store + "_", "" ;  Here, we extract the store name and username from the _id attribute. Now, add the  following condition to each if and else statement:  && object === itemStore.username  This ensures that the username matches the current user. If it doesn't, we do nothing   and save ourselves a useless sync operation . If it does, we sync as usual.  [ 198 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Only set the data if needed Whenever setData   is called, the onAddRecords event handler is called, resulting  in unnecessary processing and synchronization. We should be smarter about this.  We should only set the data when PouchDB and our local store disagree. For now,  we'll use the count of the store and the _id attribute for this.  Open the Item store and add the following helper method:  setDataIfNeeded: function store, docs  {   var recordIds = store.getData  .all.map function r        { return r.getId  ; } .sort  ;   var docIds = docs.map function r  { return r._id; } .sort  ;    if  recordIds.length !== docIds.length  {     store.setData docs ;     return;   }    for  var i = 0; i < recordIds.length; ++i  {     if  recordIds[i] != docIds[i]  {       store.setData docs ;       return;     }   } },  This method takes the current list of records in the store, sorts it by _id, and then  compares it with the list of documents  after sorting these by _id as well . If the   lists have the same length and the _id attributes are the same for all the elements,   it assumes that the lists are the same and doesn't call setData  .  Obviously, this ignores the fact that _id is not enough to guarantee sameness. Later  in this chapter, we'll add support for the _rev attribute and check for equivalence  there as well.  Now, wherever setData   is called in the Item store, replace it with a reference to  setDataIfNeeded  except, of course, in setDataIfNeeded itself .  Refactoring the event handlers Each event handler has an enormous amount of duplicated code. This adds  complexity to the store and makes it difficult to change the code in the future. Let's  refactor this common code into several helper methods. Edit the Item store and make  the following changes.  [ 199 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The onLoad method Add a helper method named loadDocsAttributes and give it the following code:  loadDocsAttributes: function me, store, docsArray, attributes,    flag, callback  {   me.doWithDocs store, function pouchdb, docs  {     for  var i = 0; i < docs.length; ++i  {       var indexOf = -1;       for  var j = 0; j < docsArray.length; ++j  {         if  docsArray[j]._id == docs[i]._id  {           indexOf = j;           break;         }       }       if  indexOf === -1  {         docsArray.push docs[i] ;       } else {         docsArray[indexOf][flag + 'rev'] = docs[i]['_rev'];         Ext.each attributes, function attr  {           docsArray[indexOf][attr] = docs[i][attr];         } ;       }     }     callback docsArray ;   } ; },  This method does a few things. First, it calls doWithDocs   to get a list of data types  in the current list from the specified PouchDB database. Next, it checks whether  each of these documents already exists in the Item store. If not, it adds them. If so,  it copies the new attributes to the existing document. Finally, it sends the updated  array of documents to the specified callback.  Now that we've abstracted this out, we can call it from onLoad for each data type that  we support: text, maps, and images. We'll use this pattern for each of the remaining  event handlers. Replace onLoad with the following code:  onLoad: function store, records, successful, operation  {   var me = this;   var updateImages = function docsArray  {     me.loadDocsAttributes me, store.localImagesDB, docsArray,           ['media'], 'images', function docs  {       me.setDataIfNeeded store, docs ;     } ;   };  [ 200 ]  www.it-ebooks.info     var updateMaps = function docsArray  {     me.loadDocsAttributes me, store.localMapsDB, docsArray,         ['latitude', 'longitude'], 'maps', function docs  {       me.setDataIfNeeded store, docs ;       updateImages docs ;     } ;   };   var updateText = function docsArray  {     me.loadDocsAttributes me, store.localTextDB, docsArray,  ['description'], 'text', function docs  {       me.setDataIfNeeded store, docs ;       updateMaps docs ;     } ;   };   updateText records.map      function r  {       return r.getData  ;     }     ; },  This is pretty straightforward. We use the two helper methods that we've created so  far, loadDocsAttributes and setDataIfNeeded, in order to take the redundancy  out of the method. Using the callback, we chain these methods together such that  the text database is loaded in the store first, followed by maps, and images last.  The onAddRecords method Add a helper method named addDocsAttributes and give it the following code:  addDocsAttributes: function me, store, docsArray, attributes,     flag, callback  {   me.doWithDocs store, function pouchdb, docs  {     var toadd = [];     for  var i = 0; i <docsArray.length; ++i  {       var exists = docs.some function d  { return d._id ==           docsArray[i]._id; } ;       if  !exists  {         var obj = {           '_id': docsArray[i]._id,           'list': me.currentListId         };         var change = false;         obj['_rev'] = docsArray[i][flag + 'rev'];         Ext.each attributes, function attr  {  [ 201 ]  www.it-ebooks.info             if  docsArray[i][attr]  {             obj[attr] = docsArray[i][attr];             change = true;           }         } ;         if  change  {           toadd.push obj ;         }       }     }     if  toadd.length > 0  {       store.bulkDocs toadd, function   {         me.flagStoreForSync flag ;         callback docsArray ;       }      } else {       callback docsArray ;     }   } ; },  Like loadDocsAttributes, this method loads all the data items from the specified  database for the current list. It then adds them to a temporary list if they don't  already exist in the store. If this list has items in it by the end of the algorithm, they  are written to PouchDB using bulkDocs   and then the app is flagged for a sync  operation. Finally, a callback method is called with the list of records to be added.  Now, replace the onAddRecords method with the following:  onAddRecords: function store, records  {   var me = this;    var addImages = function docsArray  {     me.addDocsAttributes me, store.localImagesDB, docsArray,         ['media'], 'images', Ext.emptyFn ;   };   var addMaps = function docsArray  {     me.addDocsAttributes me, store.localMapsDB, docsArray,         ['latitude', 'longitude'], 'maps', function docs  {       addImages docs ;     } ;   };   var addText = function docsArray  {     me.addDocsAttributes me, store.localTextDB, docsArray,  ['description'], 'text', function docs  {  [ 202 ]  www.it-ebooks.info         addMaps docs ;     } ;   };   addText records.map      function r  {       return r.getData  ;     }     ; },  The differences between onAddRecords and onLoad are slight. The text, maps, and  images database are modified in the same order and each use the helper that we've  defined. We don't change the data in the store as this handler is only called after  setData  , the purpose being to replicate any new records to PouchDB to sync.  The onRemoveRecords method Add a helper method named removeDocsAttributes and give it the following code:  removeDocsAttributes: function me, store, docsArray, flag,     callback  {   me.doWithDocs store, function pouchdb, docs  {     docs = docs.filter        function e  {         return docsArray.some          function r  {             return r._id == e._id;           }          ;       }      ;     for  var i = 0; i < docs.length; ++i  {       docs[i]._deleted = true;     }     if  docs.length > 0  {       pouchdb.bulkDocs docs, function   {           me.flagStoreForSync flag ;           callback docsArray ;       } ;     } else {       callback docsArray ;     }   } ; },  [ 203 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   After the call to doWithDocs  , this method takes all the documents marked for  removal, sets their _deleted attribute to true, and writes these changes to PouchDB  with bulkDocs. Finally, it triggers the callback method, passing the list of records  to be removed.  Next, replace onRemoveRecords with the following code:  onRemoveRecords: function store, records, indices  {   var me = this;    var removeImages = function docsArray  {     me.removeDocsAttributes me, store.localImagesDB, docsArray,         'images', Ext.emptyFn ;   };   var removeMaps = function docsArray  {     me.removeDocsAttributes me, store.localMapsDB, docsArray,         'maps', function docs  {       removeImages docs ;     } ;   };   var removeText = function docsArray  {     me.removeDocsAttributes me, store.localTextDB, docsArray,         'text', function docs  {       removeMaps docs ;     }    };   removeText records.map      function r  {       return r.getData  ;     }     ; },  This method is pretty much identical to onAddRecords. Our helper method once again  does the heavy work and leaves this method free to define the higher-level algorithm.  The onUpdateRecord method Add a helper method named updateDocsAttributes and give it the following code:  updateDocsAttributes: function me, store, data, attributes, flag,  callback  {   store.get data['_id'], function error, doc  {     if  !doc  {       doc = {         '_id': data['_id'],  [ 204 ]  www.it-ebooks.info           'list': me.currentListId       }     }     var changes = attributes.some        function attr  {         if  !doc[attr] && !data[attr]  {           return false;         }         return doc[attr] != data[attr];       }      ;      if  changes  {       Ext.each attributes, function attr  {         doc[attr] = data[attr];       } ;       store.put doc, function   {         me.flagStoreForSync flag ;         callback data ;       } ;     } else {       callback data ;     }   } ; },  This method is unique in that it only deals with a single record at a time and not  several. This means we can call get   instead of doWithDocs  . If the document  doesn't already exist in PouchDB, we create it. If there are any attribute changes, we  apply them, then save the document, and flag the store for the synchronization.  Finally, we send record to the specified callback.  Next, replace onUpdateRecord with the following code:  onUpdateRecord: function store, record, newIndex, oldIndex,     modifiedFieldNames, modifiedValues  {   var me = this;    var updateImages = function data  {     if  modifiedValues['media'] !== null  {       me.updateDocsAttributes me, store.localImagesDB, data,           ['media'], 'images', Ext.emptyFn ;     }   };   var updateMaps = function data  {  [ 205 ]  www.it-ebooks.info       me.updateDocsAttributes me, store.localMapsDB, data,         ['latitude', 'longitude'], 'maps', function doc  {       updateImages doc ;     } ;   };   var updateText = function data  {     if  modifiedValues['description']  {       me.updateDocsAttributes me, store.localTextDB, data,           ['description'], 'text', function doc  {         updateMaps doc ;       } ;     } else {       updateMaps data ;     }   }   updateText record.getData   ; },  This method is very similar to the previous event handlers, with one difference.  The updateText and updateImages closures check that the given attributes have  changes before passing them off to the handler. This is because we don't want to  create empty documents in PouchDB that do nothing but hold empty strings.  That's enough refactoring for now. Commit your changes, start the web server, and  play with the to-do app. You'll notice that it has become more efficient when changes  occur. Fewer sync operations occur and fewer event handlers in the Item store are  called, resulting in increased performance.  Implementing conflict detection PouchDB is aware of conflicts under the hood. By default, when a conflict occurs, it  chooses an arbitrary winner and returns it on request. This isn't quite the behavior  that we want. Instead, when a conflict occurs, we want PouchDB to give us a list  of all of the conflicts so that the user can resolve them. The first step is altering our  stores to detect and expose the conflicts.  Getting PouchDB to return conflicts The first step is to get PouchDB to return a list of the conflict revisions. Edit the  doWithDocs method in the Item store and add the following option to the allDocs  method immediately after the endKey option:  conflicts: true  [ 206 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Now, each document with conflicts will have a _conflicts attribute with an array  of all the losing conflicts. Once we have this, we can let the user select the revision  that they actually want to win and then remove all of the other conflicts.  Attaching conflicts to the item model Now that PouchDB is returning conflicts, we need to attach them to the Item model  so that they'll show up in the edit form. First, edit this model and add the following  fields:  'textconflicts', 'mapsconflicts', 'imagesconflicts',  Each attribute will store an array of revs and be accessible from the hiddenfield  components in the edit form. Where do these attributes come from? The _conflicts  attribute from the documents in each of our three databases: text, images, and maps.  Let's implement this mapping now.  In the Item store, edit the loadDocsAttributes method and replace the indexOf  === -1 if block with the following code:  if  indexOf === -1  {   var obj = Ext.clone docs[i] ;   if  obj['_conflicts'].length  {     obj[flag + 'conflicts'] = docs[i]['_conflicts'];   }   docsArray.push obj ; } else {   if  docs[i]._conflicts.length  {     docsArray[indexOf][flag + 'conflicts'] =         docs[i]['_conflicts'];   }   Ext.each attributes, function attr  {     docsArray[indexOf][attr] = docs[i][attr];   } ; }  If we're loading a document that doesn't exist in the local store, update the   type-specific rev and conflict attributes of this document. If the document does   exist, do the same but reference the existing document instead of creating a new one.  [ 207 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Attaching the current revision to the item  model Conflicts are one thing, but we also need to attach the current revision to the Item  model. This way, when we submit the changes to PouchDB, we're using the revision  that we received during the last sync and not the latest revision, which may or may  not map to the data that we loaded. This helps PouchDB to flag the conflicts better.  Edit the Item model and add the following fields:  'textrev', 'mapsrev', 'imagesrev',  Now, just as with conflicts, we can multiplex the _rev attribute from each  document that we get to the appropriate field. However, in contrast, we do this  during submit as well and not just on load. Edit the Item store and modify the  loadDocsAttributes method. Change the if…else block that you created in the last  section and add the following to the if part of the block, immediately before the call  to docsArray.push  :  obj[flag + 'rev'] = obj['_rev']; obj['_rev'] = undefined;  Now, add the following similar code to the end of the else part of the block:  docsArray[indexOf][flag + 'rev'] = docs[i]['_rev'];  This is it for the load. Now, let's ensure that our type-specific revision fields are  mapped back to _rev when the form is submitted. Edit the updateDocsAttributes  method and add the following to the top of the if  changes  block:  doc['_rev'] = data[flag + 'rev'];  Now, the revisions and conflicts are being mapped from our PouchDB databases to  our Item model. With this extra information, we can improve the efficiency of the  data loads.  Checking the revision before loading the data Our setDataIfNeeded method is responsible for taking the data that we load   from PouchDB and setting the store. Previously, if PouchDB and the store had   the same set of the _id attributes, we didn't update the store. This works when  adding removing the to-do items but does the wrong thing when just updating   an existing item as _id remains unchanged.  [ 208 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Now, as we have revision as a part of the Item model, we can compare this   against _rev of each document that we load. If the revisions aren't the same, we  know our local store is out of date and can update it. Replace setDataIfNeeded   with the following:  setDataIfNeeded: function store, docs, flag  { }  Note that we added a flag argument to the method. This helps us with the mapping  from _rev to flag + 'rev'. Now, add the following code to this method in the  given order:  var sortFn = function a, b  {   return a._id > b._id ? 1 : a._id == b._id ? 0 : -1; };  This method sorts an array of objects by their _id attributes. We'll use this to simplify  the comparison algorithm when checking whether the contents of the local store  are up to date with PouchDB. Now, let's retrieve the data from our local store and  sanitize it:  This converts the data to a sorted list of objects with their attributes at a top level.  Now, let's do the same to the data that we loaded from PouchDB:  var records = store.getData  .all.map    function r  {     return r.getData  ;   }  .sort sortFn ;  docs = docs.filter function n  {   for  var i = 0; i < records.length; ++i  {     if  n._id == records[i]._id  {       return true;     }   }   return !!n[flag + 'rev']; } .sort sortFn ;  if  records.length !== docs.length  {   store.setData docs ;   return; }  [ 209 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  We exclude any documents that aren't in the local store and don't have a revision as  these don't technically exist as documents in PouchDB as of yet. Next, let's compare  the arrays and see if they contain the same number of items:   This is a shortcut when items are added or removed from the list as we don't need to  compare the revisions to tell that the data isn't the same. However, if the lengths are  the same, we need to ensure that no items have been updated since the last load:  for  var i = 0; i < records.length; ++i  {   if  records[i]._id != docs[i]._id  records[i]._rev !=       docs[i]._rev  {     store.setData docs ;     return;   } }  At this point, if none of the checks have triggered, we assume that the stores are the  same and do nothing. This prevents redundant calls to setData, which slow down  the app and result in unneeded synchronization between our local and remote  PouchDB instances.  That's it for the method. As we added the flag attribute to the signature of the  method, we need to go through the Item store and add this parameter to all the calls  of the function. Add 'text', 'maps', or 'images', depending on what type of data  is being used.  Implementing the conflict resolution At this point, PouchDB returns conflicts when they exist and assigns them to the  Item model for use by our controllers and views. The next step is to expose this  information to the users and let them resolve conflicts when they arise.  Adding the supporting methods The last thing that we need to add to the Item store is a couple of supporting  methods. As PouchDB returns a list of conflict revisions but not the data attached  to each revision, we need to fetch this explicitly. People need to see what data is  attached to each revision in order to select the right one.  Edit the Item store and add the following method:  getAllConflicts: function me, store, id, revs, docs, callback  {   if  !revs.length  {     callback docs ;     return;   }   store.get id, { rev: revs.shift   }, function error, doc  {     docs.push doc ;  [ 210 ]  www.it-ebooks.info       me.getAllConflicts me, store, id, revs, docs, callback ;   } ; },  Normally, we would use allDocs to return a list of documents, but it only works  with the _id attribute and not _rev. Instead, we'll use recursion to retrieve each  revision in sequence and send the set of documents to a callback method when   we're done.  Next, once the user has selected the revision that they want to win, we need a helper  to remove all the other revisions and resolve the conflict. This next method does  exactly this:  resolveConflicts: function me, store, id, revs, callback  {   store.remove id, revs.shift  , function error, doc  {     if  !revs.length  {       store.get id, function error, doc  {         callback doc ;       } ;       return;     }     me.resolveConflicts me, store, id, revs, callback ;   } ; }  As before, we have to remove each document one at a time. This method calls itself  recursively until the operation is complete and then sends the winning document  to callback that we specify. This is still very fast because we're querying our local  PouchDB. Once all the conflicts are removed, we'll synchronize PouchDB again.  Adding fields to the edit views The first order of business is to add the fields related to the revisions and conflicts  to our forms. Edit todo-app app view Edit.js and add the following fields  immediately after the description text field:  {   xtype: 'hiddenfield',   name: 'textrev' }, {   xtype: 'hiddenfield',   name: 'textconflicts' },  [ 211 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Now, edit todo-app app view Image.js and do the same with the following fields:  {   xtype: 'hiddenfield',   name: 'imagesrev' }, {   xtype: 'hiddenfield',   name: 'imagesconflicts' }  {   xtype: 'hiddenfield',    name: 'mapsrev' }, {   xtype: 'hiddenfield',   name: 'mapsconflicts' },  {   xtype: 'todo-conflict' }    config: {     layout: 'hbox',     items: [     ]   } } ;  Finally, edit todo-app app view Map.js and do this once again:  Now that these fields exist, we can access them in our controller and provide the  conflict resolution logic. First, we need a container to hold the conflict resolution  views. Edit todo-app app view Edit.js and add the following to the end of the  items array of the description fieldset:  Now, let's define this xtype. Create a new file named todo-app app view  Conflict.js and add the following code:  Ext.define 'TodoApp.view.item.Conflict', {   extend: 'Ext.Container',   alias: 'widget.todo-conflict',  [ 212 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   This is an empty hbox layout that we'll fill with buttons using the controller. Each  button will contain the description associated with a particular conflict. When  clicked, we'll make the selected revision the winning revision and delete the others.  Adding controller logic There are two parts to this. First, when we click to edit a to-do item, we need   to detect conflicts and populate the view accordingly. Second, when we resolve   an existing conflict, we need to update the store and refresh the view with the  winning revision.  Let's add the edit logic first. Open the Main controller, modify the editTodoItem  method, and add the following variable definitions after the existing definitions:  pouchdb = store.localTextDB, textPanel = editForm.down 'fieldset[title=Description]' , conflictPanel = textPanel.down 'todo-conflict' , record = store.findRecord '_id', button.getData   , mediaData = record.get 'media' , textConflicts = record.get 'textconflicts' , mapsConflicts = record.get 'mapsconflicts' , imagesConflicts = record.get 'imagesconflicts' ;  Next, before the call to showEditView  , add the following code block:  if  textConflicts  {   conflictPanel.removeAll  ;   store.getAllConflicts store, pouchdb, button.getData  ,       textConflicts.concat record.get 'textrev'  , [],         function docs  {     Ext.each docs, function d  {       conflictPanel.add {         xtype: 'button',         action: 'accept',         text: d.description,         data: d._rev       } ;     } ;     conflictPanel.setHidden false ;     textPanel.down 'textfield[name=description]' .setHidden true ;     textPanel.setTitle 'Description  resolve conflict ' ;   } ; } else {  [ 213 ]  www.it-ebooks.info     conflictPanel.setHidden true ;   textPanel.down 'textfield[name=description]' .setHidden false ;   textPanel.setTitle 'Description' ; }  First, this code checks whether there are text conflicts or not. If so, it retrieves   the conflicts using the getAllConflicts method that we created earlier. Then,   it reveals the conflict panel and adds buttons to it, one per revision, each with the  description associated with that revision. It also hides the input field and changes the  description of fieldset. This ensures that the conflict is resolved before any additional  changes are made.  Next, open the Sync controller and add the following handler to the control  configuration:  'todo-edit button[action=accept]': {   tap: 'acceptChange' }  Now, implement the acceptChange handler. Add the following code to the   Sync controller:  acceptChange: function button  { }  Add each of the following code snippets to this method in the given order. First, let's  define a few variables:  var store = Ext.getStore 'Item' , pouchdb = store.localTextDB, fieldset = button.up 'fieldset' , text = fieldset.down 'textfield[name=description]' , rev = fieldset.down 'hiddenfield[name=textrev]' , conflicts = fieldset.down 'hiddenfield[name=textconflicts]' , values = button.up 'formpanel' .getValues  , record = store.findRecord '_id', values._id , toremove = record.get 'textconflicts' .concat     record.get 'textrev'  .filter function r  {   return r != button.getData  ; } ;  Now, let's call the resolveConflicts method and pass a callback to it in order to  update our view:  store.resolveConflicts store, pouchdb, values._id, toremove,     function doc  {   fieldset.down 'todo-conflict' .setHidden true ;  [ 214 ]  www.it-ebooks.info     fieldset.setTitle 'Description' ;   text.setHidden false ;    text.setValue doc.description ;   rev.setValue doc._rev ;   conflicts.setValue undefined ;    record.set 'description', doc.description ;   record.set 'textrev', doc._rev ;   record.set 'textconflicts', undefined ;   record.setDirty  ;   store.sync  ;    Ext.getStore 'Item' .flagStoreForSync 'text' ; } ;  This callback does the following three things:     First, it hides the conflict-related UI and reveals the fieldset as it       Second, it sets the values of the underlying form fields with the    normally appears  winning revision  PouchDB sync     Finally, it sets the values of the underlying record, saves it, and triggers a   Trying it out First, commit your changes to Git. Now, start the web app in two browsers. Make  sure that a to-do item is defined and then put one of the browsers in the offline  mode. Make changes to both the to-do items and save. At this point, the instance of  PouchDB on each browser has a different revision of the same to-do item.  Enable the online mode in both the browsers. Wait for PouchDB to sync and notice  that one of the changes wins by default and applies to both automatically. This is  PouchDB's default behavior. Regardless, a conflict exists. Edit the to-do item in one  of the browsers and notice that the conflict resolution UI shows both the conflicts.  [ 215 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Choose the losing conflict. Notice how the conflict resolution UI disappears, the app  syncs, and the selected revision appears in both the browsers. Refresh to ensure that  the resolution succeeded. Now, repeat the process and choose the default winning  conflict instead. The same thing should happen, except that the descriptions will stay  as they were.  Conflict resolution  Conflict resolution for maps and images At this point, conflict resolution is fully functional for the description field in each   to-do item. Obviously, this technique can be extended to support maps and images  as well. The main difference is the UI used to resolve the conflict. Text is easy as a  single button can be used to show each revision and mark it as the winning revision.  Maps and images are harder. The content is rich, so you'd likely need to show a  thumbnail of each revision, with the option to see the whole thing  if they differ  slightly . If you want to implement this, give it a try. The store will need no  modification and the controller will need slight modifications based on the UI that  you want to construct. I will leave this as an exercise for the reader.  [ 216 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Comparing and contrasting with the  design principles Let's put our phone into airplane mode and do another quick evaluation against the  principles with the same pass fail scoring as before. Give me uninterrupted access to the content I care about.  This is a pass. Besides maps, the entire app works as expected while offline. Thanks  to PouchDB, even when we can't talk to the online database, our offline database  works just fine. Content is mutable. Don't let my online offline status change that.  This is a pass. The content in our app is perfectly mutable, again thanks to PouchDB. Error messages should not leave me guessing or unnecessarily worried.  This is a fail. Even though we're not supporting offline maps in our app, we should  provide a better error message. Also, there are a bunch of errors that only appear in  the developer console and not in the app itself, so sometimes it appears that nothing  happened when in reality we just ran into an error. We'll improve error messaging in  the next chapter. Don't let me start something I can't finish.  This is a pass. You can still save changes to the to-do items while offline. An app should never contradict itself. If a conflict exists, be honest about it.  This is a pass. Thanks to the improvements in this chapter, when conflicts exist, we  let the users know and allow them to select a resolution. When the laws of physics prevail, choose breadth over depth when caching.  This is a fail. Caching is still pretty dumb. By default, PouchDB caches everything,  which works for now, but it isn't scalable. We'll fix this in the next chapter. Empty states should tell me what to do next in a delightful way.  This is a fail. We still don't provide much guidance when you're filling out a to-do  item for the first time. Let's address this in the next chapter. Don't make me remember what I was doing last. Remember for me.  This is a fail. We haven't yet provided a way to keep the context sticky. We'll address  this problem in the next chapter.  [ 217 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Degrade gracefully as the network degrades. Don't be jarring.  This is a pass. We do a few things to help here. First, we predict when you're about  to go offline and warn you about it. Next, we retrieve and display the text first, so  in low-bandwidth conditions, you still get value from the app. In addition, when  the synchronization takes a long time, we let you know so that you're not caught  unawares. Never purge the cache unless I demand it.  This is a pass. When you sign out, we purge the cache for you.  Where does it need to improve? We still have four areas where the experience falters but the improvements in this  chapter buttressed the existing areas and we'll do our best to fix the remaining issues  in the next two chapters. We've solved most of the hard problems. Getting to 10 10  is easier than you might think at this point.  Summary In this chapter, we discussed different ways of dealing with a split-brain: the  collective agreement approach where every collaborator must agree on the same  resolution and the self-appointed dictator approach where any collaborator can  choose a resolution independently of the others. We implemented the second  approach for the description field of the to-do items and discussed ways to extend  this to the map and image fields as well.  In the next chapter, we'll look at ways to optimize the performance of the app. Up  until now, we've stuck with the standard defaults provided by our offline database.  Let's investigate where our defaults fall short and how to improve them. We'll also  learn how to detect different usage scenarios and tweak the defaults in real time to  accommodate these scenarios.  [ 218 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Choosing Intelligent Defaults  In the previous chapter, we addressed the problem of conflicts that occur when we  are offline. Thanks to our offline PouchDB instance, we were able to track revisions  while offline and reconcile the changes when we are back online. When multiple  resolutions exist, we let the user choose which one to keep and dispose of the others.  In the future, if we implemented an undo feature, we would see a linear revision  history with no branches.  In this chapter, we will look at the low-hanging fruit that we've ignored up until  now. Many of these things are trivial. When we load the app while offline, the  Google Maps API leaves an ugly error message. When no to-do lists or to-do items  exist, the screen is empty instead of providing a hint of what to do next. When the  user reopens the app, they probably want to come back to whatever they were  viewing last.  These are simple things and we can fix them easily. There are a few other defaults  that involve a little more work, but we should fix them as well. First, PouchDB  caches everything by default. This was fine when we started, but because storage is  limited, we need to set limits and respect these limits. By default, we should cache all  the list metadata  otherwise you can't navigate to a to-do list  and cache all the data  in the current list, but caching other data is up to the discretion of the app.  This app discretion gives us some rope to work with. A second improvement that  we can make is to track the lists that are viewed most frequently. Once our top  cache priorities are out of the way, we'll cache the data from the other lists in the  appropriate order. Additionally, when we exceed our cache limits, we can remove  items from the cache in the reverse order.  Finally, if people want to clear their cache for any reason, we'll give them a  straightforward way to do so. To inform this behavior, we could show them how  much data is being consumed by the database and disable this functionality when  the database is already empty, for example.  [ 219 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Beyond this, we'll talk about different scenarios that people deal with when their  cache is being loaded with data. We'll discuss how these scenarios affect the  performance of the app and ways in which you might tweak the behavior of your  own app to compensate for certain edge cases.  Low-hanging fruit The first six chapters focused on the harder problems in offline-first web  development. There are a couple of reasons for this. First, a lot of apps do the small  obvious things right  mostly , so there's not much to learn there. Second, solving  the harder problems first means that you're making those changes while the app is  simpler to understand and modify.  Small changes, even ultimately positive ones, add complexity to an app, making it  harder to make changes later. We're now at a point where we can afford to backtrack  and solve these smaller problems.  Error messages Remember when we implemented support for maps in Chapter 3, Designing Online  Behavior? As we haven't added support for offline maps, we get the following error  message when opening the app while offline. It's ugly and doesn't describe the  problem really well. We can do better.  Current error when map is not available  [ 220 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The current error message is defined by Sencha Touch. Let's override this. Create a  new file named todo-app app patch MapsError.js and add the following code:  Ext.define 'TodoApp.patch.MapsError', {   override: 'Ext.Map',    constructor: function   {     this.callParent arguments ;      if  ! window.google  {} .maps  {       this.setHtml 'Must be online to use Google Maps' ;     }   } } ;  Commit your changes and start the app in offline mode. Open a to-do item with a  map and verify that this more sensible error message is displayed:  Improved error message when map is not available  [ 221 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Empty states Next, we need to give our data views an empty state. There are three data views:  collaborator.List, list.List, and list.Lists. Sencha Touch provides a  configuration option where we can specify a string to be displayed when the data  view is empty. Let's do this now.  Edit todo-app app view collaborator List.js and add the following attribute  to the data view:  Now, do the same for todo-app app view list List.js:  emptyText: '<div style="' +   'text-align: center;' +   'height: 100%;' +   'margin-top: 50%;">' +   'Add a collaborator to this list' +   ' ', deferEmptyText: true  emptyText: '<div style="' +   'text-align: center;' +   'height: 100%;' +   'margin-top: 50%;">' +   'Add a todo item to this list' +   ' ', deferEmptyText: true  emptyText: '<div style="' +   'text-align: center;' +   'height: 100%;' +   'margin-top: 50%;">' +   'Create a todo list and help your brain' +   ' ', deferEmptyText: true  Finally, add an empty string to the data view in todo-app app view list Lists.js:  [ 222 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Commit your changes and start the app. Delete any existing lists and notice the  empty state. Create a list, then click the Share and Edit buttons. Verify that these  empty states show up as well:  Empty state for the lists view  Restoring the last view The last bit of low-hanging fruit is to restore the last view that a user was on when the  app is restarted. This will help them regain their previous context quickly when the  app restarts. To do this, we need two things: a local store to persist this data between  the restarts and a way to keep track of the method used to display a given view.  [ 223 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   On the extreme end, we could restore any screen the user was on. More realistically  though, the user probably only cares about being taken back to the last list or item  that they were viewing. Clicking Edit again isn't a huge hardship. If we implemented  an autosave of the drafts, we could prompt the user to pick up where they left off.  For now, we'll support going back to one of the three views: the list of lists, a specific  list of the to-do items, and a specific to-do item.  Creating a store and model First, create a new file named todo-app app model Restore.js. In this file, add the  following lines:  Ext.define 'TodoApp.model.Restore', {   extend: 'Ext.data.Model',   requires: [     'Ext.data.identifier.Uuid',     'Ext.data.proxy.LocalStorage'   ],   config: {     identifier: {       type: 'uuid'     },     fields: [       'id',       'currentListId',       'currentItemId'     ],     proxy: {   type: 'localstorage',   id: 'todoapp-restore'     }   } } ;  This code defines a basic model backed by local storage, which contains the IDs of  the list and or item to restore. If both of these items are null, no restoration will take  place. We'll implement this logic in the controller.  Now, let's create the corresponding store for this model. Create another file named  todo-app app store Restore.js and add the following code:  Ext.define 'TodoApp.store.Restore', {   extend: 'Ext.data.Store',   config: {     model: 'TodoApp.model.Restore',  [ 224 ]  www.it-ebooks.info       autoSync: true,     autoLoad: true   } } ;  Nothing new here. The synchronization and loading is handled automatically, so all  we need to do is add a record and the store will handle the rest.  Specifying which pages to restore Now that our store and model are in place, the next step is to populate these with  data when visiting certain pages in the app. On loading, the app will check the store  and if the data is present, will load the appropriate pages. Edit the Main controller,  then create the following helper method:  saveView: function currentListId, currentItemId  {   var store = Ext.getStore 'Restore' ;    store.removeAll  ;   store.add {     'currentListId': currentListId,     'currentItemId': currentItemId   } ; },  This method simply takes currentListId and currentItemId and passes them to  the store to be persisted. As we can have only a single page to restore, it clears all the  other records from the store. Now, we can add hooks elsewhere in the app that will  call this method when the current list or item changes.  Edit the goBack method and append the following code:  var xtype = this.getMainPanel  .getActiveItem  .xtype; if  xtype === 'todo-list'  {   this.saveView Ext.getStore 'List' .currentListId, null ; } else if  xtype === 'todo-lists'  {   this.saveView null, null ; }  This code checks the xtype of the panel that we've gone back to. If it's a list panel,  we tell the app to restore that list on loading. If it's a list of lists, we tell the app to do  nothing  as this is the default landing page anyway .  [ 225 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Now, edit the showView method and add the same code:  var xtype = this.getMainPanel  .getActiveItem  .xtype; if  xtype === 'todo-list'  {   this.saveView Ext.getStore 'List' .currentListId, null ; } else if  xtype === 'todo-lists'  {    this.saveView null, null ; }  This covers two cases: going back and going to either the list view or list of lists  view. Lastly, we need to save the state when the user edits a to-do item. Edit the  editTodoItem method and add the following code immediately before the   call to showEditView   at the end:  this.saveView store.currentListId, itemId ;  This is it. Now, let's look at restoring the state from this data when the app loads.  Loading the page when the app starts With the information that we've stored, it can detect where we left off and load   the appropriate page automatically the next time the app loads. Edit the Main  controller and add the store and model that you just created to the models and  stores configuration attributes. Now, find the editTodoItem method and   replace its arguments with the following:  editTodoItem: function itemId  { … }  This method now receives a to-do item's identifier directly, rather than having to  extract it from the button control. The reason we do this is because this method will  be called from two places: when a to-do item's Edit button is clicked and when the  restoration data is loaded on the starting of the app. Now, replace each instance of  button.getData   in the method with itemId.  Next, we need to create the equivalent event handler method, which extracts the  identifier from a button's data attribute and passes it to editTodoItem. Add the  following method to the controller:  onEditTodoItemClick: function button, e, eOpts  {   this.editTodoItem button.getData   ; },  Now, go to the control attribute in config and replace the call to editTodoItem  with a call to onEditTodoItemClick.  [ 226 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The next step is to do exactly the same thing with the editList method. Replace the  definition of editList with the following code:  editList: function listId  {   … }  Replace each instance of button.getData   in the method with listId. Now, create  the corresponding event handler:  onEditListClick: function button, e, eOpts  {   this.editList button.getData   ; },  Finally, in the control attribute of the controller's config, replace the call to  editList with onEditListClick. This concludes our changes to the Main controller.  Now, edit the Sync controller and add the following attribute immediately before the  doSync method.  This attribute is very important. It signals whether we've done a restore since the  app has been loaded. As restoring the state is a disruptive operation  we don't want  people to suddenly be hoisted to a different screen , we want this to happen first  thing. Note that doSync is called at the end of the startMetaSyncing method. As  this method is called on init, doSync is called as well.  Edit the doSync method and add the following else clause to the end of the   if statement:  } else if  me.restoreOnLoad  {   var store = Ext.getStore 'Restore' ,     record;    if  store.getCount    {     record = store.getAt 0 ;     if  record.get 'currentListId'   {       me.getApplication  .getController 'Main' .editList           record.get 'currentListId'  ;     }     if  record.get 'currentItemId'   {       me.getApplication  .getController 'Main' .editTodoItem            record.get 'currentItemId'  ;     }   }    me.restoreOnLoad = false; }  [ 227 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   After all of our PouchDB stores have loaded, this clause will be executed if it hasn't  already. It loads the list ID and item ID from the store and calls the appropriate  methods in the Main controller to display the relevant view. However, because  doSync is a recursive method, we need to make sure that it's called once more  after the last PouchDB store loads. Replace the itemStore.load   method in the  syncImages branch of the if statement with the following:  itemStore.load function   {   me.doSync false, false, false, false ; } ;  That's it! Commit your changes, start the app, navigate to a list or to-do item,   and then restart the app. After a couple of seconds, it will load the screen that   you viewed previously.  Obviously, this isn't perfect. As the initial sync takes a few seconds, there's a lag in  the restoration process. Ideally, we would show a splash page during the initial sync  and then show the UI after any screen restoration has taken place. Regardless, this is  a good demonstration of the concept.  Cache limits File space is limited. Databases have a tendency to grow out of bounds, so if you're not  careful, you'll end up with more database than you can store. PouchDB is particularly  bad in this regard as it stores the revision history of every document. Whenever you  make a change, you store both the old document and the new document.  Now, we know that the revision history exists to help us resolve conflicts gracefully  in offline scenarios. However, to do this, we only need to save the leaves, the last  revision of a document. Is there a graceful way to get rid of older revisions and   save space?  Fortunately, the answer is yes. When you create a local PouchDB database, you can  set the auto_compaction option to make this behavior default whenever a document  is written. Edit the Sync controller and add the following variable definition to the  init method:  options = { auto_compaction: true },  [ 228 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Now, add this variable to each new PouchDB statement in the method:  listStore.localDB = new PouchDB 'lists', options ; listStore.localMetaDB = itemStore.localMetaDB = new     PouchDB 'metadata', options ; itemStore.localTextDB = new PouchDB 'text', options ; itemStore.localMapsDB = new PouchDB 'maps', options ; itemStore.localImagesDB = new PouchDB 'images', options ;  Do the same thing with the startMetaSyncing method. Add an options variable  to the top of the method and append this variable to each instance of new PouchDB  in the complete event handler at the end of the method. It's worth pointing out that  auto_compaction has no effect on remote databases, so you'll need to run a remote  process to prune these databases if you need to conserve space.  Obviously, this technique doesn't solve the problem that databases grow slowly  over time. PouchDB doesn't provide an easy way to limit the amount of space that  it consumes. However, individual databases are cheap, so you could give each list  its own database and only load databases as needed  or up to some predetermined  limit . This would serve the purpose of restricting the amount of space taken up  locally by your data.  List frequency Beyond limits, you need to think about how this space is used. As with limits,  PouchDB doesn't come with a lot of control here. You have to build the system  yourself. The general pattern holds. Assign one list per database, embed the  frequency metadata in a master database  that you always sync , and then choose  which databases to sync locally based on this data.  Clearing the cache Every once in a while, you just want to clear everything in your local cache and start  over. Thanks to replication, your data will remain secure; it'll just be wiped from  your mobile device. If you sign in again, the data will be synced back to your device.  The reason we don't do this when signing out is to speed up the rate at which your  device resynchronizes with remote changes; though you can certainly clear it if you  want. Clearing the cache is the nuclear option, rarely needed, but important to know  how to do.  [ 229 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Google Chrome To clear the cache in Chrome, do the following:  1.

Let's pause and talk about some real-world scenarios that might affect the  approach that you take in your own apps. We'll use the scenarios in Chapter 1, The Pain  of Being Offline and apply what we've learned so far about offline development. To facilitate the discussion, let's map each scenario to the following three axes:  Usage scenario axes  The three dimensions are Internet speed, Offline frequency, and Space on device.  The more a scenario falls on the left-hand side of the graph, the more optimization  we need to do. If the Internet speed is Slow, users are going to need caching to be  highly prioritized: the most frequently viewed lists and text first and images and  revision history last. If they're offline most of the time, the cache becomes sacred.  Once gone, it's impossible to get it back. If their device is space-constrained, caching  must be highly selective. Frequently viewed items should be cached and items that  are never viewed should be purged to keep the data usage slim.  Let's look at some of the scenarios now.  [ 231 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Going on an off-the-grid vacation Once a year, Carl disappears into the wilderness for a two-week trek along the  Pacific Crest Trail in the Western United States. He does this to get away from  technology. Sometimes, due to the nature of his job, he has to respond to an  important e-mail or take the occasional phone call.  There is no cellular coverage out in the pines. To connect, Carl has to leave the forests  behind and hitch a ride to the nearest hotel. After a hot shower and some real food,  he cracks open his laptop and endures shoddy hotel Wi-Fi for the evening. It's an  inconvenience but a compromise that Carl is willing to accept.  Carl's scenario map  Any apps that Carl uses must have highly-prioritized caching and preserve the  contents of the cache at all costs. However, because Carl has a modern smartphone,  he can store essentially limitless amounts of data on it.  Living in a third-world country Marsha owns an old Nokia phone with an i9 keypad. She has access to a slow GPRS  network, which often goes down. As modern websites are so bandwidth-intensive,  her phone so slow, and online connectivity so tenuous, she turns off images and  media when she browses.  [ 232 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   In the next town, the mobile network is slightly better, but it's a five-mile walk. When  Marsha needs to e-mail photos, she composes draft e-mails and queues them on her  phone. Once a week, she treks into town to deliver milk from their small herd of  cattle. During this time, she is able to send those e-mails. It's a slow and frustrating  experience but she can't do much about it.  Marsha's scenario map  Any apps that Marsha uses must have highly-prioritized and highly-selective  caching, yet cache as much as possible. Due to this, Marsha probably needs an option  to trim the cache to a certain size, rather than nuke it entirely, due to the expense of  repopulating the cache. Better yet, the app could give her the option to specify the  cache size and have the app respect this size automatically.  Commuting on public transportation Elizabeth takes the bus an hour each way on her daily commute. The bus doesn't  have Wi-Fi and encounters several dead zones on the route. She is a dedicated  bibliophile, so these routes are a great opportunity to feed her reading addiction.   As she reads 1-3 books a week, she often runs out of reading material.  [ 233 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   When this happens on the bus, she can't usually do anything about it. Her life is  so busy that she doesn't usually have time to think about downloading new books  before her commute. Maybe she'll bring a paperback along next time for something  to do.  Elizabeth's scenario map  Unlike Carl and Marsha, going offline is more of an annoyance than a serious  problem for Elizabeth. She doesn't need her cache to be highly optimized, so long as  it stores enough data to keep her occupied in the few instances when the Internet is  not available.  Working on a Wi-Fi only device Shawon is 14. On his last birthday, his parents bought him an iPod Touch. He  wanted an iPhone for the coolness factor but, oh well. It's fine. It doesn't have   GPS or a mobile plan, but most of the time it's as good as a real iPhone.  Like most kids, he relies on his parents for transportation and accompanies them on  their errands. As he has a Wi-Fi only device, he often goes somewhere new, only to  have to figure out what the Wi-Fi password is, that is, if the place even has Wi-Fi.  There aren't many Wi-Fi networks without passwords these days.  [ 234 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   When he can't find the password, he has to stay contented with the games and music  that are on his device. However, most of his games require an Internet connection,  which seems odd, particularly for games with a single-player mode.  Shawon's scenario map  This scenario is similar to Elizabeth's in that Shawon has a good Internet connection  and plenty of space on his device. However, he's much less likely to have an Internet  connection because of his Wi-Fi only device. His apps need to have deep caching to  give him plenty to do when he's offline.  Sharing files between mobile devices Francine likes her world where file sharing is so easy and seamless. In 2005, you used  USB drives. In 2015, you share files wirelessly with technology and services such as  Dropbox, Google Drive, and Airdrop. Unfortunately, when her Internet connection  dies, she's transported back to 2005.  [ 235 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Just last week, her editor asked for an update to an outline she wrote. Traveling at  the time, she didn't have easy access to Wi-Fi. She made the changes on her laptop  but couldn't transfer the file to her phone to be e-mailed. After struggling with this  for several minutes, her Airbnb host replied with instructions to connect to the  network. Crisis averted.  Francine's scenario map  This is a slightly different scenario than the last few ones. Most of the time, people  have a pretty good idea of when they'll be without Internet. Business travel is unique  in that you're almost never sure of the kind of connection you'll have once you get  to your final destination. Francine needs her caching to be deep when an Internet  connection isn't present and prioritized to get the most out of a flaky connection.  Streaming high-definition videos from  YouTube Brian streams online videos, a lot. Most of this streaming is over his phone.  His mobile provider is kind of horrible, so he has to deal with dodgy Internet  connectivity. Most of the time, YouTube is very good about decreasing the quality   of the videos to compensate for bad network conditions but it isn't always enough.  He wishes there was a way to get a transcription of the video or just wait for the  entire thing to download before playing. YouTube won't download an entire video  when it's paused. Unfortunately, these features don't exist. Instead, Brian bookmarks  the videos to watch at home.  [ 236 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   In this scenario, Brian is rarely offline. Prioritized caching is the only thing that he  really needs. As he consumes videos at a faster rate than they can be cached, he  wants to be notified when a video is cached and ready to be viewed. Caching video  streams is outside the scope of this book.  Brian's scenario map  Online shopping with your phone Jasmine is not an organized person. She likes taking care of things in the moment as  they come to mind. As a busy professional, she doesn't have the mental resources to  memorize lists and doesn't want to be tied to a to-do app or sheet of paper.  Shopping is one example. Throughout her day, she does a mental inventory as she  moves about. When she spots an item in short supply, she grabs her phone and  places an order with her Amazon app. When she's connected to the Internet, this  works great. When she's not, it frustrates her that she can't take care of things. If only  Amazon provided a better add-to-cart experience for offline users.  [ 237 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   This use case is very close to the to-do app that we've been developing. Let's see how  it maps:  Jasmine's scenario map  Jasmine finds herself offline just enough for it to be annoying. In these scenarios, she  has a task that she wants to perform online and can't. Caching is important only to  the extent that it captures her intent and allows the app to perform the action when  it is back online. When shopping, she might tag the items that she buys frequently,  then she might want to go back and place an order for these items. By caching these   and the actions associated with them , she can.  Getting work done at a conference Conferences are notorious for their abysmal Wi-Fi. Raphael is attending Whole  Design along with 1,500 other attendees. It's a three-day, single-track conference.  On day two, with four hours to go, he is ready to be done fighting for the Wi-Fi  bandwidth. He hasn't gotten much done  besides listen to some great talks . Even his  cell phone, normally reliable, doesn't work here at all.  Every couple of hours, the attendees get a 30-minute break. Raphael uses these  opportunities to sprint outside the venue. Here, he can get a solid 3G connection.  This is enough to check his e-mail, send chats, and generally check in with his world.  At least, it should be. His apps behave as though there's a binary switch between no  bandwidth at all and enough to stream HD video. A third option would be nice.  [ 238 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Raphael's scenario map  This scenario is very like the first one. The difference between Raphael and Carl is  the interval spent offline. Raphael spends hours while Carl spends weeks. Due to  this, prioritized caching is a must but the cache is less sacred as Raphael can refresh  it on a fairly regular basis.  Comparing and contrasting with the  design principles Let's put our phone in the airplane mode and do another quick evaluation against  the principles with the same pass fail scoring as before. Give me uninterrupted access to the content I care about.  This is a pass. Besides maps, the entire app works as expected while offline. Thanks  to PouchDB, even when we can't talk to the online database, our offline database  works just fine. Content is mutable. Don't let my online offline status change that.  This is a pass. The content in our app is perfectly mutable, again thanks to PouchDB. Error messages should not leave me guessing or unnecessarily worried.  This is a pass. In this chapter, we improved the error message that occurs when maps  are not available. Don't let me start something I can't finish.  This is a pass. You can still save changes to the to-do items while offline.  [ 239 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   An app should never contradict itself. If a conflict exists, be honest about it.  This is a pass. Thanks to the improvements in this chapter, when conflicts exist, we  let the users know and allow them to select a resolution. When the laws of physics prevail, choose breadth over depth when caching.  This is a fail. Caching is still pretty dumb. By default, PouchDB caches everything,  which works for now, but it isn't scalable. We'll fix this in the next chapter. Empty states should tell me what to do next in a delightful way.  This is a pass. In this chapter, we added basic empty states to our list views. Users no  longer get a blank stare when no data is present. Don't make me remember what I was doing last. Remember for me.  This is a pass. In this chapter, we implemented stickiness for some of the views  namely, the list of lists view, list of to-do items view, and edit a to-do item view. Degrade gracefully as the network degrades. Don't be jarring.  This is a pass. We do a few things to help here. First, we predict when you're about  to go offline and warn you about it. Next, we retrieve and display the text first, so in  low-bandwidth conditions, you still get value from the app. In addition, when the  synchronization takes a long time, we let you know so that you're not caught unawares. Never purge the cache unless I demand it.  This is a pass. When you sign out, we purge the cache for you.  Where does it need to improve? Thanks to the low-hanging fruit that we addressed in this chapter, our score improved  significantly as compared with the last chapter. The only area with a fail score is  with respect to the caching depth. Instead, we've discussed a variety of scenarios to  inform how rigorous your caching algorithm should be and you should use your best  judgment when selecting one for your app. Our app scores 9 10 at this point.  [ 240 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Summary In this chapter, we addressed some low-hanging fruit to improve the score of  our to-do app. In addition, we took the scenarios from Chapter 1, The Pain of Being  Offline and analyzed each against three criteria that affect a user's offline experience:  connection speed, offline frequency, and device storage. No one strategy fits every  user's needs, but knowing who your users are and what scenarios they experience  can help inform the kind of caching that you implement.  In the next chapter, we'll look at ways to keep your data synchronized when you  lack an Internet connection. Modern smartphones have a wide variety of network  interfaces, including Bluetooth and peer-to-peer Wi-Fi. Let's see how we can keep  our PouchDB databases synchronized using these interfaces.  [ 241 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   www.it-ebooks.info   Networking While Offline  Up until now, our work has followed a predictable pattern. Present a problem,   figure out how to solve it, and implement the solution. This chapter is different.   The problem is real, but the technology isn't in place to actually solve the problem.  The basic premise behind each chapter is that the Internet is required to sync your  data. You can modify it and create new data offline, but to make it stick, you have to  be able to connect to your Cloudant databases.  In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:     What it means to be offline    Device support    Platform-independent libraries    Synchronization over Wi-Fi    Making the setup less painful  [ 243 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   What it means to be offline This basic assumption that the Internet will always be there is a faulty assumption. The  Internet is best described as a graph of servers, each capable of talking to the others:  Network topology  A Server is anything that talks on the Internet: your laptop, your mobile phone,  the machine hosting your Cloudant database, and so on. Offline simply means that  a specific server is no longer able to talk to the other servers on the Internet. Thus,  offline is a matter of perspective.  Server offline  [ 244 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Now, this graph is somewhat dishonest. If you're on a mobile device, all the data  goes through a wireless router. If this router goes down, all the phones sending their  data through this node go offline. This is why, when your Internet goes down, it's  common to ask other people if their Internet is down as well.  Server hierarchy  If you're the only person affected, your device is probably at fault. If other people   are affected at the same time, the fault lies higher in the hierarchy. Sometimes,   entire segments of the Internet go down, affecting all the servers that depend   on the Internet.  To further complicate the issue, a device may communicate with multiple data  sources at the same time. If any of these go down, the apps that depend on them  will enter an offline state, but the other apps will remain online. Thus, it can be more  useful to consider offline connectivity on an app-by-app basis rather than for the  device as a whole.  [ 245 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   So how does this relate to our app? In typical usage, there is a set of mobile devices  all communicating with each other through our Cloudant instance:  To-do app architecture  Unlike the mesh diagram that we showed earlier, these mobile devices cannot  communicate with each other directly. Instead, they write the data to their local  PouchDB instances, which synchronize with Cloudant, triggering an update on   the other mobile databases.  Before I explain why things work this way, understand that PouchDB  does not mandate this model. In the world of PouchDB, every database  is a peer. We synchronize with Cloudant out of convenience, but there's  nothing that says that we can't synchronize mobile devices directly,  avoiding Cloudant entirely. I'm not saying that this is necessarily a superior approach. Cloudant is  always there. When you have Internet connectivity, you always have  something to synchronize with  assuming that Cloudant isn't down .  On the other hand, there's no guarantee that any other mobile devices  are online to sync with. Also, if you only have one mobile device to your  name, Cloudant serves as a backup for your data. You don't have to rely  on other devices for backups.  This becomes interesting if you're offline. If you're offline due to being off the grid   a not so uncommon scenario , how do we synchronize your device with another  device belonging to you or one of your collaborators?  [ 246 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Today, you can't. At least, not in a platform-independent way, using the facilities  provided by modern mobile platforms. Peer-to-peer communication has always  been important but very hard to do well. The widespread adoption of the Internet  has made peer-to-peer communication less important but correspondingly less  considered as well. What we want is a graph as follows:  Desired to-do app architecture  Then, when a mobile device goes offline  that is, can no longer talk to Cloudant , it  can still synchronize with the other mobile devices in the mesh. In the real world,  you often end up with a partitioned network as follows:  Partitioned network  In this scenario, Mobile A and Mobile B can still talk to each other. Either they're   on the same Wi-Fi network  which has lost Internet connectivity  or are off the grid  and relying on some form of mesh network  for example, Bluetooth or peer-to-peer  Wi-Fi . They can synchronize their to-do items as they would when online. In addition, Mobile C is still online and able to talk to Cloudant DB though it can't  talk to Mobile A or Mobile B. When the connectivity is restored, PouchDB can  reconcile any conflicts.  [ 247 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Device support Unfortunately, this is where we run into problems. Support for Internet-free sharing  of data is extremely sparse on mobile platforms. Android supports peer-to-peer   Wi-Fi, Near Field Communication  NFC , Bluetooth, and USB. However, this is  specific to Android. If you want access to these features on iOS or Windows Phone,  you're out of luck. Let's start by inspecting the support provided by Android,   then evaluate a couple of libraries that can be used to emulate this functionality   on other platforms.  Open http:  developer.android.com guide topics connectivity  in your  browser and note the support for the following interfaces.  Bluetooth Bluetooth is a protocol with a typical range of 10 meters. If you're sharing data with  someone in the same room, Bluetooth is a good choice. Let's see what the sharing  process looks like:  Bluetooth pairing process  [ 248 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   There are a few things that we could do to make this process simpler. First,   we could turn on discoverability automatically. Second, we could perform periodic  scans in the background. Third, we could save pairings, so you only need to pair  the first time. Finally, we could make choosing a device and synchronizing the same  action  assuming that the devices are already paired . This results in the following  optimal workflow:  Bluetooth sharing  simplified   One unintended side effect is that we lose Cloudant's ability  to mediate the authentication. We need a way to distribute the  authentication so that our offline apps know who has permission  to edit which lists. Obviously, we don't want to share these secrets  with all the devices that share a copy of our PouchDB database.  PouchDB provides a feature that allows you to store local documents. A local  document is never replicated and exists only in the database on which it was  created. We can store private information here, such as Secure Shell  SSH  keys and  credentials, without fear that others will get them. The particular encryption method  that you use is up to you, but I recommend some form of hashing algorithm.  NFC NFC is used to describe a variety of protocols, each with a shorter range than  Bluetooth—typically 10 cm or less. This is a good distance for two people who are  next to one another.  Unlike Bluetooth, there are many incompatible implementations of NFC, so this  is probably most useful as a backup to Bluetooth unless you know the hardware  specifications of the devices that will be using your app in advance. Additionally,  NFC is anywhere from 10 to 100 times slower than Bluetooth, so take this into  consideration as well.  [ 249 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   NFC has the concept of tags. Tags are small blocks of memory, which can be read  by another device without turning on the host device. This is why you can pay for  merchandise with your phone without turning it on. Depending on the storage  requirements of your app, you could theoretically let another person synchronize  with your phone without turning it on. Pretty slick.  Also, as NFC requires such close proximity between devices, this can be a security  benefit though you'll probably want to require a passcode or biometric check before  permitting the data to be synchronized.  Peer-to-peer Wi-Fi Peer-to-peer  or ad hoc  Wi-Fi is a technique that allows two devices to share the  data directly without going through a router. As with normal Wi-Fi, it has a range of  approximately 100 meters, which allows people in the same home to share data. In  addition, Wi-Fi has a greater throughput than either Bluetooth or NFC, allowing for  quick synchronization.  The process of pairing is very similar to Bluetooth. However, you only need to enable  peer-to-peer Wi-Fi; a confirmation of each pairing is not required. In addition, Wi-Fi  has the ability for one device to act as a router, allowing other devices to connect and  form their own mesh network. This permits a group of people to synchronize their  apps simultaneously, something that neither Bluetooth or NFC can do easily.  Platform-independent libraries Now that we've had an overview of the different protocols available, let's look at  a few libraries to help you implement these connections. First, the bad news: there  are no platform-independent options for Bluetooth, NFC, or USB. The good news:  platform-independent synchronization over Wi-Fi is possible as long as you're  willing to manually create an ad hoc network on one device and connect to it from  the other device.  USB From a security and reliability standpoint, it's hard to beat wires. The primary  problem with USB is that not all mobile devices include a USB port. However, if a  port is available, this is a great way to share data between two devices. It avoids the  complicated pairing of wireless protocols, relying only on a hard-wired connection.  You'll still want authenticate, but you don't have to worry about other people  eavesdropping on the connection—something that all wireless connections have   to worry about  though the shorter the range, the less of a concern this is .  [ 250 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Bluetooth It's theoretically possible to connect iOS devices together over Bluetooth,   but this requires a Made For iPhone certification. For more information about   the MFi certification, see the following website: https:  developer.apple.com  programs mfi   It is not currently possible  as of Android 5.1.1 Lollipop  to connect iOS and Android  devices together, though once a bug is resolved on the Android side, it will be  possible to do so using a low energy Bluetooth. The bug report for this issue can be  found at https:  code.google.com p android issues detail?id=58725  NFC Currently  as of iOS 8.4 , Apple has not exposed NFC support to third-party  developers. In contrast, Android support for NFC is quite good, and you can find  many Cordova plugins that support this. Unfortunately, as none of these support  iOS, you can't depend on NFC as a platform-independent technology. Here's one  plugin: https:  github.com chariotsolutions phonegap-nfc  Wi-Fi P2P Unfortunately, there are no libraries that support this fully as managing Wi-Fi is a  system feature that the OS doesn't want apps to be able to override. Android lets you  scan for all the visible networks, allowing you to prompt the user to select one. This  is only for Android; iOS does not let you scan networks through their APIs.  Here's one plugin that you can use for Android: https:  github. com HondaDai PhoneGap-WifiInfoPlugin  In iOS 7, Apple introduced a framework for Multipeer Connectivity. This allows   you to easily expose services using a combination of Wi-Fi networks, peer-to-peer  Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. This is iOS-specific, but if you only care about this platform,  you might find it helpful. No Cordova plugins exist for this functionality, but you  can see the raw API documents here:  https:  developer.apple.com library ios documentation  MultipeerConnectivity Reference MultipeerConnectivityFramework   [ 251 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Beyond this, the only way to share data over Wi-Fi in a platform-independent way  is to have a device that supports the creation of ad hoc networks and then connect to  this network from other devices. As iOS devices don't support the manual creation   of ad hoc networks, you'll need to pair them with a device that does so  for example,  a laptop .  USB Apple has famously not provided iOS devices with a USB port. Thus, cross-platform  synchronization over USB isn't possible. However, Android has a good support for  USB-based data transfer. See the following page for more information:  http:  developer.android.com guide topics connectivity usb   Synchronization over Wi-Fi Now that we've surveyed the landscape, Wi-Fi seems to be our best option for offline  synchronization. Let's go through the process of setting up an ad hoc network,  synchronizing PouchDB over this connection, and then reconciling any conflicts  when we go back online.  Setting up the P2P connection These instructions assume that you have an OS X laptop. The instructions for  Windows are similar. On your laptop, do the following:  1.  Click on the Wi-Fi status icon in your status bar:  Wi-Fi status icon  2.  Click on Create Network…. 3.  Name the network Todo App and click on Create.  Notice how the Wi-Fi status icon has changed:  Peer-to-peer Wi-Fi status icon  [ 252 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Now, connect to this network on your iPhone  or other mobile device .  1.  Open Settings. 2.  Choose Wi-Fi. 3.  Select the Todo App network. 4.  Click on Join Anyway.  You've now created a P2P network between your laptop and mobile device. You're  also offline. Next, we'll implement support for offline syncing between these devices.  Assigning an IP address to each device When you connect to an ad hoc Wi-Fi connection, you have to assign an IP address  to each device, manually. Traditionally, when you connect to a router, the router  has a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol  DHCP  server that assigns you an  IP address automatically when you connect. We don't have this. You could use  something such as Bonjour or Zeroconf to make this easier, but setting these   services up is outside of the scope of this book.  Assign an IP address to your laptop using the following steps:  1.  Open System Preferences. 2.  Choose Network. 3.  Select Wi-Fi. 4.  Click on Advanced…. 5.  Choose TCP IP. 6.  Choose Manually from the Configure IPv4 drop-down menu. 7.  Enter 192.168.1.1 in the IPv4 Address field. 8.  Enter 255.255.255.0 in the Subnet Mask field. 9.  Click on OK.  Assign an IP address to your iOS device using the following steps:  1.  Open Settings. 2.  Choose Wi-Fi. 3.  Click on the i icon next to the Todo App entry. 4.  Choose the Static tab. 5.  Enter 192.168.1.2 in the IP Address field. 6.  Enter 255.255.255.0 in the Subnet Mask field.  [ 253 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Testing the connection Start the to-do app on the laptop. Instead of localhost, use the IP address that you  configured for the laptop:  $ open 192.168.1.1:1841  Now, see whether your mobile device can view the to-do app on this IP address.  Open Safari  or the mobile browser of your choice  and navigate to this IP address.  You should see the app get loaded normally:  Viewing the to-do app through the browser  [ 254 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Implement support for offline syncing Making these devices talk to one another isn't enough. CouchDB communicates  through a Representational State Transfer  REST  API. In order to sync across  devices, we need to expose this API over at least one of the offline devices that  we want to sync. Unfortunately, there's no way to expose an HTTP socket on iOS   and doing so on Android is finicky , so syncing two mobile devices together isn't  possible. You'll need a laptop.  1.  Open http:  couchdb.apache.org. 2.  Click on DOWNLOAD. 3.  Choose the appropriate version for your platform and download it. 4.  Once the download is completed, run the application.  On OS X, you may   need to right-click the file and click Open.   Now, you have an instance of CouchDB running on your local machine. Let's create  the databases needed by our app. This setup should exactly mirror what we've  configured on our remote Cloudant instance:  1.  Click on Create Database. 2.  Enter metadata in the Database Name field. 3.  Click on Create. 4.  Repeat these steps for the remaining databases: lists, text, maps, and images.  To keep these databases in sync with our Cloudant instance, you'll want to set up a  continuous replication between them:  1.  Under the Tools menu, click on Replicator. 2.  Under Replicate changes from, choose Local database. 3.  Choose metadata from the drop-down menu. 4.  Under Replicate changes to, choose Remote database. 5.  Paste the URL to the remote metadata database. Substitute your username  and password: https:  username:password@username.cloudant.com  metadata  6.  Check the Continuous box.  [ 255 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   7.  Click on Replicate.  Wait for a few seconds. If you see the following ok event displayed, the  replication is working correctly:  Replication success  Repeat these steps for the remaining databases: lists, text, maps, and images. This  sets up a unidirectional replication from your local CouchDB to Cloudant. To make  the replication bidirectional, repeat all of the steps once more but replicate the  changes from the remote database to the corresponding local database. When you're done, click on Status under the Tools menu; you should see a set of  replication events similar to the following:  Replication status  [ 256 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Now that your local CouchDB is up and running correctly, the last thing that you  need to do is switch the URLs in your to-do app so that they point at the local  instance instead of Cloudant. This is obviously a contrived example. We'll talk about  ways to make this setup less painful in the next section.  Edit todo-app app controller Sync.js and replace the remote DB initialization  lines with the following  You may want to comment the existing lines as this is just a  temporary change. :  listStore.remoteDB = new PouchDB 'http:  192.168.1.1:5984 lists' ; itemStore.remoteTextDB = new     PouchDB 'http:  192.168.1.1:5984 text' ; itemStore.remoteMapsDB = new     PouchDB 'http:  192.168.1.1:5984 maps' ; itemStore.remoteImagesDB = new     PouchDB 'http:  192.168.1.1:5984 images' ; itemStore.remoteMetaDB = new     PouchDB 'http:  192.168.1.1:5984 metadata' ;  Now, rebuild the to-do app and reload it on your laptop and mobile device. Notice  how the devices continue to synchronize while offline.  Making the setup less painful Technically, we've enabled offline synchronization between devices, but our  approach is littered with caveats:     Offline syncing only works over Wi-Fi    Requires a laptop to perform synchronization     Involves a manual setup of a separate CouchDB database, a peer-to-peer   Wi-Fi connection, and static IP addresses     Cannot sync two mobile devices together  unless syncing through a laptop     Have to edit the source code to switch to offline mode  A lot of these reasons are due to technical constraints. Let's go through each point  and understand what the ideal solution would be, whether possible today or not.  There's a huge opportunity for mobile device manufacturers to improve the current  state of offline synchronization in a platform-independent way.  [ 257 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Multiprotocol sync What if any of the wireless protocols on your phone could be used to sync with  other phones? Apps could choose the right one based on the security, energy, and  performance requirements of the application, and synchronization would just work  with a pairing workflow identical across all the wireless protocols:  Platform-independent sync workflow  In this way, users remain unaware of the protocol used. All they care about is their  ability to share data. Whether it's accomplished over Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC, or  pigeon carrier is irrelevant.  Furthermore, this workflow is simple. If the scanning and synchronization occur  automatically in the background, the user only needs to select a device and pair with  it. The best way to encourage behavior is to remove friction from the equation. This  solution does exactly this.  Services on a mobile Phones and tablets have replaced laptops and desktops in popularity. These devices  run on less powerful operating systems and aren't capable of hosting the types of  services that a server, desktop, or laptop can. However, what if they could?  Earlier in the chapter, we showed the way the to-do app architecture is designed today:  To-do app architecture  [ 258 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   A big reason for this is that mobile devices have historically not hosted services the  way a laptop, desktop, or server does now. Mobile devices are designed to be as  energy-efficient as possible. Hosting an always-on web server runs contrary to this  ideal. This is why, in our preceding example, we required a laptop in order to initiate  offline synchronization.  Any solution must take the limitations of the mobile into account. The  synchronization should be done only when needed, as quickly and efficiently as  possible, and in the background. This last bit is especially important. If we allow  devices to synchronize only when people are using them, we add a lot more friction  to the experience.  Here are a few examples:  User A creates a to-do list and then turns off the phone.  User B opens the app, but because User A isn't using their phone, the app fails   to sync.  Now User A and User B are interacting with different sets of data.  The old-school approach of I've turned my phone on, now you turn  your phone on and let's sync puts too much effort on people. It's vital  that mobile operating systems provide a way for third-party apps  to synchronize over wireless protocols without the phones being  physically turned on.  This might result in additional restrictions. For example, when phones are off, only  low-energy Bluetooth or NFC may be used, whereas when phones are on, Wi-Fi  may be used. This is a performance compromise but an acceptable one. Data may  synchronize more slowly, but because people aren't using their phones, they won't  notice. In this scenario, reserving battery life is more important than synchronizing  data as quickly as possible.  The end result is what we want: mobile phones capable of forming mesh networks  while offline and synchronizing the data among themselves without being turned on.  The technology is here; we just need Apple, Google, and Microsoft to pay attention.  Zero configuration networking It's not acceptable to expect people to know how to configure an ad hoc network.  Devices should just know how to connect to each other in a secure and simple way.  There are many competing protocols that accomplish this but very few that do so in  a platform-independent way.  [ 259 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Distributed networking is an approach where every device is a peer, capable of  self-organizing in a coherent network. The only important thing is the connection  between devices. As long as you can trace a line from one device to another through  a series of intermediate devices, the network will function as any other. In this  scenario, being offline simply means that there's no way to trace a connection to the  device that you want to talk to.  The downside is that there are few platform-independent libraries  that implement decentralized networking. DNS and DHCP are  by far the most popular approaches, and there's little interest in  replacing them with a competing network stack.  In iOS 7, Apple released the Multipeer Connectivity framework. This framework  doesn't quite implement the mesh network that we've described but does provide  a basic ability to discover other devices nearby and connect to these devices, all  while offline. Obviously, the industry still has a long way to go to provide zero  configuration networking services to all offline devices, regardless of the platform,  but we're making gradual progress.  Automatic switching to offline mode Once all of these other areas are sorted, we'd have the technology necessary to be  aware of the devices in our proximity, the services they support, and to transfer data  back and forth regardless of their offline state. Advanced mesh networks exist but  primarily in academia and industry, not something the average consumer can benefit  from. What would a consumer-friendly mesh networking solution look like? Obviously, we're not going to move the world away from Domain Name System   DNS  and DHCP anytime soon. In the same way that IPv6 has had to coexist  with IPv4, we need to make sure that our applications can transition smoothly  from a centralized networking model to a distributed model. In an ideal world, the  underlying OS would handle this transition automatically, but in the short term,  realistically, we'll need to do some of the heavy lifting in the application layer using  frameworks such as Apple's Multipeer Connectivity.  [ 260 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The key is detecting whether we're online or offline, determined by whether we  can talk to our remote Cloudant instance. If we can, we assume a centralized  architecture. If we can't, we shift to a decentralized architecture. Thus, the  architecture diagrams that we showed earlier are both true depending on how  individual devices see themselves. It becomes interesting when you have an offline  device that wants to synchronize with an online device. There are, then, three  scenarios that we should consider:  Online architecture  As this is the design that we've implemented, I won't say much about it, except that  most of the time, for most users, this is the architecture that will be in use. When  multiple mobile users are in the same general proximity and connected to the Internet  via Wi-Fi and the network goes down, they'll be thrust into the following scenario:  Offline architecture  [ 261 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   As mobile devices can connect to the Internet via Wi-Fi or cellular, they will  automatically switch networks and try to regain connectivity. In the meantime, any  apps on these phones should try to form mesh networks to keep apps talking to each  other. As phones slowly begin to connect to the Internet again, the architecture will  shift yet again:  Mixed architecture  This is the most interesting diagram of the three and most representative of the real  world in general. Some devices have Internet connectivity, others don't, and data can  be transferred between the haves and have nots.  If the total number of devices is large and the number connected to the Internet is  small, there may not be enough bandwidth to go around. In this case, the apps may  decide to continue synchronizing with each other. Otherwise, the offline devices can  use the online devices as a bridge to talk directly with Cloudant.  It's worth noting that this scenario is very advanced and no modern operating  system handles it gracefully. This is a very common scenario in highly dense  gatherings of people with sparse bandwidth but also in any scenario where a  noncellular device is within the Wi-Fi range of a network with Internet connectivity.  As designers and developers, the best that we can do today is use whatever  frameworks have been made available and encourage those in the industry to   reach across the aisle and provide us with the tools that we need to build a truly  platform-independent peer-to-peer network.  [ 262 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Summary In this chapter, we explored the various ways that offline synchronization is done  today. We implemented a crude version using peer-to-peer Wi-Fi and looked in  depth at ways in which the industry could improve the current situation in order   to allow designers and developers to deliver more compelling offline solutions.  In the next chapter, we'll end by doing a holistic evaluation of our to-do app,  investigating ways to test the app in the real world and providing ideas for   future improvement.  [ 263 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   www.it-ebooks.info   Testing and   Measuring the UX  Congratulations! You've designed and written your first offline-first app. We've  taken the principles of offline-first web development, seen how they apply to the  realities of software development, and pushed the boundaries of today's technology.  Keep in mind that the result of our efforts is a starting point and not the embodiment  of everything an offline-first app can be. Where you go from here is up to you.  So, what's next? You've probed and prodded at the concepts, but now it's time to  take what you've learned and apply it to your own applications where these lessons  really matter. One reason why we explored the problems and design first is because  technology is constantly changing, but human needs and behaviors remain relatively  constant. By ordering the discussion in this way, you'll be able to separate the  essence of the solution from the particulars of your software stack.  This said, I hope the technical details have been every bit as interesting as the softer  concepts. The CouchDB ecosystem is full of fascinating, groundbreaking tools, which  make offline-first development easier than ever before. Sencha Touch and Cordova  are a very competent pair, making cross-platform mobile development a breeze.  We stuck with the visual defaults for the most part, but Sencha Touch is quite easy  to style and customize if you want. Just remember that the tools you use, while  important, are never as important as the problem you're solving.  The design and implementation aside, there's one aspect of software development  that we've completely ignored. Writing software is important, but setting  expectations and verifying that it meets these expectations is just as important. The  reason we've ignored it is because we wanted to keep each chapter as lean and  focused as possible. In this chapter, we'll touch on what it means to test and measure  the experience of an offline-first app.  [ 265 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Unlike traditional apps, we have two baselines: an offline baseline, when the Internet  is not available, and an online baseline, when the Internet is available. We must test  both of these scenarios and verify that the app is just as robust when online as it is  when offline  or at least, anticipates the differences and handles them appropriately .  We'll discuss ways to test the app and measure the improvements that we've made  in a quantifiable way.  Manual testing As you write an app, you want to verify that it works as expected. When you   make changes to the app, you want confidence that you haven't inadvertently   broken something.  While you can use a testing framework to verify the functionality, an easier  approach, particularly for simple apps, is to exercise the UI yourself. To ensure that  this is done in a consistent and reproducible way, write the test scripts for yourself   or another person to follow. Let's write a few scripts now.  Creating a to-do item The first test is to create a to-do item, add the text, maps, and an image, then verify  that each of these data points have been saved. You will need two devices: one to  create the to-do item and the other to verify that the data has synchronized correctly.  1.  Start the app on the first mobile device and click on Sign in. 2.  Enter your username and password and click on Sign in. 3.  Click on Add. 4.  Enter Test in the Name field and click on Create. 5.  Click on Edit for the to-do list that you just created. 6.  Click on Add. 7.  Enter Test Item in the Description field. 8.  Click on Select and choose an image. 9.  Click on Set. 10.  Select a point on the map. 11.  Click on Set. 12.  Click on Create.  [ 266 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   At this point, you should have created a to-do list named Test and to-do item named  To-do Item. The to-do item should have an image and a map location selected. Now,  verify that this data has synchronized successfully:  1.  Start the app on the second mobile device and click on Sign in. 2.  Enter your username and password and click on Sign in. 3.  Click on Edit for the to-do list named Test. 4.  Click on Edit for the to-do item named Item. 5.  Verify that all the data fields are present with the correct values.  Adding and removing collaborators The second test is to take the to-do list that you created in the first test and manage  collaborators. We'll add a collaborator, make a change as that collaborator, remove  the collaborator, and verify that the collaborator no longer has permission to view or  edit the list. You can perform this test with a single device, but multiple devices may  be simpler as you can log in as a different user on each device.  1.  Start the app on the first mobile device and click on Sign in. 2.  Enter the username and password of the first user. 3.  Click on Share for the Test to-do list. 4.  Click on Add. 5.  Enter the username of the second user in the Name field. 6.  Click on Share. 7.  Click on Back.  You've granted collaborator privileges to the second user. Now, log in as this user  and verify that you can see and make changes to the list:  1.  Start the app on the second mobile device and click on Sign in. 2.  Enter the username and password of the second user. 3.  Click on Edit for the Test to-do list. 4.  Click on Edit for the Item to-do item. 5.  Change the Description to Item 2 and click on Save.  [ 267 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Now that you've made a change as a collaborator, switch back to the first device and  verify that the change was synchronized:  1.  On the first mobile device, click on Edit for the Test to-do list. 2.  Verify that the name of the to-do item is Item 2. 3.  Click on Back.  The next step is to remove the collaborator from the Test to-do list:  1.  On the first mobile device, click on Share for the Test to-do list. 2.  Click on Unshare for the collaborator that you created. 3.  On the second mobile device, verify that the Test to-do list is no longer visible.  The bandwidth notifications The final test is to make sure that the app sends appropriate notifications about the  online offline state and the quality of bandwidth during synchronization operations.  You only need a single device for this test case. You may need to prime the last test  step by going out of range, then retracing your steps, and repeating them:  1.  Start the app on your mobile device. 2.  Verify that the message online :-  is displayed in the footer. 3.  Put the device in the airplane mode. 4.  Verify that the message offline :-  is displayed in the footer. 5.  Turn off the airplane mode and go somewhere with poor cellular reception    3G or less .  6.  Create a new to-do item and add a large image. 7.  Click Create. 8.  Wait for the following messages to appear in the footer after the    specified delay: Syncing… immediately  Taking a bit longer… 10 seconds  Still working… 30 seconds  Find faster Internet?  1 minute  Are you on GPRS?  10 minutes?   9.  After 30 minutes have elapsed, verify that a message box appears. 10.  Click OK to dismiss the message box.  [ 268 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   11.  Start walking away quickly from the signal. 12.  When you're 10 seconds away from out of range, verify that Going offline   soon :-  appears in the footer.  Cleaning up To get ready for the next round of testing, open the app and delete all the lists. You'll  start the next round of testing with a clean slate. These tests are not exhaustive but  enough to give you a rough idea of how well the app is working. In theory, 100% test  coverage is attractive but adhering to the 80-20 principle and just checking the major  scenarios is probably enough.  Testing frameworks At some point, you may decide that you're tired of running through test scripts  whenever you make a code change. Fortunately, there are testing frameworks that  can automate this tedious task, though writing and maintaining tests for these  frameworks is its own kind of tediousness. You can use the scripts that you've  already written and adapt them for whatever framework you choose. One popular  option is Bryntum Siesta.  Bryntum Siesta Siesta is a functional testing framework that runs in the browser. To use it, you write  a series of test scripts that exercise the functionality of your app, load the framework  in the browser of your choice, and run the scripts, watching them onscreen as they  execute. Siesta closely emulates the experience of an actual person. It can click and  input text in elements as needed.  Installing Siesta To get Siesta up and running, we need to download Siesta Lite from Bryntum, create  a harness file, and move the appropriate resources over to our app. This establishes  the basic framework that we need to start writing tests:  1.  Open www.bryntum.com in your browser. 2.  Click on PRODUCTS. 3.  Click on Siesta. 4.  Click on Download Siesta Lite. 5.  Under todo-app , create a directory named tests .  [ 269 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   In this directory, create a file named index.js.  6.  7.  Put the following code in this file:  var Harness = Siesta.Harness.Browser.SenchaTouch;  Harness.configure {   itle : 'Todo App',   viewportWidth: 320,   viewportHeight: 600 } ;  Harness.start    {      group : 'Todo app tests',     hostPageUrl : ' ',     performSetup : false,     items : [           TODO: Tests go here     ]    }   ;  8.  Now, create another file named index.html, which references index.js. 9.  Add the following code to this file:        <link rel="stylesheet" type="text css" href="  cdn.sencha.com  ext gpl 5.1.0 packages ext-theme-crisp build resources ext-theme- crisp-all.css"  > <link rel="stylesheet" type="text css" href="siesta resources css  siesta-all.css">  <script type="text javascript" src="  cdn.sencha.com ext  gpl 5.1.0 build ext-all.js">   <  script>              [ 270 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   10.  Create another directory named siesta  under the tests directory. 11.  Move the following files from the Siesta archive that you downloaded to the   same paths under the siesta directory: siesta-all.js resources   You're done!  Siesta UI  Before we go any further, start your app. Open http:  localhost:8081 tests  index.html in your browser. If the Siesta UI comes up, you're good. Commit   your changes.  Writing a test Now that Siesta is up and running, let's write a test to show how the Siesta tests  work. We won't write a test for every scenario that we identified in the previous  section, just the first.  Create a new file named todo-app tests 01_add_todo_item.t.js and add the  following code:  StartTest function t  {   t.chain      t.diag "Add a todo item" ,     {waitFor: 'CQ', args: '>>todo-lists'},  [ 271 ]  www.it-ebooks.info       {click: '>>todo-lists button[action=new]'},     {waitFor: 'CQ', args: '>>todo-list-new'},     function next  {       var field = t.cq1 '>>textfield[name=name]' ;       field.setValue 'Test' ;       next  ;     },     {waitFor: 'CQ', args: '>>textfield[value=Test]'},     {click: '>>todo-list-new button[action=create]'},     {waitFor: 'CQ', args: '>>todo-lists'},     {waitForMs: 1000},     {click: '>>todo-list-dataitem button[action=edit]'},     {waitFor: 'CQ', args: '>>todo-list'},     {click: '>>todo-list button[action=new]'},     {waitFor: 'CQ', args: '>>todo-new'},     function next  {       var field = t.cq1 '>>textfield[name=description]' ;       field.setValue 'Item' ;       next  ;     },     {waitFor: 'CQ', args: '>>textfield[value=Item]'},     {click: '>>todo-new button[action=create]'},     {waitFor: 'CQVisible', args: '>>todo-list'},     function next  {       t.ok t.cq1 '>>todo-list label[html=Item]'  ;       next  ;     }    ; } ;  Let's walk through this test step by step and I'll explain what's happening.  StartTest function t  {  Every test lives in a block like this, letting Siesta know where the test starts and ends.  Next, we'll provide a call to t.chain  , which provides Siesta with the steps of the  test in order.  t.chain    This function takes a variable number of arguments, then executes them in the given  order. Each argument represents a step in the test. Next, let's give the test a title.  t.diag "Add a todo item" ,  [ 272 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   This lets the user know what the test is about at a high level. Siesta supports a  Behavior Driven Development  BDD  style as well, which gives people even more  insight into what we're testing. See the Siesta documentation if you're interested in  learning more.  Next, let's provide the first actual step in the test.  {waitFor: 'CQ', args: '>>todo-lists'},  Before any test starts, we want to ensure that the application is in a good place to  start receiving commands. This statement waits for the list of to-do lists to appear.  Now that the application is ready for events, let's click something.  {click: '>>todo-lists button[action=new]'},  This statement uses a query to find an element and then clicks this element. In this  case, we're looking for the button used to create new to-do lists. Let's wait for the  next screen to show up.  {waitFor: 'CQ', args: '>>todo-list-new'},  You'll notice this pattern as we go through the rest of the test. Every time we go to a  new screen, we have to wait for this screen to appear before taking our next action.  Now that the to-do list creation screen is visible, let's fill out the form.  function next  {   var field = t.cq1 '>>textfield[name=name]' ;   field.setValue 'Test' ;   next  ; },  This method is a single step in the test. When you have a step that's more complex  than a single statement, you can wrap it in a method. Just be sure to call next   at  the end of the method. All we do here is query for textfield called name and assign  it a value.  Let's confirm that the field has been set properly before creating the to-do list.  {waitFor: 'CQ', args: '>>textfield[value=Test]'},  This done, we can click on create.  {click: '>>todo-list-new button[action=create]'},  We wait for the lists of to-do lists to appear.  {waitFor: 'CQ', args: '>>todo-lists'},  [ 273 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Now, let's pause for a second before proceeding.  {waitForMs: 1000},  Normally, using waitForMs in a test is a bad idea because it inserts a fixed delay  instead of letting the app tell us when it's ready to proceed. However, it is very  useful when you're debugging a test as it allows you to slow down the test for  observation purposes. I use it here just to demonstrate that use case.  Next, let's edit the to-do list that we just created and wait for the to-do list screen to  become visible.  {click: '>>todo-list-dataitem button[action=edit]'}, {waitFor: 'CQ', args: '>>todo-list'},  Now, let's repeat the creation process but for a to-do item this time.  {click: '>>todo-list button[action=new]'}, {waitFor: 'CQ', args: '>>todo-new'}, function next  {   var field = t.cq1 '>>textfield[name=description]' ;   field.setValue 'Item' ;   next  ; }, {waitFor: 'CQ', args: '>>textfield[value=Item]'}, {click: '>>todo-new button[action=create]'}, {waitFor: 'CQVisible', args: '>>todo-list'},  Once the to-do list is visible again, let's end the test by ensuring that the to-do item  was created.  function next  {   t.ok t.cq1 '>>todo-list label[html=Item]'  ;   next  ; }  This method uses t.ok   to verify that an entry has been created for the new to-do  item. If the to-do item exists, the test passes. If not, it fails.  Finally, add a reference to this test in index.js. Replace the to-do comment with the  name of this test:  items : [    '01_add_todo_item.t.js' ]  [ 274 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Now, open http:  localhost:8081 tests index.html in your browser. Select  the test that you just created and click Run test. Expand the DOM panel and watch  as the test executes. If the test passes successfully, you're done! If not, you'll see a  screen similar to the following with a log output to help you debug:  Commit your changes.  Failed test run  Before and after Thanks to our testing, we have verified that the app is functional. However, this is not  the only way to evaluate the experience. We set out to write an app that maintains the  rigor of an offline-only experience while augmenting it with online-only functionality.  Let's compare the before and after and see how far we've come.  [ 275 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Before – offline only Open your todo-app folder and reset the app to the state it was in at the close   of Chapter 2, Building a To-do App. Now, start the app and walk through the  experience to refresh your memory. At this point, with a fully offline experience,   you can do the following:     Create a to-do list    Add remove items from the to-do lists    Add remove a description from a to-do item    Add remove an image from a to-do item    Delete a to-do list  After – offline plus online Now, reset the app to the state it was in at the close of Chapter 7, Choosing Intelligent  Defaults. Walk through the same experience and note the differences. Verify that the  app retains all of the functionality noted in the previous section. This functionality  represents the base functionality that should operate regardless of an app's   online offline status. Test the app in both the states, offline and online.  When online, the app should additionally support the following features:  1.  Add remove a map from a to-do item. 2.  Sign in with your credentials. 3.  Sign out. 4.  Share a to-do list with a collaborator. 5.  Revoke a collaborator's privileges. 6.  Synchronize to-do lists with other devices. 7.  8.   Indication of the online offline status of the app. Indication of difficulty in synchronizing the app.  There are a couple of takeaways here. First, we've successfully translated the  robustness of an offline app to its online experience. This is a big deal. Not many  apps can claim this.  Second, adding an online functionality is very complicated. Our initial offline  attempt consisted of roughly 750 lines of MVC code. After adding the online  functionality, we're now up to 2,500 lines of code. That's 333% more code, excluding  tests. Code is an expensive liability. Don't underestimate the amount of time you'll  need in order to get your app working properly in an online context.  [ 276 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   This has a couple of implications. First, think carefully about whether you really  need to build an online experience for the people who use your software. In the case  of our to-do app, the synchronization of to-do lists is a must-have, so it was a good  decision. This said, don't blindly assume that you need online capability in your  application. Do your research. The second implication is that if you decide to make  your app online-capable, keep the following in mind:     Design and build the offline experience first    Adhere to the offline-first design principles    Test, test, test  If you keep these in mind, you'll do okay. Never underestimate the difficulty; break  the problem into small discrete chunks and give yourself plenty of time to build the  right thing the right way. You'll end up with an excellent experience for the people  who depend on the thing that you've built.  Future improvements We've come a long way, but we could take the experience even further. Let's talk  about the current limitations of the app and some of the more complicated offline  improvements that we've deferred until now.  Conflict resolution Right now, the app can only resolve conflicts for the description of each to-do item.  To do the same for maps and images, you'll need to implement a custom conflict  resolution UI for each of these data types. This boils down to diff algorithms. You  need a clear and efficient way to show the difference between an arbitrary number  of different items. For text, this is relatively easy. For images and other binary data  types, this is harder but not impossible. Search the Internet for image comparison  algorithms if you're interested in learning more.  The cache size limits At the moment, we cache everything. This is a trivial approach that works for our  to-do app, but when you start dealing with large datasets, you'll need to think about  ways to page the data in and out as needed. With PouchDB, the best way to do this  is to think of databases as pages. No individual database should be able to grow to a  size that your device cannot store.  [ 277 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Right now, we store all the text in a database, all the images in a database, all the  maps in a database, and so on. In a world where storage isn't infinite, you'll need  to alter this scheme. One approach would be to give each to-do list or to-do item  its own database. In CouchDB, databases are cheap, so this is actually an effective  strategy. In more traditional SQL databases, you might choose to map each to-do list  to a table instead.  Account management We avoided a lot of code by relying on Cloudant's built-in user management.  Unfortunately, this means that user accounts must be set up manually. Any serious  app must include account management capabilities. This can either be done in-app  or on an external website. The former is a better experience but the latter may be  required anyway. For example, if you set up an account and then lose your phone,  you need a way to reset your password or view your data without access to the app.  Offline Maps Another limitation is that our use of Google Maps requires an Internet connection.  If you start the app while offline, Google Maps will refuse to load. This is very poor  behavior. HTML5 introduces the concept of an application cache. If you specify a  cache manifest, the browser will use the local copy of any specified files and update  automatically when the remote copy changes.  To implement this, you need to create a cache manifest and add every URL used  by Google Maps. If you plan to use the app with Firefox or Chrome—browsers  notorious for their aggressive caching behavior—you may need to override how   they cache your app as well.  Alternatively, you can use the Google Static Maps API to cache maps as  images, which can circumvent this problem but at a higher storage cost.  For more information about static maps, see the following link: https:  developers.google.com maps documentation  static-maps   [ 278 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Granular sync indicators Right now, the app tells you when the synchronization is happening. This is fine,  but it's also useful to tell people which lists or items are being synchronized. If I see  that my grocery list is being updated, I might hold off making changes to it until  I see how it changed. Similarly, when I first start the app, I want the app to load  its own configuration and metadata before showing me a potentially outdated UI.  We haven't implemented a splash screen, but ordinarily you'd execute these initial  loading operations while the splash screen is displayed.  Offline sync In the last chapter, we discussed the current state of cross-platform peer-to-peer  synchronization. It's not great. Your best bet is to use peer-to-peer Wi-Fi, but even  that path is fraught with peril. To improve in this area, the major mobile device  manufacturers will need to get behind industry standards that allow mobile devices  to easily share data and form mesh networks, which allow groups of devices to  retain elements of the online experience.  Summary In this chapter, we wrote tests to verify the functionality of the to-do app and  showed how you can turn these manual tests into automated tests to be run by an  appropriate testing framework. We also did a holistic evaluation of the before and  after state of our app, showing how far we've come while preserving the rigor of the  offline experience. Finally, we briefly described ways in which the experience could  be improved further.  Take a minute and pat yourself on the back. Now, think about how to apply the  lessons that you've learned to your own software projects. I'd love to hear how you  apply what you've learned. Feel free to drop me a line at offlinefirstux@gmail.com  or tweet me at @offlinefirstux. Best of luck!

When building mobile apps, it's easy to forget about the moments when your users lack a good Internet connection. Put your phone in airplane mode, open a few popular apps, and you'll quickly see how they handle being offline. From Twitter to Pinterest to Apple Maps, some apps might handle being offline better - but very few do it well. A poor offline experience will result in frustrated users who will abandon your app, or worse, turn to your competitor's apps! Expert or novice, this book will teach you everything you need to know about designing and building a rigorous offline app experience. By putting the offline experience first, you'll have a solid foundation to build upon, avoiding the unnecessary stress and frustration of trying to retrofit offline capabilities into your finished app. This basic principle, designing for the worst-case scenario, could save you countless hours of wasted effort.
