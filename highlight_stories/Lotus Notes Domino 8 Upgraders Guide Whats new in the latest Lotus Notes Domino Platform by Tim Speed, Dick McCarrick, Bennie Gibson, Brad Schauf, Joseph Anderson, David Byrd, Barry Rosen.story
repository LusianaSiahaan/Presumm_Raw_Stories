Increasingly, professionals  are turning to on-line venues to communicate what they know and to create  communities of collaboration. They are developing ad-hoc methods to collaborate  and get work done.  They are relying on email, instant messaging, and on-line,   team-based, electronic user environments.  The latest release of IBM Lotus Notes and Lotus Domino reflects these developments  — not only to support the way people work today, but to establish a foundation for  a future of increasing collaboration. Lotus Notes is the premier integrated messaging  and collaboration client option for the Lotus Domino server. Lotus Notes can  help businesses enhance the productivity of their employees, streamline business  processes, and improve overall responsiveness.  IBM Lotus Notes 8 supports previous Lotus Notes applications, while offering  improved capabilities and delivering innovations in collaboration. The software  will provide entirely new capabilities, including composite applications and office  productivity tools that can help improve the way people work.  In addition, Lotus  Notes and Domino 8 software can play a key role as organizations adopt service- oriented architecture  SOA  strategies.   Lotus Notes 8 Enhancements For the end-user, "at the glass" interactions are critical aspects of their daily lives.  An interface that can improve the user's experience is critical to software adoption.  However, learning new technologies must be intuitive.  With the IBM Lotus Notes 8  client, IBM has delivered on these expectations.  From the initial look-and-feel of the  Notes client, to the full integration with the Sametime and Quickr platforms, IBM has  accelerated the business value of the end-user experience with email and more.   Preface  Here are just a few of the enhancements that you'll see in the IBM Lotus Notes 8  release. These are designed to help your organization collaborate better and promote  productivity and responsiveness.   Mail  IBM Lotus Notes 8 software continues IBM's commitment to helping you better  manage information received via email, while also allowing you to work from within  your inboxes. New mail features include:  Threaded emails are gathered together and presented at the view level. You  can easily expand a thread and see all messages related to specific topics  grouped together. In preview mode, you can quickly find the information  you are seeking, which is often hidden in long conversation threads.  Really Simple Syndication  RSS  feed reader plug-in is accessible from the  sidebar. You can scan information from your favorite news feeds and use  it to answer questions and complete tasks. As with all the sidebar plug-ins,  the RSS feed reader can be detached from the sidebar with the "float plug-in"  option, allowing you to work in the way that you are most comfortable.  Common keyboard and mouse-click shortcuts and commands are now  supported. For example, you can use the Control key to select multiple,  noncontiguous items in the Lotus Notes database view, which allows you to  interact with multiple pieces of information simultaneously.  Message recall capability allows you to retrieve email messages that have  already been sent.  Calendar  New Calendar improvements enable you to manage your time and meeting  invitations, and make decisions from your calendar, while reserving your inbox  exclusively for email message management. Calendar enhancements include:  Dates of important meetings or appointments are highlighted in the monthly  calendar view. Highlighted dates on the monthly calendar give you a visual  cue about days with scheduled meetings and unprocessed invitations.  You can respond to unprocessed invitations by simply double-clicking on  highlighted entries to accept, decline, or counter-propose an invitation.  When scheduling conflicts arise, Lotus Notes 8 now allows the meeting  chairperson to simply select or deselect attendees to find times that best meet  the needs for that meeting.                    [ 2 ]   Preface  Contacts Contact functionality  previously called the personal address book  now offers a  new user interface that helps boost productivity by enabling you to navigate contacts  more quickly. Other new features include:           Business-card-like views with embedded photographs help you find contact  information more quickly.  You can leverage the extensibility of Lotus Notes 8 software to initiate  contextual collaboration from the Contact view.  You can open individual contact information in a new window. If you prefer,  you can easily change the view to traditional Lotus Notes tabbed views.  Service Oriented Architecture  SOA  In addition to providing a world-class solution for messaging and collaboration,  Lotus Notes and Lotus Domino 8 is an industry-leading, robust platform for  developing people-centric applications. It helps you and the designers in your  organization build applications that assist your people to be more productive and  to meet your business requirements. The continued evolution of the Lotus Notes  Domino platform allows it to participate openly within diverse IT environments,  create new value from existing applications, and contribute to your service-oriented  architecture  SOA .  Lotus Notes Domino 8, through its support of user-facing composite applications  and web services, provides new opportunities to evolve toward an SOA, while  preserving your application and infrastructure investments. Your IT team can  seamlessly introduce new application capabilities that help increase user efficiencies,  through a familiar UI. The open, extensible Lotus Notes 8 model allows you to use  development tools and component technologies that best align with your IT strategy,  skills, and assets.   Using the Rest of This Book Written by some of the senior architects and specialists of IBM Software Services  for Lotus, this book will provide you with an excellent guide to help you realize  the value of your investment in Lotus Notes 8. You will learn how to leverage  the full capabilities of Lotus Notes 8 and how to quickly move from your existing  technology base to this new, feature-rich platform. The authors explore the  enhanced productivity tools available with this release, integrating word processing,  presentations, and spreadsheets into a seamless unit with your messaging and  collaboration solution.  [ 3 ]   Preface  Developers are not forgotten, as new features and tools are revealed. You will delve  into the world of SOA, as the authors show you how Lotus Notes can be part of an  SOA strategy that can accelerate your business integration and generate value. The  book finishes with a few words about other Lotus products, such as Lotus Sametime,  Lotus Quickr, Lotus Connections, and IBM WebSphere Portal—like IBM Lotus  Notes, all built on the open-standards-based Eclipse Rich Client Platform  RCP   technology. These products are all converging to become the next generation of  people productivity solutions.   Conclusion Over the years, Lotus Notes has come to signify the essence of electronic business  communications. With Lotus Notes 8, IBM has once again provided the user with an  intuitive, fully integrated platform to enhance each user's experience with business  communications. It is no longer just an email tool, but a basis to extend business  communications to a new level.   I hope you find this book valuable as you continue your journey with IBM Lotus  Notes and Lotus Domino 8.   Mark J.

You will also learn how Lotus Notes 8 has  many of the characteristics of SOA components, and how it can help you assemble  applications that can play a role in an SOA.  Chapter 4 provides an overview of three productivity tools: IBM Lotus Documents,  IBM Lotus Presentations, and IBM Lotus Spreadsheets. You will how these tools are  integrated with Notes 8, and how they are controlled by Domino policy documents. Chapter 5 takes a look at the major new and enhanced feature areas in Domino 8.  This includes end user and messaging enhancements, administrator enhancements,  performance enhancements, directory and security enhancements, and better  integration with other IBM technologies.  [ 5 ]   Preface  In Chapter 6 we examine important Notes Domino 8 features that can make rolling  out your new deployment significantly easier. We discuss client provisioning,  including Eclipse-based client and server provisioning functionality. We also look at  policy enhancements and the new database redirect feature. Chapter 7 is divided into two main sections. The first takes a look at the Notes  Domino upgrade process in general, discussing concepts and steps that should be  considered whenever you upgrade to any major release of Notes Domino. The  second section covers upgrade issues that are specific to Notes Domino 8. In Chapter 8, we examine coexistence issues involved with running Notes Domino 8  in a mixed environment with one or more previous releases. We begin with a look at  Notes client coexistence considerations, explain how to install two different versions  of Notes on a workstation, and discuss potential issues with calendaring and  scheduling in a multi-release environment. The chapter concludes with a discussion  of Domino 8 server coexistence, including features such as Domino Directory, ODS,  Domino Web Access, DDM, and ID files. In Chapter 9, we review some of the major new features and enhancements that affect  Notes Domino 8 application development. These include enhancements related  to composite applications, Domino Designer 8, formula language and LotusScript,  Lotus Component Designer, Web 2.0, and Lotus Expediter. Chapter 10 discusses add-on products for a typical Notes Domino infrastructure.   The specific products covered in this capture are the most common that you   might encounter, including: Lotus Quickplace Quickr, Lotus Sametime, and   Lotus Connections. The Appendix covers vendor offerings that will help you extend your Lotus Notes  Domino 8 environment. The tools covered are PistolStar's Password Power 8,  IntelliPRINT Reporting, IONET Incremental Archiver and CMT Inspector.

Three programming students attending a Midwest university in the late 1970s  wanted a way to share notes and information. To do this, they used a software  program called PLATO Group Notes, which ran on their mainframe-based college  computer system. This program really wasn't intended for this purpose—it was  originally designed for bug reporting, but it did provide just enough communication  and collaboration functionality to offer a hint at what could be done, given the right  software and technology.  After graduation, these three students—Ray Ozzie, Tim Halvorsen, and Len Kawell   names that have since achieved near-legendary status within the Lotus Notes  community —went their separate ways. But none forgot the potential they saw  in PLATO Group Notes. Halvorsen and Kawell took jobs at Digital Equipment  Corporation, where they eventually created an in-house communication tool that  resembled PLATO. Meanwhile, Ozzie took programming positions with other  corporations, but never lost sight of his vision to form his own company and develop  a more advanced, PC-based collaboration program. Eventually  1984 to be exact ,  with funding provided by the Lotus Development Corporation  makers of the  famous Lotus 1-2-3 , Ozzie founded Iris Associates Inc. to develop the first release of  Lotus Notes. Ozzie was soon joined by former classmates Halvorsen and Kawell, and  shortly thereafter by Steve Beckhardt.  This first version of Lotus Notes was modelled on PLATO Group Notes, but was  far more advanced, sporting powerful features such as online discussion, email,  phone books, and document databases. This functionality presented some serious  challenges to the hardware and supporting infrastructure upon which Notes ran at  the time. To meet these challenges, Notes was built upon then radical client server  architecture, which featured PCs connected to a local area network  LAN . Groups    A Short History of Notes and Domino  set up a dedicated server PC that communicated with other servers. These servers  exchanged information through replicated data, a concept familiar to us today, but  extremely revolutionary at the time. This allowed users to exchange information  with co-workers  however remote , while maintaining high performance. Equally  important, Notes, from the outset, was designed to be highly customizable, with  a state-of-the-art multi-faceted programmatic interface that allowed developers to  create powerful applications specifically suited to the needs of their work groups.  The first release of Notes shipped in 1989.  A five-year development cycle may  seem like a long time by today's standards, but bear in mind that the Iris folks were  basically creating an entirely new genre of software.  Release 1.0 provided several  "ready to use" applications such as Group Mail, Group Discussion, and Group Phone  Book. Notes also provided templates that assisted developers in the construction of  custom applications, which led to a vibrant business partnership. Release 1   features included:                       Email. Advanced security features. These included the now-familiar Access Control  Lists  ACLs , which control many aspects of Notes database access. Other  security-related features included encryption, signing, and authentication  using the RSA public-key technology. Dial-up functionality.  Import export capability, including Lotus Freelance Graphics metafile  import, structured ASCII export, and Lotus 1-2-3 Symphony   worksheet export.  Online help  a novel idea at the time! .  Formula language for programming Notes applications.  DocLinks that allowed users to navigate from one Notes document to  another, via technology that resembled an early form of today's URLs.  Central administration.  Notes 2.0 shipped in 1991. By now, it became apparent that much of Notes' early  customer base consisted of large companies that employed thousands of users. These  companies were particularly intrigued by Notes' ability to bring large numbers of  users together, and allow them to collaborate and share information with the speed  and efficiency of a small, tightly focused team. To accommodate these customers, the  Notes development team paid special attention to scalability enhancements, taking  advantage of recent hardware and networking advances that could support large,  geographically dispersed environments. These scalability features included support  for multiple name and address books. In addition, the addition, the new Notes C  applications programming Interface  API  enhanced Notes' extensibility, allowing  experienced programmers to create more advanced custom application. The formula   [ 14 ]   Chapter 1  language was also extended. On the user side, Notes now supported rich text as   well as tables and paragraph styles, and Notes mail was enhanced with such things  as address lookup.   Notes 3.0 shipped in mid-1993. At this point, the installed customer base for the  product had grown to approximately half a million users worldwide – substantial,  but still orders of magnitude smaller than today's global Notes Domino community.  To help broaden its appeal to new markets, Notes 3.0 offered client support for  the Apple Macintosh and server support for Microsoft Windows. Notes 3.0 also  introduced many now familiar features, including full text search with hierarchical  names, and alternate mail. Replication was enhanced so that users could perform  selective replication, and run replication in the background.   It was around this time that the Internet began to be seen as a serious business tool,  rather than merely the domain of students and socially inept "geeks". This led to the  release InterNotes News, a product that provided a gateway between the Internet  news sources and Notes. Although largely forgotten today, this was the first project  that reflected the increasing need for Notes to work together with the Internet.  In January 1996, Lotus released Notes 4.0, offering a radically redesigned user  interface that simplified many Notes features, making it easier to use, program, and  administer. This interface quickly became popular among users and developers. The  product continued to become faster and more scalable. In addition, Notes began to  integrate with the Web, and many new features reflected emerging Web technology.  For instance, the new Server Web Navigator allowed the Notes servers to retrieve  pages off the Web so that users could view them in a Notes client.  Release 4.0 included something for everybody. As we mentioned, the user interface  was completely re-engineered, offering the familiar three-paned UI  with preview  capability  for mail and other applications. This UI is still available today in the  Notes workspace. Users also took advantage of the enhanced search features, which  included the ability to search non-indexed databases. Programmers welcomed  the introduction of LotusScript, a programming language built into Notes, as well  as new view, folder, and design features. Administrators also had a lot to cheer  about. For example, the introduction of "pass-thru" servers made it much easier to  built network topologies that ensured quick and efficient delivery of email. Server  integration with the Internet was improved, including SOCKS support, HTTP proxy  support, and Notes RPC proxy support.  In July 1995, IBM purchased Lotus. This gave the Notes developer team access  to world-class technology, including the HTTP server now known as Domino   which eventually led to the Notes product being known by the current name  Notes Domino . This helped transform the Notes 4.0 server into an interactive web  applications server, combining the open networking environment of Internet   [ 15 ]   A Short History of Notes and Domino  standards and protocols with the powerful application development facilities of  Notes. Domino allowed customers to dynamically publish Notes documents to the  Web—a major development in the life of the product.  Among the major enhancements offered in release 4.5 was calendar and scheduling.   It's hard to believe it hasn't been in the product all along.  To further the theme of  Web integration started with Notes 4.0, release 4.5 also included a personal Web  navigator, as well as seamless Web access from the Notes client. Scalability and  manageability were improved with support for Domino server clusters and directory  assistance. Security enhancements, such as execution control lists, and password  expiration and reuse, helped give users more control over who could access their  PCs and what could be performed on them. For the programmers, Notes 4.5  introduced script libraries.  Notes and Domino release 5.0 shipped in early 1999. The release continued the  Notes Domino integration with the Web to the point where the two technologies  were essentially melded together. This was reflected in the release 5 interface,  which bore a more browser-like feel. It also supported more Internet standards and  protocols. Release 5 also introduced Domino Designer, the third member of the  Notes Domino triumvirate of products. And the new Domino Administrator made  Domino network administration easier.  Domino 5 featured Internet messaging and directories, expanded web application  services  including CORBA , and database improvements, such as transaction logging.  The Notes 5 client included a new browser-like user interface with a customizable  welcome page for tracking daily information. It also included improvements to  applications such as mail, calendar and scheduling, web browsing, and discussions.  By the time Notes 6 and Domino 6 were introduced in late 2002, industry talk  focused on concepts such as lower total cost of ownership  TCO for the buzzword- inclined , increased productivity, and faster deployment.  In response, Domino 6 offered enhanced installation, scalability, and performance.  Domino Designer 6 allowed developers to create complex applications more easily  and to reuse code. And IBM improved the Notes 6 client, with an eye towards  improving each user's personal productivity. The overarching theme was to help  customers work more efficiently. For example, installation and setup offered more  options and an improved interface. IBM made central management of multiple  remote servers easier, through features such as policy-based management. And they  improved server scalability and performance, with new features such as network  compression and Domino Server Monitor. These themes were carried through  Notes Domino 6.5, which offered enhanced collaboration with tighter integration  with Sametime instant messaging, QuickPlace, and Domino Web Access. For   [ 16 ]   Chapter 1  programmers, Release 6.5 included the Lotus Domino Toolkit for WebSphere Studio,  a set of Eclipse plug-ins that can be used to create JavaServer Pages  JSPs  using the  Domino Custom Tags.  Notes Domino 7, released in 2005, continued the themes of ease of use, easier  maintenance and deployment, and tighter integration with standards. For example,  Notes 7 included usability features such as the ability to close all open windows  with a single click, the ability to save the state of your work, and a prompt when  the user sends a message with no subject. New client follow-up actions helped with  messaging tracking and work flow, and new Mail rules provided for better spam  management. For those looking for a quick status on digital message signatures  and encryption, there were new status bar icons. Calendar and Scheduling  C&S   included a new calendar clean-up action that helps the end user to quickly and easily  maintain calendar entries. In addition, end-users could now configure the calendar  to accept a meeting, even if it conflicted with an earlier meeting. Notes 7 also offered  enhanced presence awareness based upon Lotus Sametime, including the ability to  see a person's name in a document or view and determine if that person is online.  Presence awareness was added to team rooms, discussions, "to do" documents,  personal name and address book, rooms and resources templates, and various   C&S views.  In Domino 7 administration, Domino Domain Monitoring  DDM  was a particularly  important new feature. Other features and tools included administration event script  handling  via LotusScript , enhanced policy administration  including the ability  to lock down end user desktops, and a new Mail policy , and integration with the  Frivolity Autonomic Monitoring Engine  TAME . Enhancements to Smart Upgrade  included the ability to detach kits in the background, to prevent time lost to a non- working client; and fail-over from a shared  network  upgrade kit to another server's  attached kit. DB2 Management tools let you enable Domino to run with a DB2 data  store, configure a connection document from DB2 Access for a Domino server to  Domino, and allow DB2 user names and passwords to be added to server IDs.  The Domino 7 server offered autonomic diagnostic collection, a feature that can  be considered both an administration feature and a server feature. It also included  more improvements to directories and LDAP—for example, support for Universal  Notes IDs  UNID  through 32-character values of the new dominoUNID operational  attribute. LDAP searches were enhanced to work with IBM Workplace products  that use the WebSphere Member Manager  WMM  service to access user and group  objects. To optimize performance, Domino 7 re-used existing LDAP connections.  IPv6 protocol support was upgraded to include additional platforms and services.  Domino 7 also centralized the processing of Rooms and Resources reservations  into a new Rooms and Resources Manager  RNRMgr  task. Additionally, it offered  improvements with the Lightweight Third Party Authentication  LTPA  scheme.  [ 17 ]   A Short History of Notes and Domino  Domino Designer 7 provided new features meant to help the developer better  manage Notes Domino applications, provide new user interface elements, as  well as provide better support for newer technologies such as Web Services. For  instance, the new Auto Save feature backed up any documents open in edit mode  to a defined "auto save" database. Shared columns provided a mechanism to reuse  a view column definition across multiple views. This allowed for consistency when  sharing them among views. Agent profiling allowed developers and administrators  to collect performance data for a LotusScript or Java-based agent. Input enabled  formulas allowed you to define whether or not a field is editable using a "@Formula"  that evaluates to @True or @False. Designer 7 provided several new smart icons,  including Debug LotusScript.  As for Notes Domino 8: well, its features are the subject for the next chapter.  Let's just say for now that this latest release continues the tradition of cutting edge  technology and functionality built into that first release, the culmination of three  forward-thinking students who  not to wax overly dramatic  launched an entirely  new software industry, and with it a whole new way of doing business, based on  communication, collaboration, and sharing and managing the collective expertise  of your corporation. In short, getting the most out of all your resources, hardware,  software, and  most important of all  human!   [ 18 ]   Overview of New Lotus   Notes 8 Client Features  In this chapter, we will take a quick look at some of the major new features offered in  the Lotus Notes 8 client. These include:           User interface enhancements Mail enhancements Calendar enhancements Contacts  formerly known as the Personal Address Book   In addition to these "user visible" features, the Lotus Notes 8 client is now built  upon an open standards Eclipse-based architecture. This architecture allows greater  flexibility of the client for customization and fits better into a service-oriented  architecture  SOA  than previous releases. Lotus Notes 8 also provides a more consistent experience across a greater variety of  operating system platforms. For example, The Lotus Domino 8 server software runs  on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5. Lotus Notes 8 client support for Red Hat Enterprise  Linux 5 WS is currently planned for the Lotus Notes 8 code stream. The Notes 8  client also offers a consistent installation process for both the Microsoft Windows  operating system users and Linux desktop users. Enhancements in Lotus Notes 8 for Linux include integrated instant messaging   and presence awareness, the Lotus Notes Smarticons toolbar, and support for   color printing.   Overview of New Lotus Notes 8 Client Features  Lotus Notes 8 support for the Macintosh workstation will be expected at a  later date.  In this chapter, we will discuss the enhanced UI and updates to mail, calendar,   and contacts.  User Interface Enhancements Long-time Notes users will notice that the Lotus Notes 8 user interface looks  significantly different from previous releases. These changes are the result of  carefully considering and incorporating user feedback and suggestions.  [ 20 ]   Welcome Page Lotus Notes 8 has a new default Welcome page. The name of this page has changed  to Home Page.  Chapter 2  This page can be considered a "home base" from which to jump to your desired  destination. It contains links labeled Mail, Calendar, Contacts  previously known  as the personal address book , To Do, and Personal Journal. In addition to these  familiar links, there are links to other productivity tools. For more details on these,  see chapter 4, Productivity Tools.  As in previous releases of Notes, you can customize this page or create your own.  Upgrading from a previous release of the Notes client will retain your  existing welcome page.  [ 21 ]   Overview of New Lotus Notes 8 Client Features  Open List Menu Lotus Notes databases are now called spplications in the Notes 8 client. There is also  a new method to access them. To do this, click on a new menu button called Open.  This button is located in the upper left-hand corner of the client interface.  From this menu, you can access the same links as from your default home page, as  well as some additional links.   Bookmarks from previous releases will be migrated if the client is  upgraded to Lotus Notes 8 from a previous release. The workspace page  is also still available as well.  A feature that is very helpful is the search feature in the Open menu. When entering  text in this search, the Open menu will contextually adjust to show only the contents  of your search.  [ 22 ]   Chapter 2  The Open menu does not replace the File menu. Speaking of which, the File menu  has been slightly modified. As mentioned earlier, the word "Database" has been  replaced by "Application" in the menu options. There are also a few new icons such  as a printer next to the Print option:  Toolbars  Lotus Notes 8 features contextual toolbars. Toolbars are now related to the tab of  the application that is being used. Contextual toolbars allow only the tools that are  necessary to be displayed.  [ 23 ]   Overview of New Lotus Notes 8 Client Features  Unified Preferences With all these new features come associated new preference settings, some of which  we have already mentioned. In Notes 8 the preferences are all in a single location.  This makes the management of this feature-rich client simpler, because you can find  the preferences for mail, activities, instant messaging, and productivity tools under  one location.  As with the Open menu and the Thumbnail view, in Preferences you can  contextually search for preference settings. Notice a pattern here?  If you are used to using the preferences in the same manner as the  previous releases, you can do so in the Lotus Notes 8 client as well.   Windows Management and Tabs To provide a less cluttered window, Lotus Notes 8 has enhanced the functionality of  its windows and tabs.  [ 24 ]   Group Document Tabs Lotus Notes 8 introduces the ability to group document tabs. With this option  enabled, documents or views opened from within one application are grouped under  the originating application tab.   Chapter 2  To access an open window in a tab, click the arrow to the right of the application  name. The number next to the arrow displays the number of open windows within  the parent application.  You can also now choose to have a new window open for every document.  [ 25 ]   Overview of New Lotus Notes 8 Client Features Thumbnails To the immediate right of the Open menu is the new Thumbnails button. Clicking  on this button transforms the open windows into a page that contains each   window displayed as a thumbnail. Clicking on a thumbnail image will take you   to that window.   This feature is extremely helpful when you are dealing with multiple open windows.  As in the Open menu, there is a contextual search available in the thumbnail view.   [ 26 ]   Chapter 2  Advanced Menus There is an old rule in the software business that states 80 percent of the users only  use 20 percent of the features. If you are not a power user, and would rather not see  all of the advanced menu options, just turn them off. In the Notes 8 client, if you fall  into the 80 percent group, you never need to see these options. By default, the option  of showing advanced menus is deselected. If you need to use an advanced menu,  you will need to enable this option.  [ 27 ]   Overview of New Lotus Notes 8 Client Features  We can now see how the menus look with Advanced Menus enabled and disabled.                          Offline Applications Ever wish there were a simple way to create a local replica of an application? That is  exactly what the new Make Available Offline feature does. Just select this option, enter  the necessary information, and voila! a local replica of your application is created.   [ 28 ]   Search Center The ability to search mail, calendar, contacts, and even the web from a single location  is now a feature of the Notes 8 client. Both Google and Yahoo! Internet searches can  be selected from within the client. Got Google Desktop search? If you have, it will  also appear in the menu.   Chapter 2  Searches can be saved as well. Using the search preferences, you can disable the  search history, clear the search history, and choose which web search you want to set  as your default.  [ 29 ]   Overview of New Lotus Notes 8 Client Features  IBM Support Assistant How much time could you save if you had your own personal support assistant  when you run into a challenging issue? IBM responded to that wish by creating  the IBM Support Assistant. The Support Assistant allows you to troubleshoot your  issue without needing to contact IBM. If you can't resolve the issue with the Support  Assistant, it will help by automating the process of collecting the diagnostic data  needed to create a problem report.  For more information on the IBM Support Assistant, see the Lotus Notes 8 client  online help or the following web site:   http:  www.ibm.com software support isa .  New Mail Features The new mail functionality in the Lotus Notes 8 client was designed with the  end user in mind. The enhancements were designed to simplify and update the  interface, as well as increase productivity. The following sections cover the new mail  functionality introduced in the Lotus Notes 8 client.  Action Bar The appearance of the action bar has been modified from previous versions. If the  new look confuses you, hover over the icon for a text box description of the   icon's functionality.  [ 30 ]   For basic functions  such as creating a new memo or replying to a message  you can  click once on the icon. Notice the arrows next to the action bar items. Clicking on the  arrows allows you to choose more options such as Reply without history or Create a  new meeting.  Chapter 2  Show Menu A new menu called Show now appears in the upper left-hand corner of the Notes 8  client interface.  From this menu, you can alter the way your client displays your documents. One of  the options in this menu controls how Notes displays the preview pane. We detail  these options in the next sections.  [ 31 ]   Overview of New Lotus Notes 8 Client Features  Horizontal and Vertical Preview Panes As mentioned previously, you can choose how to display the preview pane. The  two options allow you to preview on the right or on the bottom. This fits into the  philosophy of being able to customize the client's experience.  If you choose to display the preview pane on the right, the text of your messages  will resize so that they fit in the preview pane. This allows you to view the same  information regardless of the preview pane selection. The other option is to remove  the preview pane altogether.  Mail Threads Lotus Notes 7 allowed you to view the mail thread in the header of the email.  Lotus Notes 8 builds upon this mail thread functionality.  There are now two new  options for mail threads when viewing directly from the inbox. By default, when  you highlight a message in the inbox, it will display a twisty next to the subject if the  message is in a thread.  [ 32 ]   To see the contents of the entire mail thread, click this twisty.  Chapter 2  In most cases, replies to an email contain the original subject line preceded by Re:.  The mail thread functionality in Lotus Notes 8 displays the first line of the email  rather than the subject. This allows the user to scan the thread for useful information  without having to open a memo to see the contents.  The mail thread will display all messages in a thread, regardless of the location of  the actual message. If you move a message in the thread to any folder other than the  inbox, the thread will display the name of the folder containing the message.  By making the mail threads resilient, the Lotus Notes 8 client will still display  messages in the thread even if one of them is deleted. It also displays messages that  originated outside of your Lotus Domino environment. If someone sends messages  to you from the Internet, those messages are displayed in the thread.  The mail file must be hosted on a Lotus Domino 8 server in order for the  mail threads to be resilient.  Conversations View Notes 8 allows you to display your messages in a Conversations view. This  compacts emails to one message per conversation. This view provides an uncluttered  inbox. The emails in a topic will be grouped together by the latest entry in your  inbox. To switch between the conversations view and the individual messages view,  use the Display menu.  [ 33 ]   Overview of New Lotus Notes 8 Client Features  In the Conversations view, you will see the number of emails in the conversation in  parenthesis at the end of the subject. Clicking on the twisty will display the messages  in the conversation, just as it does in the default mail view.  Another time-saving feature in this view is the ability to perform actions on the  entire conversation. These actions include filing into a folder or deleting the entire  conversation. To prevent accidental deletion of an entire conversation, a dialog box  will appear when someone deletes a conversation.  This dialog box can be suppressed by checking a box.  Mail Header Options If you only want to display the header options that are pertinent to you, now you  can. In Notes 8 you can choose what header options to display in your mail file.  This figure displays all of the options in the mail header.  To limit the header options, click on the display button in the memo. This will allow  you to choose what options to limit. You can hide everything except the To, Cc, and  Subject fields.  [ 34 ]   Sending confidential messages is easier in Notes 8. There is a check box named Mark  Subject Confidential. When you check this option, the text *Confidential is added to  the beginning of your subject.  Chapter 2  Mail Addressing One of the biggest improvements in the Notes 8 client is the manner in which   type-ahead mail addressing works. There is now a "type down" feature. As you  type in an address, names that match the characters appear in a drop-down list.  This allows you to address emails quickly. The names that appear are in the order of  frequency of use rather than alphabetically. If you have a contact that you frequently  mail, this user will appear at the top of the list and can be brought up with minimal  key-strokes. Clicking on the name in the list will add that name to the address field.  Multilevel Undo  The multilevel undo functionality for text editing in Notes 8 is now up to 50 levels.  This applies to any text field in Notes 8, not just email text fields.  [ 35 ]   Overview of New Lotus Notes 8 Client Features  Inline Spell Checking Inline spell checking can now be enabled. When this is enabled, a red squiggle will  appear underneath any misspelled word  or more precisely a word that does not  appear in the dictionary  in a rich-text field. This option can be enabled in the   unified preferences.  Right-clicking the word with the red squiggle displays a list of suggested spellings.  Clicking on one of the suggested spellings will replace a misspelled word with this  word. You can also add the word to the dictionary. This will prevent the word from  being marked as misspelled in the future.  [ 36 ]   Chapter 2  When inline spell checking is enabled, it is available in any   Notes document.  Document Selection Lotus Notes 8 has changed the way in which documents are selected. In previous  Notes releases, a check mark was placed next to a document's name. Notes 8  now supports common operating system commands and mouse clicks. To select  multiple documents, hold down the Shift key and select the documents. To select an  individual document, hold down the Control key and click on the document. This will  highlight the selected documents and allow you to work with them in a group.  Common operating system commands and mouse clicks work in the calendar and  contact views as well.  [ 37 ]   Overview of New Lotus Notes 8 Client Features  Recent Collaborations Have you ever wanted to view your conversations with a specific person, from  multiple tools such as instant messaging, email, activities, and calendaring? Notes 8  contains a right-click option that will allow you to view all your dealings with that  person. A window titled Recent Collaborations will display a list from which you  can select and open any recent collaboration.   The right-click option to view recent collaborations will work in the calendar and  contact views as well.  Message Recall Sometimes users accidentally send a message before finishing it, or send it to  unintended recipients. Message recall can now help you in these sticky situations.   To recall the message, just select it in your Sent view and click on the Recall  Message button.  [ 38 ]   After you click the Recall Message button, a dialog box will appear with options.  You can select which recipients from who to recall the message. You also have the  option to recall a message even if it was already read.  Chapter 2  If you would like to receive a recall status report, check the Send me a recall status  report for each recipient option. This will send you a status report.  You will only be able to use this feature from the Sent view of your mail file. The  sent message must be available for the information about the recipients to be used to  recall the message. If the message was not saved when sent, you cannot recall it.  Message recall will only work if the user is on Lotus Domino 8 server and  the feature is enabled. The user must also be configured for use in a   mail policy.  [ 39 ]   Overview of New Lotus Notes 8 Client Features  Improved "Out of Office" Functionality The "Out of Office" functionality has been enhanced on the Notes client, as well as  on the server. This section will cover these enhancements. The settings are now more  granular, allowing you to set the hour that you are leaving and returning. You can  also choose to only have the "Out of Office" message sent in reply to the first message  that someone sends or in reply to all messages that they sends.   Manually disabling the "Out of Office" feature is a thing of the past. The feature  disables itself when the "Out of Office" time expires. This saves time by requiring less  administrative tasks upon your return. A person who is delegated to your calendar  cannot enable and disable the Out of Office for you.  New Calendar Functionality The Calendar view has been updated in Lotus Notes 8. The following sections cover  the new features in the calendar.  [ 40 ]   View Navigation To keep the view navigation consistent, the calendar can be navigated from the view  navigator pane on the left-hand side of the Notes 8 interface.  Chapter 2  Action Bar As in the mail view, the action bar is designed to offer single click functionality.  More options can be accessed with the Respond button.  [ 41 ]   Overview of New Lotus Notes 8 Client Features  Display of All-Day Events Now all-day events are displayed for the entire day. To save you the bother of  scrolling up, the title of the all-day event will appear at the top of the page regardless  of what time of the day you are viewing in the calendar. Anniversaries behave in the  same manner as all-day events.  Manage New Invitations from Your   Calendar View A new feature in Notes 8 is the ability to display unprocessed events on your  calendar, next to processed events.  Unprocessed events are calendar events that  have been received, but not yet accepted.  This allows you to see your calendar with  all events before deciding to accept or decline.  [ 42 ]   By default, this feature is not enabled. You must enable this feature in your   calendar preferences.  Chapter 2  When enabled, your unprocessed items will appear in a color different from accepted  items. They will appear in white with an envelope icon in the upper right-hand  corner. Accepted invitations appear in blue with a person icon in the upper   right-hand corner.  Show Cancelled Invitations in Your Calendar  Now you can choose to keep canceled invitations in your calendar.  In previous  releases, you could auto-process cancellations so as to have them removed from your  calendar.  The benefit of this new functionality is to keep a record of the cancelled  meeting in your calendar, rather than just a cancellation notice in your inbox.  This is enabled in your calendar preferences.  [ 43 ]   Overview of New Lotus Notes 8 Client Features  A cancelled meeting will be displayed in brown on your calendar without an icon.  When you open the meeting from your calendar, it will be removed from this view.  Check Schedule You can now check your schedule when you are creating a new meeting by clicking  the Check Schedule button. This will bring up a window with the day view showing  how the new meeting will fit into the schedule.  An alternative method to check your  schedule is to use the side bar.   Locate Free Time for a Subset of Invitees When inviting a large number of people to a meeting, it is often difficult to determine  when all everyone will be available. Now you can select certain invitees and get free  time information for them. For example, you can search only the required attendees.  [ 44 ]   Contacts In Notes 8, the Contacts user interface has been changed significantly. In particular,  new features have been introduced. The names.nsf file that contains all local  contacts has been renamed to Contacts. The following sections will describe the new  interface and features.  Chapter 2  Contact Form The newly renamed Contacts database has additional forms which add flexibility to  how you store your contacts. There are more fields available when filling out the Contact form. You can see these  new fields when placing a contact form in edit mode.  [ 45 ]   Overview of New Lotus Notes 8 Client Features  If the field is not filled in, it will not be displayed when viewing the saved contact.  There are several formats in which the contact can be displayed, and you can choose  which format is most appropriate.  [ 46 ]   To make the forms more customizable, you can now change the titles of the fields to  reflect your individual needs.  Chapter 2  You can now store a photograph of your contact in the record by clicking on the  Insert Contact Photo button in the top left corner of the Contact form.  [ 47 ]   Overview of New Lotus Notes 8 Client Features  Business Card View A new view, called Business Card, has been added to the Contacts database. This  displays all your contacts in a business card format, making it easier to find contacts  at a glance. To open the contact from this view, simply double-click it.  Recent Contacts Another new view in the Contacts database is the Recent Contacts view. This view  will display all of the people with whom you have recently collaborated. This makes  it easier for you to address frequently used contacts. It is from this view that the  client gets the addresses that populate the pull-down menu that appears when you  send a memo or an invititation. This allows you to pull up any email address that  you have sent messages to you. You can also pull up any addresses you have been  copied on, and add them to an email that you are addressing.  [ 48 ]   From the Replication page you can choose to have your contacts synchronized. This  will check for changes such as phone number or address changes from the server  directory and synchronize them with your local Contacts database.  Chapter 2  Summary In this chapter, we have reviewed the major new features offered by the Lotus Notes  8 client. Many of these involve enhancements to the client user interface itself. Other  new features include enhancements to mail, calendar, and contacts. These features  significantly broaden the power and usefulness of the Notes client, while providing  greater ease of use  and potentially minimal retraining  – an important consideration  for any user planning to upgrade to Notes 8.   [ 49 ]    Lotus Notes 8 and SOA  In this chapter, we will introduce the concept of a service oriented architecture   SOAs  and how Lotus Notes 8 fits into one. We will explain what an SOA is, its  value, and its characteristics. You will also learn how Lotus Notes 8 has many of the  characteristics of SOA components, and how it can help you assemble applications  that can play a role in an SOA.  However, this chapter is not intended to provide the  in-depth detail necessary to implement your own SOA.   What is an SOA? Although the concept of an SOA is simple, the components that make up one  can be complex. Additionally, the value and perception of an SOA varies with  the perspective and role of organizations and persons considering one. So in this  chapter, we'll start with the basic definition of an SOA and then examine specific  aspects of SOAs.  "SOA" stands for service oriented architecture. This definition can often be taken further  by adding the word "business", since the inherent value of an SOA comes from  business orientation and enablement.  In computing, the term SOA expresses a software architectural concept that defines the  use of services to support the requirements of software users. In an SOA environment,  nodes on a network make resources available to other participants in the network  as independent services they access in a standardized way. Most definitions of an  SOA identify the use of web services  using SOAP and WSDL  in its implementation.  However, you can implement SOA using any service-based technology.   Lotus Notes 8 and SOA  SOAs can be used to:  Build distributed systems that deliver application functionality as services to  either end-user applications or other users. Design and implement distributed systems that allow a tight correlation  between the business model and its IT implementation. Manage services made available by different software packages for reuse   and reconfiguration.  These uses of SOA highlight the fact that they encompasses a wide  range of interests.  There are many ways to implement and view an SOA. The specific approach  and value proposition depends on the needs of the business and the role of the  organization or person considering the SOA. In this chapter, we will focus on how  business how to reuse existing Notes-based functions, and how to take existing Eclipse  and WebSphere Portal services and incorporate them into new Notes functions.  The Characteristics of an SOA  There are some commonly understood characteristics of an SOA. These include   the following:  Services are reusable and called by many applications. Service access is with communication protocols rather than direct calls. Services are loosely coupled so that they are autonomous. Interfaces are defined in a platform-independent manner. Services are encapsulated so that the interface doesn't reveal how the service  was implemented.  This is called abstraction.  Services share a formal contract. Services are composable  able to be assembled into composite applications . Services are stateless. Services are discoverable.                               Later in this chapter, we will examine some of these characteristics and see how  Lotus Notes 8 can interact with an SOA.  Perspectives on SOAs From a business perspective, SOA is about identifying, surfacing, and integrating  business services to meet business needs.   [ 52 ]   Chapter 3  From an IT perspective, SOA is about responding quickly to changing business  needs. IT organizations must determine what style, patterns, or principles provide  architecture capable of responding in a timely fashion. These questions must be  answered with the understanding that existing applications and systems have been  built over time and are hard-wired together.  Why SOAs Now? One key factor in the emergence and success of SOAs is the evolution of standards.  Standardization has made SOAs more useful now than ever before. In the past,  companies have made numerous attempts to develop a standard to support some  version of SOAs. Standards such as CORBA and DCOM have existed for a while,  but haven not been sufficiently widely adopted to allow true interconnection of  companies and people.  Thanks to the Internet and standards such as HTML and HTTP, companies and  customers are linked together as never before. This linkage is the key to the  interconnection and combination of services that distinguish an SOA. As the Internet  has matured, web services standards have emerged; they now have a common  set of standards across vendors and businesses. Major vendors have agreed on  standardization of web services and have incorporated these standardized services  into products, providing unprecedented breadth of tools for supporting an SOA.  Standards for interoperability that have been widely adopted include:               HTTP XML SOAP WSDL UDDI OASIS standards such as ODF  Other factors play key roles in the adoption of SOAs. For example, mature software  and software frameworks are now available across a breadth of vendors, including  Eclipse and OSGi. SOA-related governance models and best practices are defined  and proven. With the development of the Internet, implementation is now practical,  and business IT collaboration is receiving renewed focus.  [ 53 ]   Lotus Notes 8 and SOA  SOA Lifecycle There are four distinct phases to the lifecycle of an SOA: model, assemble, deploy,  and manage.    Assemble  Assemble existing and new  assets to execute and  manage business processes  Deploy  Deployment of models, policies and assemblies  to realize  business intent  Model  Deploy  Assemble  Manage  Governance & Processes  Model  Capture, simulate,  analyze, and optimize  business models to reduce risk and increase flexibility  Manage  Real-time visibility and Analysis of business Information for timely And coordinated action  This lifecycle provides a framework within which an SOA can be built. However,  businesses and IT organizations can choose where within the lifecycle to begin  an SOA implementation.  One of the key values of SOA is the ability to get quick  benefits by assembling and deploying services without waiting for a full-blown   SOA definition.   The Model Phase The model phase of the SOA lifecycle starts with discovering which program  assets can be reuse in new applications. You can discover these hidden assets and  determine which programs are good candidates for reuse in web applications with a  number of tools already on the market.  As we stated earlier, the key value of an SOA is the surfacing of business services.  So as to properly identify the business services and understand how they fit into the  business, SOA modelling uses establishes a common understanding of the business  processes, objectives, and outcomes between business and IT. The SOA model helps  make sure that any IT applications meet the needs of the business and provide a  baseline for business service performance.  [ 54 ]   Chapter 3  At the end of the model phase, you should have a clear inventory of assets showing  where they can be used in the business processes that you have modelled.  The Assemble Phase The assemble phase is where programs are wrapped as services and used to create  composite applications which bring together core assets that often span multiple  platforms. If you use legacy host transactional environments, the tools simplify the  development of new web user interfaces, traditional terminal interfaces, and back- end business logic.  During the assemble phase, you can create services out of existing assets such as   ERP and financial systems, legacy host applications, and other solutions that are  currently running your business. If no functionality exists, you can create and test  a service to deliver the functionality required for your business process. Once the  required services are available, you can orchestrate them so as to implement your  business process.  Lotus Notes 8 includes features to support the assemble phase of  SOA development.  We will review those capabilities later in this chapter.  The Deploy Phase During the deploy phase, you can configure and scale the runtime environment  to meet the service levels required by your business process. You can optimize  the services environment to reliably run mission-critical business processes while  providing the flexibility to make updates dynamically in response to changing  business requirements.  Once it is configured, you can deploy your business process into a robust, scalable,  and secure services environment. This service-oriented approach can reduce the cost  and complexity associated with maintaining numerous point-to-point integrations.  The Manage Phase The manage phase involves managing the underlying service assets, establishing and  maintaining service availability and response times, and managing and maintaining  version control over the services that make up your business processes. The  management phase ultimately enables you to make better business decisions sooner  than previously possible.  [ 55 ]   Lotus Notes 8 and SOA  You can monitor key performance indicators in real time to get the information  required to prevent, isolate, diagnose, and fix problems, enabling you to provide  feedback into the business process model so as to enable continuous improvement.  Once the SOA has been deployed, you'll need to continue to secure, manage, and  monitor the composite applications and underlying resources from both an IT and  a business perspective so as to get full value from the SOA. Information gathered  during the manage phase on key SOA indicators can provide real-time insight into  business processes, enabling you to make better business decisions, and feeding  information back into the SOA lifecycle for continuous process improvement.   How Lotus Notes 8 Works with SOAs Now that we've covered the basics of an SOA, it is time to examine how Lotus Notes  8 fits in. Lotus Notes 8 can help an organization achieve an architecture with SOA  characteristics by:        Supporting service reuse. Lotus Notes 8 does this by providing a composite  application development capability, and by providing web service consumer  and producer capability. Enabling further extension of Lotus Notes to further work with SOAs  through an open technologies framework  Composite Applications Lotus Notes 8 has the ability to assemble composite applications. This ability is  useful in the assemble phase of the SOA lifecycle. In this section, you will learn   what a composite application is and how Lotus Notes 8 enables the assembly of  composite applications.   A composite application is a loosely coupled collection of user-facing components  brought together for a specific business purpose. Composite applications provide the  front end of an SOA. The ability to create and edit composite applications lets you  easily combine and reuse different services, providing a tremendous platform for  service reuse – a key characteristic of an SOA. With Lotus Notes 8, server-managed,  NSF-based composite applications can be created or edited. An NSF-based composite  application can consist of NSF, Eclipse, and WebSphere Portal components.   Elimination of information and service "silos" is a key benefit of composite  applications for end users. With composite applications, the services are loosely  coupled and independent  not hard-wired into the infrastructure  so they can be  easily reused or extended, as business needs change. This is an important element in  enabling a business to flexibly respond to business changes and to alter application   [ 56 ]   Chapter 3  interactions as needs dictate. Available online or offline, composite applications can  facilitate self-service activities. Using the composite application editor within Lotus  Notes 8 software, end users and LOB managers can create composite applications.  IT staff can use their current development skills to build and modify reusable  components, helping to reduce IT and development costs. Organizations can reuse  previously developed Eclipse technology-based components within the composite  applications experienced by Lotus Notes and Domino 8 software, helping to increase  return on investment in application development tools and skills.    The composite application editor is an install-time option of the Lotus Notes 8 Client.  Composite applications can be built with minimal or no NSF design changes to reuse  existing Notes applications as components of the composite application.  Lotus Domino  Server  HTTP Server  NSF Component  Eclipse  Component  Composite Application  XML  Graphical Representation  Lotus Notes 8  Development responsibilities for building composite applications can be distributed  across several types of application development and administration team members.  The process does not have to be restricted to a highly skilled component developer.  The roles in composite application development typically include the following:           A component developer who designs and creates NSF and   Eclipse components. An application assembler who defines and assembles the composite  application, and who may be business user. An application administrator who deploys portlets onto the WebSphere portal  and maintains NSF-based composite applications on the Domino server.  [ 57 ]   Lotus Notes 8 and SOA  The following section provides an example of how Lotus Notes 8 enables composite-  application assembly. The documentation and files necessary to build this example  can be found at: http:  www-03.ibm.com developerworks blogs page  CompApps?entry=more_sophisticated_tutorial_of_composite  You can also find a blog discussing composite applications in Lotus Notes 8 at:  http:  www-03.ibm.com developerworks blogs page CompApps  This example involves three components:          Lotus Notes Contacts A Notes Domino forum application An Eclipse component implementing a Tag Cloud  The above figure shows the Lotus Notes Contacts view. On its own, this component  shows a list of contacts and has a preview pane showing the details for the currently  selected contact. Certainly, this is a valuable service by itself. But our example shows  how you can reuse this service, combine it with other services, and extend the value  of this component.  [ 58 ]   The second component of this example is a Lotus Notes discussion application. This  component allows users to discuss topics  in this case, Lotus Notes Designer  in a  user discussion forum setting. Again, this on its own is a useful component, but our  example will combine this component with the Lotus Notes Contacts to create a new,  more useful service by loosely coupling these components.  Chapter 3  [ 59 ]   Lotus Notes 8 and SOA  In the first step in this example, the Lotus Notes 8 Designer is uses WSDL  Web  Services Description Language  to expose properties and actions needed to navigate  within the Notes Forum application. Below is one screen from the Lotus Notes 8  Designer where the final step of the WSDL creation is being completed.  In addition to using WSDL, Lotus Notes 8 Designer also allows you to create actions  to be implemented during assembly of a composite application. In this case, the  action is called Select Person.   [ 60 ]   This action will select the forum entry for the current selection in the Lotus Notes  Contacts component.  Chapter 3  With the appropriate WSDL action associated with the Notes Forum application, the  prerequisites for assembling the composite application are in place. In the following  figure, the composite application editor is used to wire the Notes Contact view and  the Notes Forum application.  [ 61 ]   Lotus Notes 8 and SOA  The result is a composite application in which the Notes Forum entry is displayed  based on the selected Notes contact entry. As you can see in the following figure,  Betty Zachman of ZetaBank is the currently selected Lotus Notes contact and the  Lotus Notes forum has been advanced to show the threads for Betty Zachman.  [ 62 ]   Next, the composite application editor is used to include an Eclipse tag cloud in   the composite application. This component displays tag data about the current  contact. This is accomplished by linking the Eclipse component to the Notes   Forum application.  Chapter 3  [ 63 ]   Lotus Notes 8 and SOA  In this final figure, the current Lotus Notes contact selection is Betty Zachman and  the interest selected is application development. The result is a view of the Notes  forum positioned in a thread by Betty Zachman related to application development.  This simple example shows the power of the Lotus Notes 8 composite application  editor. Minimal Lotus Notes designer effort, combined with use of the Lotus Notes  8 Client composite application editor, can produce a new business function reusing  existing heterogeneous services.   [ 64 ]   Chapter 3  Lotus Notes 8 and Web Services Web services producer and consumer capability is not new to Lotus Notes 8.  However, the ability to produce and consume web services is a key characteristic of  an SOA. This section provides an overview of how Lotus Notes supports web service  production and consumption.  A web service provider makes available a WSDL  Web Services Description  Language  document that defines the service interface. The WSDL document  is in XML format. What happens behind the interface is up to the provider, but  most providers map the interface to procedure calls in a supported programming  language. Incoming requests from a consumer are passed to the underlying code,  and results are passed back to the consumer.  Lotus Domino maps the WSDL interface to an agent-like web service design element  that can be coded in LotusScript or Java. The web service must be on a Domino  server with HTTP enabled.  We can test the web service through an HTTP session   in the Notes client preview.  Access is through one of the following Domino   URL commands:        OpenWebService invokes the web service in response to a SOAP-encoded  message sent through an HTTP POST request. An HTTP GET request  for  example, a browser query  returns the name of the service and its operations. WSDL returns the WSDL document in response to an HTTP GET..  Several approaches can be used to create a web service design element in Domino  Designer. One approach is to code the service entirely in LotusScript or Java. In  this case, saving the design element generates a WSDL document that reflects  the LotusScript or Java code. Alternatively, an existing WSDL document can be  imported. In this case, the LotusScript or Java code reflects the operations in the  imported WSDL document. The web service design element saves the WSDL  document as well as the code. If the public interface has not changed, the WSDL  document stays as it is. If anything in the coding that affects the public interface is  changed, a new WSDL document is generated.  [ 65 ]   Lotus Notes 8 and SOA  In Domino Designer, the web service design element resides below Agents under  Shared code.   The web service design window looks a lot like the agent design window. Clicking  the New Web Service button creates a new web service. Double-clicking the name of  an existing web service opens it for editing.  An example of a web service to access Domino databases can be found here:  http:  www-10.lotus.com ldd sandbox.nsf ByDate  7b12bb2e3f4a78be852572c3005bac80?OpenDocument  Lotus Notes 8 and Open Technologies Lotus Notes 8 supports both OASIS ODF and Eclipse open formats.  OASIS ODF Lotus Notes 8 supports both OASIS ODF and Eclipse open formats.   Word-processing, spreadsheet, and presentation applications are basic, standard  tools that many business users need and use on a daily basis. Lotus Notes 8 includes  a suite of office productivity tools that allow end users to create, edit, and collaborate  on a wide variety of file types. Lotus Notes 8 is packaged with IBM productivity  tools that support the OASIS Open Document Format  ODF . ODF is an international  standard for saving and sharing editable documents, such as word-processing  documents, spreadsheets and presentations.   [ 66 ]   Chapter 3  Eclipse At the core of Lotus Notes 8 software is IBM's version of Eclipse Rich Client Platform   RCP  technology, which introduces a new open-standards-based SOA that makes  Lotus Notes 8 software more extensible. In fact, a number of the new features  of Lotus Notes 8 are a direct result of this extensibility  for instance, Sametime  integration and RSS feed integration .  IBM has built a common client platform named Lotus Expeditor  previously called  WebSphere Everyplace Deployment or WED  that packages the Eclipse rich client  platform with some extra services  security, synchronization, data, deployment, and  more  that can be used across the IBM software product set. The Lotus Notes 8 client  is a consumer of this Lotus Expeditor common platform. This provides additional  functionality while ensuring "forward compatibility" for existing Lotus Notes and  Domino applications.  Lotus Notes 8 software supports nearly all custom Lotus Notes applications built  for prior versions and incorporates the open standards of the Eclipse application  development framework, allowing the use of a componentized SOA. This provides  helps to make it easy to aggregate, access, and deploy functionality from a mix of  software programs and systems. It enables developers to build applications more  quickly and to reuse existing assets as business needs evolve.  Summary In this chapter, we introduced service oriented architectures  SOAs  and saw how  Lotus Notes 8 supports it. We then looked at several Notes 8 features and capabilities  that can help you implement SOA-based architectures within your own organization.   We saw that, with a foundation in open technologies like Eclipse and with the  introduction of the composite application editor, Lotus Notes 8 can be a key part of  an SOA.  We also saw that currently Lotus Notes 8 only participates directly in the assemble  phase of an SOA lifecycle. However, the open framework on which Lotus Notes 8  is based provides a highly flexible platform, and we can expect to see significant  growth of Lotus Notes as a key factor in the growth and adoption of SOAs.   [ 67 ]    Productivity Tools  With the Lotus Notes 8 client comes a new suite of productivity tools which support  the OASIS Open Document Format  ODF . ODF is an international standard that  provides support for multiple file formats for word processing, presentations, and  spreadsheets. By adopting this format, IBM has allowed Notes users to read and save  documents in the Microsoft Office format as well as read from IBM Lotus SmartSuite  documents. Both can be saved as ODF documents or as PDF format documents.   The advantage of using the productivity tools with ODF is that you no longer have  to purchase an application from a single vendor in order to share and save your  documents. Using a non commercial ODF product, will allow you to avoid having to  maintain licenses, and also allow you to stop worrying about your software reaching  the end of its shelf life. These benefits can lead to a lower TCO for maintaining  software for document-based data.  This chapter provides an overview of the three productivity tools that are provided  with the client:         IBM Lotus Documents IBM Lotus Presentations IBM Lotus Spreadsheets  These productivity tools are also referred to as document editors, since you use them  to create and edit documents in various formats  word processing, presentations,  and spreadsheets respectively .   Productivity Tools  Productivity Tools Integration with Notes 8 The Eclipse architecture of the Notes 8 client supports the integration of other  applications. One key example of this is the integration of the productivity tools.  The preferences for the tools are in the Preferences interface. When opening the  preference options for the productivity tools, you will see the following:  This setting will load a file called soffice.exe. This file corresponds to a stub that  remains resident so that the tools will launch more quickly. If you do not want this to  occur, choose the setting not to pre-load the productivity tools.  The productivity tools are independent of the Domino 8 server. This means that the  tools will function without a Lotus Domino 8 server. They can even be launched  when the Notes client is not running. To do this, either double-click on the icon on  your desktop, or select the program from the Start menu.  [ 70 ]   Productivity Tools and Domino Policies A Domino administrator can control the productivity tools through a Productivity  Tools policy setting. This gives the administrator the ability to control who can use  the tools  and also control whether or not macros are permitted to run . It will also  control what document types will be opened by the productivity tools.  Chapter 4  [ 71 ]   Productivity Tools  IBM Lotus Documents The IBM Lotus Documents productivity tool is a document editor that allows you  to create documents containing graphics, charts, and tables. You can save your  documents in multiple formats. IBM Lotus Documents has a spell checker, which  provides for instant corrections, and many other tools that can be used to enhance  documents. No matter what the complexity of the documents that you are creating  or editing, this productivity tool can handle the job.  IBM Lotus Presentations The IBM Lotus Presentations tool will allow you to create professional presentations  featuring multimedia, charts, and graphics. The presentations tool comes with  templates that you can use to create your slide shows. If you wish, you can create  and save your own templates as well. The templates that you create should be saved  to the following directory: \Notes\framework\shared\eclipse\plugins\com. ibm.productivity.tools.template.en_3.0.0.20070428-1644\layout.  You  can save a template in a different directory, but you'll need to navigate to it when  creating a new presentation from that template.   [ 72 ]   Not only can you apply dynamic effects to the presentations, but you can also  publish them in a variety of formats.   Chapter 4  IBM Lotus Spreadsheets As its name indicates, IBM Lotus Spreadsheets is a tool used to create spreadsheets.  You can use this tool to calculate, display, and analyze your data. As with other  spreadsheet applications, the tool allows you to use functions to create formulas that  perform advanced calculations with your data.     [ 73 ]   Productivity Tools  One feature gives you the ability to change one factor in a calculation with many  factors so that the user can see how it effects the calculation. This is useful when  exploring multiple scenarios. IBM Lotus Spreadsheets also has a dynamic function  that will automatically update charts when the data changes.  Summary In this chapter, we have reviewed the productivity tools provided with the Notes 8  client. These tools include IBM Lotus Documents, IBM Lotus Presentations, and IBM  Lotus Spreadsheets. We have briefly examined how these tools are integrated with  Notes 8, and how they are controlled by Domino policy documents.   [ 74 ]   Lotus Domino 8   Server Features  As you can see from Chapter 2 of this book, a major focus of development activities  for release 8 is the Lotus Notes client. However, there are a number of significant  improvements and new features added to the Domino 8 server. These include mail- related features such as message recall and immediate notification of "Out of Office"  status. Other core components have been enhanced, such as cluster replication,  Domino Domain Monitoring, and security. Server performance has been improved,  while maintaining backwards compatibility and ease of upgrade, which does  not require changes to the hardware, the operating system, or even the On-Disk  Structure  ODS .  This chapter reviews the new features and enhancements in Domino 8. We will  discuss the following:                End user and messaging enhancements such as mail recall and automated  inbox cleanup. Administrator enhancements such as improved Domino Domain Monitoring. Performance enhancements such as streaming cluster replication and an  improved AdminP process.  Directory and security enhancements such as the integration of Directory  Integrator and new directory views. Integration with other IBM technologies.  Our goal is to provide an overview of these topics so as to help you better  understand the new and enhanced features within Domino 8.   Lotus Domino 8 Server Features  End-User and Messaging Enhancements  There a number of new features provided to both end users and administrators in  Lotus Domino 8. This section will focus on the following:             Message recall "Out of Office" service Automated inbox cleanup Transfer and delivery delay reports Connection termination error limits  Message Recall You can now recall mail messages that have been sent to other users within a Lotus  Domino environment. Previously, administrators needed to manually delete a  message that had been inadvertently sent. This process was painstaking and often  did not fully provide the ability to recall messages. The new message recall feature  will allow the end users to initiate the recall of messages and  as long as the message  has been routed only through the NRPC protocol  the recipient's mail server will  attempt to recall the message.  The message recall feature will only work for users using the Notes 8 mail template  with servers running Domino 8. It will work across domains as long as the message  was only routed via NRPC; messages that get sent over SMTP through the Internet  will not be able to be recalled.  The message recall feature is enabled and configured for the entire Domino 8  environment through a server configuration document. This server configuration  document allows administrators to configure the service to recall messages,  depending on whether or not they have been read by the end user, or depending on  the age of the message.  [ 76 ]   In addition to a global setting for the environment, message recall can be applied  more granularly through the use of a mail policy. The mail policy can be configured  to change the parameters for the end users, but the use of a policy does not override  the global configuration. Within the policy document, administrators can set whether  the end users can recall messages and whether messages sent to end users can be  recalled. In addition, the policy can define whether or not to recall messages based  on whether they have been read by the end user or have passed a predefined age.  Chapter 5  "Out of Office" Messages In previous releases of Domino, "Out of Office" functionality was only offered as an  agent. As a result, there was a delay in processing "Out of Office" messages for the  end users. Typically, senders of messages to end users that had enabled their "Out  of Office" agent would not receive notice for up to four hours based on the default  configuration, but this could be greater based on internal implementations. Some  environments were modified to inform senders of their "Out of Office" status at a  more frequent interval. This shortening of the interval could affect the performance  of the servers, because they would need to process the agent on a more frequent  basis. The Domino 8 environment allows administrators to configure the "Out of  Office" feature as a service on the server, rather than as an agent.  The configuration of the "Out of Office" feature as a service is not a requirement  in Domino 8; the environment can continue to be configured via an agent. It is  important to note that the utilization of Notes 8, the Notes 8 mail template, and a  Domino 8 server is required for this feature to work. If the Notes 8 template or all  servers  including cluster pairs  are not running Domino 8, you must configure the  "Out of Office" feature as an agent.  [ 77 ]   Lotus Domino 8 Server Features  Configuring the "Out of Office" feature as a service allows Domino 8 to send the "Out  of Office" notification as soon as messages are received, after the server and end user  mail rules are applied. Another enhancement of running the "Out of Office" feature  as a service is that, once an end user enables the feature, upon the completion of the  "Out of Office" time frame, the service is turned off after the first message is acted  upon or through normal server maintenance routines.  Enhanced Support for the Mail Thread Feature Mail threads were introduced in early versions of Notes and Domino. The earlier  implementation of mail threads within the inbox in Notes had some limitations,  specifically when messages within the mail thread were deleted thus breaking the  thread. Additionally, messages that were received from outside systems were not  included in the mail thread. The Domino 8 support for client-based mail threads has  been enhanced to ensure that the threads are persistent and that deletion or archiving  of messages within the thread will not cause problems. In addition, enhanced  support for messages outside of the Domino environment has been extended and can  be included within the mail threads.  [ 78 ]   The enhanced mail features are delivered through the Domino server to the end user,  therefore the Domino 8 mail thread functionality is not dependent on Notes 8  since  the Notes 7 client will provide the mail threads within the inbox view , the Notes 8  mail template, or the Domino 8 server for the senders or intermediate servers that  will route the mail. The end user's mail server must be running Domino 8 for it to  deliver the enhanced functionality.  Chapter 5  Automated Inbox Cleanup An excessive number of documents in a single view can be a significant end-user  performance issue, particularly the primary view when the database is open.  The number of documents in the Inbox view within the mail database can hinder  performance by increasing the time required to build the view. When end users  leave all of their incoming messages in the inbox view and do not archive messages  or place them in folders, the inbox can become unwieldy. Domino 8 introduces the  Automated Inbox cleanup process that removes messages from the inbox.  The Automated Inbox Cleanup feature can either be set through the server  configuration document:  or through the use of a mail policy:  [ 79 ]   Lotus Domino 8 Server Features  This feature doesn't require Notes 8 or the Notes 8 mail template, but your mail  databases need to be hosted on a Domino 8 server. Through the server configuration  document and the mail policy document, administrators can set the schedule for  inbox maintenance based on the day and time.   Administrators can add this functionality for all users or a select group of users. The  inbox cleanup can occur with a specified time frame and can leave documents in the  inbox if they have not been read.   Reverse Path Setting for Forwarded  Messages As spam filters and other technologies proliferate, so has the use of reverse lookups  for ensuring the proper address is used so that messages are not rejected. When a  mail rule is set to forward messages within Domino 8 and the forwarded message  contains a null value, some spam filters may reject the message. The new reverse  path setting feature in Domino 8 allows for the setting of the path so as to ensure that  messages are not rejected. Within the server configuration document, administrators  have the ability to set the reverse path for forwarded mail.  Rejecting Ambiguous Names Denying Mail   to Groups In some SMTP configurations, the environment is set up so as to conduct lookups to  the directory before routing messages within the infrastructure. When this setting is  configured, the server will reject ambiguous addresses for end users and groups.   [ 80 ]   Upon rejection of the message, a return message is routed to inform the sender   that the message has been rejected by the Domino environment based on a   corporate policy.  Chapter 5  There are a number of other new and enhanced features in Domino 8 including  router group expansion, transfer and delivery of delay reports, and improved HTML  rendering for email. Refer to Domino 8 Administrator Help for more information on  these and other topics.  Administration Enhancements Domino administrators will welcome a number of important enhancements in  Domino 8 including:         Enhancements to the end user renaming process Enhancements to the AdminP process  Enhancements to the Domino Domain Monitor  DDM  feature  [ 81 ]   Lotus Domino 8 Server Features  The End User Renaming Process The end user renaming process in Domino is executed by leveraging the AdminP  process. When the request for a change in the user's name or shift in the hierarchy  is submitted, the AdminP process begins to execute the renaming process in all  databases throughout the environment. This ensures that ACLs, reader fields, and  so on are updated with the new information. These requests are very intensive and   depending on the size and complexity of the environment  can take a considerable  amount of time.   In Domino 8, the new names list feature builds a list of author and reader names  found in the database, which the AdminP process can then use. If the name is found  in the list, the AdminP process will make the appropriate changes to the fields. This  new feature will increase the efficiency with which the AdminP process executes  name changes throughout the environment. The limitation for the names list is 4K; if  the list is larger, the AdminP process reverts to looking through the entire database  to identify the fields where the name exists.  If your servers are running Domino 8 and have the new On-Disk Structure  ODS   applied  see the section on the new ODS structure later in this chapter , then the  AdminP process will be able to use this new names list feature.  The AdminP Process  The Lotus Domino environment invokes the AdminP process for executing requests   user renaming, database moves and deletes, and so on  and uses the AdminP  database, which is built from the AdminP.ntf template. A replica copy of the  database is placed on every server. As AdminP requests are generated, they are  recorded on the administration server and then pushed out via replication to the  other Domino servers. The servers will then look up and execute the tasks   as required.  In Domino 8, requests that are generated for a specific server will be directly  placed on that server as long as there is connectivity between the servers. The  implementation of placing requests directly on the executing server should speed  up the processing of the requests, because the replication of the AdminP database  is removed from the process  which can cause some delays due to scheduling  issues . There is no dependency on Notes 8 or the Notes 8 template to deliver this  functionality, but the source server must be upgraded to Domino 8.  This enhancement of the AdminP process is the default setting in Domino 8. To  disable this feature, set the following in Notes.ini:  ADMINP_DONT_ATTEMPT_DIRECT_DEPOSIT=1  [ 82 ]   Chapter 5  Domino Domain Monitoring  DDM  Domino Domain Monitoring  DDM  was introduced in Domino 7. The goal of DDM  is to reduce the administrative workload required to troubleshoot and manage issues  in the Domino environment. Prior to the introduction of DDM, administrators had  so as to review a number of sources to collect the appropriate information to conduct  problem determination. Domino 8 includes several enhancements to DDM.   WebSphere Services Probe Domino 8 includes the ability to monitor the Lotus Connections'  the Lotus  Connections software is not bundled with Domino, this function only enhances the  monitoring capabilities  Activities function, which is hosted on a WebSphere server.  A new WebSphere Services probe has been introduced so as to give the Domino  administrator the ability to monitor the connectivity status of the activities servers.  [ 83 ]   Lotus Domino 8 Server Features LDAP Search Reporting Domino provides a robust LDAP server built into its base server functionality. As  more and more environments become dependent on the LDAP services provided  by Domino, it is important to ensure that searches are completed with appropriate  response times. The new LDAP Search Response probe allows you to monitor and  track response times as they relate to LDAP searches.  Common Actions Quick Access Feature The DDM database within the Domino 8 environment provides a set of common  tasks that are performed by administrators. From within the DDM database, you  can simply click on the Common Actions drop-down menu and access routine  administrative actions without switching to another view or client.  [ 84 ]   Chapter 5  By Database View Working through the DDM database can be difficult when you are trying to work  on specific issues related to a single database. In Domino 7, administrators were  required to search through the database or create a custom view and then maintain  that view as new releases of the product were deployed. The new By Database view  allows you to research specific issues related to a troublesome database or respond to  a customer issue without having to ensure that the view is brought forward if it was  customized in previous versions.  Other Domino 8 administration features include Domino Administrator integration  with IBM CommonStore Archive Services, Web Administration Server Bookmarks,  automatic report closing  administration probe subtype ; execute CA role, modular  documents, and others. For a more complete review of the DDM features, you  should refer to the Domino 8 Administrator Help.  Performance Enhancements  Domino 8 includes a number of new features designed to enhance its performance.  The focus of these enhancements is on reducing server overhead and load from  functions within the environment.  This section will focus on the following new and enhanced features:         Streaming cluster replication New ODS  design note compression, on-demand collations  Simple search controls  [ 85 ]   Lotus Domino 8 Server Features  Streaming Replication The cluster replication process moves information between the cluster member  servers to ensure that, in case of a server outage, users maintain access to the most   up-to-date information. As a new item is received on one server, the cluster  replication process pushes the information to the other server. A typical  configuration of the cluster replication task is to have one instance enabled on  each server. You can increase the number of cluster replication tasks within the  environment, but doing so increases disk I O requirements, and this may have an  effect on performance.  Domino 8 introduces a new feature for the cluster replication process, streaming  replication. Streaming replication allows for the immediate transfer of information  from one server to its cluster mate, without requiring the server to write to disk. The  replication process occurs within the memory, thereby reducing I O requirements.  Cluster replications works closely with the normal replication process to ensure that  the impact on the environment is reduced. Streaming replication is a server-based  feature that does not require Notes 8 or the Notes 8 mail template.  New ODS Domino 8 includes a new On-Disk Structure  ODS  that will allow the  implementation of new features to increase performance and reduce the amount  of overhead required to maintain and manage the environment. The new ODS 48  is not a requirement when moving to Domino 8. Instead, it is an option that takes  advantage of the design note compression and on demand collation features. To  upgrade the databases, add the line Create_R8_Databases=1 to your server's  Notes.ini file. To upgrade databases to the new ODS and compress the design, run  a copy-style compaction.  The design note compression and view collation features  require ODS 48.   Design Note Compression Design note compression is a new feature provided in Domino 8 to assist in reducing  the space required by the database templates. The compression feature allows  design elements to be compressed, thereby reducing disk requirements. Based on  preliminary testing, database size could be reduced up to 55% to 60%. Design note  compression does not require Notes 8 or the Notes 8 mail template, but since this is a  server feature, the Domino 8 server is required.   [ 86 ]   Chapter 5  On-Demand Collation A new Domino 8 feature is the ability to allow application developers to leave  the creation of indexes until the end user leverages the sorting feature within  the database. This option will reduce unnecessary overheads for the Domino  server. To enable this feature, Notes 8 and the Notes 8 mail template are not  required. But since this is a server-based feature, the Domino 8 server is required.  To enable this feature, add the following line to Notes.ini: ENABLE_ON_DEMAND_ COLLATIONS=1.  Managing Simple Searches Effectively The Notes Domino environment allows for feature rich searching capabilities. These  capabilities leverage the full text index created for a database. If a full text index has  not been created when the user searches for the information, the server attempts to  locate the information within the database. The process of searching the database  without a full text index can significantly impact the performance of the server. In  Domino 8, a new enhancement is introduced so as to eliminate the use of simple  search and thus increase server performance. [ 87 ]   Lotus Domino 8 Server Features  By checking the Don't Allow simple search checkbox within the database properties  tab, you can significantly enhance performance. If the database does not have a full  text index and this feature is enabled, the end user will receive an error and the  search will not be completed for the database.  There are a number of other new performance-related features and enhancements   in Domino 8. These include improved server availability in a cluster and critical  request scheduling.  Domino Directory and Security  Enhancements Domino 8 offers a number of important Domino Directory and security  enhancements. These include:       IBM Tivoli Directory Integrator The Directory management tool  [ 88 ]   Chapter 5                   Enhancements in Directory Assistance authentication Directory Assistance LDAP configuration wizards People view by Lotus Notes version Internet password lockout Enhanced ID recovery APIs Preventing access to Internet password fields Enhanced local database encryption Certificates  IBM Tivoli Directory Integrator One of the most complicated problems to solve when implementing Domino  or  any system that requires a directory to function  is locating the single authoritative  source to use for access or identity management. Tivoli Director Integrator  TDI  is a  directory integration engine that provides a system that allows business rules to be  applied to synchronize data in any direction. TDI provides different "assembly lines"   integration components that use the TDI API to connect various stores so as to allow  TDI to apply those business rules .   For example, if you have Microsoft Active Directory for file and print services, an  LDAP store for web authentication, SAP or Peoplesoft for HR, or Lotus Domino,  then TDI will allow granular control of user properties across all systems with TDI  serving as the arbiter and synchronizing "master".  TDI  AssemblyLines  Graphical Integrated  Development Environment  Web  Administration and Monitoring  Action Manager Monitor, control and log Service  CommandLine  Interface  Services  Execution   RT environment  Logging, tracing  API & JMX  SystemStore  SystemQueue  Functions, delta, libraries, pooling,  tombstones, notifications  ACT event processing  Components  Files  LDAP directories  JDBC databases  JMS   MQ queues  Web Services  HTTP, TCP  XML, LDIF, DMSL, CSV  SNMP, JMX  CCMDB  GLA  more..  Java VM  Windows, Linux, AIX, zOS, Sun, HP,  i5 OS in 6.1.1   [ 89 ]   Lotus Domino 8 Server Features  This applies to Domino as follows. With email, every message or calendar invitation  that is sent requires a directory lookup to find the recipient for delivery. In typical  organizations, the email directory and the authoritative directory are not the same.  Domino 8 includes a license for TDI to synchronize these directories in a manner that  previously has been extremely difficult and expensive.  The following illustration shows a connection from Microsoft Active Directory as  the directory partner for Lotus Domino, where directory entries flow bi-directionally  between the two systems.   Applications  TDI  Applications  Active  Directory  Lotus Domino  Sync adds mods deletes to Domino  AD change connector  Domino Users  connector  Sync change to mail address back to AD  LDAP  connector  Domino change  connector  Previous versions of Domino included a tool known as ADSynch to perform a  similar function. However, this tool was not as flexible or scalable as TDI. As the  name suggests, ADSynch only synchronizes Active Directory and Domino. TDI can  connect to nearly any system.  This model provides a single user interface for ID generation and management. If a  user is created on either side, IDs and ancillary entries are created on the other. This  could be with two systems as illustrated above, or with many systems and entries  flowing to all the other systems user-specific attributes as defined by TDI.  When implementing Notes Domino 8 in a "green field" environment or as a  migration, the directory integration piece is a primary component, not just another  feature to be added. With the addition of TDI, Notes Domino 8 lets you bring in  many different directories and provide services much more easily than before.  However, this does not mean that directory integration should be considered less  important just because it's not as difficult. Disparate directories in organizations today  are more prevalent than five years ago, so this directory integration functionality has  become more logistically complicated, as tools such as TDI have evolved to make  the technical aspects simpler.  For a more complete review of the TDI features and  functionality, you should refer to the IBM Tivoli Directory Integrator documentation.    [ 90 ]   Chapter 5  Directory Management Tool  DirLint  Domino 8 introduces a new tool called DirLint. This tool lets you verify the  information that is contained within the directory. It runs against the directory  and helps you identify issues, including invalid syntax in names and issues with  the naming hierarchy scheme. It also validates that users' names found in groups  through Directory Assistance are consistent.  DirLint is a command line utility that is loaded by simply typing, "load dirlint" on  the server console. It provides an XML document as output. This document can be  read using any Internet web browser.   The information that is produced will be stored in \\Domino\data\IBM\IBM_ TECHNICAL_ SUPPORT\lintout_ ServerName _ Date  as shown above. An  example of the information provided in the XML file is as follows:  [ 91 ]   Lotus Domino 8 Server Features  Authentication through Directory Assistance In previous releases of Domino, Directory Assistance provided all directories for  both authentication and name resolution when addressing messages. This created a  situation where ambiguous names would be displayed while a message was being  addressed if there was an "authentication only" directory included in the Directory  Assistance task. In Domino 8, you have the option through Directory Assistance to  specify that the server only references directories contained within the document  during the authentication process. This allows you to effectively deploy Directory  Assistance for authentication without affecting end users during the addressing   of messages.  Directory Assistance LDAP Configuration  Wizards Domino 8 offers configuration wizards for LDAP directories. In previous releases,  you needed to know a significant amount of information about the LDAP directories  that were being connected via Directory Assistance. You still need to understand  basic Directory Assistance and LDAP concepts, but the new Suggest and Verify  buttons on the configuration document help you complete the document thus  ensuring the proper connectivity to the LDAP servers. Some of the wizard buttons  run scripts on the Domino server or connect to the LDAP server directly.  [ 92 ]   Chapter 5  People View by Lotus Notes Version As users log into Domino, the AdminP process captures the Notes version used to  access the server. The information is stored within the Person documents in the   Domino Directory.  [ 93 ]   Lotus Domino 8 Server Features  The new People  by Client Version view allows you to go to the Domino directory  and identify the clients that the users are using to access the server. In previous  releases, this was a custom view that was needed to be developed and maintained.  Internet Password Lockout Domino 8 now offers an Internet password lockout feature. This feature provides a  mechanism  via the inetlockout.nsf database  to track all access attempts to the  HTTP environment so that the status of the login attempt is logged. The creation of  the Internet lockout database can be done manually, during server startup after the  process has been configured, upon the first request to view a document, or when a  document needs to be created within the database. The only caveat is that the service  must have been running for a period of 10 minutes if the server is not to be rebooted.  The Internet password lockout feature can be enabled for the entire environment  through a configuration document, or via a policy that more granularly assigns the  ability to lockout users from the HTTP access. The configuration setting does   the following:          Enables the feature Sets the logging feature to report lockouts, failures, or both Sets the maximum number of tries allowed, the lockout expiration timing  in minutes, hours and days, and the maximum interval between tries in  minutes, hours and days.  The lockout feature only applies to HTTP access, and traditional anti-spoofing  mechanism is leveraged within the rich Notes client so that services such as LDAP,  POP, IMAP, DIIOP, Lotus Quickplace, and Lotus Sametime are currently not  supported with this feature. If your Domino environment is using a customized  DSAPI filter, there is a possibility that the Internet password lockout feature will  not function, because customized DSAPI filters can be coded to bypass the standard  Domino login facility.  [ 94 ]   Chapter 5  When configuring Internet password lockout via a security policy, the same options  are presented as with the configuration document.     It is important to note that enabling this feature could increase the initial call volume  to your Help desk or the administrative overhead required to manage passwords  if the HTTP password feature is used significantly within the organization. Also,  malicious attacks can occur on the Domino servers through denial of service   attacks. This type of an attack could significantly reduce effectiveness within   the environment.  [ 95 ]   Lotus Domino 8 Server Features  Enhanced Local Database Encryption In Domino 8 the encryption level for all new databases will be set for strong  encryption. The ability to encrypt databases with an end user's ID to prevent access  by other users' IDs is necessary so as to ensure the protection of data once a database  is brought to the local workstation. In previous releases, databases had the ability  to be encrypted at the simple, medium, or strong levels, depending on the needs  and requirements of the environment and the end users. Domino will still provide  backwards compatibility for the simple and medium encryption models, but going  forward, all new replicas will be encrypted as strong.   Certifier Key Rollover Domino administrators can assign a new set of public and private keys to a Domino  certificate authority. These keys are used to certify the keys of OUs, servers,  and users in that organization. The process of assigning news keys is known as  key rollover. Rolling over a CA key may become necessary if the current key is  considered too short for adequate encryption, the current key is too old, or if the  value of the current private key has been compromised.  When an administrator assigns a new set of keys to a Domino certificate authority,  they are created and self-certified and added to the top-level certifier ID file in the  pending key area of the ID file. The keys that were previously used are added to the  archived keys area of the ID file, and rollover certificates binding the new and old  keys are added to the rollover certificate area of the ID file.    [ 96 ]   Chapter 5  In order to support certifier key rollover, the Domino trust model has been extended  to include a new type of certificate, rollover certificates. These certificates are issued  by an entity to itself. In a hierarchical certificate, there is a single issuer name, a  single subject name, and a single subject key. In a rollover certificate, there is a single  name  which is both the issuer and the subject  and two subject keys; one key is used  to sign the certificate and attests to the fact that the subject name is legitimately in  possession of the other key.     Generally, when a key is rolled over, two roll-over certificates are issued; one of   them is signed by the old key saying that the new key is valid, and the other is  signed by the new key saying that the old key is valid. Each certificate has its own  expiration date.    Rollover certificates are essential for limiting the expiration dates of certificates  issued to the older keys. One of the reasons for rolling over a key is that a former key  has been compromised or considered to be old enough for the danger of compromise  to be unacceptable. In such cases, limiting the expiration date of a rollover certificate  limits the lifetime of a formerly issued child certificate. This is done by specifying an  early enough expiration date in the rollover certificate.   SSO for LTPAToken2 Multi-server session-based authentication, also known as single sign-on  SSO ,  allows web users to log in once to a Domino or WebSphere server, and then access  any other Domino or WebSphere servers in the same DNS domain that are enabled  for SSO without having to log in again. The SSO feature makes logging in and using  multiple servers in a mixed environment easier for users. Web browsers must have  cookies enabled since the authentication token that is generated by the server is sent  to the browser in a cookie.  SSO may be set up by creating a domain-wide configuration document in the  directory and enabling the multi-servers option for session-based authentication in a  web site or a server document.  [ 97 ]   Lotus Domino 8 Server Features  Certificate Revocation Checking through the  Online Certificate Status Protocol  OCSP  The Online Certificate Status Protocol  OCSP  enables applications to determine  the revocation state of an identified certificate. OCSP checks are made during  S MIME signature verification and mail encryption by the Notes client. OCSP is  enabled through a policy, using the Enable OCSP checking setting on the Keys and  Certificates tab.  Other new Domino 8 directory security features include LDAP server  improvements for WebSphere Member Manager  WMM  and larger key support.  Enhanced Integration with IBM Servers  and Tools The Notes and Domino environment has continually leveraged other IBM  technologies to improve performance, reliability, administration, and functionality.  The Domino 8 release has built upon prior successes and added more robust  support for other IBM technologies. This section will focus on the integration of DB2,  WebSphere Portal, and the Tivoli Enterprise Console.  IBM DB2 as a Back-End Data Store Lotus Domino 7 introduced the ability to use IBM DB2 software as an alternative  to the Lotus Notes storage facility  NSF  for storing Lotus Domino data on a per- database basis. This feature, called the Lotus Domino and DB2 feature, enables you  to use both DB2 and Lotus Domino databases, accessing and viewing data stored in  either format.  [ 98 ]   Chapter 5  When you run Domino with DB2, there are three distinct interactions that occur  between Domino and DB2:  Domino uses DB2 as an alternate data store for Notes data. Specific sets of data are pushed from an NSF to DB2 in the form of DB2  Access Views  DAVs . A Notes view can be built based on an SQL query in the form of query views.   Domino 8 introduces two new features for integration with DB2:  Set or delete default DB2 user name. Domino verifies the uniqueness of the  default DB2 user name.  DB2 Move Container. This allows you to move a DB2 from one disk or  volume to another disk or volume so as to control space usage.     IBM WebSphere Portal Integration Wizard A future release of WebSphere Portal will introduce an enhanced integration wizard  that reduces the complexity required to enable Lotus Domino 8 and WebSphere  Portal integration. This includes the setting up of the Common PIM  personal  information management  portlets  CPP  and the Lotus Domino Extended Products  portlets  DEPP .  The wizard will automate the following      Configure single sign-on  export LTPA token, create Web SSO document on  Lotus Domino . Configure Lotus Sametime  single sign-on, enable awareness for Lotus  Domino Web Access, set up trusted servers in STCENTER.NSF . Configure Lotus Domino Directory  single sign-on, DIIOP, configure  collaborative services to bind to Lotus Domino LDAP . Configure Lotus Domino mail servers  single sign-on, DIIOP, Notes.ini  settings for HTTP, enable XML services .                            [ 99 ]   Lotus Domino 8 Server Features  Perhaps the most dramatic improvement is the Notes 8 rich client. Notes and  Domino 8 software makes it easy for you to integrate line-of-business solutions and  data into a new class of applications, called composite applications. Both Domino  8 and WebSphere Portal 6 servers can host composite applications. This will allow  clients to run both Domino applications and portlets  as well as servlets and Internet  applications . The following diagram depicts the Notes Domino infrastructure,   a rich client, as well as a web client and necessary components to facilitate   this architecture.    Web client  Rich client  Lotus Notes 8.0  Web browser  Lotus Expeditor Platform  NSF Components  Composite  Application Editor  Client  Server  Composite  Template Editor  WebSphere Portal  Lotus Domino  IBM Tivoli Enterprise Console Integration  The Tivoli Enterprise console consolidates events from networks, hardware, and  software throughout the environment, and presents them in a single monitoring  interface. Domino 7 allowed you to configure events generated by operating system  probes to be viewed with other events in the Enterprise console.    Domino 8 allows you to configure any events to be forwarded to the Enterprise  console. The first thing you need to do is configure the connectivity to the Tivoli  Enterprise Console through the Lotus Domino server configuration document.   [ 100 ]   It is then necessary to forward the events to the Tivoli Enterprise Console. You do  this by configuring the events.nsf database so as to describe the proper Event  Handler documents required by the Enterprise console.    Chapter 5     Summary In this chapter, we took a brief look at the major new and enhanced feature areas  in Domino 8. This includes end user and messaging enhancements, administrator  enhancements, performance enhancements, directory and security enhancements,  and better integration with other IBM technologies.   [ 101 ]    Deployment Enhancements  in Notes Domino 8   The deployment and management of Notes Domino has traditionally been divided  between the Domino administration staff and the desktop management team. In  previous releases, the deployment of Notes was a completely stand-alone process,  and Domino administrators relied on the desktop team to deploy the client. Domino  then introduced a feature called Smart Upgrade to assist with the management and  deployment of new Notes client releases. This concept of server-based management  of the client was significantly enhanced with the introduction of policies and  enhancements to Smart Upgrade.  The task of managing the Notes client through Domino has been significantly  enhanced in Notes Domino 8. With the introduction of the Eclipse client platform  for Notes, the Domino server becomes a provisioning tool. Advancements in policies  and the introduction of the database redirect feature also significantly improve the  ability to manage the Notes environment.  This chapter focuses on the new and improved technologies that allow Domino to  better deploy and manage upgrades to the Notes client:           Client provisioning includes new features that leverage Eclipse client and  server provisioning.  Policy enhancements include new and enhanced features within the policy  document environment.  Database redirect is a new feature that allows you to better manage database  access from the end user environment.   Deployment Enhancements in Notes Domino 8   Client Provisioning The shifting of Notes to the Eclipse platform has a significant impact on the end  user community. As noted in chapter 2 of this book, the new look and feel of the  client and the underlying Eclipse foundation enhances the end user environment.  Eclipse-based plug-ins in Notes extend the user's ability to work in a collaborative  environment. Unfortunately, the management of these new features may require  a higher level of user interaction. Lotus IBM has recognized this issue, and has  leveraged the native Eclipse provisioning architecture to allow for the management  of plug-ins and the desktop environment. The introduction of these provisioning  features does not replace the Smart Upgrade feature; this utility can still be used to  deploy versions of the client.  Server-Managed Provisioning Domino 8 offers functionality that allows for the deployment of the full Notes client,  Eclipse-based plug-ins, and applications  native Domino, composite, or Expeditor  based . The following illustration shows the different models for managing the end  user environment:  Domino Server  SmartUpgrade Components   Client   Eclipse Plug-ins   Components   non-Notes Client   Domino, Composite or Expenditor based  Applications  Deploy and  manage  Client versions  Deploy and  manage Plug-ins  Deploy and  manage  Applications  Notes release 8  End User Workstation  [ 104 ]   Chapter 6  Smart Upgrade The traditional Smart Upgrade feature within the Domino server can be used to  deploy Notes to the end users. The Smart Upgrade feature will assist in pushing the  entire set of client code to the Notes user community.  For more information on the Smart Upgrade feature, refer to the Domino 8  Administrator Help database.  Eclipse-Based Provisioning Notes 8 is built on the Eclipse foundation. Composite applications are considered  as features within the Notes architecture, so their deployment and management is  handled through the same process as other Eclipse-based features. The management  of   Eclipse-based clients such as Notes and Sametime Connect 7.5.x is now shifted to  the native provisioning model. When the end user or administrator wants to push  out a new feature to Notes, they will be directed to a Site.XML, which contains the  information for installing the feature. The feature that is being installed within the  Eclipse framework will have dependant plug-ins required for the feature to function  properly.  Within Domino 8, a new update.ntf template leverages the native Notes replication  and security features, to provide and manage access to new and updated features.  For more information on provisioning features through Domino, consult the   Domino 8 Administrator Help database.  Site.XML  \Features  \Plug-ins  [ 105 ]   Deployment Enhancements in Notes Domino 8   Policies Policies were introduced in earlier releases of Domino to assist in the management  of end users through a server-managed process. They are configured through the  Domino Directory. Domino 8 introduces new policy documents, as well as new  options within existing policy documents. This section will review these new and  enhanced policies and options.  It is important to note that Domino uses dynamic configuration to  deploy all policy settings, with the exception of the mail policy settings.  When end users authenticate with their home servers, the information  stored within the policy settings documents is deployed  pushed down   to the end users. The mail policy settings are not deployed through the  dynamic configuration process; instead they are deployed throughout the  environment via the administration process  AdminP .  "How to apply setting" Feature In previous releases of Domino, policies were applied to all end users who were  configured to receive them. This was limiting, as it forced users to conform to the  policies without the option of changing them later if necessary. The new How to  apply setting option allows you to configure whether the policy is applied, using one  of the following three options:           No policy, use default value: This option uses the initial configuration upon  installation of the client. Set initial value: This option sets the value for the end user, but does not  prohibit the end user from later changing it to better suit current requirements. Set value and prevent changes: This option sets the value for the end user  and enforces the option so that the end user cannot make a change.  [ 106 ]   Chapter 6  Activities Policy Settings Document Lotus Connections does not require the use of Notes Domino, but with the Eclipse  platform, the Activities portion of the product can be leveraged as a plug-in to the  client environment. To support this new product and the plug-in, Domino 8 contains  a new Activities policy document to manage the Activities environment, specifically  the ability to configure an Activities server URL and port. Additionally, you can  specify whether or not SSL is leveraged to encrypt the username, password, and data.  Productivity Tools Settings Document The support of Open Document Format  ODF  has been extended to Notes Domino  through the introduction of productivity tools within the client. To support this new  feature, Domino 8 contains a new productivities tools policy document. This can  be used to leverage the tools and macros, and the ability to choose which Microsoft  Office and SmartSuite files and templates to open by default.  [ 107 ]   Deployment Enhancements in Notes Domino 8   Desktop Policy Settings Document  and Setup  Policy Settings Document  To ease the management of the environment, the options for the setup policy  settings document are now also available in the desktop policy settings document.  You can now use just one document  the desktop policy settings document  to  establish the desktop policy settings as well as many of the setup policy settings. It is  recommended that going forward, you use the new, updated desktop policy settings  document to define both your desktop policy settings and your setup policy settings.  The desktop policy settings document controls the user's workspace. Desktop  settings are enforced the first time a user logs in to Notes and runs setup. After the  initial setup, you can use the policy settings to update the user's desktop settings.  Users receive updates to the settings when any of the policy settings change; the  desktop policy settings are enforced the next time users authenticate with their   home server.  Replication Settings through the Desktop and  Setup Policy Documents As customers consolidate their Domino environments, the use of the local replication  model is becoming more popular. Local replication allows end users to interact  with their mail databases locally on their machines and to leverage the native  asynchronous notification process to deliver mail to the workstation.   Deploying the local replication model is the key to the success of the consolidation  project. With local replica-based mail, users perform all their mail functions in a  replica stored on the hard drive of the workstation. They can use replication to create  a local instance of a Domino database on the workstation. Updates such as receiving  new mail or template changes are initially received by the server mail replica. The  Notes client then pulls these updates to the local database via replication. Any  changes that have been made on the local mail replica, such as composing new  mail, deleting mail, or putting it in a folder, are pushed to the Domino server after  receiving new updates via replication.  [ 108 ]   Chapter 6  compAdircat.nsf  Mail\euser.nsf  compAdircat.nsf  Mail\euser.nsf  compAdircat.nsf  Mail\euser.nsf  Implementing local replica-based mail allows users to access databases on the  workstation without requiring a connection to a Domino server. This approach  provides advantages for users who are connected over a wide area network or a  virtual private network, since the operations of sending and receiving mail happen  without the user noticing. By performing these operations in the background, slight  errors in network communication will not be known to the user. Since new messages  are kept locally until sent, there will not be any hang conditions in the Notes client  when a server connection is slowed or lost.    For the consolidated environment, Notes clients will be configured to connect  to a primary and secondary email server at the closest geographic site. The local  replication model will be used and new messages will be synchronized with the  servers in a high priority replication interval of 5-10 minutes. Addressing services  will be provided by a condensed directory replicated to the local Notes client on a  normal replication cycle of 30-60 minutes. Applications will be replicated following  the normal replication cycle. Notes 8 clients will use the integrated instant messaging  services linked to a clustered Sametime instant messaging server.    The desktop policies include a section that allows you to set and enforce replication  on end users' workstations. In previous versions of Notes Domino, there was no  way to set and or enforce replication to the end users desktop. This allowed some  users to disable replication or set the replication threshold at one minute or less.  [ 109 ]   Deployment Enhancements in Notes Domino 8   The following diagram outlines the replication settings available through the desktop  policy. All options have the new How to apply this setting feature to enhance the  setting of standards throughout the environment.  Security Policy Settings Document The security policy settings document has been enhanced to allow administrators to  better manage Notes and Internet passwords, configure password polices, set up key  rollover, and manage administration execution control lists  ECLs . In addition to  these features, the security policy document in Domino 8 has been enhanced to  account for the installation of Eclipse-based plug-ins. There are three options that can  be configured within the security policy document within the Signed Plug-in tab, as  noted below. Each option has the ability to be configured with the options as noted:  Ask the user, Never install, and Always install.  [ 110 ]   There are a number of other new and enhanced features within the policies  environment. Refer to the Domino 8 Administrator Help for more information about  this and other topics.  Chapter 6  Database Redirect In previous releases of Notes Domino, when the administrator moved or deleted a  database, it was sometimes difficult to have end users redirect their links to the new  location or  in the case of deletion  shift them to a replica. To address this, Domino 8  introduces a new feature called database redirect.  Redirect When Databases Are Moved  To redirect a database that is being moved, open the administration client and select  the database in the Files tab. Then in the right pane select Database  Move.    [ 111 ]   Deployment Enhancements in Notes Domino 8   Select the servers to which you want to move the database, and select the directory in  which the databases should be placed. In the right-hand pane, select the server, and  in the lower right-hand section select Create a redirect marker for updating client  references. This creates the redirection after the administrative process completes   the move.  [ 112 ]   Redirection When Databases Are Deleted  In the adm the administration client Files tab, select the database to be moved. Then, in the  right pane, select Database  Delete.    Chapter 6  In the dialog box, select the Create a marker that allows clients to update their  references to this database option.  [ 113 ]   Deployment Enhancements in Notes Domino 8   Then choose the server to which users will be redirected to access the database.  This is very useful when deleting a database on a specific server where the end user  population is known.  You can then move users to a replica on another server so as to help balance the load  within the environment. When the following dialog box is presented, click Add to  select the replica to which users are to be redirected.   [ 114 ]   When selecting the database for redirection, you have the option of selecting which  users should be redirected to the replica of the database.  This is an optional step in  the redirect process.    Chapter 6  Then select OK in the dialog box to confirm the redirect.  Summary In this chapter, we have examined a number of important Notes Domino 8  features that can make rolling out your new deployment significantly easier. We  discussed client provisioning, including Eclipse-based client and server provisioning  functionality. We also looked at policy enhancements and the new database   redirect feature.   [ 115 ]    Upgrading to Notes Domino 8  After you have decided to upgrade to Domino 8, you will need to create an upgrade  plan. Most companies are not able to upgrade all users and servers at once. There are  several things that you need to consider before you upgrade. This chapter explains  these things. Overall, the upgrade process from Notes 6 or Notes 7 client is relatively  easy. You can use the SmartUpgrade process to help upgrade these clients.  See  chapter 6 for more details on SmartUpgrade.     This chapter is divided into two main sections. In the first, we look at the Notes  Domino upgrade process in general, discussing concepts and steps that should be  considered whenever you upgrade to any major release of Notes Domino. In the  concluding section, we look at upgrade issues that are specific to Notes Domino 8.  The Domino Notes Upgrade Process The Domino Notes upgrade process consists of a number of phases, as follows:                       Vision and direction. High-level architecture analysis Use cases. Requirements. Agreements. Final target architecture. Creating the design and upgrade plans. Creating test plan. Testing. Creating upgrade process document and plans.   Upgrading to Notes Domino 8         Executing logistics plans and schedules.  Creating the pilots. Updating and final changes.  We discuss each of these phases below. Vision and direction: This phase is where you define your goals for the upgrade.  These goals can include your business needs, a basic idea of your current IT  architecture, and some rough time lines for the upgrade. A simple vision charter  might read something like this:  THE COMPANY will upgrade their ND5 6 7 architecture to Domino 8 in X  months, taking advantage of new Domino 8 features, and will also consolidate  several servers during the upgrade.  High-level architecture analysis: Before you upgrade, make sure you know what  you have. Experience tells us that most companies cannot identify 100% of their  environment. A good review is prudent so as to keep surprises to a minimum.  Take the time to obtain a list of applications, including email applications and  custom applications, backup systems, virus scanners, and web-based services and  appliances. Build an inventory of all things that "touch" Domino. This will help you  identify any items that may be affected impacted by the upgrade.  Use cases: A use case, in this context, is a statement and description of a system  service that defines the use and behavior of an environment. A basic use case should  include the following elements:              Upgrade steps Description of requirements Goals to help target requirements Identification of "actors"  the people using the system: users, administrators,  operators, and so on  Identification of associations between use cases and actors  These documents will help you build a set of requirements. In each use case, you  should also identify various states of the upgrade. Examples include upgrading the  servers, and enabling the new mail policy feature once all of the clients and server  have been upgraded.  [ 118 ]   Chapter 7  A use case can point to the need for:                             Client upgrade Server upgrade ODS upgrade  optional with Domino 8  Communications and transformation management Application upgrade Custom API upgrades Calendaring and Scheduling  including rooms and resources  Administration tool upgrade SMTP service upgrade Security impacts Directory impacts Process upgrade Help desk  A sample use case is included at the end of this chapter. Requirements: When all the use cases have been created and agreed on, you can  summarize them into a total list of requirements. These use cases and requirements  can be used to determine upgrade steps, use of new features, systemic impacts,  budgets, and time-lines. These requirements will be used to create the "draft"   target architecture. Agreements: This is where you will build out your budgets, build out decision  records, and obtain agreements from all interested parties in your organization. After  all of the agreements have been approved and signed, then your target architecture  can be finalized.  Final target architecture: At this point, the final target architecture can be created.  In most organizations, there will normally be a phased approach. It can take several  iterations to get to this final architecture. One example would be new Domino 8  programming functions. In order to take advantage of this feature, you will need to  have both servers and clients upgraded before the new functions are enabled. Create the design and upgrade plans: This step is where you start the process to  detail the upgrade process. Also, you begin documenting the process that will be  used as a step-by-step upgrade guide.  [ 119 ]   Upgrading to Notes Domino 8  Create test plan: Remember the identification of new features and requirements?  This is where you create a test plan to test each of the upgrade elements, which  includes the server, clients, applications, custom tools, and other items Testing: The flowchart below shows the testing and pilot process:  Testing  Create Uppgrade  Process Documents  and Plans  Execute Logistics Plans and Schedules  Create Pilots Plans and docs  Execute Technical  Pilots  Execute  Process Pilots  Each part of the upgrade should be tested before you actually put any new  technology into a production environment. Most companies execute what are  known as "unit" or component tests. These tests are the basic components of the new  technology. For example, you might choose to test the Notes 8 client on a sampling  of your current PCs. This particular test verifies that Notes 8 will run on your exiting  hardware, and does not impact any other applications and or PC environment. As  testing progresses, you will start to include each other element into the environment,  for example, Notes 8 on the network, Notes 8 on applications, Notes 8 client that will  access a Domino 6 or 7 server, and so on.   [ 120 ]   The goal is to test Notes Domino in a holistic test environment that replicates  various part of your production environment.   Chapter 7  One very important step is to contact each vendor for any third-party  tools and utilities. The upgrade process will make changes to the  directory, and then to each server. Be sure to contact every vendor and  determine whether or not Domino 8  or any new release of Notes  Domino  is support by that vendor. Double-check to verify that APIs have  been recompiled  as needed  by the vendor, and that the new directory  is supported. Then do your own testing, to make sure all is working as  advertised by the vendor.  Create upgrade process document and plans: Create all of the upgrade steps,  procedures, and schedules, training, and Frequently Ask Questions documents.  Some of these documents will be the actual upgrade steps and checklists. If you are  upgrading a large number of servers and users, then you can use a tracking database  and or spreadsheet. The results of the testing will be manifest in the upgrade  process. Also, communications plans should be created at this time.  Execute logistics plans and schedules: This is where you order any equipment,  hire any additional staff, and start the overall upgrade process. Included in the  scheduling process will be the execution of the pilots.  See the following step.  Create the pilots: Next, create and document each pilot that is needed. You will  need two pilot types: non-production pilots  technical pilots, process pilots , and  production pilots  shown in the diagram later in this chapter .  As we mentioned earlier, you should test as much as possible in a test environment  before executing a production roll-out. These non-production pilots are an  opportunity to test each step of a process. These should include:              Upgrade steps. Training and education. Communications. Help desk testing and FAQ. Executive help staff.  One important step of the pilots is "lessons learned". Each pilot is an opportunity to  modify upgrade steps and processes.   Non-production pilots are normally separated into two types, technical pilots and  process pilots. Technical pilots verify that each holistic step of the upgrade works  correctly. Process pilots verify that the actual checklists and documents are correct.   [ 121 ]   Upgrading to Notes Domino 8  Transformation management: When upgrade migration projects fail, it is always  people issues, not technical problems, which are the root cause. Transformation  management  TM  is a formal process to help identify and mitigate the people issues  associated with each project. Change is implied by any upgrade and or migration.  TM takes into considerations the various work environment issues that occur   during the upgrade migration project. One core fundamental part of any TM plan   is communication.  Here is a simple example that could form the basis of the communication part of a  TM plan:   Your company is taking on a migration upgrade to Domino 8. Your company may  experience a few changes to the architecture, some changes to end user clients, and  possibility a few changes to the administration teams. In some cases the end user and  administrators may require some training on Notes and Domino 8. Your company should  consider the following activities as part of the administration and migrations team's  transformation management activities:   1.    Develop a team name: for example, The Domino8 Upgrade Team.  Also create a    team logo.    number of weeks.  2.    Develop a team charter: for example, Migrate upgrade x number of users in n   3.    Announce the date of the final "migration done" party.  4.    Create an intranet web site with a list of FAQs, and the names and pictures of the   5.    Create a Red Yellow team to isolate the migration team from the end users    migration team members.    post-migration issues .    6.    Develop two sets of communications from the migration team to end users. This   should be added to the overall TM planning.  7.    Introduce users to the migration team. These users will be notified about the   migration team and their purpose. Also users should be instructed about whom  they should contact with questions about the upcoming migration. LPS ISSL  recommends that the help desk be trained about the migration and possible end  user questions.   8.    A pre-migration FAQ should be created and hosted on the Intranet.  9.    Print posters with the name of the team and the logo on the top of the poster, and   place them where they are likely to be seen  break rooms, elevators, and so on .  [ 122 ]   Chapter 7  10.  After users have been migrated, send out a weekly message to migrated users,   with "Tips of the week" and other relevant information.  11.  Three milestone meetings will be needed for your company's    migration upgrade:    The opening meeting: The CIO or CEO should open this meeting.  A quick five-minute pep talk is all that is needed from the VPs, but  it could be important for the team to let them know that there is  executive support. The lead project manger will launch the migration.  Announce the plans, hand out procedures, and review the whole  process.  The "half-way" meeting: This occurs when 50% of users migrated  have been migrated. This is a great cause of celebration, so give out  some special awards! The final party: At the "98% of users migrated" mark, close out the  migration. Move the remainder of the migration processes into the  permanent support staff.        12.  Close out the project.  13.  Transfer any left over migrated users into the current customer steady state   support staff.  A "go no go" decision is made before the production pilots are executed. This  decision will be based on the results of the testing and pilots. If all have been  successful, then the next step will be the production pilots.  [ 123 ]   Upgrading to Notes Domino 8  Go  NO-Go Decision  Production  Pilot 1  Production  Pilot 2  Update and Final Change  Roll out to Enterprise  End  [ 124 ]  Once all of the pilots had been completed, you will need to start the actual upgrade  process. Use a set of "friendly" users  never use executives!  for the first pilot. The  preceding diagram shows two production pilots. In reality, you will execute as many  as are needed. Each pilot will provide lessons learned to be used for the next pilot. Update and final changes: After all the pilots have been executed, and you have had  an opportunity to update the processes and make any final changes to the overall  upgrade process, you will be ready to roll out the upgrade to your enterprise.  Notes Domino 8 Upgrade So far we have discussed a generic Domino Notes upgrade process. In this section,  we discuss the specific upgrade issues for Notes Domino 8.   Reviewing the Current Infrastructure    the Health Check   Before you upgrade you will need to identify the components and systems that will  be impacted by this upgrade. This is an opportunity for you to execute a system wide  heatlh check – this normally includes a review of the following:   Chapter 7                       Servers: Identify any existing issues, such as crashes, problem servers, and  slow access. Your servers should be tested before you process the upgrade.  Be sure to set up similar servers in a test environment, and use server.load   to test the performance capabilities of your servers. Also, make sure that   your servers are not "sick"; you should not upgrade a server that is crashing  or having hardware issues. Fix issues and problems before you upgrade. Monitoring systems  Tivoli, DDM, BMC, and so on : There are many new  monitoring features with Domino 8. Be sure that your current monitoring  systems work with Domino 8, and that there are no conflicts with any   new features. Directory architecture  directory analysis, directory customization : This is  a big step. Analyze you directory, and determine whether or not there is any  customization. Determine whether or not any custom design features  views,  forms, and so on  need to be moved into a new directory. In some cases, you  may find these customizations are no longer needed in Domino 8.  Clients: Test you clients, and make sure that your current hardware and  software configuring will support Notes 8. PDA and or other wireless systems: with each new release, new features are  added. Be sure to verify that any new features don't conflict with your PDA  devices. For example, we have seen in the past where a ODS change broke  the connection between the local PDA and the data on the Notes Client.  AdminP status: This is a great opportunity to makes sure that admin4.nsf is  replicating to all servers, and that all AdminP ACL database assignments are  correct. Also, there are new features that allow you to set up several directory  AdminP servers using Extended Directory access control.  Application analysis: This includes any issues with applications being  upgraded, custom templates, and API analysis. Be sure to test your  applications with Domino 8. In general, upgrading to Domino 8 should not  result in any issues relating to existing applications, but it's always a good  idea to test with any upgrade. Make sure that your custom APIs still work as  needed with Domino 8. In some cases, you may need to recompile some of  these APIs, and in other cases, you may no longer need the APIs.   [ 125 ]   Upgrading to Notes Domino 8                    Custom templates: Check for customization of system templates. Compare  this customization with any new features in Domino 8, and determine  whether or not you need to move this customization into the templates and  applications. The use of the IVES Team Studio Delta tool will help you with  your analysis.  Messaging architecture  including NRPC services, SMTP services,  messaging tracking, enterprise-wide communications, mass mail, corporate  communication, and co-existence with other messaging systems and other  tools : NRPC rarely causes problems during or after upgrades, but it's never  a bad idea to test this anyway. Make sure that NRPC Notes Name Networks   a.k.a. NNN  or Domino Named Networks  DNN  work as before the  upgrade. Test each SMTP Services feature that is enabled. Test each Domino  message tracking feature that is enabled in your current environment. There  are a wide variety of mass-mailing tools and other customized features that  may be installed in your environment. Be sure to test each of these tools.  Large enterprise organizations can have several varieties of mail systems and  servers. Test any custom interfaces, software, and SMTP connectivity. Be sure  and check out the new "out of office" configuration features for ND8 – you  now have the option of using the router to launch the "out of office" messages  in place of the standard agent.  Other services and servers: There are a large number of Lotus IBM  products. All of these need to be tested. Examples include Quickplace,  Sametime, LEI, SMTP gateways, virus scanners, backup services, and  provisioning systems. Ensure that these products  and the versions you have  installed  are supported with Domino Notes 8:  Domino replication  activity logging, replication topology, replication  settings, connection documents, access control, replication schedules, cluster  replication, if enabled : Our experience with most upgrades is there is rarely  an issue with replication and upgrades, but be sure to test this.  Messaging topology  server topology, named networks, domains, inbound  and outbound message flow, routing requirements, routing priorities,  volume metrics, client strategy, server vs. local replication, alternate client  access [POP, IMAP, web, mobile users], hand-held device recommended  practices [Treo vs. Blackberry] : With ND7 a new task was added: the Room  and Resource manager task; be sure and test your Rooms and Resources  architecture as part of your upgrade.  Mail-enabled applications: Most Domino architectures will have several  mail-enabled applications. These can, and will, be affected by an upgrade to  a new release of Domino. Overall, Lotus Notes and Domino provides great  backward compatibility, but you still need to exercise due diligence regarding  any new Lotus Script elements, new "@Functions", and new design elements.  At the minimum, verify that the mail-in-DB records are functioning correctly.   [ 126 ]                                 Chapter 7  Architecture  high level review, connections to internal systems [networks,  unified messaging, SMTP Internet domains] . Network  platforms, DNS DHCP, remote access : Overall, we see very little  impact to this area with an upgrade. Again, take the time to test the new  release to make sure that the 'basics' work.  Calendar & scheduling  user calendaring [delegation, manager access],  enterprise scheduling [resources, shared group calendars] .  Directory  directory architecture [in particularly directory design],   directory management, directory synchronization, naming [Servers, users,   O and OUs] .  Security  ACL access, anonymous access, encryption and certificates,  certification practice statement, organization structure, ID management,  access controls [file server system, console and physical, server access pass- thru deny, client execution control, administration access] . Capacity: Determine if servers can handle current user loads  mail file  size, hardware sizing , load balancing sage, and capacity planning. Our  experience is that each new release of Domino provides better performance  in CPU and memory, and that each new release provides more features. With  each new feature or function you will find additional resources being used  – in particular, system memory. Be sure to monitor, via statistical baselines,  the impact of a new release on the current setup of hardware.  Configuration settings: These are a very important part of the server  upgrade. Review each server configuration to determine if you need to make   any changes.  Environmental variables: Check for abandoned Notes.ini variables and  obsolete notes.ini settings. Check the on-line support tools for this list. The  release notes may also have some information about the current set of   supported Notes.ini variables. Management and administration  change control, administration model,  client management, remote access recommendations, staffing levels, service  monitoring and reporting, systems management, backup and restore model .   ESX VmWare: There are a number of Domino enterprises that are looking  at ESX and WMware. At the time of writing, there are limited sets of data  regarding the successful use of ESX for Domino 'messaging'. If you are  considering using ESX for ND8 messaging, we suggest the following:     Review the current supportability statements  URL and release  notes  from IBM  on this topic.  [ 127 ]   Upgrading to Notes Domino 8        If possible, do not upgrade to both ND8 and ESX WMware at the  same time. This is the old rule of not making too mange changes  at once Be sure to set up a test lab to check how ESX will work with a  shared CPU and memory model. Also pay close attention to the  Disk I O queues. Server.load can help you with test loads scripts.   If you are using clustering, you should monitor the workqueue depth and seconds  on queue statistics.  The Upgrade Process After you have checked the infrastructure, it is time to start the upgrade. The  following steps show the basic upgrade path. This path can vary, based on your  research and the use cases that you have created: Systemic normalization: The first step of your upgrade is to "normalize" your  architecture.  We have already mentioned that it is important not to make any changes,  upgrades or migrations to an environment that is "sick". Take the time to review each  health check category and determine if your environment is stable. If it is stable, you can  then upgrade your architecture.  Upgrade the Domino Administrator clients: Upgrade all of your Domino  Administrator clients. Verify that all feature and functions run in the current  environment before you upgrade your first server. Upgrade the Domino directory: This step can be executed before you upgrade your  first server. Remember the use case above? Use that to drive the upgrade of the  directory, making any customizations and changes. Be sure to work with IBM Lotus  support to make sure that the directory is backward-compatible with your current  directory.  You should have done this in the testing phase of the upgrade.  Upgrade the administration server: This is a very important server. AdminP  requires that you assign an administration server to the Domino directory    names.nsf .  [ 128 ]   Chapter 7  The AdminP server task runs on all Domino servers. This task loads when  the Domino server is first started, and is controlled through the notes. ini variable ServerTasks. The AdminP server task wakes up on periodic  time intervals  specified in the Administration Process section of the  Server document  and executes commands waiting in the Administration  Request database. Each command placed in the Administration Request  database has an assigned proxy action. These proxy actions are essentially  the op-code that runs the administration process. Each command placed  in the administration request database is represented by a document.  Each document has a number of fields, including one called Proxy Action.  After each action has completed on a server, a response document is  created to indicate the status of that request.   There is a new option  since release 7  to use multiple servers to maintain the  Domino directory. If a Domino domain is geographically dispersed, then you can use  several servers to process administration requests:  Carefully evaluate your Administration server: Due to the new complexities  of Domino 8 and some new proxy actions, you may need to have a dedicated  administration server. AdminP can generate a large number of proxy actions as your  architecture grows. Upgrade utility servers: This step can be different with each customer. In some  cases, the hub server can be upgraded first, then the utility servers. Utility servers are  defined as SMTP, support, tools, and other servers. In some cases, vendors may not  be ready with their updates to support a new release of Domino. Upgrade hub servers: Upgrade each server, and then monitor the "normal"  operations between each upgrade. Verify that replication is still working, that agents  are still executing, and that mail is still routing. Upgrade spoke messaging servers: After the hub servers have been completed,  upgrade your spoke and messaging servers. Upgrade specialized servers: In some cases, these may be some of the first servers  you upgrade. One example would be specialized backup software. Once again, you  need to contact you vendor before you upgrade your first server or upgrade the  directory. The issue is backward compatibility. Verify with each vendor that the tools  and utilities will work with each release.   Upgrade the application servers: One important step is to test the applications  before you upgrade. There are several tools listed in the reference section of this book  that will help you.   [ 129 ]   Upgrading to Notes Domino 8  Upgrade Notes clients: You are now at the point where you can upgrade the Notes  clients. Smart-upgrade can be used if you have Notes Domino 6 7 installed. If not,  you can use a MSI MST type installs process to roll out the code.  Implement new Domino 8 features: When all servers and clients have been  upgraded, you can implement the new Domino 8 features. Each feature should be  tested, and in some cases you may need to build an architecture design for each  feature. One new feature that you should consider is the mail policy. This is a new  policy that can be enabled after you have upgraded both servers and clients.  Upgrade applications: When your architecture is pure Domino Notes 8, you can  start to implement new Domino 8 features in your applications. Use the testing  methodology listed above.   Special Feature Upgrade Considerations  Lotus Notes and Domino 8 include a number of important new features. These  features are discussed in Chapters 2 and 3 in this book. Be sure to consider these  features as part of your upgrade planning:  Productivity tools: Notes 8 includes a set of office productivity tools which support  the Open Document Format  ODF  standard. These include IBM Lotus Documents   create, edit, and share word processing documents , IBM Lotus Presentations  create  and deliver presentations , and IBM Lotus Spreadsheets  create spreadsheets and  analyze numerical data . LOB: Notes Domino 8 also makes it easier to integrate line-of business  LOB   solutions and data into new types of applications, called composite applications.  Composite applications, which are manifested in the front end of a Service Oriented  Architecture  SOA   See chapter 3.  Mail recall: This is a "planned" option of Domino 8. Work with your administrator to  determine if you can use this feature and what options are available.  Improved "out of office" capabilities: This includes an option to specify special  hours in addition to specific dates. Now notifications can be sent almost immediately  if a person has enabled the "out of office" agent.  Central management: Domino 8 offers the option to centrally managing initial  deployment and upgrades of Notes 8 client software and composite applications.  Using server-managed provisioning, you can even deploy different Notes 8 client  features to different users. This new capability will support the existing Notes  SmartUpgrade feature.  Refer to Chapter 6.    [ 130 ]   Chapter 7  DB2: Domino 7 introduced an option to use IBM DB2 as an alternative to the  traditional Lotus Notes storage facility  NSF  for storing Lotus Domino databases.  Domino 8 will now support DB2 as part of a standard install.   Use Case Document Example The following is an example of a use case document. You can use this example as a  guideline when creating your own use case documents, which is an important step  in the Domino 8 upgrade process.  Example Use case – Domino Server Upgrade.

We began with a generic  description of the Notes Domino upgrade process. We then concluded with tasks  and considerations specific to upgrading your environment to Notes Domino 8. We  also included an example use case that you can use as a template for your own use  cases, as well as links to sites that can provide you with additional Notes Domino 8  upgrade information.  [ 132 ]   Coexistence between Notes  Domino Releases  This chapter discusses coexistence between Notes Domino 8 and earlier versions.  When you install a new release, there are several things to consider relating to  coexistence with earlier releases of Notes Domino. For example, always test  coexistence scenarios before implementing changes in your production environment.  Follow the recommended upgrading routine described in chapter 7. Be sure to check  with http:  www.ibm.com developerworks lotus to find the most recent Tech  Notes and articles on coexistence.  The first section of this chapter covers Notes client coexistence issues. The second  deals with Domino server considerations.  Notes Client Coexistence Although running two different releases of the Notes client on one workstation  is an unsupported configuration, it can be done. The Notes 8 install program will  automatically upgrade any existing Notes client. But you can install Notes 8 on a PC,  while retaining the previous version of the Notes client.  In the following section, we assume that Notes 7 is installed in the default  Windows Client for e-business locations  C:\Notes for programs, and  C:\Notes\Data for the data directory . If you run Notes 7 from another  directory  such as C:\Program Files\Lotus\Notes, the default  Notes 7 product install location , substitute this directory name in place of  references to C:\Notes in the description below.   Coexistence between Notes Domino Releases  If you want to save your existing Notes 7  or 6  client binaries, but still want to share  the data directory  which is the easiest to use and switch between , you should do  the following.   Copy the existing Notes directory and subdirectories to a Notes 7 directory. You  only need to copy the Notes directory and the JVM, license, MUI, and xmlschemas  sub-directories, not the data subdirectories, but it is easier to copy all directories and  subdirectories if you have the space.  1.  Create a new desktop shortcut to run the Notes 7 version. To do this: 2.  Create a copy of your existing Notes desktop shortcut icon, then right-click   on it and choose Properties.  3.  Change the Shortcut  tab Target value to:     \notes7\notes.exe = \notes\notes.ini   This indicates Notes 7 executables using the Notes 8 Notes.ini file   and data.    4.  Change the Start in value to be:     \notes7   5.  Change the Title  General tab  to Notes 7. 6.  Click OK to close the properties dialog. 7.   Install the Notes 8 client.  The Notes 8 install will upgrade the original Notes directory and subdirectories to  Notes 8  leaving your Notes 7 copy alone .   If you want to save your existing Notes 7 client binaries and data, keeping two  separate data directories and Notes.ini files, then perform the following:  Copy the existing Notes directory and subdirectories to a Notes7 directory. Edit your  notes7\notes.ini file, replacing any references to \notes\ with \notes7\.  1.  Create a new desktop shortcut to run the Notes 7 version.  2.  Create a copy of your existing Notes desktop shortcut icon, then right-click   on it and choose Properties.   3.  Change the Shortcut tab Target value to:    \notes7\notes.exe = \notes7\notes.ini   This indicates Notes 7 executables using the Notes 7 Notes.ini and data.    4.  Change the Start in value to be:  \notes7. 5.  Change the Title  General tab  to Notes 7. 6.  Click OK to close the properties dialog.  [ 134 ]   Chapter 8  Install the Notes 8 client. The Notes 8 install will upgrade the original Notes  directory to Notes 8, but you will still have a separate copy of your Notes 7 binaries  and data.  Usually, you would upgrade Notes clients, after upgrading your Domino servers.  This way, Notes users can take advantage of the new features that exist on the server,  such as mail message recall  which also requires that the mail template be a   Notes 8 design .  There are actually two new Notes clients: the Notes 8 Eclipse based interface and the  Notes 8 basic client. The basic client cannot utilize the Eclipse based technology, such  as productivity tools, vertical preview pane, composite applications, the Sidebar,   and mail improvements related to recent contacts  such as drop-down addressing .  This basic client should be used on low memory workstations that do not meet the  higher requirements of the Notes 8 Eclipse client. The following table compares the  client requirements.  Memory  Notes 7  128 MB minimum  256 MB or more  recommended   Windows 2000 and  Windows XP   Disk space  275 MB required  Processor   Pentium or better  Notes 8 Eclipse Windows XP 512 MB minimum 1 GB or more recommended Windows Vista 1GB minimum 1.5 GB or more recommended Linux 512 MB minimum 1 GB or more recommended Windows 900 MB required, more  recommended Linux 1.5 GB required, more  recommended Pentium or better  For more information on the features that are not available in the Notes 8  basic client, consult the Notes 8 release notes.  The requirements for Notes Eclipse are stricter due to the number of enhancements  to the client code.  [ 135 ]   Coexistence between Notes Domino Releases  Calendaring and Scheduling Many of the new features in Notes 8 require the server, the client, and mail file  design to all be at the release 8 code-streams to function properly. As a result, most  of this new functionality will be unavailable to users until all three are upgraded.  Calendar Delegation Calendar delegation occurs when an owner of a calendar gives another user access to  their calendar for the purpose of managing it  for example, a manager giving access  to an assistant . These users require special planning when upgrading to Notes 8.  The best practice is to upgrade the clients of the delegate and owner at the same time.  We also recommend upgrading the templates at the same time. This will limit issues  that can occur if the clients do not have the same release.  Domino Server Coexistence  This section discusses co-existence between Domino 8 and previous versions of  Notes Domino. This will occur as soon as you upgrade your first server. This state is  called a mixed environment due to the existence of Domino 8 server code as well as  pre-Domino 8 code.     Domino Directory One of the first things to do is to upgrade the design of the Domino directory to  Notes Domino 8. This can be done in advance of the server code upgrade or at  the same time as you upgrade your administration server. The Domino 8 directory  design is supported on Domino 6.5.x and 7.x servers. There are Domino 8 features  that may not function on pre-Domino 8 servers. These features are mostly found in  the server and configuration documents.  If you have applications that rely on custom views in your Domino directory, we  recommend that you test your applications with the new Domino directory design.  If possible, before upgrading from a previous release, clean up any unneeded  views and agents in the existing Domino directory. After the design of the Domino  directory has been upgraded, the next phase is to upgrade the server code.  ODS In Domino 8 the default ODS is the same as in Notes Domino 6 and 7. There is a  new optional ODS in Domino 8, ODS48. This new ODS is optional, and should be  applied if you ned to utilize these new features.  [ 136 ]   Chapter 8  Administration Requests and Events  Databases After you upgrade your server the administration requests database  admin4.nsf   and events database  events4.nsf  will automatically be upgraded. There should be  no issues due to having the design of these upgraded databases replicate to the   other servers.   Rooms and Resource Reservation Database The rooms and resource reservations database has not changed from Notes Domino  7. If you are upgrading from Domino 7, then you will not need to make any changes.  If you are upgrading from the Domino 6.x code stream, some changes will be  necessary. Resource reservation databases with a design of 6.x or earlier are not  supported on the Domino 8 server. In releases prior to Notes Domino 7, the router  was the task that processed reservations in the resource reservation database.  Starting in Notes Domino 7, there is a new task that performs this duty, the Rooms  and Resource Manager task  RNRmgr . This new task was added to prevent some of  the issues that were seen when the router task was used, such as double booking. For  instructions on upgrading from the Domino 6.x code stream, see the Notes and Domino  7 Upgrade Best Practices Red Paper.  Domino Domain Monitoring Domino Domain Monitoring  DDM  was first introduced in Domino 7. Most DDM  probes do not function on a pre-Domino 7 server. There are also some new probes  that are specific to new features and functions in Domino 8. The probes that are  specific to the Domino 8 features will not work on pre-Domino 8 servers. For more  red paper Lotus Domino Domain Monitoring. For the new  information on DDM, see red paper features in DDM in Domino 8, refer to the Domino 8 administrator help.  Policies There are several new policies that have been introduced in Domino 8. New policies  that were introduced in Domino 7 or 8 will not be recognized by Notes 6.5.x or  earlier clients. Newer policies will not adversely affect the earlier client; they will not  be recognized or enforced until the client is upgraded to Notes 8.  [ 137 ]   Coexistence between Notes Domino Releases  Message Recall While in a mixed environment, if message recall functionality is enabled, users will  not be able to recall a message to a user on a pre-Domino 8 server. Message recall is  enabled by default.   Cluster Coexistence  A new feature in Domino 8 is streaming replication. You can read more about this  new feature in chapter 5 of this book. In a mixed cluster, this feature will not work.  Both servers attempting to replicate in the cluster need to be at the Domino 8 code  stream in order for streaming replication to occur. In a mixed cluster, the Domino  8 server will attempt to initiate streaming replication. When it cannot do so, it will  fail and revert back to regular replication. Cluster replication will function as it did  before the upgrade and mixed cluster state. Once two or more of the servers in the  cluster have been upgraded to Domino 8, streaming replication will automatically  occur between them.  In Domino 8, there have been some minor changes to the cluster database directory  or CLDBDIR.nsf. These changes are all backward compatible with pre-Domino 8  servers. You can have mixed releases in a cluster. However, we suggest you upgrade  the cluster mates in quick succession.  There have been changes to the "Out of Office" functionality. Now there is the option  of having the "Out of Office" feature as a service rather than as an agent. If one of the  servers in the cluster is running pre-Domino 8 code, the "Out of Office" feature must  be run as an agent.  Domino Web Access Domino web access requires two things to work properly. The first is the mail file  template. In Notes Domino 8, the mail template is built into Domino web access.  There is no longer a separate mail file template for all Domino web access. The  second things that is needed is the Forms database. This database is release-based  – new features are added to it with each release. In Notes Domino 8, the Forms  database is called forms8.nsf. So if you upgrade the template to Domino 8, make  sure that there is such a file on the server. To be backward compatible, a Domino 8  server will include a forms6.nsf file and a forms7.nsf file. This allows you to keep  mail files in an earlier template version and still have Domino web access on the  Domino 8 server.  [ 138 ]   Chapter 8  When upgrading from R5, Domino 8 will not remove the forms5.nsf  file. This will allow Domino web access on release 5 to work. If you   need Domino web access on release 5 to work on a new installation of  Domino 8, you should either place an operating system level copy of the  forms5.nsf file on the server or replicate a copy.    ID Files In each past release, there have been changes to the encryption key length so as to  provide enhanced security. Older keys can be used on new clients, but they are not  forward compatible. This means that newer keys cannot be used on older clients. It  is advisable to upgrade your ID files after you have completed your entire upgrade  to Notes Domino 8. This will provide you with the enhanced security offered by the  longer key length.    Summary In this chapter, we examined a few coexistence issues involved with running Notes  Domino 8 in a mixed environment with one or more previous releases. We began  with a look at Notes client coexistence. We explained how to install two different  versions of Notes on a workstation, and discussed potential issues with calendaring  and scheduling in a multi-release environment. We concluded with a discussion of  Domino 8 server coexistence, including features such as the Domino directory, ODS,  Domino web access, DDM, and ID files.   [ 139 ]    What's New in Notes   Domino 8 Development  For the past 20 years Lotus Notes and Domino have been the premier collaborative  application platform of choice. Small businesses and Fortune 50 companies alike  are using the Notes Domino application platform for email, calendaring and  scheduling, instant messaging and applications.   There are hundreds of IBM business partners supporting the community of  approximately 130 million users with their daily blogs, web sites, podcasts, and  support forums. Any visit to LotusSphere, the IBM's premier end-user conference  for the Lotus brand, will leave your head spinning with a myriad of possibilities to  integrate Notes Domino with other technologies in your business.  So, what exactly is the strategy for the future of Notes Domino development? Given  that IBM has a history of protecting their user's investments in the platform, the  strategy is obviously one of extension of the platform while continuing to support  legacy applications.   All of the applications written for the platform have one thing in common, the end  user. The end user operates in a specific context. For Notes Domino users, this  context is one of Notes for collaboration  email, calendaring, and instant messaging ,  an operating system with its file system for other work such as storage and retrieval  of documents, and other applications and office technologies.  The IBM strategy for Notes Domino is to allow the user, in his or her context, to  collaborate more effectively in more and new flexible ways while maintaining the  ability to support legacy and new open composite applications.   What's New in Notes Domino 8 Development  One way this is being done is by allowing developers new and better ways of  taking complicated and related applications, and placing them together to create  new conceptual whole applications, or composite applications  applications that  are composed of two or more applications . In order to allow this within the Notes  Domino application platform, IBM has added new development tools and features,  allowing Notes Domino the ability to take part in the new world of Service Oriented  Architectures  SOA, see Chapter 3  while continuing to support the rich legacy of  applications already built.  Composite Applications Composite applications are applications that consist of two or more components  that may have been independently developed, working together to perform tasks  that none of the member applications could perform by itself. Each component  publishes and consumes messages from other components, and performs actions  based upon user interaction or information received from other components.  Support for composite applications is one of the central points for Notes Domino  8. Composite applications in Notes 8 can wire together multiple components from  Notes applications, Lotus Component Designer applications, and Eclipse into a  single application context for the end user.  Composite applications, whether they are based on Notes Domino 8, WebSphere  Portal, or Lotus Expeditor, are the "front end" or user interface to an enterprise's  SOA strategy. They, in effect, consume the services that are offered by the composite  architectures put in place to support SOA.   An example of a composite application would be a simple customer relationship  management application. This application needs to display a list of accounts,  opportunities, and contacts to end users.  The accounts component should display accounts owned by the end user. When  the end user selects an account in the account component, the opportunities for that  account should be displayed in the opportunities component, and all of the contacts  for the first opportunity should be displayed in the contacts component.  In the application described above, the components are "communicating" with each  other by publishing and consuming properties via a property broker. When the user  clicks on an account, the account component publishes the accountkey property to  the property broker. The opportunities component has been written to "listen" for  the accountkey property to be published, and when it is, it performs a lookup into  a data store pulling back all the specific opportunities for the published account  key. Once it has displayed all of the opportunities for the account, it selects the first  opportunity for display and then publishes the opportunitykey property to the   [ 142 ]   Chapter 9  property broker. The contacts component then performs a lookup to display all of  the contacts for the opportunity.  When the user selects a different opportunity, the opportunity component again  publishes an opportunitykey property and the contacts component receives   this new opportunitykey property and displays the correct contacts for the   selected opportunity.  Using component applications, developers can respond quickly to requests from the  line of business for functionality changes. For example, in the case of the customer  relationship management application described above, the line of business may  decide to purchase a telephony component to dial the phone and log all phone calls  made. The developers of the application would need to simply modify the contact  component to publish the phone number of a contact with a name that the new  telephony component listens for and the call could be made on behalf of the user.  In addition to being used within the customer relationship management application,  the components developed could be put together with other components to form  entirely different applications. Each component already understands what data it  needs to publish and consume to perform its actions, and contains the code to perform  those specific actions on back-end systems. The reuse of the components will save the  developers and the organization time each time whenever they are reused.  Composite applications also require a new programming model for Notes   Domino 8. This model mirrors the model within WebSphere Portal 6 in that multiple  components are aggregated into a single UI with the property broker acting as the  "glue" that allows the various components to interact and share data even if the  components are from different systems. This programming model is something new  in Notes 8 and required some changes to Domino Designer 8.  As a side note, the new programming model of composite applications will most  probably bring its own set of problems. For example, what happens in a composite  application when one of the components fails? In this "composite crash" situation,  what does the composite application need to do in order to recover?   Additionally from an infrastructure point of view, composite applications will only  be as available as their weakest component. What good would a reservations system  implemented with many components be if one of the components were not hosted  by a highly available infrastructure, while the others were? We see these sorts of  issues being dealt with currently by customers venturing into the composite world  via SOAs.  There are two main categories of change for development related to composite  applications in Notes Domino 8 application design and programming. We will look  at both of them in the following sections.  [ 143 ]   What's New in Notes Domino 8 Development  Application Design In order to allow your Notes or Domino application to participate within a composite  application, you must first decide which design elements need to be accessible to  other components. To make these components available to other components within  your composite application, they are specified within a Web Services Description  Language  WSDL  file. The composite application property broker then uses this  WSDL file as a map into your application and its published properties and actions.  To allow this mapping to occur, the Composite Application Editor is used. Without  making changes to legacy Notes Domino application functionality, the Composite  Application Editor can be used to surface the elements of the application such as  forms, views, documents, and other Notes elements to the composite application.  Another element of composite application design is deciding where the application  components will reside. Composite applications can be hosted within a local NSF  file on a Notes client, on a Domino 8 application server, in WebSphere Portal, or in  Lotus Expeditor. The Notes Domino application components are created with the  Composite Application Editor while WebSphere Portal composite applications   can be created with the Composite Application Editor or the Portal Application  Template Editor.  Programming As mentioned previously, the addition of composite applications to the development  strategy for Notes Domino 8 required some changes and additions to the existing  programming model.  Within a composite application, the components must be able to interact even if they  were defined with different tools and technologies. Some components may even be  stored within different database technologies. One component may be NSF based  while another may be stored within a relational database store. The components  need a standardized way to define the properties and actions that they support, so  that an application developer can wire them together into a composite application.  The standard way to define these properties and actions is via a WSDL file.  Let's take a quick look at properties, actions and wires.  [ 144 ]   Chapter 9  Properties Component properties are the data items that a given component produces. They are  either input properties  consumed by the component  or output  produced by the  component  properties. Each property is assigned a data type, which is based on the  WC3 primitive data types. These include string, Boolean, decimal, time, and date.  The primitive data types can also be utilized to build new data types. For example,  within Notes 8, some new data types for components will be available that map to  common data available within the mail, calendar, and contacts applications. Some of  these new data types are listed in the following table:  Data Type Name  Example  mailTo  Description  Extends  Data  Type String List of people  to receive an  email  emailAddress822  String Email   address  following   RFC 822  distinguishedName  String LDAP name  "mailto:suzie@company. com?subject=Our Dogs are  Smart&cc=frankie@company. com,domino@company. com&bcc=gromit@company.com "My Gerbil <shelbie@company. com>"  "Little Man <nate@company. com>" "cn=bubbles,ou=turtles,dc=co mpany,dc=com"  Actions Actions are the logic that is used to consume a property. For example, a component  may implement an action that sends an email when it receives a mailTo type  property from another component. The code within the component that sends the  email based on the information consumed from the property is the action for the  component. Components can obviously contain multiple actions depending on the  business logic required for the component.  It is easy to confuse a web services action with a Notes action. The web services  action is a name in a WSDL file that represents functionality that will consume a  property. Notes actions can be coupled with a web services action so that the Notes  action gets called to consume a property. The LotusScript in the Notes action can  then implement code to act on the property.  [ 145 ]   What's New in Notes Domino 8 Development  The illustration below shows a Notes action in the Notes 8 mail template that is  coupled with a web services action NewMemoUsingMailtoURL. You can see that in the  code, the LotusScript is using a property broker to gain access to the property.  Wires Wires are the construct by which components interact within a composite  application. A wire is simply a programmatic definition of which components talk to  each other. The components must share common properties and then produce and  consume them via actions. More simply put, wires connect properties to actions.  For example, an application developer could wire together a contact list component  with an email component. When the user selects a contact from the contact list, the  contact list component would produce and publish a mailTo type property, which  could then be consumed by the email component. The email component would  consume the published mailTo property and compose an email using the data  contained within the property.  [ 146 ]   The following shows the components available within the Notes 8 mail template  that are available for use in other component applications as well, shown from the  component palette within the new Composite Application Editor.  Chapter 9  [ 147 ]   What's New in Notes Domino 8 Development  New Features in Domino Designer 8 With the addition of composite applications to the development strategy of Notes  Domino 8, there are a number of changes required to Domino Designer 8 to allow  for composite applications design, development, and use. Some additional new tools  were also required.  These changes augment existing functionality. They were made without sacrificing  supportability of existing applications. They allow legacy applications as well as new  applications to play a part in an SOA by providing a platform that permits multiple  technologies to be combined into a single application, side by side.  Composite Applications Support New Domino Designer 8 features that support composite applications include the  Property Broker Editor and the Composite Application Editor.  Property Broker Editor One of the first things you will notice in Domino Designer 8 is the new support for  composite application design elements. These design elements store the WSDL and  XML files for wiring properties and applications. You can see these new design  elements by selecting the Composite Applications item in the view.  The Wiring Properties view is where Domino Designer stores the WSDL that defines  the properties, types and actions for the application. These design elements are  edited with the Property Broker Editor, which is new in Domino Designer 8. To edit  wiring properties, select the wiring property from the new Notes 8 mail template  and click the Open File button. This will bring up the Property Broker Editor. The  Property Broker Editor allows you to create or edit the properties, types or actions   [ 148 ]   for your applications. Once the Property Broker Editor has saved the WSDL as a  design element, you will be able to associate the defined properties and actions with  other design elements.  Chapter 9  Composite Application Editor Also within the Composite Applications view within Domino Designer 8, is the  Applications listing. These design elements store the XML that define the makeup of  the composite applications and their associated wiring.  [ 149 ]   What's New in Notes Domino 8 Development  Launching the Composite Application Editor is not done via the Domino Designer  interface however, and may confuse new composite application developers.   To launch the Composite Application Editor, open Notes and then select   Action  Edit Application.  Once the Composite Application Editor is open, you can select a component and  then edit the wires for this component.  [ 150 ]   Chapter 9  The illustration above shows the wiring properties for the Notes Calendar   Navigator component.  Web Services Consumer Web services were supported starting with Notes Domino 7. However, the web  services supported with Domino 7 could only be web service providers. They could  be called as a normal web service from a remote computer and return information  from Domino databases, or perform other Domino-related functions. It was also  possible in release 7 to write web service consumers and have them hosted by  Domino, but there was no specific support for web service consumers within  Domino and creating them was a matter of Java development.  With the release of Notes and Domino 8, Domino-based web service consumers are  supported. Notes Domino applications can now call web services hosted on remote  computers. Notes Domino 8 makes it simple to call web services. Domino Designer  will even import the WSDL and create the code required to use the web service   for you.  Unlike web service providers in Domino, which are stored in special design  elements, web service consumers in Domino 8 are stored in a special type of script  library. This script library can be written in either Java or LotusScript. Just as with  other script libraries, code that wants to use the web service consumer must use the  script library that contains it.  Consuming a web service in Notes Domino 8 is very simple. The high level steps are:  1.  Locate a web service that you would like to consume and acquire its    2.  Create a new script library to contain the web service consumer. 3.  4.  Have your application call the script library so as to consume the    Import the WSDL file into the new script library.  WSDL file.  web service.  For this example, we have selected a free stock quote web service that retrieves 20  minute delayed quotes from Yahoo. The web service description and its WSDL file  are located here:  http:  www.webservicelist.com webservices f.asp?fid=37722  [ 151 ]   What's New in Notes Domino 8 Development  We will create a script library to contain the web service, create a form with a simple  button to prompt the user for a company symbol, and then call or consume the web  service and display the resultant stock quote.  [ 152 ]   Chapter 9  Once you have selected a web service to consume and have its WSDL file, you  need to create a new script library to contain the web service code. Create a new  application, and select Create  Design  Script Library. Select either LotusScript  Library or Java Library depending on your language of choice. For this example, we  will create a LotusScript library. Save the script library and provide a name for it  when prompted. For this example, we called the script library stockquote. Keep this  script library open.  You now have a new, empty script library. At the bottom of the code window in  Domino Designer, you will see a button labeled WSDL. This button will allow you  to import the WSDL file that describes the web service that you are going to consume  and also generate the code for consuming this web service. This will save you a lot of  time going through the WSDL file and crafting your classes!   Import the WSDL file that you downloaded for your selected service. Notice that  Domino Designer generates the class required to consume the web service.  For the free stock quote service selected, the generated LotusScript code look   like this:  Option Declare %INCLUDE "lsxsd.lss" Const n0 = "http:  www.themindelectric.com wsdl net.xmethods.services. stockquote.StockQuote " Class NetxmethodsservicesstockquoteStockQu_n0 As PortTypeBase  [ 153 ]   What's New in Notes Domino 8 Development  Sub NEW    Call Service.Initialize        "HttpWwwThemindelectricComWsdlNetXmethodsServicesStockquoteStockQuo  teNetXmethodsServicesStockquoteStockQuoteService",_ "net.xmethods.services.stockquote.StockQuoteService.net.xmethods. services.stockquote.StockQuotePort", "http:  services.xmethods.net  soap", _ "NetxmethodsservicesstockquoteStockQu_n0" End Sub           End Class  Function getQuote symbol As String  As Single   End Function  Let getQuote = Service.Invoke "getQuote", symbol   Notice that Domino Designer did the hard work of decoding the WSDL file to create  a class with functions to consume the web service. If you like, you may even decide  to modify the generated code so as to make it a bit more readable –  by changing the  class name, for example.   It is a good idea at this time to inspect the code that was generated and become  familiar with it. In this example, we can see the generated LotusScript created a  class called etxmethodsservicesstockquoteStockQu_n0 and a function called  getQuote. Domino Designer got these values from the WSDL file that was imported.  We will use the class name and the function name later within our button that will  call the script library that consumes the web service.  Now, all we need is some code to consume the web service via the special web  services enabled script library that we just created. To keep things simple, let's create  a button on a form that will prompt the user for a stock symbol and then display   the results.  Create a blank form. Within the Globals section of the form, place the following  code, which disallows implicit variable declarations  a good practice  and identifies  the script library stockquote as used within the form:  Option Public Use "stockquote"  [ 154 ]   On the same form, create a new button. Give the button a clever label like Get a  stock quote, and then insert the following code into the button:  Chapter 9  Dim symbolname As String Dim symbolvalue As Single Dim quote As New NetxmethodsservicesstockquoteStockQu_n0   ' ask the user for a stock quote symbol symbolname = Inputbox "Enter stock symbol for quote:"    ' call getQuote to consume the web service and return the value symbolvalue = quote.getQuote  symbolname     ' Let the user know the current value Messagebox "Value of " & symbolname & " is = " & Cstr  symbolvalue    [ 155 ]   What's New in Notes Domino 8 Development  Save the form, and then open the application. Create a new instance of the form that  contains the button.  Now click on the button to invoke the code within it. You will be prompted to enter  the stock symbol whose quote you would like to retrieve via the web service. For this  example, we selected my favorite hamburger chain.  When you click on OK, Notes will execute the code so as to invoke and consume the  web service. Once that has been done, Notes will then process the Messagebox call so  as to present the results.  [ 156 ]   Chapter 9  This is obviously a very simple example of consuming a web service, but it should  open your mind to the possibilities. There are web services available for almost  anything you can imagine. Some are free and others are for a fee. You can use web  services to retrieve grocery items by UPC number, perform credit card transaction  processing, and even track packages shipped with FedEx or UPS.  Now that Notes Domino 8 can consume web services, you have another data  integration tool at your disposal.  Domino IBM DB 2 Integration The ability to use DB 2 as an alternate back-end storage system for Domino was  available in Domino 7 as a Feature Trial and also via a Limited Availability program.  With the release of Notes Domino 8, the integration with DB 2 will be generally  available on certain Windows, IBM AIX, and Linux operating systems.  Using this integration, you can make data within your Domino databases available  for use by relational database tools and show external relational data within Notes  Domino views and embedded views.  View Enhancements Domino Designer 8 view enhancements include new column number formats,  extended to use available window width, defer index creation until first use, and  show default items in right-mouse menu.  New Column Number Format There is a new number format for number columns that will display the column  contents in kilobytes, megabytes, or gigabytes, which makes it much easier to  determine the relative size of the number represented in the column. In this example,  the size of file attachments is used.  [ 157 ]   What's New in Notes Domino 8 Development  When displayed in Notes 7, the column shows just the attachments lengths for   each document.  However, when the same column is displayed in Notes 8 with the Bytes  K M G   number format, the column displays a much friendlier format.  [ 158 ]   Extend to Use Available Window Width In Notes 8, you can select which column within a view will expand to utilize the  available width of the window. In previous releases, this option was only available  for the last column in a view.   Chapter 9  For this option to work, the view level option Extend last column to  window width takes precedence and must be deselected. In addition, the  column to be extended must be marked as Resizable. Multiple columns  can be designated to extend to use the available window width. However,  only the first column, which has this attribute set, will expand.  [ 159 ]   What's New in Notes Domino 8 Development Defer Index Creation until First Use Index creation can now be deferred for Click on column header to sort view  columns. Using this option, the view index won't be created until a user first clicks  on the column to sort it. Only views that users click to sort will have their indexes  built. This can help reduce the load on servers, as not all column indexes will be  created automatically. They will only be created when they are used.  Note that the deferred index creation feature requires the database to be using the  new ODS  On-Disk Structure  for Notes Domino 8. By default, Notes Domino 8 still  creates databases with ODS 43, which was introduced in release 6 and used through  releases 7 and 8. To enable the creation of databases in ODS 48 format, use the Create_ R8_Databases=1 Notes.ini parameter on the Domino 8 server or the Notes 8 client.  Show Default Items in Right-Mouse Menu Developers have been able to add custom actions to the right-mouse menu with  previous versions of Notes Domino. With release 8, you can choose not to have the  default right-mouse menu items shown in the menu, allowing just the menu items  you select to be displayed.  [ 160 ]   Chapter 9  The default is to show just default items. The picture above shows that we have  deselected the option allowing only the actions that we select to be shown in the  menu. This will make it easier for the end user of the application to find the actions  we have defined for the view or folder.  Form Enhancements There is a new rich text lite field option that allows you to add a thumbnail picture to  a form. This new feature is used in the Notes Domino 8 address book templates.   For example, in the personal address book template, you can add pictures of your  contacts to their contact records. This is handy to help remember the face that goes  with the name.  To add the thumbnail picture to a contact note in Notes 8, edit the contact record,  click on the import icon, and select the picture.  [ 161 ]   What's New in Notes Domino 8 Development  Once the picture has been selected, it will be displayed in place of the import button.  To delete the picture, you should edit the document, select the thumbnail, and press  the delete key.  To enable thumbnails in your rich text lite field, select the second tab of the  properties box, and then select Thumbnail in the Only allow selection field. When  Thumbnail is selected, all of the other options will automatically be deselected for  you. Also, you may only select Thumbnail in the First Display property.  [ 162 ]   Chapter 9  You can also have Notes resize the thumbnail image by selecting the width and  height in pixels.  [ 163 ]   What's New in Notes Domino 8 Development  Agent Enhancements Agents can now be tagged so as to determine when the server starts. These agents  will start the server a few minutes after the Domino server boots up. They should not  be relied upon to start immediately.   Agents triggered to start when the server starts will not run when just the agent  manager itself is restarted. They will only run when the entire Domino server is  started. This allows agents to perform actions that should only occur after a server  has started and not be repeated each time agent manager starts up. To trigger an agent this way, select When Server Starts for the On event trigger type.  Agents that are triggered when the server starts can also be given dates to start and   stop running. This could be helpful if the agent is implementing a date driven  business process.  [ 164 ]   To edit these agents' schedule properties, click the Edit Settings button on the Agent  properties box.  Chapter 9  Formula Language and LotusScript Additions Domino Designer 8 includes several enhancements to formula language and  LotusScript.  Formula Language Additions The following are some selected new commands that are available within   Notes Domino 8.  @Command [CopySelectedAsTable] : This new command performs the same action  as its menu command counterpart, Edit  Copy As  Table, which copies one or  more selected view entries into a table. It places the table of the selected view entries  on the clipboard. It also includes a link to each of the documents in the table. This is  very useful when sending co-workers links to documents from a database in a pre- formatted table.  @Command [OpenInNewWindow] : This new command allows your formula language  code to open a document from a view, folder, or calendar in a new window instead  of opening it within a new tab within Lotus Notes.  [ 165 ]   What's New in Notes Domino 8 Development LotusScript Additions The following are some selected new classes, methods, and events available   within Notes Domino 8. The NotesProperty and NotesProperyBroker classes,  and the Onselect event were added to support the new composite application- programming model.  MarkAllRead and MarkAllUnread methods: Finally, within the NotesView,  NotesViewEntryCollection, and NotesViewNavigator classes, two new methods  dealing with read unread marks are available. Using these classes, you can mark  documents as having been read or unread using the MarkAllRead or MarkAllUnread  methods. These methods will affect the documents within the collection or navigator.  There are, of course, Java counterparts available.   NotesDirectory class: Objects created with this new class correspond to  the directories on a specific Domino server or Notes client. The objects are  contained within a NotesSession object, and they contains one or more  NotesDirectoryNavigator objects. The following properties are available in the  NotesDirectory class. Unless otherwise specified, these properties are read-only.  Property AvailableItems  Type Variant array  AvailableNames  Variant  array  AvailableView  String  GroupAuthorizationOnly  Boolean  Description This property is set by the methods  LookupNames and LookupAllNames. If a  NotesDirectory object has been created  but no lookups have been performed with  it, this property will be null. This property will contain the names  returned from the most recent  LookupAllNames or LookupNames call. If  a NotesDirectory object has been created  but no lookups have been performed with it,  this property will be null. This property contains the name of  the view specified in the most recent  LookupAllNames or LookupNames call. If  a NotesDirectory object has been created  but no lookups have been performed with  it, this property will be null. Read write property. This property  controls which directories will be used  during lookups. If the property is True,  only directories marked "Enable for Group  Authorization" will be searched. If set to  False, the default, lookups performed  will search all directories available.  [ 166 ]   Property LimitMatches  Type Boolean  PartialMatches  Boolean  SearchAllDirectories  Boolean  Server  String  TrustedOnly  Boolean  UseContextServer  Boolean  Chapter 9  Description Read write property. If True, directory  lookups will be limited to fifty entries. If  False then lookups performed will return   all matches. Controls whether or not lookups will  match on partial names. If True, partial  names will match. If False, the default,  lookups will not match on partial names. Read write property. If True, the default,  all directories will be searched during  lookups. If False, lookups will cease after  the first directory containing the view   name specified. This property contains the name of the  server represented by the instance of  NotesDirectory. Read write property. This property  controls which directories will be used  during lookups. If True, lookups will  search only directories which contain trust  information. If False, the default, the  lookups will search all directories. Read write property. This property  controls whether the server of the context  database or the server specified in the  lookup methods will be used. If True, the  server context database will be used. If  False, the default, and then the server  specified in the lookup method will be used.  The following methods are available for the NotesDirectory class.  Method CreateNavigator  Returns NotesDirectoryNavigator Use to create additional   Description  FreeLookupBuffer  N A  DirectoryNavigators  to allow multiple  DirectoryNavigators to   be used. Since the resultant name lookup  buffers can be quite large, this  method can be used to free  memory in the current lookup  buffer, in effect resetting all  navigators. Used for memory  management.  [ 167 ]   What's New in Notes Domino 8 Development  Method LookupAllNames  Returns NotesDirectoryNavigator  LookupNames  NotesDirectoryNavigator  Description Performs a lookup of  designated items contained  within the specified view. Performs a lookup of  designated items contained  within the specified view for  the specified items.  NotesDirectoryNavigator class: NotesDirectoryNavigator objects are  returned by methods  of the NotesDirectory class and allow the developer to  navigate the items returned by a directory search. The following properties are  available for the NotesDirectoryNavigator class. Unless otherwise specified,   these properties are read-only.  Property CurrentItem  Type String  CurrentMatch  Long  CurrentName  String  CurrentView  String  MatchLocated  Boolean  NameLocated  Boolean  Description This property will contain the current item  for the NotesDirectoryNavigator  and is updated with subsequent  calls of GetNextItemValue and  GetNthItemValue methods. An index to the current match for the  NotesDirectoryNavigator and is updated  by subsequent calls to FindFirstMatch,  FindNextMatch and FindNthMatch  methods. The name of the current match indicated  by the CurrentMatch property index for  NotesDirectoryNavigators created with  the LookupNames method. Contains the name of the directory view used  to create the NotesDirectoryNavigator  object. This property is updated when  directory lookups are performed. If True, a match was successful. If False, the  match was not successful. If True, a name was located. If False, the  name was not located.  [ 168 ]   The following methods are available for the NotesDirectoryNavigator class.  Chapter 9  Method FindFirstMatch  Returns Boolean  FindNextMatch  Boolean  FindNthMatch  Boolean  FindFirstName  FindNextName  FindNthName  Long  Long  Long  GetFirstItemValue  Variant  GetNextItemValue  Variant  GetNthItemValue  Variant  Description Moves the navigator of the first  match of the current name in the  NotesDirectoryNavigator. Returns  True if a match was found otherwise  returns False indicating no match   was found. Moves the navigator of the next  match of the current name in the  NotesDirectoryNavigator. Returns  True if a match was found otherwise  returns False indicating no match   was found. Moves the navigator of the nth  match of the current name in the  NotesDirectoryNavigator. Returns  True if a match was found, otherwise  returns False indicating no match   was found. Moves the navigator to the first name  in the NotesDirectoryNavigator  returning the number of matches found. Moves the navigator to the next name  in the NotesDirectoryNavigator  returning the number of matches found. Moves the navigator to the nth name  in the NotesDirectoryNavigator  returning the number of matches found. Returns the value of the first item of the  current match. Moves the navigator to the next item  within the current match and returns the  value of that match. Moves the navigator to the nth item  within the current match and returns the  value of that match.  NotesProperty class: This class represents a single component property within the  composite application. Component properties are data items that a given component  produces and the NotesProperty class allows your application to manage the  publishing of the defined properties within an application.    [ 169 ]   What's New in Notes Domino 8 Development  The methods for the NotesProperty class are only active when used within the  Notes 8 Standard configuration. They are not available when used by applications  running on Domino server or from within the Notes 8 Basic configuration.  The following properties are available for the NotesProperty class. Unless otherwise  specified, the properties are read-only.  Property Description  Type String  IsInput  Boolean  Name  String  NameSpace  String  Title  String  TypeName  String  Values  Variant array  of Strings,  Integer,  Real, or  NotesDateTime  Method Clear  Returns N A  Publish  N A  Description This class property returns the description for  the NotesProperty object. If True, the property is an input property. If  False, the property is an output property. This class property returns the name of the  NotesProperty. This class property returns the namespace for  the NotesProperties data-type. This class property returns the title of the  NotesProperty. This class property returns the type name  of the NotesProperty. When combined  with the NameSpace property, it provides a  unique identifier for the NotesProperty type. This read write class property sets or returns  the array of values for the NotesProperty.  The array items must be of all the same  data type and input properties by definition  cannot be set using this property. The  Publish method must be called after using  this property to set values or the values   will not persist.  Description For output properties only, this method clears  the new or modified values of the specified  property from the temporary cache used for  publishing via the property broker. If called  from an input type NotesProperty the  method will have no effect. Publishes to the property broker the new  values for the NotesPropery object.  [ 170 ]  The following methods are available for the NotesProperty class.   Chapter 9  NotesPropertyBroker class: The following properties are available for the  NotesPropertyBroker class. This is where all the composite application magic  occurs in Notes Domino 8.   The current implementation of the property broker for Notes Domino 8 only  supports a single input property. The InputPropertyContext is, however, declared  as an array to allow for future expansion of the property broker to support multiple  input properties in the future.  Unless otherwise specified, the properties are read-only.  Property InputPropertyContext  Type Array of  NotesProperty  Description Returns an array of NotesProperty  objects, with only the first item of the  array populated.  The methods for the NotesPropertyBroker class are only active when used within  the Notes 8 Standard configuration. They are not available when used by applications  running on Domino server or from within the Notes 8 Basic configuration.  The following methods are available for the NotesPropertyBroker class.  Method ClearProperty  Returns N A  GetProperty  NotesProperty  GetPropertyValue  Variant array  of Strings,  Integer, Real, or  NotesDateTime Boolean  HasProperty  Publish  N A  SetPropertyValue  NotesProperty  Description Clears the new or modified values of a  specified property from the temporary  cache used for publishing. Returns a NotesPropery object for a  specified property. Returns the value of a specified input  property. Used when implementing an  action.  If True, the specified property is associated   with the property broker. If False, the  property broker does not have a property  with the specified name. If values of the NotesPropertyBroker  have been modified, this method will  publish them Returns a NotesProperty object with the  value of a specified output property.  [ 171 ]   What's New in Notes Domino 8 Development  Onselect event: This new event was added to the NotesUIView class to give  developers the trigger needed to have other components respond to selected  documents within a view. The Onselect event is used to contain code that publishes  properties to the property broker based on the documents selected.  What's Ahead? As you know, Domino Designer is used to create Notes Domino applications. You  have seen how it can be used to take a Notes application and build components from  the various Notes Domino design elements using the Property Broker Editor and  the Composite Application Editor, and new integration points with actions and   view columns.  Future plans for Domino Designer may include merging it with Lotus Component  Designer within an Eclipse framework, bringing the two designer tools together into  an integrated development framework for Lotus applications. All development will  be performed within the Eclipse environment with new script editors and shared  design element bookmark navigation.  Bringing these multiple development tools under a single designer framework  will make the developer's job easier by offering them a consolidated view of the  development process.  [ 172 ]   Chapter 9  Lotus Component Designer Lotus Component Designer is the new version of Workplace Designer, with support  for WebSphere Portal 6. It is a development environment built on top of Eclipse,  which allows for the creation of document based applications using visual design  methods with no need to know the intricacies of J2EE.  Forms are the building blocks for applications built with Lotus Component Design.  Applications can have more than one form associated with them. Each form then  contains one or more controls. Controls include things like views, images, text boxes,  combo boxes, radio buttons, and tables.   Once controls are placed on a form, the built-in JavaScript editor can be used to  customize functionality. The JavaScript editor supports color-coding and code-assist,  so developers who are comfortable developing in Domino Designer will feel right   at home.  The forms and controls within a Lotus Component Designer application are used to  manipulate an XML-based document model, which is stored in a relational database.  This allows for the separation of the look and feel of the application from its data.   Here are some selected new features of Lotus Component Designer.  Migration Tool Lotus Component Designer allows you to migrate components created with previous  releases into release 8. The migration tool is a part of the component import process  and can detect older versions of components. When an older version is detected, its  pages are converted to the new XSP format.  [ 173 ]   What's New in Notes Domino 8 Development  Help and Enhanced Welcome Page The new Lotus Component Designer welcome page offers a rich set of options  including an overview, tutorials, samples, Web resources, and context-sensitive help.   Accessibility Lotus Component Designer is an accessible software development tool with which  you can create accessible components. It is compliant with IBM Corporate Instruction  162  CI 162  which meets the U.S. government federal accessibility guidelines for  information technology. It requires that hardware, software, services, web pages, and  internal applications are accessible to persons with disabilities.  Composite Application Support With Lotus Component Designer, you can now create applications that can work  within the IBM WebSphere Portal composite application model. These components  can interact with components created with Notes Domino 8 as well.  [ 174 ]   Chapter 9  Controls and Pages There are many new features and additions to controls and pages. Here are a   few favorites:  Preview images directly from the Choose Image dialog box without having  to add it to the page first. Create custom controls, which combine two or more controls into a   single control. Add UI controls that are not listed in the standard UI Controls palette, such  as supported AJAX controls. Web page preview without having to leave Lotus Component Designer.  Data Connections Some of the new features and enhancements for data connectivity are the following:  Local connections are supported in components. Connections are the sets of  information used to connect to a data source such as a database. The schema editor has been improved so as to provide an easy graphical way  to create and edit XML schemas. Components can now store data in external data sources such as Domino  databases and XML files on a target server A new query editor is available to provide a more granular and flexible way  to populate view queries. Components can now consume external web services and manipulate the  data received with JavaScript  Scripting Some of the new features and enhancements for deployment are the following:  There is a new XSP file format for registry and page loading which has been  made public. For more information, visit the Lotus Component Designer  developerWorks web site at http:  www.ibm.com software workplace  products product5.nsf wdocs workplacedesigner A new XSP tag library is available offering a library of UI controls, data  sources, simple actions and other controls. This library is located in the   \doc\controls directory. A JavaScript debugger is now included and can be used to debug any  JavaScript code that runs on WebSphere Portal 6.x.                                      [ 175 ]   What's New in Notes Domino 8 Development  Deployment Some of the new features and enhancements for deployment are:           Components can be deployed to servers without knowledge of J2EE  applications and without the administrator credentials. Components can be deployed to a cluster for production deployment by  exporting the components WAR  Web ARchive  and DDL  Data Definition  Language  files and providing them to you administrators. Basic authentication is now supported for WebSphere Portal 6.x  New Web 2.0 Features The following are some of the new Web 2.0 features that are available in Notes  Domino 8.  RSS and ATOM RSS and ATOM are feed formats used to publish web content that is updated on  a regular basis. News organizations, governments, private companies, and even  individuals via their daily blogs publish RSS and ATOM feeds. All you need to read  these feeds is an RSS or ATOM reader such as Notes 8 and access to the Internet.   Feeds within Lotus Notes 8 are included as a side bar plug-in along with the  Sametime Contacts, Activities, and Day at a Glance, on the right side of the screen.  [ 176 ]   With Notes Domino 8, you can also generate RSS feeds from Domino databases  including the new blog template and Domino Web Access. The Domino RSS  Syndication template is used to create the feeds from any Domino view. The agents  and script libraries from this template can also be used within other applications.  The first step is to create a database to manage your feeds. Create the new  application and base it on the RSS Feed Generator template.  Chapter 9  [ 177 ]   What's New in Notes Domino 8 Development  Once the database has been created, you will want to set up the global options that  apply to all the RSS feeds that are generated. To do this, click Set Global Options in  the action bar of the application.  Using the Global options dialog, you can control the following:             The protocol for accessing feeds – either HTTP or HTTPS. The RSS   element prefix – either notes:   or http:  . The default database redirect time, entered in seconds. The available feeds header, via HTML. The default HTML for the feed database, via HTML.  [ 178 ]   Once the defaults are set, you can define a feed and direct it to a specific mail file,  based on a user or on a specific database.  Chapter 9  With a feed defined, you are able to get a listing of all available feeds from the  Domino server by directing your browser to the feed database that you created  earlier. From this web page, you will be able to add the feed into your favorite RSS  feed reader.  [ 179 ]   What's New in Notes Domino 8 Development  Blog Template With Notes 8 you can create your own web log, or blog, using the new Domino Web  Log template  dominoblog.ntf . Once created, you can use either Notes:   [ 180 ]   …or a web browser:  Chapter 9  …to add content and manage your blog. The resultant web page shows the first  entry of the author's blog. The template allows creation of blog entries from the  Notes client or from the web site itself.  AJAX Support Domino 8 adds support for JavaScript Object Notation  JSON  as an output format.   Lotus Expeditor Lotus Expeditor is the base platform for Lotus rich clients such as Notes 8 Standard  and Sametime 7.5. It is also a product that companies can leverage to build their own  rich client solutions. Built on top of Eclipse  an open source IDE , Lotus Expeditor  adds the ability to create composite applications, a local data store for credentials and  application data, role based provisioning, enhanced security, and offline abilities.  One of the problems with rich clients in the past was the cost of deployment  and support. Rich clients are large installations that needed to be upgraded and  supported. In fact, it is the cost of deployment and support that helped to drive the  web based applications that we see in wide use today. Everyone with a rich client  knew what version of it they were running, but there is no reason to know what   [ 181 ]   What's New in Notes Domino 8 Development  version of eBay, Google Mail, or your corporate WebSphere Portal you may be using  because they are server managed and was updated all the time with new features,  functions, and content.  In fact as the rush towards web-based applications required more and more  functionality to be supported by the browser, the "light browser" itself became very  large and started to require deployment and support planning. In some instances the  browser footprint on a client became larger than some rich client applications.  Lotus Expeditor can be thought of as a platform that has all the benefits of rich   clients but also has the benefits of those web-based applications because it can be  centrally managed. It can also been described as a "local portal" because it can be  used to create composite applications that contain Notes Domino 8 components,  JSR -168 compliant portlets, SWING, and AWT applications without the need for a  network connection.  Lotus Expeditor does this by implementing client side containers for the components  that communicate via a local property broker implementation. This can have another  benefit – speed of execution. Since the code is executing within the Lotus Expeditor  platform, the composite application may not be affected by network and back-end  systems latency or at least only to the extent that it utilizes those systems.   In addition to responsiveness, applications built with Lotus Expeditor can also be  more reliable and portable due to their local execution and data stores. This results  in a rich client that has the benefits of a browser but with a user experience that can  be better than a browser due to speed, reliability, centralized management, and  the ability to work online or offline. When working offline, the applications store  transactions in the local data store. Once connected to the company network, Lotus  Expeditor can then synchronize the transactions to the host application and may  even download updates for the application itself.  Some of the applications Lotus customers can build with Lotus Expeditor include  customer service and support application such as bank teller and reservations clerk,  as well as sales force automation applications such as mobile CRM or insurance  claims management.   Summary In this chapter, we reviewed some of the major new features and enhancements that  affect Notes Domino 8 application development. These included enhancements  related to composite applications, Domino Designer 8, formula language and  LotusScript, Lotus Component Designer, Web 2.0, and Lotus Expeditor.  [ 182 ]   Integration with Other Lotus  IBM Products  The Lotus brand within IBM Software group represents the "people facing" side of  the overall IBM product family.

The specific products covered in this chapter are the most common, and   they include:          Lotus Quickplace Quickr Lotus Sametime Lotus Connections  Each of these represents key components in the overall product strategy IBM has for  the collaboration space.    This chapter does not cover all the products available under the Lotus brand. For  additional information on these, visit http:  www.lotus.com.  [ 184 ]   Chapter 10  Lotus Quickplace Quickr  The Lotus Quickplace product has been available for several years. Quickplace has  become recognized as a leader in web-based team collaboration, and it is used in  many large corporations throughout the world.     In early 2007, IBM announced two important changes to the Quickplace   product family:       The new version of Lotus Quickplace will be renamed Lotus Quickr. A new J2EE based version of Quickplace will be introduced, also called   Lotus Quickr.  These two versions of Quickr  one based on Domino and one based on WebSphere  Portal  form a single product. They do, however, have very different deployment  architectures. From an end user's standpoint, they should be viewed as collaboration  appliances. They will be presented with a consolidated list of places where they  are involved so that they can easily navigate. This will be the case regardless of the  backend deployment architecture.  The goal of these changes to Quickplace Quickr is simplification. IBM wants the  product to be so simple that an end user can, with a few clicks, generate productive  services. There is also a focus on server deployment simplification. This will be  covered in detail later in this chapter.  One of the key components of Quickr is the connector technology that it introduces.   These connectors will allow for direct and programmatic interaction with the data  stored in the Quickr places. Connectors that will be shipping with Quickr 8.0 are   the following:           Notes Sametime File System Windows Explorer RSS ATOM  In this section, we will cover each edition and discuss how it integrates with Domino.  We will not be covering how to install the product itself; this is covered in detail  within the product documentation.  [ 185 ]   Integration with Other Lotus IBM Products  Quickr with Services for Domino The Domino-based edition of Quickr should be thought of as a significant upgrade  to the existing Quickplace product line. This product has been maturing over many  years, and this new release provides many new capabilities. These include native  support for wikis and blogs "out of the box".  Product Installation The basic installation process for Quickr with service for Domino is very simple. It  involves installing a base Domino server v7.0.2 FP1. The Quickr product components  are then installed on top of this server.  Directory Integration After installation, there is some additional configuration required depending on the  intended usage.     User group directory configuration is used to control the authorization and  authentication of the environment.  [ 186 ]   Chapter 10       Sametime integration is used to enable presence awareness within the places. QPServlet configuration is used for WebSphere Portal integration. The user group directory configuration allows you to select one of three   directory types:           Internal place level directory allows for registration of users at a place level.  The users are independent of any corporate directory that may be in place.  Generally this is used to support external user access. Lotus Domino directory allows users and groups to be stored in the names. nsf database  public address book  and corresponding directories surfaced  via directory assistance.  LDAP directory allows for users in a supported native LDAP directory  for  example, Domino, IBM Tivoli Directory Server, Microsoft Active Directory,  Novelle Directory, or Sun One Directory . This configuration allows for the  refinement of the settings used to interact with the LDAP source.  The directory can be configured by first logging as an administrative user. In the  screen below, we have logged in as user Admin from the Domino directory.  [ 187 ]   Integration with Other Lotus IBM Products  Next, select the User Directory option from Site Administration. The following  screen shows the default value of No Directory selected. This is the base setup where  the contacts.nsf database for each place will be used as a user directory.  It is possible to change the user directory by clicking the Change Directory button.  This lets you choose between No Directory, LDAP Server, and Domino Server.  [ 188 ]   If LDAP Server is selected, then options for connecting to the directory server will be  displayed as shown in the screen below:  Chapter 10  This screen contains the following fields:                  Name provides the host name of the LDAP Directory Server. Port number is the LDAP TCP IP port used to communicate with the server. Check for SSL connection with LDAP User Directory enables SSL  encryption of the LDAP traffic. Note that this is an "all or nothing" selection.  It is not possible to only encrypt parts of the conversation with the LDAP  server. Search base controls determines where in the LDAP tree to search for  users and groups. For a Domino LDAP directory this value is generally left  blank. This is because groups in Domino as seen through LDAP have no  organizational component  for example, cn=Sales Users . Narrow searches to the place name further restrict the LDAP search to users  that contain the Quickr place name  for instance, Sales . Check to use credentials specified below when searching the directory  controls whether or not anonymous access is used for the LDAP directory. It  is very common to have read-only binding credentials to search the directory.  [ 189 ]   Integration with Other Lotus IBM Products             Username provides the user's distinguished Name for the LDAP server  for  example, cn=quickrbind,ou=Admin,o=Acme . Password is the password for the user name above. Authentication timeout controls the time in seconds for the login operation  to timeout. The default is 120 seconds. Search timeout controls the time in seconds for LDAP searches to timeout.  The default is 120 seconds.  The next section of the directory configuration screen determines whether or not  new users can be controlled at the place level. Specifically this allows for the place  manager to create new users that are not in the directory. Otherwise they can only  add users that exist in the directory.  After you complete the configuration, the LDAP directory is available for use. If  additional configuration is needed beyond this, then a qpconfig.xml file must be  used. This file is created in the Quickr server data directory, where there is a sample  configuration file called qpconfig_sample.xml.  The qpconfig.xml file can be used to fine tune the LDAP directory settings  including attribute mappings, LDAP search filters.   If Lotus Domino is selected as the directory type, the only option is management of  the place level security. This is the same option as in the LDAP server setting.  [ 190 ]   Lotus Sametime Integration The process required to configure Sametime integration with Quickr is similar. From  the Site Administration screen, select Other Options and then select Edit Options.  Chapter 10  The Sametime Servers section controls the host names to be used for the Quickr  server. This screen has numerous other items as well that are covered in the  administration help.  Enter the Sametime Community and meeting server host names. Depending on the  environment, these may be the same hosts.  [ 191 ]   Integration with Other Lotus IBM Products  Quickr depends on SSO to be correctly configured between the Quickr  and Sametime servers. This allows for the user credentials from the  Quickr server to be passed into Sametime. By default the Quickr server  will only have basic authentication configured.  The next configuration step is to set up a new Web SSO document in to Domino  directory shared by the Quickr and Sametime servers.  If you are using WebSphere  Portal server as shown in a later section, this Web SSO document will contain the  imported WebSphere application server token.   You must now copy several files from the Sametime server to the Quickr server.  These files will be used for both awareness and meeting services. The final step is to  ensure that the Chat: Shot the Chat link is enabled. It should be enabled by default. Integration with Lotus Sametime and Quickr services for Domino involves the  qpconfig.xml file. It manages the Sametime features available within Quickr. When  using Sametime with Quickr, only users that are in the LDAP directory will be  visible. Any locally created users will not have awareness.  Application Development The final integration component of Quickr with services for WebSphere Portal and  Domino comes in the area of application development. Since this edition of Quickr  is built on top of a Domino foundation, it is possible to use traditional Domino  development techniques to customize and extend it in many ways.  Quickr with Services for WebSphere Portal The WebSphere Portal based edition of Quickr represents a significant application  in the Web 2.0 space. It heavily leverages these technologies to bring an industry  leading collaboration experience. This product expands on the capabilities originally  created from IBM Workplace Collaboration Services and IBM Workplace   Services Express.   [ 192 ]   The user interface is very similar to the Domino based edition. The feature sets  between these two are different at the moment. Therefore it is important for  customers to evaluate the requirements for each place to determine if the Domino or  J2EE foundation provides the necessary features.  Chapter 10  [ 193 ]   Integration with Other Lotus IBM Products Product Installation The installation of Quickr services for WebSphere Portal server has been optimized  for ease of deployment.  There are three installation types that are available in the setup program.           Departmental Express provides for the fastest deployment. The server is  fully deployed with all necessary components including DB2. Advanced Single Server allows for additional options during setup for  future expansion.  Advanced Enterprise Cluster allows for a base installation that is intended  for a clustered deployment.  Additional details about the product installation are available in the Quickr  administration guide.   [ 194 ]   Chapter 10  Directory Integration Since the J2EE based version of Quickr is built on top of the WebSphere application  server and the WebSphere Portal server, there are only two directory configurations: Custom User Registry is the internal directory built in on top of the Quickr  RDBMS. LDAP User Registry is the external LDAP directory.        Even though you have to transfer security to an external LDAP directory as a  separate step, it should not be inferred that security is not enabled in Quickr. The  installation process enables WebSphere Portal security against the custom user  registry with a user specified during the installation. This user is quikradm   by default.  The custom user registry is similar to the default Domino edition of Quickr. That  is, the place administrators can manage new users without having them written  into the corporate directory. When using an LDAP user registry, it is common for  these to have write access restricted limiting the creation of new users outside of the  Directory administration team. The process of security transfer to an external LDAP  source is handled by the Configuration Wizard.  It is recommended that, if you are planning to transfer security to an external  LDAP directory, this should be done during the initial installation. It is technically  possible to do this transfer with data in the system, but you risk causing harm to that  information later. This is particularly true if your user credentials are changing as  part of this move.  In preparation for the security transfer, several users and groups need to be created  in the LDAP directory.                 wpsadmin: WebSphere Portal server administrative user account. wpsbind:LDAP bind user account. wasadmin: WebSphere application aerver administrative user account. wpsadmins: WebSphere Portal server administrative group account; this  should contain wpsadmin user account at a minimum. wpsContentAdministators: WebSphere web content manager administrative  group. This should contain the same users as wpsadmins as a minimum. wpsDocReviewer: WebSphere Portal document manager administrative  group. This should contain the same users as wpsadmins as a minimum.  [ 195 ]   Integration with Other Lotus IBM Products  It is possible to use different names for these entries as needed.  The specific process for the security transfer is beyond the scope of this chapter.  It is very similar to that used for WebSphere Portal itself. Refer to the Quickr  administration guide for additional information.  Sametime Integration The use of awareness within Quickr services for WebSphere Portal is configured in  the same as any other WebSphere Portal installation:  1.  Configure the Sametime server using the LDAP directory. It is possible to  use the native Domino directory for Sametime, but integration is easier if  WebSphere Portal Quickr and Sametime are both using LDAP.  2.  Configure SSO between WebSphere Portal Quickr and Sametime. This   is accomplished by exporting the LTPA token value from the WebSphere  application server and importing it into the Domino domain hosting the  Sametime servers.  3.  Update the wpconfig.properties file for WebSphere Portal Quickr with   the values for the Sametime server. This includes the following:  Sametime host name  Sametime protocol  http   Sametime http port   4.  There are additional configuration options available in the CSEnvironment. properties file to facilitate name mapping, if a different directory is used   for Sametime.   5.  Run the WPSconfig.bat .sh lcc-configure-sametime configuration   program to name the necessary system changes.  Lotus Quickr Connectors One of the key features of Quickr is the openness provided by the connector  architecture. These connectors allow for direct interaction with the Quickr servers  independently of the backend architecture  WebSphere Portal Domino .  [ 196 ]   The installation of these is via the large link on the main page of either edition.  Chapter 10  The preceding link will initiate the download and installation of the connectors  package. This is handled as a standard msi package starting you at the welcome  screen. Click Next to continue.  [ 197 ]   Integration with Other Lotus IBM Products  Next is the license text. After you have read all of the content and gotten agreement  from your legal department, click Next to continue. The next screen allows for a  custom setup of the Connectors. Select the desired options and click Next.  If you select Notes as a Quickr Connector type, you will be asked for the file page of  the Notes client installation. Change the path if necessary to match your installation  and click Next.  [ 198 ]   If you select Sametime as a Quickr Connector type, you will be asked for the file  page of the Sametime client installation. Change the path if necessary to match your  installation and click Next.  Chapter 10  The connector will now be installed on your machine.  [ 199 ]   Integration with Other Lotus IBM Products  After the installation process has completed, the following screen will appear. The  two options can remain selected if necessary. It is advised to at least launch the  Microsoft Windows Explorer connector. This will allow you to add Quickr servers to  the configuration.  From the Quickr icon on the Microsoft Windows task bar, select Add Places to install  your first connection to a Quickr server. At least one connection is necessary. It  does not matter if this is pointing to a J2EE or Domino edition backend, as both will  function the same via the connectors. In the Add Places section of Lotus Quickr Connectors dialog, enter the server   path and user credentials for server. This could be different for different Quickr  servers, depending on the directory configuration. After entering the information,  select Next.  [ 200 ]   Chapter 10  If the connection to the server was successful, the following dialog should appear.  This will be a list of places that are present on the server for you to interface with.  Select the desired place from the list. It is possible to select multiple places.   Then select Finish.  [ 201 ]   Integration with Other Lotus IBM Products  The monitor is a background process that communicates with the various Quickr  instances and places. To access the monitor, select the Quickr icon from the task bar.  Now that the Quickr Connector is configured, it will be visible in the various  applications. Below is an example of the Microsoft Windows Explorer connector.  It allows Quickr to work like a file server to drag and drop files. This also has the  document management features of check in, check out, and versions.  [ 202 ]   Within Notes, Quickr connectors are visible from the Actions menu. This allows  interaction with the Quickr services to provide links to content and save file  attachments into the content store.  Chapter 10  [ 203 ]   Integration with Other Lotus IBM Products  The following screen is called Insert Link to Document. It allows a user to send  a link to a document in the Quickr content store instead of putting it in an email  message. This allows different users to access a central copy of the content. In the  Add Link dialog, you can select a document from the navigator. Select Open to add  the link to the mail message or other Notes document.  After the link has been added to the email message, others can use it to open   the content.  [ 204 ]   The connector for Sametime allows access to Quickr content stores. It is implemented  as a Lotus Expeditor plug-in within the Sametime 7.5.1 client.  Chapter 10  [ 205 ]   Integration with Other Lotus IBM Products  The connector for Microsoft Office provides access to Quickr document management  functions directly from within Office applications.  As you can see, the Lotus Quickr connectors provide for tight integration into the  content. This will give the end users choices as to how they work and interact with  their content.  Lotus Sametime Sametime is an enterprise client instant messaging and web conferencing product  that has been available for many years. The current version of 7.5.1 extends these  capabilities with a revised web conference meeting center client and Lotus Expeditor  based instant messaging client.  [ 206 ]   Chapter 10  The product is a core component of the unified communications and collaboration  strategy. This represents an integrated messaging solution that includes instant  messaging, voice, and video.  The client product now supports not only Windows, but also Linux and Mac OS X.  These additional client platform choices expand its enterprise reach.  The 7.5.1 product release introduces a new server platform with Linux. This has been  a long sought after operating system for the server platform.  Product Installation The installation of Sametime 7.5.1 requires Domino 7.0.1 or higher. The Domino  server is used for the HTTP services, configuration, and meeting data storage. A  slight variation on this is the Enterprise Meeting Server  EMS  product. It extends  the capabilities of Sametime with the WebSphere application server as the front  end. The main difference is that EMS provides meeting services fail-over. While  the WebSphere application server is used as the front end, the engine driving the  meetings themselves is a standard Sametime server running on Domino.  The installation process involves running the Sametime server installation wizard  on an existing server. After you answer a few simple questions, the installation  will complete in a matter of a few minutes. After this base installation has been  completed, additional customization is possible.  [ 207 ]   Integration with Other Lotus IBM Products  One important thing to note is that Sametime Connect clients are not installed as part  of the Sametime server. The installation programs for these must be installed after  the base server install.  There is a Sametime SDK toolkit that can be installed as part of the base package.  This provides API services and sample applications to build integrated solutions.  Directory Integration The base installation itself is fairly simple with a minimal amount of questions. The  key difference is the directory type selection of either Domino or LDAP. Regardless  of user directory type, the base functions of Sametime are the same.  If the Domino directory is used, then the configuration is very straightforward. The  Sametime server needs a replica copy of the Domain directory. It also needs a Web  SSO document defined so as to function correctly. This is done by default as part of  the Sametime setup if such a document does not already exist.  [ 208 ]   If an LDAP directory is used, then the configuration can be a bit more complicated.  During the installation process, you will be asked for the LDAP server host name  and port number. Further configuration is handled via the Sametime administration  Web interface or by editing the stconfig.nsf database via a Notes client.  Chapter 10  When an LDAP directory is used in Domino, it has two interface points. The first  is for instant messaging. These services directly access the LDAP server and don't  use Domino. The second is for meeting services. These use the Domino's directory's  assistance database to interact with the LDAP source. The reason behind this is that  meeting services leverages the Domino authentication services and database ACLs to  manage access.  [ 209 ]   Integration with Other Lotus IBM Products Application Integration Sametime has many integration points. This is in addition to the Lotus Expeditor  based client.           Notes Sideshelf. Notes view document integration  for instance, inbox . Quickplace Quickr. The WebSphere Portal server.  This list includes a few integration points that are available. The key is that the  Sametime services can be integrated into virtually any application that can leverage  the API services it provides.  Lotus Connections The Lotus Connections product represents a new classification of applications within  the enterprise. It is targeted as a social network tool to allow for dynamic end user  collaboration through Web 2.0 tools and technologies.  The product has five key areas that it brings into an environment. Each of these can  be deployed separately or mixed and matched as needed. However, to fully take  advantage of this product, all five should work in unison. The five areas are   as follows:                Profiles provide for personal information about end users within the  environment. This can include reporting structures, contact information, and  associated content within the remaining four components. Communities provide for a collaboration environment based upon the wiki  structure. Blogs provide for basic blogging services for an enterprise. Dogear provides for intelligent bookmarking services across all of the Lotus  Connections application. It also has the ability to bookmark any linkable  material such as a website, Notes documents, Quickr content. One key aspect  is the nature of social bookmarking, where an individual can subscribe to the  bookmarks of other interested parties. Activities provide for a new task based work management tool. An activity  is a discrete work stream that can consist of one or more components and  can involve many individuals. An example activity would be the creation  of a book such as this. The book itself would be the activity with many  active participants. Then as content is created, reviewed, and updated, those  activities can be managed in the context of the activity.  [ 210 ]   Each of these components with the exception of profiles provides the ability to enter  unique tags. The tags themselves then roll up as tag clouds.  Chapter 10  These tag clouds allow for quick information categorization and searching. Each  tag cloud also provides for a slider to increase or decrease the depth of information  displayed. If you have not seen these before, the font size and color indicates the  strength of the tag or its frequency of occurrence.  Within Notes Domino, the main point of contact is in the area of activities and  Dogear. These two items can directly connect into the Notes 8 client.  [ 211 ]   Integration with Other Lotus IBM Products  Activities are rendered as a side shelf within the client. It is available as a   right-click context menu that can be used t add a Notes document  such as an email   to an activity.  Dogear is available as a right click context menu.  The architecture and installation for Lotus Connections is based on WebSphere  application server. For additional information, see the Lotus Connections  administration guide.  Summary In this chapter, we looked as several add-on products that are typical integrated into  a Notes Domino environment. These include Quickplace Quickr, Sametime, and  Lotus Connections. Each of these represents is a key component for the software  environment at your company.  As we mentioned, there are a number of other Lotus IBM products that can   be integrated into Notes Domino. For more information, consult   http:  www.lotus.com.  [ 212 ]   Third-Party Products  In this appendix, we look at several vendor offerings that could extend your   Lotus Notes Domino 8 environment. The information contained in this chapter is  provided by the vendors themselves. For more information, consult the respective  vendor's website.  PistolStar PistolStar, Inc. is a password management software solutions provider specializing  in IBM software platforms, with a core focus on the Lotus software suite.  Many  of PistolStar's senior-level developers are from Iris and Lotus, bringing in-depth  knowledge and first hand experience to Password Power 8's plug-ins.   PistolStar's Password Power 8 plug-ins expand the authentication and password  management capabilities of Lotus Notes Domino 8. The Notes ID plug-in offers SSO  and seamless redirection of the Notes ID file's authentication to LDAP compliant  directories  e.g. Microsoft Active Directory, Novell eDirectory, Tivoli Directory  Server . Likewise, the Domino plug-in offers HTTP SSO to Domino and seamless  redirection of HTTP authentication to LDAP-compliant directories as well. The  Web Set Password Plug-in  WSP  offers great control over the management of the  Domino Internet password if it is vital to the current authentication processes. Below  is an outline of the functionality available with each of PistolStar's Password Power 8  plug-ins as they pertain to Lotus Notes and Domino 8. To achieve PistolStar's definition of Single Sign-On  SSO , we start at the  desktop with the Windows session. We leverage Microsoft Active Directory and  Novell eDirectory—both significant technologies in Windows-centric computer  environments—by enabling use of either of their passwords at the initial computer  login to access all Domino server applications in multiple domains and the Notes  client. With this capability, the number of times an end-user must supply logon  information during a Windows session is reduced to a single instance.   Third-Party Products  Password Power 8 Domino Plug-in  The Domino plug-in provides end-users with SSO access to all applications on  Domino servers, creating convenience and saving login time. The Domino plug-in  now offers two methods for SSO capabilities: Kerberos or proprietary cookies, both  of which optionally allow authentication utilizing a Personless NAB.   Enabling SSO to Domino HTTP servers via Kerberos requires connectivity to a  central Key Distribution Center  KDC . In Windows, each Active Directory domain  controller acts as a KDC. Users authenticate themselves to services  e.g. Domino  servers  by first authenticating to their Windows machine using a domain account,  then requesting encrypted service tickets from the KDC for the specific services they  wish to use. This last step is performed automatically by the user's web browser.  Only the service  and the KDC  can decrypt the service ticket to get the user's  information. Because only the KDC could have created the service ticket, the service  knows that the user must have also authenticated to the KDC so it can trust the user  credentials in that ticket.   Alternatively, to enable SSO to Domino HTTP servers, a web browser toolbar creates  client-side cookies with encrypted credentials for each of the Domino servers listed  in the Password Power configuration file. Accessing a Domino server through a web  browser automatically sends the corresponding cookie with the request. These same  cookies can also be used to grant SSO to IBM Lotus QuickPlace and Sametime, IBM  WebSphere and WebSphere Portal and SAP Netweaver. These in-memory session  cookies have a configurable expiration interval that defaults to 12 hours. When  the end-user closes the browser, logs out or shuts down Windows, the cookies are  automatically destroyed.   The Domino plug-in also supports a Personless NAB allowing the end-user to logon  to Domino HTTP with their network directory  e.g. Microsoft Active Directory   credentials to access all Domino HTTP solutions, including Lotus iNotes, Sametime,  QuickPlace, and Domino Web applications. Browser-only end-users no longer  need a duplicate set of Person documents as the Domino plug-in requires that the  end-user be defined only once – in Active Directory  users of the stand-alone Notes  client would still need Person documents to support encryption and signatures .  The Personless NAB approach also leverages Domino's Directory Assistance, which  allows an end-user access token to contain their Active Directory name and any  Active Directory groups to which they belong. The central role in this approach  is performed by a DSAPI filter which can give SSO and overrides the normal  authentication process, which checks the username and password against the  Domino Directory.  [ 214 ]   This functionality solves many of the username mapping issues associated with  authenticating against remote directories without requiring changes to the LDAP  server accounts or Domino Directory. Redirecting web authentication requests  from the Domino Directory to a different LDAP directory also eliminates the need  to maintain or synchronize the Domino Internet password, as its presence and  upkeep are no longer required. This functionality extends to affect all Domino HTTP  authentication including QuickPlace and Sametime.

The Notes ID plug-in provides synchronization between Active Directory and the  Notes ID File and allows forgotten Notes ID file passwords to be automatically  recovered and resynchronized with the Active Directory.   With PistolStar's Password Power Notes Id plug-in, a successful authentication to  Microsoft Active Directory, Novell eDirectory, Lotus Domino LDAP, Tivoli Directory  Server or Sun ONE LDAP grants access to the Lotus Notes client. This effectively  eliminates the manual Notes ID password recovery by allowing a reset of the LDAP  password to restore access to Lotus Notes. Password synchronization between   LDAP and the Notes ID file is always performed for times when the LDAP server   is unreachable.

This allows  end-users to synchronize Windows, HTTP, LDAP passwords and Notes ID File.  This increases security because having only one password to commit to memory  decreases the likelihood end-users will write it down and become a target for  internal intruders.  System Requirement for Web Set Password Plug-in  Lotus Domino 5 6 7 8 Microsoft Windows NT, 2000, 2003 IBM AIX 5.1 and higher IBM System i V5R3 and higher All x86 Linux distributions Sun Solaris SPARC 8 and higher Lotus Sametime 3.1, 6.5.1, 7, 7.5  optional  Lotus QuickPlace 3.1, 6.5.1, 7  optional  Domino.doc 6.5.1, 7  optional   Security The Password Power 8 Web Set Password plug-in  WSP  offers the following  security features:  Force an SSL connection for logins: WSP can ensure end-users' credentials  are submitted via SSL. If an end-user tries to login through HTTP instead  of HTTPS, WSP forces login with HTTPS by redirecting the end-user to a  HTTPS connection. Dictionary lookup functionality: Allows administrators to enable a  dictionary lookup to prevent users from setting pre-specified  unacceptable  or easily guessed  passwords, such as company name. The lookup can be  added in three ways: Notes database, JavaScript, or both Notes database and  a list accessed through JavaScript.  [ 216 ]                            Appendix  Password quality: With WSP, Administrators can configure several fully  customizable password 'strength' rules.  Password quality check on both client and server sides: With WSP,  client side checking does not access server and is done through JavaScript  requiring less server loan and network traffic. Server side checking can use  @PasswordQuality instead of JavaScript  requires a trip to the server  to  determine if a new password is acceptable. This allows administrators to  set minimum password quality  0-16  and any new password must, at a  minimum, equal this quality. Disqualify username as password: Administrators can prevent new  passwords from containing variations of the end-user's username, a typical  password choice that is easily guessed by network intruders. Password expiration grace period: WSP lets Administrators select a grace  period or a timeframe in which end-users must change their passwords. Disable Internet Explorer Auto Complete: Administrators can prevent  Internet Explorer Auto Complete feature from offering a list of previously  used entries. When enabled, this applies to all WSP fields and only affects  IS5.0 and higher. This feature prevents internal intruders from easily  accessing the password from the drop-down menu of previously used  passwords. Prevent similar password use: WSP's 'Prevent Similar Passwords' JavaScript  Rule checking disallows use of similar passwords during password resets. Confirmation requirement for self-registration: With WSP, an email is sent  to the end-user with a link to a confirmation page for self-registration. On  this page, end-users are prompted for their email address, which affects  creation of the Person Document in the Domino Directory.  Auditing Features WSP also includes auditing features. These include:  Store last login date and time: Allows Administrators to track the date and  time an end-user last logged in – data that is stored as a new field in the  Person Document. Administrators can also elect to record more detailed  information to be sent to the WSP database, such as username, end-user's IP  address, URL requested and server name. Enable Strikeout logging functionality: Strikeouts can be logged to a  database so Administrators see when failed attempts occurred.                             [ 217 ]   Third-Party Products  Log invalid usernames: Administrators can enable logging of invalid  usernames to the mail-in database. The information included in this report is:             IP address of computer that made the request URL requested by the user Username used Password given The WSP-specific function the user attempted to accomplish    log in, set password, and so on  The server on which the attempt occurred The time the attempt occurred          Enable 'set password' logging: In WSP, Administrators can enable logging of  successful 'Set Password' events to the mail-in database.  Help Desk  WSP also includes Help Desk productivity features. For example, WSP's Help Desk  Manager Utility allows Help Desk personnel to manage end-user passwords without  full access to WSP's configuration data. This database includes several actions    the Unlock Agent item is actually an agent, not a button :  Unlock User unlocks end-user accounts that have been locked by WSP's  strikeout function utility. Email Random Password: generates random value passwords and emails  them to the end-user. This can also be used automatically send multiple   end-user's blank passwords. Reset Password resets the HTTP password to a new value when an   end-user does not have an HTTP password, has forgotten it, is unable   to reset it themselves, and does not have a Notes client. Expire Password forces end-user to change their HTTP password the next  time they log in to Domino through a Web browser. This is useful when  password policies change. Reset WSP Fields resets end-user accounts as if they had never accessed WSP. Set Expiration Date provides a one-time override of WSP's expiration  functionality. This is useful for exempting end-users from resetting   a password. Unlock Agent unlocks end-users automatically every x number of hours.                         [ 218 ]   Appendix           In addition, WSP offers the following features designed to assist Help Desk personnel: Enable customized HTML: With WSP, Administrators can write customized  messages to end-users to prompt them through the login process, reducing  end-user confusion and subsequent Help Desk Calls. Email Random Password Functionality: Allows Administrators to generate  random passwords that are automatically emailed to new end-users. This is  both an administrative time-saver as well as a security feature because the  administrator never sees the password. WSP enables customizable expiration  options for the new password as well. Support localization: Administrators can configure all UI screens in any  language without use knowledge of Domino Designer. Administrators  can easily modify logon screens to ensure that customized messages and  prompts are understood by the end-user. Localization reduces Help Desk  calls by minimizing end-user confusion. Enable customized disclaimer messages: Administrators can create a  disclaimer message that the end-user sees upon logon. This feature can be  used to display corporate network usage instructions for sensitive Websites  and resources  i.e., password protected . Easily configurable user interface: All WSP screens seen by the end-user   are configurable without knowledge use of Domino Designer. Through a  user-friendly interface, screens can be modified with logo insertion, font and  color selection, and editing of HTML seen by user. WSP Unlock Utility: WSP's strikeout functionality is an important part of  securing the authentication process. When enabled, the end-user is no longer  able to log in after a pre-set number of attempts. The WSP Unlock Utility  allows Help Desk personnel who do not have Editor-level access to the  Domino directories to unlock end-users who have struck out.           You can now delegate unlocking of strikeouts to Help Desk personnel with less  security clearance. This is especially beneficial to companies with employees in  different time zones, when employing Help Desk personnel with a high-level of  security clearance around the clock is costly. The end-user does not have to wait for  support and the company can maintain security by granting Editor-level access to  fewer personnel.  [ 219 ]   Third-Party Products End Users WSP also offers end-user productivity features. For instance, WSP's challenge,  question, and answer functionality allows the end-user to recover passwords without  Help Desk assistance. This feature stems potential security breaches that occur when  Administrators e-mail passwords to end-users or when they give out passwords to  end-users over the phone. Challenge questions are customizable.  WSP also allows end-users to create their own user accounts without administrator  involvement. If more complex workflow around account verification is necessary,  self-registrations can be set to require either end-user confirmation  to prevent  automated account creation bots  or approval by an internal user.

PO Box 1226  Amherst, NH 03031 US   603  546-2300  Reporting from Lotus Notes and   Domino Data As a Notes  Domino developer, you must be familiar with the limitations of  reporting from Notes and Domino data. Common approaches include using Notes  scripting or external reporting tools to transform the data into meaningful reports  that can be accessed on demand by end users.  This section provides a quick overview of the two methods, their inherent limitations  and provides an introduction to IntelliPRINT, the only effective reporting solution  which is native to Notes and Domino. The section on IntelliPRINT lists a few of its  key features which make it an effective solution for addressing the need for reporting  from Notes and Domino data, in a holistic manner.  There are two common approaches generally followed by organizations to report  and print data from Notes and Domino.  [ 220 ]   Appendix  Reporting Based on Notes Programming  using Lotus Script Notes professionals often prefer to create and manage their reports programmatically  using Lotus Script. This approach ensures that data security and integrity are  preserved, the business context is inherited, and the Notes application workflow is  kept intact. While it overcomes many limitations set by non-native reporting tools,  reporting using Lotus Script does have a few limitations:  Time Consuming: The time taken to create reports may vary from several  hours for basic reports to several days for complex reports. Significant overhead on IT: Programming requires highly competent Notes  developers to design and manage the reports. This imposes time and effort  overheads on the IT team. Limited Reporting Functionality: Visual representation of data in the form  of charts is not supported, and even tabular reports often require the creation  of additional views.  This approach is time consuming, expensive and end-user unfriendly. In most  situations, user request for reports cannot be met due to the effort involved in  producing the report and the poor presentation quality of the reports.  Reporting Based on Tools External to Notes There are a wide variety of report creation tools with extensive functionality that are  available for use with Notes and Domino. However, most of these are not native to  the Notes and Domino framework. These tools connect to Notes data by using ODBC  drivers or by exporting Notes data to other formats such as spreadsheets. Limitations  posed by these approaches include:  Security: Once data leaves the Notes environment via ODBC, it compromises  the robust data security offered by Notes and fails to leverage the Notes ACL  which is one of the inherent strengths of Lotus technology. Data integrity is  also compromised, as data type definitions are lost when the data is exported  from Notes. Furthermore, the exported data can be modified, as most  external environments do not provide the robust change tracking inherent to  Notes. This compromises the reliability and accuracy of reported data. Performance: There is a significant performance impact while accessing  or exporting data from Notes and Domino through the ODBC connector.  The performance degradation results in significant additional hardware  investment and compromises business efficiency by considerably increasing  system response times.                 [ 221 ]   Third-Party Products        Inability to use native Notes functionalities: Unique Notes functionalities  such as @Formula, multi-value fields, RTF, etc. cannot be used for   designing reports Presents a confusing view of the target database: Notes forms, views and  folders are exposed as separate data tables leading to a confused view of the  target database  Introducing IntelliPRINT Reporting IntelliPRINT started as a printing solution for Notes and Domino and has matured to  become one of the best reporting solutions in its current release, which was launched  at Lotusphere 2007. It has also been extended to natively support Notes  Domino 8  while continuing support for Notes versions 6 and 7.  IntelliPRINT Reporting is to Notes and Domino what Crystal Reports was to Visual  Basic. It is a native reporting component that is tightly integrated with the Notes  and Domino application framework. It is a logical extension to Notes and Domino  and lets you use its APIs to tightly integrate the reports within the workflow of your  Notes and Domino applications.   As the report format is stored as a Notes document, security settings for report access  as well as row level access are automatically inherited from the Notes ACL. The  report is then presented as a Notes tab making the reporting workflow integral to  your application workflow.   [ 222 ]   Appendix  The key features that make it a logical extension of Notes and Domino are listed  below and include details of the steps involved in creating a simple report and a  complex report.  Report Deployment without Development Overheads Consider a scenario where a multi-level cross-tab report has to be created, such as a  sales report that shows the sales for multiple products across several geographical  regions. The rows would display the sales for each of the regions while the columns  would show the product sales across the regions. Creating such a cross-tab by just  using Lotus Script would typically entail the following:            Several hours of scripting to create the row and column totals A script that spans several hundred lines Creation of additional views in the Notes application, for document selection  in the script Hard coding of the font and color formatting  [ 223 ]   Third-Party Products  The same cross-tab can be created with IntelliPRINT Reporting within just a few  minutes. The benefits of using IntelliPRINT in this situation include:              Drag and drop creation process that saves substantial time No changes required in the database  The Notes database would not get loaded with multiple Views  Color schemes can be easily and quickly defined to suit organizational  standards  Presentation quality reports that can be printed or exported to PDF  IntelliPRINT thus helps reduce a substantial amount of IT workload for not only  creation of the report but also for future changes in the report! The report format gets  saved in the host database and can be accessed on demand by authorized users.   Report Deployment without Administrative Overhead Once designed, a report template is stored in the host Notes application or a central  report repository. These formats can also be deployed on a Domino server and   made available online via a web browser. Report format take very little space to  store—typically less than 100KB—and can be opened almost instantaneously.  When a report is viewed, data is fetched from the database and presented in the  format as specified in the report metadata. This ensures the report always reflects  real-time information. Generated reports can be programmatically stored, for  example you could save them into the same Notes database as the application.  IntelliPRINT Reporting integrates seamlessly with the Notes and Domino's existing  security framework. Reports are only accessible to users who have access to the  applications in which IntelliPRINT is embedded. In addition, report creators can  specify access controls for individual reports in addition to the Notes ACLs already  present. This means the data in IntelliPRINT reports have access controls enabled for  users as well as groups. Report Designers can easily set this up using a form, which  will specify access levels for each report. This ensures that your users can access their  data within Notes' secure, consistent security model without you having to spend  time and effort to setup different systems.  [ 224 ]   Appendix  Integration with The Application Workflow Report templates that have been embedded in the Notes application can be made  available to users by just adding Action buttons in the Notes application. Consider  the scenario where an employee needs to create time-sheet reports from an HR  application. Using IntelliPRINT, the reports can be triggered by 'action' buttons  within the application, and directly mailed to users as PDF attachments.   The entire process can be automated on a Domino server using Notes agents that can  generate reports automatically at pre-defined intervals, e.g. weekly reports that are  generated every Monday. The agent will also handle emailing of these reports to   the users.  Automation of the entire reporting system for scheduled reporting provides  tremendous benefits to IT personnel as well as the business users. IT no longer needs  to spend days working on manual report creation and business users are guaranteed  timely delivery of reports.  Creating a Simple Report Using the Wizard With IntelliPRINT Reporting, simple tabular reports can be created in a matter of  minutes. The procedure below describes the steps involved in creating a simple  report. The steps below are to be performed on the Pinnacle Electronics sample  database provided with IntelliPRINT Reporting. The database is automatically  installed while installing IntelliPRINT Reporting.  To create a simple report using a wizard:  1.  Open the Formats list in IntelliPRINT Reporting – Designer, via the Notes   Actions menu.   2.  Click New and choose Report. Select the Standard Report Wizard.  3.   In the Report Wizard, use the Edit Database button to define the database  from which the report needs to be generated. Click Edit query to start the  visual query builder. Select the required fields from the Views listed.  [ 225 ]   Third-Party Products  4.  Select the page layout and the report style, and you're done.  And you're report is ready; the Wizard will now place the bands automatically. Click  the Preview button to view the final report. You can even adjust the band layout to  suit your needs. The entire process takes just a few minutes!  Creating a Complex Report with IntelliPRINT  Reporting IntelliPRINT Reporting allows you to create a variety of complex reports such as:               Master-detail reports Multi-database reports Subreports Parameterized reports Cross-tab reports Charts  [ 226 ]   Appendix  Here we will step through the procedure for creating a Master-Detail report; we'll  be working with the Pinnacle Electronics sample database that is provided with  IntelliPRINT Reporting.  A Master-Detail report connects to a database using multiple queries. The idea is to  extract related information from two different queries and print them in the same  report. For instance, we can design a report which utilizes two queries - the first  query fetches the customer Name and ID while the second query extracts the same  customer's purchase details, such as the Product name, Quantity and Unit price.  To create a Master-Detail report:  1.  Open the database from which the report has to be generated. IntelliPRINT   Reporting will now use this as the default database automatically.  2.  Open the Formats list in IntelliPRINT Reporting – Designer, via the Notes   Actions menu.   3.  Click New and choose Report. Cancel the Standard Report Wizard as we'll   be designing this report manually.   4.  Add a Notes database connection by selecting Insert  LN Database from    the menu. A new icon named LNDatabase1 should appear in Data pane    at the bottom .  5.  Define a Notes query by selecting Insert  LN Query from the menu. A new  icon named LNQuery1 should appear in Data pane. Repeat this step to add  LNQuery2.  [ 227 ]   Third-Party Products  6.  Double-click LNQuery1 to open the Query Builder window, seen below.   Expand the View that contains the required fields, and drag the appropriate  fields' folder to the Data Fields box to populate it with the list of fields.  LNQuery1 is ready. Similarly, define LNQuery2.  7.   Insert the Master Band by selecting Insert  Insert Band  Master Data from  the menu options. Use LNQuery1 in the Select DataSet dialog box. Insert a Detail Band by selecting Insert  Insert Band  Detail Data from the  menu options. Use LNQuery2 this time in the Select DataSet dialog box. 9.  Now you can add the required fields from the Data Tree window  on the   8.   right side . Just drag and drop the field to the Master and Detail bands  [ 228 ]   10.  Add a Report Title band and define the title as Master Detail Report.  Appendix  Your report is ready, click Preview to view your report. To add even more power to  your report, you can add objects such as Computed Columns, Images, Charts, Cross- tab tables, Rich Text, Sub report objects, and a lot more.   Conclusion To sum up, here's why IntelliPRINT Reporting can help you improve the  productivity of your reporting system:             Shortened report development cycle Superior performance because of its native 'designed-for-Notes' approach Advanced drag-and-drop and wizard-based reporting functionality Presentation-quality reports that are print-ready as well Support for native Notes features, including the Notes security framework  [ 229 ]   Third-Party Products  All of these make IntelliPRINT Reporting the product of choice for reporting and  printing with Lotus Notes and Domino applications.

IONET Incremental Archiver IONET are a Wellington, New Zealand based company that have specialised in  Lotus Notes and Domino solutions since v3.0. They concentrate on innovative, low- cost products to enhance the usability of any Lotus Notes Domino environment.  For a demonstration copy of the Incremental Archiver, or more information on  IONET or our products, please visit http:  www.ionetsoftware.com.   The IONET Incremental Archiver complements R8 as an automatic archive restore  tool for Lotus Notes data. In the Archiver, we use standard Lotus Notes technologies,  but in an innovative way, which is the focus of this article.   Briefly, the Archiver automatically installs, archives, allows users to restore document  versions and deletions themselves, and removes production data  including mail .  It does this via a combination of Notes replication and a host of other functions that  may be useful for any Notes Domino environment. Coupled with the usability of R8,  this makes a powerful platform for your archiving requirements.   The Archiver has been designed to allow users to restore their own data from any  date  including document versions , using the source Notes application they are  familiar with, be it mail or any other Notes database. This means that the hierarchy  of the data  e.g. responses  is preserved and therefore familiar to the user. It also  means that the IT Department no longer has to juggle backup tapes to restore user  data. The user can also search Archives, providing a 'back-through-time' look at  document versions in the Archive.  All facets of the Archiving process are automatically enabled and controlled by the  Administrator, Notes security is observed, and full backups can still be taken for  Disaster Recovery. In addition, Notes databases no longer need custom Archiving  solutions, as data can be simply deleted from the database and remains in the  Archive, including document versions. That means you can safely use the 'Remove  documents not modified in the last x days' setting to control database size  the  Archiver can also remove documents for you according to combinations of dates and  @formulas . For the full product description, features and downloads, please visit  http:  www.ionetsoftware.com archiving.  [ 230 ]   Appendix  Let's have a look at the main components in more detail. They are:           Setup Archiving: Create the Archiving environment per database The Archive Process: Locate, Compress, Archive and Remove Data The Restore Process: View Actions Searching Archive: Including Search functions i.e. Client JS  Setup Archiving To make it easier to administer, the Archiver installation is automated as much   as possible. The setup process below is followed for each database included in   the Archive:  1.  Add three design elements  an Agent, View and Form  to the production   database design. This is performed using the excellent DBDesign LotusScript  class from Damien Katz  ex. IRIS . This class treats Notes Design elements as  Notes Documents, thus allowing them to be copied between databases using  the CopyToDatabase NotesDocument method. This library is available via  the Sandbox on the Lotus Developers Domain.  2.  Create a replica on the Archive Server. This is performed using the   3.  Set the Replica to not replicate deletions, via the NotesReplication   CreateReplica method.  LotusScript class.  4.  Set the Replica to only replicate documents matching a user-defined @  formula, using the NotesReplicationEntry LotusScript class.  5.  Create a copy of the newly created replica on the Archive Server  this copy   contains document versions . This is performed using the CreateCopy  method of the NotesDatabase class.  6.  Check there is no scheduled replication  by trawling Directory documents ,   and that the Replica cannot write back to the Production database  via  NotesACL LotusScript methods . These checks are also performed before  each Archiving operation to ensure the integrity of data.  7.  Create Full Text Indices of the newly created databases on the Archive   Server. This function is not directly possible via LotusScript. However, it is  possible to create a separate LotusScript agent  called BuildIndex  that opens  a database locally  using " as the server argument  and creates an Index  using the CreateFTIndex method of the NotesDatabase class. Using a second  agent, you then instantiate this agent and call the RunOnServer method,  passing a NotesDocument containing the database information. The result is  to create a Full Text Index on the Server. This is shown below.  [ 231 ]   Third-Party Products Calling the BuildIndex Agent  Dim s As New NotesSession Dim db As NotesDatabase Dim agent As NotesAgent Dim doc As NotesDocument   Set db = s.CurrentDatabase Set doc = ... Set the document object containing the Database   Set agent = db.GetAgent "BuildIndex"  Call agent.RunOnServer doc.NoteID    BuildIndex Agent  Dim s As New NotesSession Dim db As NotesDatabase Dim targetDB As New NotesDatabase "", ""  Dim agent As NotesAgent Dim doc As NotesDocument  Set db = s.CurrentDatabase Set agent = s.CurrentAgent Set doc = db.GetDocumentByID agent.ParameterDocID  If Not  doc Is Nothing  Then         End If  replicaID$ = doc.DBReplicaID 0  If targetDB.OpenByReplicaID "", replicaID$  Then   End If  Call targetDB.CreateFTIndex 23, False   Sub Initialize                 Replica ID       End Sub  Sub Initialize                                   End Sub  The Archive Process During setup, we created a replica on the Archive Server  the Archive Replica  and a  copy of that replica  the Archive Store , for each production database.  [ 232 ]   Appendix  A scheduled agent in the Archiver checks each Production database for any changes  made to eligible documents  i.e. those matching the Archive @formula for the  Database  since the last time replication occurred, using the Search method of the  NotesDatabase class - the Search method allows reasonable search performance  using time date criteria within databases that may or may not be Full Text Indexed.   For any document that has been modified, the corresponding document is located  in the Archive Replica  where it contains the previous content . This document is  copied to the Archive Store database. Because we're copying data on the same file  system and not traversing a network, this is a reasonably fast process.   During the copy process, the user has the choice to automatically ZIP attachments.  This is done by calling a Java agent that uses the java.util.zip package. Briefly,  the steps are:  1.  Make an array of all eligible attachments in the document and write this to   the document.  2.	 Extract the attachments to disk and remove them from the document. attachments to disk and remove them from the document. 3.  Call the Java agent, again using the NotesAgent RunOnServer method   ocument NoteID.

It does this via the Replicate method of the  NotesDatabase class.  So by identifying modified documents BEFORE they are updated via replication, an  accurate versioning of the documents is achieved.   [ 235 ]   Third-Party Products  Because deletions are not replicated to the Archive Replica, all documents are  permanently retained. Replication and ACL settings are verified before every  Archive procedure to ensure deletions are not replicated back into Production when  deletion stubs have been purged.   The final part of the Archive process is to remove documents from the Production  database, if they match the criteria specified for the database, using a combination of  document age, last accessed date, last modified date, and @formulas.   The Restore Process During the setup process, a Dialogbox Form and a 'Restore Document' Agent are  automatically added to the Production database. When a user wants to restore a  document, they run this agent. They are prompted for the date and it is retrieved  from either the Archive Replica or Archive Store  depending on the required date ,  and opened.   The following graphics show the Restore operation. Note the handy use of the R8  function to modify the right-hand menu.  [ 236 ]   The user then has to select the type of Restore:  Appendix  If the user wants to restore a deleted document, they instead automatically open the  Archive Replica  where deletions are not removed , locate the document they want,  set the date and repeat the restore process, retrieving the document from either the  Archive Replica or Archive Store depending on the required date. Users can then  restore deleted documents to the Production database.   [ 237 ]   Third-Party Products  The user is also able to search the Archive Replica and Archive Store databases for  the data they want.   This allows a 'back through time' search facility that includes the date archived. This  functionality is provided via our FT Search Manager, which allows simultaneous  searching of multiple Full Text Indices.  [ 238 ]   Appendix  Conclusion Housekeeping agents optionally clear out Archived data after a configurable period.  A separate database option allows the restore process to use a separate directory, so  that if a restore of data from 5 years ago is required, the Archive Replica and Archive  Store tape backups can be restored into this directory and the process works from  there instead of the normal location. This is so that 'normal' full backups to tape can  be performed if required  i.e. for Disaster Recovery, reducing disk space usage etc.    Another benefit of the Archiver is that no other form of archiving is required  i.e. no  custom data archives need be done by the IT Department , documents can be simply  deleted from the Production database and they will remain available in the Archive  Replica for restore.   CMT Inspector for Lotus Notes Your Domino infrastructure gets more complex every day, and effectively managing  through that complexity can save your firm time and money. Before making  upgrades additions wholesale changes to your Domino environment, gain the  knowledge you need regarding what legacy applications exist today, with granular  information on critical metrics such as usage, access and attachments. Easily  identify opportunities for improved storage and security policies based on real- world results that point to changed business needs, falling usage access, etc. CMT  Inspector provides the inspection and analysis you need to not only justify the legacy  environment, but also effectively plan for future investment options. CMT Inspector  provides the following functionalities:                           Usage Reports Security Reports Server Statistics Email Statistics Code Search and Comparison Content Analysis Application Design Analysis User Surveys Application Template Matching  Notes Upgrade Validation Extensive Code Validation Rules Engine Code Flowcharting  [ 239 ]   Third-Party Products             Export to Access Design Sophistication Indexes Express and Advanced Settings Usage Analysis Redundant Failover Logic  Will You Code Break When You Upgrade? CMT Inspector contains an extensive Rules Filtering Engine with hundreds of rules  that can be leveraged to find out if your applications will work when you upgrade.

This figure shows the Code  Inspector at work:  [ 240 ]   Appendix  Design Search, User Surveys and  Flowcharting  [ 241 ]   Third-Party Products  All code can be flowcharted and exported to Visio for much better analysis.  Reports and Export CMT Inspector comes with an extensive collection of reports that can be  automatically generated. Furthermore, all data can be exported to Microsoft Access  for further reporting and querying. This means that almost any report can be  generated on the fly.  [ 242 ]   Appendix  CMT for Public Folders You have business-critical information stored in Exchange Public Folders. You have  to migrate to Lotus Notes, but, how do you migrate the data in the Public Folders?  Making your mail migrations from Microsoft Exchange to Lotus Domino easier is a  snap with Binary Tree's CMT for Public Folders. This solution provides a simple and  user-friendly means of migrating a public folder hierarchy to a single database.  [ 243 ]   Third-Party Products  The data in a Microsoft Exchange Public Folder often has significant value that  has been protected with permissions, based on the identity stores in Exchange's  Directory. CMT for Exchange Public folders was created to help companies recover  the intellectual capital often found in Public Folders. CMT not only takes data from  the Public Folders, but can also mimic the permissions that existed on the Exchange  servers in brand new Domino databases. CMT migrates the standard Exchange  document types, including mail messages, calendar events, journal items, tasks  and notes. If your Public Folders contain forms that have been modified to include  additional fields and data types, the CMT tool can be customized to migrate this  data, as well.  CMT for Notes The Binary Tree Common Migration Tool  CMT  migrates data from one email  system to another. The tool can be used to migrate from numerous email systems to  Lotus Notes, and like the DUS tool, CMT has the ability to migrate both Server-Based  data and end-user based data.   Binary Tree's Common Migration Tool for Notes builds on 14 years of outstanding  email and calendar schedule migration solutions from Binary Tree. To date, millions  of users world-wide have been migrated to Lotus Notes with Binary Tree's CMT for  Notes tool.  CMT for Notes offers several business benefits:                           Enterprise migration solution that can manage large migrations  up to 50,000  users have been migrated at one time . There is no limit to the number of  users that can be imported from a source directory. Wizards set up specific functions such as importing users, registration to the  Domino directory, the end-user migration and the server-to-server migration. Ability to create mail files during the registration process. Date filtering for migrating mail, calendar and tasks during an Exchange  server-to-server migration. Process can be rolled out into two steps: user registration and user migration. Customize data types for migration, including mail, calendar, notes, journal,  tasks and contacts, depending on individual needs, space and time. Schedule users and or groups to migrate at specific times, thereby limiting  network load and support calls. Migrations do not require end-users. The Administrator can perform the  migration, cutting down on your IT department's time and expense.  Detailed logs with extensive error reporting help administrators identify,  interpret and resolve issues.  [ 244 ]   Appendix  CMT for Coexistence By off-loading most of the traffic from the Microsoft Exchange Notes Connector,  Binary Tree's CMT for Coexistence yields a more stable and reliable connection  between Lotus Notes and Microsoft Exchange.  The most popular and highly functional connectivity solution between Microsoft  Exchange and Lotus Notes environments is the Notes Connector for Microsoft  Exchange. This solution addresses e-mail, calendar, scheduling and task data  exchange, automated directory synchronization and free busy lookup between  Microsoft Exchange and Lotus Notes environments.   To overcome issues reported by many customers using the Microsoft Notes  Connector, Binary Tree's solution greatly enhances fidelity of mail exchange and  improves connectivity reliability. This is accomplished by a series of configuration  and programmatic changes in the environment.  iCal is supported with the advent of Exchange 2000 and Notes 6. iCal is the standard  for the encoding of a calendar messages in SMTP format. This allows email and  calendaring to be sent via SMTP, which greatly decreases the stress on the Microsoft  Connector, improving data fidelity. What does CMT for Lotus Exchange Coexistence do?  CMT for Coexistence offloads all mail traffic from the Microsoft Notes Connector  using SMTP and MIME encoding, effectively bypassing the inefficient Rich Text  conversion used by the Microsoft Exchange Notes Connector. Mime encoding is  much more efficient, preserving 100% fidelity.  CMT for Coexistence offloads all calendar traffic by encoding the message in iCal  format and passing it via SMTP, instead of through the Microsoft Notes Connector.  What does the Microsoft Notes Connector do  when Integrated with CMT for Lotus Exchange  Coexistence?       Directory Synchronization Free Busy Lookups  [ 245 ]   Third-Party Products     Never crash and have the ability to scale to an unlimited amount of users  CMT for Domains Your Domain infrastructure is a vital asset, and one that should be protected. Your  IT environment is unique, which means that you need something designed with  adaptability in mind.  Enter Binary Tree's CMT for Domains, Users, Servers and Desktops, a solution  which expedites the conversion between platforms, while diminishing the impact  on your IT resources. A user-friendly administrator tool requiring virtually no end- user interaction, CMT for Domains, Servers, Users and Desktops will enable you to  automate the entire migration lifecycle in minutes.   [ 246 ]                            Utilizing CMT for Domains, Servers, Users and Desktops, the following processes  can be accomplished with the click of a button:  Appendix  Entire Environment and User Audit: Wholly automates the replacement of  users' present naming structure to the new one. All-encompassing Jurisdiction of the Migration Process: Grants the  Administrator a complete overview of the migration life-cycle, providing  meticulous data with process information based on migration phases or users. Instigates the re-name of multiple users to the new hierarchical name  upgrade: The practice of migrating and or consolidating Lotus Notes  Domains is habitually escorted by altering end-users' hierarchical naming  structures. Commonly, a Lotus Notes Administrator performs the process  of Lotus Notes Domain migration by using a multifaceted, lingering  process provided by Lotus. CMT for Domains, Users, Servers and Desktops  condenses this process, accomplishing the task quickly and efficiently, but  with the minimal amount of effort. Notes Desktop Update: Programmed as an email message containing a  button for each user to click, users' desktop information  server names  for databases, user accesses, mail file and personal address book, location  documents, connection documents, etc.  are automatically updated to the  new infrastructure information with one click. Notes Port: Runs on the Domino server and by design, replaces all reference  to each migrated user's old infrastructure information with the new one in  the users mail database.  Includes fields in mail messages, calendar, meetings  and to-dos   Additionally, you can:  Move users applications to a different Notes Domain Domino Server and  amend the Domino Directory to reflect the move Monitor the rename process Monitor the move Progress Forget about digging through help files looking for answers  Never before has a consolidation of multiple Lotus Notes Domains been more  straight-forward. CMT for Domains, Users, Servers and Desktops consists of  everything a Lotus Notes Administrator needs to move users from an existing  domain to a new one. Furthermore, as a result of the migration using CMT, users  will appear to have always lived on the new domain.
