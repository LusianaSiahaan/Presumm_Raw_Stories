Dear Kate, you and I cannot be conﬁned within the weak list of a country’s fashion. We are the makers of manners.  William Shakespeare, Henry V  Chapter 1  Introduction  There’s a new king in town.  Over the past couple of years we’ve seen new technologies redeﬁne the rules of server-side web app development. It’s the client’s turn. Get ready to throw out your current “customs” of client-side development. With Dojo, we’re entering a new era of browser-based applications.  Dojo is a set of tools that helps you build better browser-based applica- tions. Dojo is built mostly using client-side JavaScript, and it expands the capabilities of the modern browser  and even Internet Explorer  far enough that the line between local, native applications and browser- based applications has all but disappeared.  This is a pretty signiﬁcant statement. It means that browser-based  and, therefore, web-based  user interfaces can be made indistinguish- able from those included with the best local, native applications. And it means that the user interface of local applications can be implemented in the browser rather than through one of the heavy, platform-sensitive, and complex native GUI frameworks  Windows, Tk, Qt, Fox, AWT, SWT, Swing, Cocoa, and the rest .  The ubiquitous browser becomes the user interface platform. It no longer matters where the back end lives: on a network of distant HTTP servers or in a small local program that implements the HTTP protocol.  Unfortunately, the “modern” browser provides an incomplete, incon- venient, and incompatible programming environment. You could get around these problems using a plug-in such as ActionScript, but this breaks an important rule: locally installed software is strictly forbidden.   CHAPTER 1.  INTRODUCTION  10  Although it may be OK to break this rule for a local application, it is certainly not OK to break it for a web-based application.1 Enter Dojo.  Dojo ﬁxes browser defects such as browser incompatibilities and mem- ory leaks, and it adds important capabilities such as HTML user inter- face controls and DOM querying. Although many JavaScript libraries are available, most focus on one particular idea. Some include effects libraries, others concentrate on perceived core JavaScript omissions, and still others implement one or more HTML widgets  user interface controls . In contrast, Dojo addresses all of these functional areas—and many others—extensively. In this respect, we say that Dojo has breadth and depth unlike any other open source solution.  For example, looking at Dojo’s depth, Dojo normalizes the event system among the popular browsers  Internet Explorer does not implement the W3C event model, and it leaks memory; most other browsers do the opposite . If you want to connect to a click event in Dojo, you can write the following:  dojo.connect myButton, "click", myFunction ;  This code will work perfectly on any supported browser. You can include a tree control on a web page by writing this:      This is quite a bit easier than what’s required in many native frame- works.  Dojo also has incredible breadth. It includes some forty user interface controls, a graphics framework, cometd support,2 a packaging system, and much more. Today, Dojo stands alone in its vast capabilities.  You may be concerned that all of this capability implies increased com- plexity. We think the opposite it true—at least if you compare apples to apples. Dojo is organized into a hierarchy of functionality. This allows you to focus on just the area you need for the current work at hand. As your needs change and expand, Dojo will be ready to answer those needs precisely because of its breath and depth. Contrast this to a smaller, less-ambitious library. Although such an alternative may be  In the corporate world, installing anything on company computers is a big deal. If 1. you eliminate this road block, you can instantly open markets that were previously untouchable. 2. Cometd is a low-latency communications technique that allows the server to push data to the browser. See http:  cometd.com .   CHAPTER 1.  INTRODUCTION  11  Buzzwords  The terms Ajax, Web 2.0, and Rich Internet Application  RIA  are so popular these days that sometimes it is not completely clear what they mean. Given what we can do with modern browser programming techniques, Ajax has come to mean “the way we do modern web apps.” That’s the way we use it. Web 2.0 is as much a business strategy as a technical term. We’ll avoid it. Finally, a local, browser-based application that communicates with an on-host HTTP server is usually considered an example of an RIA, yet such a program isn’t an Internet application. But the word is pervasive, so we’ll use it. When we do, we mean a mostly single-page, browser-based application. Ahh, precision.  easier to digest on day one  and we dispute even this , three or six months later when you need a capability that the library does not pro- vide, you are left with either learning another library or implementing something yourself. Both of these choices imply much more complexity and cost than using Dojo from the beginning.  Further, one of the core values of the Dojo contributor community is “beat down complexity.” All key attributes of Dojo’s design have been vigorously debated, implemented and reimplemented, tested, and used with this value in mind. Rather than ignore defects and build beautiful new buildings on sinking swamp land, the Dojo community has mixed the mature, rational, even skeptical engineer’s approach with the fast- moving forward thinking of the young hacker. There is real substance behind these words: the community spent most of 2007 refactoring the core system. This is surely a sign of commitment to excellence and pro- fessionalism, which can sometimes be missing in open source projects.  Finally, you should know that Dojo is not an academic project. It’s being used in hundreds of projects at hundreds of companies. Navigate to http:  www.myaol.com, and hit View Source. Dojo is there. IBM is a major contributor to the Dojo foundation—and is using Dojo in its WebSphere stack. BEA and Sun ship Dojo with their products. With this kind of Fortune 100 usage and sponsorship, you can be sure that Dojo is here for the long haul.   1.1 Key Aspects of Dojo  Let’s survey the broad landscape that is Dojo.  KEY ASPECTS OF DOJO  12  Not Just a Library—A Toolkit  Dojo is a collection of static, client-side JavaScript scripts. There is no client-side plug-in or server-side components. It includes the following:    A design and implementation that normalizes the browser, allow- ing the same source code to work in several browsers  no more browser feature snifﬁng and resulting browser-dependent code .    Functions libraries that abstract the sometimes-obtuse, arcane, and inconvenient W3C DOM programming model into a conve- nient, parsimonious, efﬁcient interface.    Functions libraries that ﬁx several gross browser errors such as memory leaks; others that provide functionality likely to be avail- able natively in the browser in a few years—today!    A library of arguably the largest single set of HTML widgets avail-  able today.    A module system coupled with a build system that lets you divide code into small, manageable chunks during development and later package the release system for optimal download performance— without any modiﬁcations to the source code. The build system even lets you slice and dice Dojo itself in a way that’s optimal for your project.    Independent libraries  that is, you can load them on demand  that  implement several other advanced capabilities.  Several of the libraries result in frameworks for the following:    Building custom HTML widgets    Internationalization  i18n     Localization  l10n     Accessibility  a11y   Dojo also includes a utility application called the build system that packages large projects that may include hundreds of ﬁles into small, optimal sets of compressed ﬁles for deployment on production servers.   KEY ASPECTS OF DOJO  13  At the time of this writing, Dojo ofﬁcially supports Internet Explorer  6+ , Firefox  1.5+ , Safari  3+ , and Opera  9+, Dijit doesn’t support Opera .  Since Dojo is pure JavaScript, it can be used in nonbrowser, Spider- Monkey-embedded, and Rhino-embedded environments. Of course, much of Dojo—anything that leverages HTML, CSS, and or XHR—is not applicable in these environments. Still, there is an inner core of functionality that is useful. The loader, language extensions, asynchro- nous programming, object-oriented programming, and Common Locale Data Repository functionality depend upon nothing but JavaScript and can be used in these nonbrowser environments.3  Dojo Targets a Wide Audience  Dojo aggressively targets a broad range of users, from designers of sim- ple web sites through enterprise application developers. This is a very tough requirement to get right since design decisions that are optimal for one group are often less so for another. Most “web design” tasks can be accomplished by simply loading the script dojo.js. In this respect, Dojo is as lightweight and easy to use as the best competing libraries. On the other hand, larger projects require more. Dojo includes machin- ery to load different function families upon demand. This design gives Dojo users the luxury of digesting exactly as much complexity as they need to solve the problem at hand.  Dojo Targets the Future  The state of the browser-based programming environment is another major force behind Dojo’s philosophy and content. If the browsers were standards-compliant  or, at least compatible , if JavaScript and the DOM API ﬁxed some glaring shortcomings, and if HTML included user interface controls more modern than 1989, then much of Dojo wouldn’t be required. The architects of Dojo recognize that, eventually, these defects will be ﬁxed. And when native functionality becomes available, you’ll want to use it rather than a scripted alternative. Dojo was created to solve key defects in the browser-based programming environment so that modern, highly capable programs  indeed, programs rivaling native applications  can be targeted to the browser—while preparing for a for- ward upgrade path as the native browser environment improves.  3. Using Dojo outside the browser is beyond the scope of this book.   KEY ASPECTS OF DOJO  14  Since browsers won’t be ﬁxed in a single ﬂash, Dojo’s modular design can hook into these facilities directly—on a per-facility per-browser level—as they become available. In short, Dojo provides a stable, browser-based programming environment, even as we enter the next round of browser wars.  Dojo Is Open Source  The source code is free and available. It is dual-licensed under either the terms of the modiﬁed BSD license or the Academic Free License version 2.1. The BSD license is very friendly to commercial products; it allows you to use or modify Dojo in your own commercial products without any requirement to open source anything that you do. Nat- urally, you can change whatever you want for such products.  Heck, under the BSD license, you could sell unmodiﬁed copies of Dojo.   The development process is rigorous and open. Source code is main- tained in an SVN repository; defects and enhancements are tracked by Trac. Anonymous access is available to both. Coding style guide- lines are enforced, and code must be accompanied by unit tests prior to inclusion in the key release sets.  There are avenues of free support through forums and mailing lists as well as companies that provide for-fee services.  Unlike many open source projects, Dojo is backed by a foundation. The Dojo Foundation is a 501 c  6  nonproﬁt organized to help promote the adoption of Dojo and to provide a healthy environment for JavaScript engineering of every stripe. One of the key beneﬁts that the foundation affords is the ability to insulate users from hidden liabilities  for exam- ple, patent or copyright infringement  regarding the use of the code.  All things Dojo discussed here start at http:  dojotoolkit.org .  Dojo Is Divided Into Three Projects  Dojo includes three projects:    Dojo: The foundation upon which everything else is built. Alto- gether, it includes about ﬁfty JavaScript scripts and several other resources that handle browser normalization, JavaScript modu- larization, extensions to the core JavaScript library, extensions to the W3C DOM API  including a parsing and querying the DOM , remote scripting, Firebug Lite, drag and drop, a data store API,   USING THE BOOK  15  localization and internationalization, and a few other miscella- neous functions.    Dijit: The Dojo widget framework and built-in widgets  about forty  HTML user interface widgets .    Dojox: Dojo extensions. This includes everything from the grid widget to graphics libraries. Dojox is the Wild West of Dojo—there are some very sophisticated and stable libraries that are currently deployed in real-world, for-proﬁt systems as well as some com- pletely experimental systems. Each library includes a readme that describes the project.  Each of these three projects resides in its own source code tree. Typi- cally Dojo and Dijit coordinate releases; so far, Dojox has released with Dojo and Dijit, but this may change in future releases. We’ll cover Dojo and Dijit exhaustively in this book while only touching on a couple Dojox projects.  Dojo Has a High Degree of Conceptual Integrity  Despite the size of Dojo, the design and implementation possess a high degree of conceptual integrity. In Fred Brooks’ classical software engineering tome The Mythical Man-Month [Bro95], Brooks postulates that conceptual integrity  the ratio of functionality to complexity  is the most important attribute of any programming project. This is a well- established and frequently missing attribute of long-lived software. We already noted that beating down complexity is one of the Dojo project’s core values. Further, the Dojo and Dijit project trees are each man- aged by a single individual who guides and coordinates project evolu- tion. This fulﬁlls another of Brooks’ requirements to achieve conceptual integrity—designating a single system architect. Finally, as we explore Dojo, you’ll see that it just feels right. It seems to surprise the least...to be natural.4 All of these are attributes of high conceptual integrity.  1.2 Using the Book  Here are a few last preliminary remarks that will help you maximize the value of the book.  4. Although Dojo is mature, like any signiﬁcant software system, it isn’t perfect. We’ll occasionally point out weaknesses.   USING THE BOOK  16  Assumptions  We assume you have at least some minimal web programming experi- ence. Dojo builds on top of standards-based technologies, most notably,  X HTML, CSS, DOM, and JavaScript. Although we’ll often provide a few orienting remarks on an underlying technology when discussing a particular Dojo functional area, we will not attempt to teach these technologies—that’s at least four more books! In case you are fairly new to all of this, here are some recommendations:    Yahoo has published an excellent set of lectures about JavaScript  and DOM programming by Douglas Crockford.5    The canonical JavaScript reference is JavaScript: The Deﬁnitive Guide [Fla06]. It also includes a very good DOM tutorial and ref- erence.    CSS is often arcane and obtuse. Cascading Style Sheets: The Deﬁn- itive Guide [Mey06] makes a good attempt, but there are several other references with different strengths and weaknesses.    On the other hand, HTML is fairly simple to grasp. HTML and XHTML: The Deﬁnitive Guide [MK08] is a nice reference, but any number of free, online references are also probably sufﬁcient.  JavaScript is a great language. Contrary to popular—and very mis- informed—belief, it is closer to Lisp than BASIC. It allows you to express very powerful ideas quickly and with elegance. Dojo pushes JavaScript hard; so will we.  The Example Code  We’ve constructed real, working examples throughout the book. We’ve tried to ﬁnd a good balance between including enough code in line with the narrative so that you can understand the code but not so much that the ﬂow is interrupted with pages of code. If you ﬁnd that a particular code fragment is missing some detail that you ﬁnd perplexing, you can ﬁnd the complete working examples online at http:  www.pragprog.com  titles rgdojo source_code.  5. http:  yuiblog.com blog 2007 01 24 video-crockford-tjpl, http:  yuiblog.com blog 2006 11 27 video-crockford-advjs , and http:  yuiblog.com blog 2006 10 20 video-crockford-domtheory    ACKNOWLEDGMENTS  17  Debugging  Web programming is a very dynamic activity. Typically, you’ll write a few lines, hit Refresh in your browser, and see what happens. Still, a good debugging environment is critical to maximize programmer efﬁciency. Since Firefox + Firebug are among the best options  and they’re free! , we use them in the narrative. If you’re using something other than Firefox  for example, Internet Explorer , then you probably already have a good debugging environment scoped out. If not, Dojo includes the Firebug Lite console that you can use with any browser. See the Alex Says. . . , on page 79 for more debugging advice from Alex.  The Plan  The book is divided into four parts. Part I demonstrates how Dojo helps you build powerful apps quickly and easily. These chapters include complete details on the examples they present, but they intentionally do not dissect the areas of Dojo they touch. Part II gives an exten- sive exploration of Dojo Core—the foundation upon which all things Dojo are built. Part III covers Dijit, the Dojo widget system, and Part IV demonstrates how to construct a Rich Internet Application.  1.3 Acknowledgments  Above all, the three of us would like to recognize and thank the Dojo contributors. Without such a dedicated and truly talented community Dojo simply wouldn’t be. We hope this book reﬂects well upon their her- culean efforts. We also owe special thanks to Bill Keese, Adam Peller, Ian Dees, and Brian Reeve for taking the time to read and critique the manuscript. Nearly every page includes improvements recommended by these experts. Finally, a tip of the hat to the folks at Pragmatic Programmers—clearly a publisher by programmers for programmers. Thanks for giving us the opportunity and all of the support along the way. —Rawld, Craig, and Alex  I would like to especially thank my coauthors, Craig and Alex, and the development editor, Jackie. What a wonderful set of people to work with, each highly skilled in completely different ways, all helping me get out a better product. —Rawld  At the risk of sounding like a long Academy Awards speech, I would like to thank my writing teachers Carolyn Goodwin, James Alsop, Gerry Shapiro, and Judith Sornberger. They encouraged me to keep writing,   ACKNOWLEDGMENTS  18  even though the last thing the world wants is another writer. And to Kathy, thank you for the Starbucks card, your love, and your limitless patience that made this book possible. If life were fair, the ﬁrst pub- lished book between us would’ve been yours. —Craig  First, I’d like to thank Craig and Rawld, whose book this really is. Their dedication, talent, and willingness to plumb the deepest depths of Dojo has produced a book whose quality and clarity will be an asset to Dojo developers for years to come. I feel lucky to have had the opportunity to contribute in the small ways that I have to this effort. Rawld, Craig, and Jackie Carter have made the process easier than I could have possibly imagined. My humblest thanks to them.  I’d like to thank the contributors and committers who have made Dojo the outstanding achievement that it is.

They split long forms into tabbed pages, wrote validators to check input, and developed easy-to-use con- trols such as date entry calendars. These features are so prevalent now that users don’t think twice about them. But you do. They’re still not native features in HTML, so you must either write your own compo- nents or shoehorn someone else’s into your application.  There’s an easier way. Dijit, the widget system built on Dojo, can do the heavy lifting for you. A widget, also called a Dijit component, is a user interface control built from HTML and JavaScript. You create one by adding a simple dojoType= attribute to an HTML tag. It’s a remarkably simple way to add form functionality.  dojoType= is nonstandard HTML, but Dijit uses the attribute to endow special features onto the enclosing tag. This is called a declarative wid- get because you write no actual code for it. But you can create the same widgets through JavaScript, a subject we’ll touch on in Chap- ter 12, Scripting Widgets, on page 319. These are called programmatic widgets. For the next couple chapters, we’ll use only declarative widgets because of their simple learning curve.  There are widgets to control layout and validate input. There are wid- gets that emulate native application controls such as sliders, tooltips, and progress bars. There are widgets to model complex data such as hierarchical trees and tables. Dijit comes with more than forty pre- packaged widgets, and many work well without a stitch of extra Java- Script!   WHAT CUSTOMERS ARE SAYING ABOUT YOUR FORM  21  In this chapter, we will take a traditional ﬁll-and-submit form and turn it into a more functional, intuitive, and feature-rich form. We’ll “super- size” the regular HTML controls into Dijit components, adding tons of useful functionality with almost zero programming. When we’re done, you’ll have a form that’s so neat and functional that you’ll want to tape a copy of it to your refrigerator.  Dijit components solve common web design issues, and you can drop them in and make them work in a matter of minutes. And that’s good, because you have a problem form on your hands. . .  2.1 What Customers Are Saying About Your Form  So, let’s talk about that web page. You know the one. It’s where sub- scribers change their address, look up their order information, manage their subscription preferences, and so on. It’s called Account Prefer- ences or My Account or something like that.  You know that page? Well. . . people hate it.  No one told you? Of course not. It’s easier to mutter under your breath than send a comment to “Contact Us.” Here’s what they’re saying:    Customer Looking for Their Order History: “OK, phone number, phone number. Where is it? [scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll] Oh, here it is. Way down at the bottom. Nice.”    Customer Service Representative: “Oh, great. Someone typed Rover as their email address. Stupid web server. Doesn’t it know all email addresses have an @ sign?”  Hmmm. Your form has an attitude problem. Fortunately, Dijit is here to help. Its layout, veriﬁcation, and user interface elements will solve these problems, and the overall design will be much prettier to boot. So, what are we waiting for? The sooner we get it installed, the sooner we can get started!  2.2 Installing Dojo on Your Own Server  Dojo is a client-side JavaScript toolkit, and its heart lies in some well- tuned JavaScript scripts. In a Dojo-based web application, you create small bits of HTML and JavaScript that call the Dojo toolkit code.  Technically, Dojo doesn’t need a web server. You can install Dojo into any directory, build Dojo-based web applications, and load them all   ADDING DOJO AND DIJIT TO A PAGE  22  with the ﬁle:   protocol. But a web server lets you do more interest- ing things such as proxying  introduced in the sidebar on page 48  and partitioning  in Section 10.3, Partitioning with QueryReadStore, on page 272 . For that reason, we recommend installing a web server ﬁrst—and here, you can choose any one that ﬁts your needs. Dojo is stubbornly server-agnostic. There are no special procedures for serving it from a Windows, Linux, or Mac OS X server.  You can download the latest Dojo package from http:  dojotoolkit.org. It comes bundled with Dojo, all the Dijit components, the extension com- ponents of Dojox, and utilities such as the DOH unit tester and the ShrinkSafe source code compressor.1 Follow the directions for expand- ing the .zip or .tar.gz ﬁle on your computer. If you know what you’re doing, you can pick any directory you want for installation. This book’s example code assumes the ﬁles are in the  dojoroot directory on your web server. The Dojo archive ﬁle contains four directories: dojo, dijit, dojox, and util.  Finally, if you’re picky about such details like “Did I install it right?” then simply hit the URL http:  yourserver.com dojoroot dojo tests runTests. html. This will run Dojo through a battery of unit tests.  We should note here that for serving dynamic content from your own data sources, you’ll need to use a server-based programming language such as PHP, ASP, or JSP. Since our focus here is Dojo, the examples in this book are server-agnostic. Instead, we’ll hook either to third-party data sources, such as Yahoo, or to static ﬁles that emulate dynamic data sources.  2.3 Adding Dojo and Dijit to a Page  Dojo and Dijit act much like other JavaScript libraries. You add a few statements to the top of each page, and these statements transfer the Dojo Dijit JavaScript code to the browser. Below those statements, you can call Dojo methods and or use Dijit components. Dijit components rely on Dojo methods, but the loading processes handle all the depen- dencies for you.  You must add a few statements to the   and   sections of each page to accomplish that. Fortunately, the statements are fairly  1. This is the “binary distribution” of Dojo. You can also download the entire source version, which allows you to do custom builds. We explain the other differences in Sec- tion 4.2, Getting the Source, on page 77.   ADDING DOJO AND DIJIT TO A PAGE  23  boilerplate. You can add these statements to a text editor template ﬁle, a macro, or a snippet within easy reach. Or, if your site uses a standard include ﬁle, you can place the boilerplate in that ﬁle. In short, you need to do the following:  1. Add the standard Dojo headers to the   section. 2. Set the class for the   tag to a Dijit theme. 3. Add dojo.require statements for the components you need.  If you are using Dojo without Dijit, some of these steps can be elim- inated or reduced. We’ll note where you can do this. But there’s no harm, except for a small increase in load time, in including all of them. So, let’s begin.  Step 1: Add the Standard Dojo Headers  The following statements load the Dojo toolkit and style sheets from your server:  Download advanced_forms_made_easy hello_dojo_world.html     @import " dojoroot dijit themes tundra tundra.css"; @import " dojoroot dojo resources dojo.css"    <script type="text javascript" src=" dojoroot dojo dojo.js"  djConfig="parseOnLoad: true">   The @import rule loads the standard Dojo styles and the theme Tun- dra. In Dijit terminology, a theme is a set of fonts, colors, and siz- ing settings for components so they look good together. Three themes come prepackaged with Dijit—Tundra, Soria, and Nihilo—and you can develop your own themes as well, a process we describe in Chapter 16, Dijit Themes, Design, and Layout, on page 428. You must always import dojo.css, but if you’re using Dojo without Dijit, you can omit the theme style sheet import.  The   tag pulls the Dojo code from your server. The djCon- ﬁg="parseOnLoad:true" attribute is required to use Dojo elements declar- atively. The declarative vs. programmatic distinction in Dojo is one we’ll cover throughout the book, but for now we’ll be using just declarative widgets because they’re easier to learn. If you can’t wait for the details, see the sidebar on the following page.   ADDING DOJO AND DIJIT TO A PAGE  24  Declarative vs. Programmatic: A Preview for the Impatient  You can create Dijit widgets declaratively or programmatically. In a nutshell, declarative widgets are nestled in HTML like this:  Download advanced_forms_made_easy declarative_vs_programmatic.html  <div dojoType="dijit.layout.ContentPane" href="http:  www.yahoo.com" >   Programmatic widgets are built from JavaScript like this:  Download advanced_forms_made_easy declarative_vs_programmatic.html  var programmaticPane =  new dijit.layout.ContentPane   { href: 'http:  www.yahoo.com' }   ;  Declarative widgets use nonstandard HTML attributes such as dojoType=. Although this may bother purists, the utility of declar- ative widgets makes them an acceptable trade-off.∗  So, with that said, declarative is the easiest method for using Dijit and the one we’ll use for most of the book. In Chap- ter 12, Scripting Widgets, on page 319, we’ll see program- matic Dijit components. If you use only programmatic Dijit or use plain Dojo without Dijit, you don’t need dojo.parser or djCon- ﬁg="parseOnLoad:true". Omitting them makes the page load a smidge faster.  ∗. Not convinced? See the Alex Says. . . , on page 81 for an explanation of nonstandard attributes and their role in Dojo.  Step 2: Set the Class of the Body  Next, you set the class of the body to match the theme. In our case, we’re using Tundra, so we add the following:  Download advanced_forms_made_easy hello_dojo_world.html       The class name will match the theme name in lowercase: tundra, soria, or nihilo.  The a11y theme is autoapplied under certain conditions that you’ll learn about in Section 16.3, A11y and Themes, on page 440.   You might ask, “Why do I need to specify my theme here? I loaded it in the style sheet.” The biggest reason is that Dojo doesn’t per-   ADDING DOJO AND DIJIT TO A PAGE  25  form “magic.” Simply including something in the page shouldn’t have huge side effects, and every modiﬁcation of your page should be at your control. By scoping theme rules to the tundra  or other theme- appropriate  preﬁx, Dijit puts you in control. Second, placing the theme in the   tag partitions the styles into a neat namespace hierar- chy. We’ll show you how this works in Section 16.1, Theme Structure, on page 428.  The theme is used for Dijit components only. If you’re using Dojo with- out Dijit, you can omit loading it.  Step 3: Add dojo.require Statements  Dojo and Dijit components, like big treasures, come in small packages; they’re called modules, and you will need to include a dojo.require for each module referenced in your page. dojo.require acts like require_once in PHP or require in Ruby.  You add code like this to the   section:  Download advanced_forms_made_easy hello_dojo_world.html    dojo.require "dojo.parser" ; dojo.require "dijit.layout.ContentPane" ;     The dojo.parser module is required for all pages using declarative Dijit.  See the sidebar on the previous page for details.  Then you load the dijit.layout.ContentPane module, required to draw Dijit content panes. Dojo modules correspond roughly to JavaScript ﬁles under  dojoroot. For example, requiring dijit.layout.TabContainer loads the JavaScript script  dojoroot dijit layout TabContainer.js. The story is more complex, as we’ll see in Chapter 4, Dojo In Depth, on page 71, but this is the general idea.  dojo.require is one of the most important functions in Dojo. But how do you know which modules to include? In this book, we’ll always intro- duce a new component or Dojo API, say the Date API, with its module name, for example, dojo.date. These module names are also shown in the Dojo online API guide at http:  dojotoolkit.org api.  You will be applying these three steps to every page using Dojo or Dijit. Once the browser loads the theme style sheet and executes the Dojo script, processes the dojo.require statements, and sets the   class, you’re ready to roll. Meanwhile back on our Account Preferences form, we have problems to solve.   LAYING OUT THE FORM  26  Figure 2.1: Our form before adding dijit  2.4 Laying Out the Form  In Figure 2.1, you can see Account Preferences as it exists now. The form is too long, and users hate scrolling through it. It would be eas- ier to use if the ﬁelds were presented in logical groups. We will do that by using the Dijit components dijit.layout.ContentPane, a widget that separates parts of a page, and dijit.layout.TabContainer, which adds tabs to them.  Tabs along the top will group the form into sections: Personal Data, Address, and so on. Only one tab shows at a time. Clicking a tab label on the top brings the corresponding section to the front. It looks like a ﬁle cabinet—intuitive and friendly.  Preparing the Page  To get to the tabbed interface, we must ﬁrst add Dojo and Dijit to the page, as outlined in the previous section.   LAYING OUT THE FORM  27  First, add the   and   tags:  Download advanced_forms_made_easy form_with_dijit.html  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional  EN"  "http:  www.w3.org TR html4 loose.dtd">         Account Preferences With Dijit     @import " dojoroot dijit themes tundra tundra.css"; @import " dojoroot dojo resources dojo.css"    <script type="text javascript" src=" dojoroot dojo dojo.js"  djConfig="parseOnLoad: true">    The lines marked with a triangle in the margin are the ones we added.  Then, add the   class for the theme, which is tundra in our case.  Download advanced_forms_made_easy form_with_dijit.html     Finally, add the dojo.require statements. In this case, the page needs the dijit.layout.TabContainer and dijit.layout.ContentPane components:  Download advanced_forms_made_easy form_with_dijit.html     dojo.require "dojo.parser" ; dojo.require "dijit.layout.ContentPane" ; dojo.require "dijit.layout.TabContainer" ;      .formContainer {  width:600px; height:600px;  width:150px; float:left;  } label {  }       The styles will line up the labels and textboxes we will add in a sec- ond. With the preliminaries out of the way, we can now add our Dijit components.   LAYING OUT THE FORM  28  Organizing the Form with Tabs  In Dijit, “adding a component” really means “adding the dojoType= at- tribute to an HTML tag.” Dijit components nestle right inside your HTML code. Most components begin life as   tags, but others are built on  ,  , or other tags.  The two components we need, again, are as follows:    A dijit.layout.ContentPane, which holds one “tabful” of data. Each  ContentPane has a label that appears on the tab.    A dijit.layout.TabContainer, which holds a group of ContentPanes.  To turn a form fragment into a ContentPane, just surround it with   tags and specify a dojoType= of dijit.layout.ContentPane, like this:  Download advanced_forms_made_easy form_with_dijit.html      First Name:  <input type="text" name="first_name" id="first_name"  size="30"  >    Last Name:  <input type="text" name="last_name" id="last_name"  size="30"  >    Middle Initial:  <input type="text" name="middle_initial" id="middle_initial"  size="1"  >      Then repeat this for all the tabs:  Download advanced_forms_made_easy form_with_dijit.html      Address Line 1:  <input type="text" name="address_line_1" id="address_line_1"  size="30"  >    Address Line 2:  <input type="text" name="address_line_2" id="address_line_2"  size="30"  >    City:  <input type="text" name="city" id="city"  size="30"  >    State:  <input type="text" name="state" id="state"  size="2"  >    Postal Code:  <input type="text" name="postal_code" id="postal_code"  size="15"  >    Country:  <input type="text" name="country" id="country"  size="30"  >    LAYING OUT THE FORM  29   Date of Move to this Address:  <input type="text" name="date_move" id="date_move"  size="11"  >         Home Phone:  <input type="text" name="home_phone" id="home_phone"   Work Phone:  <input type="text" name="work_phone" id="work_phone"  size="30"  >   size="30"  >    Cell Phone:  <input type="text" name="cell_phone" id="cell_phone"  size="30"  >      Wrap up these panes in a   with dijit.layout.TabContainer:  Download advanced_forms_made_easy form_with_dijit.html  <div class="formContainer" dojoType="dijit.layout.TabContainer"  style="width:600px;height:600px">  Notice the height style on the TabContainer. That’s required, and if you leave it off, the tabs will not appear at all.  Consider yourself warned!  The width, on the other hand, is optional.  So, let’s get this party started! Download the code, and place it into a new directory called dojobook advanced_forms_made_easy. Fire up your favorite browser, and hit the URL http:  yourserver dojobook advanced_ forms_made_easy form_with_dijit.html. Up pops your tabbed form, which should like Figure 2.2, on the following page.  It looks and works great! Click a tab, and the data pops out in front. The Tundra theme makes the design elements look good. It acts like you’d expect. What would have taken you hours to code in JavaScript takes just a few   tags and two JavaScript statements.  Something Wrong?  Things happen. The most common novice problem is seeing no for- matting appear so that our form looks more like the form we started with—see Figure 2.1, on page 26. If this is you and you’re using Inter- net Explorer, you probably also saw a script error pop up or a Script Error icon in the browser’s lower-right corner. If you’re running Firefox with the JavaScript console open, you probably saw the error there. But when things go wrong, you could use some industrial-strength help.   LAYING OUT THE FORM  30  Figure 2.2: A tabbed container  Enter Firebug. Firebug is a combination debugger, DOM viewer, console logger, and proﬁler. The full version is an open source Firefox extension, and to install it in Firefox, simply visit http:  www.getﬁrebug.com and click the Install button.  But if you use Internet Explorer or Safari, never fear! Dojo comes pack- aged with Firebug Lite, which includes the more useful features of Fire- bug. To turn on Firebug Lite, simply change your script-loading state- ment to the following:  <script type="text javascript" src=" dojoroot dojo dojo.js"  djConfig="parseOnLoad: true, isDebug: true">   Firebug Lite will appear in the browser window unlike Firebug, which keeps itself hidden. So, you’ll want to turn the isDebug ﬂag off in pro- duction apps.  When running Firebug or Firebug Lite, you get a bit more information on the console, as shown in Figure 2.3, on the following page.  Here, it looks like whatever statements are referencing dijit.layout. TabbedContainer are wrong. Taking a quick look into the directory  dojo- root dijit layout, you see TabContainer.js, not TabbedContainer.js. That’s the problem. We’re trying to use TabbedContainer instead of TabContainer.  If there is still no formatting but no errors in the console either, check these things:    Make sure your dojoType= attributes are correct. Case matters  here.    Double-check the   tag to make sure it has class="tundra".   IMPROVED FORM CONTROLS  31  Figure 2.3: Firebug ﬁnds the problem.    Double-check the   tag to ensure you’re loading the Tundra  CSS from the correct place.  Once you have that working, step back and take a look at your new tabbed form. It cuts a very ﬁne ﬁgure, indeed! And easy to use? Abso- lutely! And this is only the beginning.  2.5 Improved Form Controls  Getting back to our problem form, one issue concerns bad data. A little behavioral psychology on the user will help: make the good choices easy to pick and the bad choices difﬁcult. Unfortunately, HTML controls go for the lowest common denominator, leaving choices wide open. Dijit’s validation controls can ﬁx that. Controls like dijit.form.ValidationTextBox ﬂag the unacceptable choices immediately. Finally, input helpers such as dijit.form.DateTextBox make choosing dates very easy.  Validating Fields  Client-side data validation is win-win: it helps you by keeping the data clean and helps the user by giving immediate, targeted feedback. In fact, validation is so useful that it was one of JavaScript’s ﬁrst and most popular applications. Dijit goes one step further by making popular validations available via HTML attributes with no visible JavaScript.  We need some data cleanliness, so let’s start with the ﬁelds on the Per- sonal Data tab. First start with a regular   or   tag. Add a dojoType= attribute of dijit.form.ValidationTextBox. Then add valida- tions and ﬁeld-cleansing attributes:  Download advanced_forms_made_easy validating.html   First Name:  <input type="text" name="first_name" id="first_name"  dojoType="dijit.form.ValidationTextBox" trim="true" propercase="true" required="true" size="30" missingMessage="You must enter your first name"  >    IMPROVED FORM CONTROLS  32  Alex Says. . .  Debugging Tools  it would be this:  start with Firebug  get  I were allowed to give but one piece of debugging If advice, it at http:  www.getﬁrebug.com  . For a long time the development tools for doing development in a browser were so poor as to be laughable. Luckily, Firebug has almost single-handedly dragged the state of the art forward by a tremendous amount. As a response to Firebug, new versions of Internet Explorer, Opera, and Safari are all beginning to include improved debugging facilities. Despite this renewed arms race for devel- oper mind-share, Firebug remains the gold standard.  Perhaps the most compelling feature of Firebug is its JavaScript console. Firebug exposes APIs for logging events from pages that you may be interacting with, but the console builds on that to let you type or paste in some JavaScript and execute it on-the-ﬂy. This lets you "poke around" the environment ﬂuidly, often drastically shortening the time it takes to prototype a new feature or debug a problematic one. Firebug’s DOM tree, CSS style, and layout exploration tools are so convenient that they frequently eliminate the need to dump messages and objects to the console or to programmatically change properties and styles. Finally, Firebug sports a full-featured JavaScript debugger with complete stack and variable inspection, breakpoint, and stepping functionality. In fact, we’re so enamored of Firebug that Dojo includes a beefed-up version of “Firebug Lite” as part of the toolkit to give you a console on browsers that otherwise wouldn’t provide one.   IMPROVED FORM CONTROLS  33  And don’t forget to add dojo.require to the header:  Download advanced_forms_made_easy validating.html  dojo.require "dijit.form.ValidationTextBox" ;  These extra attributes do an incredible amount of work:    required="true" makes the ﬁeld required, of course. When the ﬁeld is blank, the background is colored yellow, as is the case with any erroneous ﬁelds.    trim="true" automatically removes leading and trailing spaces in the input. So when you type a string and tab out of the ﬁeld, the spaces are trimmed.    propercase="true" is similar to trim. When the box loses focus, the  ﬁrst letter is capitalized, and the rest are lowercased.  In a similar vein, we can validate the email address with Validation- TextBox’s regular expression option:  Download advanced_forms_made_easy validating.html   Email:  <input type="text" name="email" id="email" size="30"  dojoType="dijit.form.ValidationTextBox" regExp=".*@.*"   >  Here you have the full power of JavaScript regular expressions. In our case, .*@.* matches all strings with any preﬁx  including an empty string , then @, and then any sufﬁx.  ValidationTextBox has many other kinds of validation, which we’ll cover in Chapter 15, Form Controls, on page 394. As powerful as Dijit validation is, however, it should always be backed up with server-side validations. That way, bad people cannot introduce bad data by merely turning off JavaScript.  Easier Date Entry  How many ways can you specify a date? No one really knew until HTML forms were invented—evidently, the answer is “millions of ways.” Of course, we’d much rather have consistently formatted dates, and users would rather have easier ways to pick them.  With Dijit, you use dijit.form.DateTextBox to turn any textbox into a widget with a calendar. First, add it to the header:  Download advanced_forms_made_easy validating.html  dojo.require "dijit.form.DateTextBox" ;   WRAPPING IT UP  34  Figure 2.4: Dijit DateTextBox  Then, add it to the textbox:  Download advanced_forms_made_easy validating.html   Date of Move to this Address:  <input type="text" name="date_move" id="date_move" size="11"  dojoType="dijit.form.DateTextBox"  >   By clicking the textbox, the user can unfold a calendar underneath. In Figure 2.4, you can see the DateTextBox in its open state.  DateTextBox also respects the value= attribute of the textbox, provided it is in ISO date format, which we’ll cover in Section 15.4, Standard Form, on page 410.  2.6 Wrapping It Up  Well, that was a rush! Here’s the form source code we’ve built bit by bit:  Download advanced_forms_made_easy ﬁnished_form.html  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional  EN"  "http:  www.w3.org TR html4 loose.dtd">         Account Preferences Final Form     @import " dojoroot dijit themes tundra tundra.css"; @import " dojoroot dojo resources dojo.css"    <script type="text javascript" src=" dojoroot dojo dojo.js"  djConfig="parseOnLoad: true">    WRAPPING IT UP  35     dojo.require "dojo.parser" ; dojo.require "dijit.layout.ContentPane" ; dojo.require "dijit.layout.TabContainer" ; dojo.require "dijit.form.ValidationTextBox" ; dojo.require "dijit.form.DateTextBox" ;      .formContainer {  width:600px; height:600px;  } label {  }    width:150px; float:left;             First Name:  <input type="text" name="first_name" id="first_name"  dojoType="dijit.form.ValidationTextBox" trim="true" propercase="true" required="true" size="30" missingMessage="You must enter your first name"  >    Last Name:  <input type="text" name="last_name" id="last_name" size="30"  dojoType="dijit.form.ValidationTextBox" trim="true" propercase="true" required="true" length="30" missingMessage="You must enter your last name" >    Middle Initial:  <input type="text" name="middle_initial" id="middle_initial"  size="1"  >    Email:  <input type="text" name="email" id="email" size="30"  dojoType="dijit.form.ValidationTextBox" regExp=".*@.*"   >       Address Line 1:  <input type="text" name="address_line_1" id="address_line_1"   Address Line 2:  <input type="text" name="address_line_2" id="address_line_2"  size="30"  >   size="30"  >    City:      State:    WRAPPING IT UP  36      Postal Code:  <input type="text" name="postal_code" id="postal_code"  size="15"  >    Country:      Date of Move to this Address:  <input type="text" name="date_move" id="date_move" size="11"  dojoType="dijit.form.DateTextBox"  >         Home Phone:  <input type="text" name="home_phone" id="home_phone"   Work Phone:  <input type="text" name="work_phone" id="work_phone"   Cell Phone:  <input type="text" name="cell_phone" id="cell_phone"  size="30"  >   size="30"  >   size="30"  >            This form is easier to navigate, is easier for adding data, and is patient but ﬁrm about accepting good data. Yet it takes only a few lines of JavaScript and some extra HTML attributes. Dijit is a very powerful thing indeed! Out of the entire Dijit catalog of more than forty widgets, you now know four of them:    dijit.layout.ContentPane creates boundaries around content to place  in containers.    dijit.layout.TabContainer stacks ContentPanes on top of one another  and lets the user choose one with tabs on the top.    dijit.form.ValidationTextBox performs validations on individual con-  trols.    dijit.form.DateTextBox adds a pop-up calendar to a textbox.  All of this takes place without any extra server communication. In the next chapter, we’ll leave Dijit for a bit and see how Dojo can create small, chatty conversations with servers—your own or someone else’s.   Chapter 3  Connecting to Outside Services  In the previous chapter, we used Dijit to improve the user-to-browser experience. Now we’re going to go the other direction: from the browser to the server. Ajax, or Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, uses this communication path to free the browser from the shackles of form submission and the tedium of constant page redrawing. This, in turn, improves the user interface, making web apps look and behave more like regular programs.  3.1 Dojo Remote Scripting  Google Maps was to Ajax what Elvis Presley was to rock ’n’ roll. Unlike the popular map programs of the time such as MapQuest, Google Maps could scroll in any direction, zoom in, and place markers all without the ﬂicker of a page submit. Users loved it! Developers, eager to please users and show their prowess, immediately dug into the details of Xml- HttpRequest, or XHR.  But here’s the thing: XHR is hard! Or more accurately, XHR is easy to use naively but hard to use correctly. Some of its many weirdisms include the following:    An unfamiliar syntax. Many developers simply copied and pasted XHR code snippets but had no idea what the code was doing. That makes debugging. . . ehhhhh, not so fun.    Poor handling of content types. Though XHR is supposed to speak XML ﬂuently, you could hand back valid XML from the server and still get a head-scratching “Not valid XML” message from XHR.   DOJO REMOTE SCRIPTING  38    No help in creating the parameter string. You had to do all the URL encoding yourself, or perhaps you didn’t do it at all. . . and the ﬁrst & in a textbox broke your application.  But don’t worry. XHR may have saved the Internet, but Dojo will save you from XHR!  Dojo’s remote scripting facilities enable a client-side script to communi- cate with a server without a page reload. Remote scripting’s easy-to-use XHR and pseudo-XHR APIs extend the walls of the application, reach- ing out to services from your own server and beyond. And Dojo does all this without excessive JavaScript on your part. Dojo and Dijit provide control and data translation services layered on top of XHR, making it easy to use. In this chapter, we’ll look at three Dojo techniques for service connections:    dojo.data is an API speciﬁcation like JDBC or ODBC. A dojo.data driver implements this speciﬁcation and responds to requests from your data-enabled widgets or JavaScript code. Traditionally, each driver is in charge of a different data provider format, for example, JavaScript Object Notation  JSON  or XML. But it could also abstract a web service or an in-memory JavaScript object. You use common APIs to read or write the data, no matter what the source and format is.    The dojo.io.script method accesses JSON with Padding  JSONP  ser- vices in other domains.1 XHR must follow the same-origin rule— you can call only those services housed on the same server as the outer page. JSONP removes this restriction in a clever way by using   tags. More and more web services from Yahoo and Google are available in JSONP format, and dojo.io.script calls them in a way that mimics XHR.    The dojo.xhrGet, dojo.xhrPost, dojo.rawXhrPost, dojo.xhrPut, dojo. rawXhrPut, dojo.xhrDelete, and dojo.xhr methods are the lowest-level remote scripting services. These methods, collectively called dojo. xhr*, don’t provide the common API layer and translation services that dojo.data does. They also require a server-side proxy to call services outside your domain. But dojo.xhr* works without writing  JSONP  acronym  1.

They are best for off-site services that don’t support JSONP.  Generally, dojo.data is the most sophisticated of the three. Its drivers are built on the dojo.io.script and dojo.xhr* methods. If you’re already used to XHR, the latter two methods will feel more familiar. All of these methods require ﬂuency with less-common JavaScript idioms such as hashes and function literals, so we’ll take a slight detour to learn those ﬁrst. Then we’ll build three working examples: a grid of wish-list entries, a list of Yahoo Search matches, and a web service for gathering reviews.  3.2 JavaScript Idioms for Calling XHR  Before we plunge into calling web services, we need to look at some JavaScript features that are used in Dojo XHR but are less common in the real world. They may look unfamiliar to you even if you have used JavaScript for a while. But they will be extremely useful here and down the road.  Literals and Hashes  A literal is a notation for a ﬁxed value in source code. So in JavaScript, "Foo" is a string literal, 1 is a number literal, and [1, 2, 3] is an Array literal. Literals are the atoms of a particular JavaScript type.  A hash is a collection of name-value pairs called properties. Each prop- erty name can be used only once in a hash. So, you can have the prop- erties  "bun", "wheat"  and  "burger", "beef"  in the same hash, but not both  "bun", "wheat"  and  "bun","white" . This concept is probably familiar to you already—in Perl it’s called a hash, in PHP it’s an associative array, and in Java it’s a Map. Or if you like to think in relational database terms, properties are two-column rows with the property name acting as a primary key. Fair enough.  In JavaScript, any instance of the type Object is a collection of proper- ties. Although we’ll see objects can be used for much more than sim- ple collections of properties, sometimes just bundling some properties together in one place is all you need. When an object is used like this, we’ll call it a hash; if the object happens to be a literal, we’ll call it a hash literal. The general form is as follows:  {  «propertyName1»:«value1», «propertyName2»:«value2», ... «propertyNameN»:«valueN»   }  JAVASCRIPT IDIOMS FOR CALLING XHR  40   JAVASCRIPT IDIOMS FOR CALLING XHR  41  Figure 3.1: A hash printed with console.dir  One important note: you should never end the last property-value pair with a comma. Firefox is forgiving about this, but other browsers are not. It’s better to be on the safe side.  The following code assigns a hash literal to a variable:  var burger = {patties: 2, type: "gardenburger", bun: "wheat"};    displays the object structure in the Firebug console console.dir burger ;  That console.dir statement looks interesting. This method, along with console.debug, console.log, and console.error, is your passport to Firebug and Firebug Lite’s logging mechanism. If you have spent your web life debugging JavaScript with alert boxes, you’ll ﬁnd this a welcome change of pace.  The console.dir method prints the hash properties on the log, similar to Figure 3.1. It’s also handy for printing objects, arrays, and all kinds of complex data structures. Its low-power cousin console.debug prints strings, numbers, and other primitives. Finally, console.log and con- sole.error do the same thing as console.debug, but with different mes- sage levels and different icons appearing in the console. You can ﬁlter messages by these different levels in Firebug.  So, now back to hash literals. Like array literals, these are a nice syn- tactic shortcut. Just as var a = [2, 4]; is equivalent to a[0] = 2; a[1] = 4;, so is the hash literal example equivalent to the following:  var burger2 = {}; burger2.patties = 2; burger2.type = "gardenburger"; burger2.bun = "wheat";    Should be exactly the same as previous example console.dir burger2 ;   JAVASCRIPT IDIOMS FOR CALLING XHR  42  Here we have three properties named patties, type, and bun with values 2, "gardenburger", and "wheat", respectively.  Many documents  including the Dojo API documentation  don’t use the word hash. We ﬁnd it useful because it says, no matter its origin, “It’s an object that’s just being used to bundle up some properties—nothing more, nothing less.”  We’ll have lots more to say about objects and classes in Chapter 9, Deﬁning Classes with dojo.declare, on page 225, but for now we’ll con- centrate on plain ol’ hashes and their usefulness in Dojo.  Hash literals can contain other literals, including array literals and other hash literals:  var burger3 = {     an array literal patties: ["gardenburger", "bocaburger"], toppings: {  cheese: "American", meat: "bacon"  }, bun: "wheat"  }; console.dir burger3 ;   The fact that you can mix a vegetarian patty with a nonvegetarian topping proves JavaScript is very loosely typed!  Notice the formatting here—when we nest hashes with more than a few properties, it helps to indent them inward like structured code. The extra whitespace reveals the structure at a glance.  For the property-value pairs, the property name can be placed in quo- tation marks, so "patties":2 is the same as patties:2. The right sides of the colon can be any expression: numeric and string literals, array literals, nested hash literals, function calls, or object constructor calls.  Hash literals are important in Dojo because they make function calls more readable. Take, for example, dojo.io.script.get, a Dojo function we’ll use later in this chapter for Yahoo Search.  Even without knowing dojo.io.script.get, the parameters here are clear and readable:  dojo.io.script.get {     URL for Yahoo Search url: "http:  search.yahooapis.com WebSearchService V1 webSearch",   JAVASCRIPT IDIOMS FOR CALLING XHR  43     Send search term parameters:  content: {  appid: "DEMO", query: searchTerms, output: "json"  },     If the response takes longer than 10000ms  = 10 seconds , error out timeout: 10000,     Yahoo API requires you to send the callback function name in the    parameter "callback" callbackParamName: "callback"     The full call will have load and error parameters too    ...  } ;  All of the data is passed as one hash with properties url, content, and so forth. This could be simulated with individual primitive parameters, but there are big advantages to doing it with a hash literal:    The hash literal is more descriptive than a set of parameters. To replace dojo.io.script.get with dojo.io.script.get 1, ’someNode’, ... , we’d have to review the API documentation to learn what “1” refers to. Put another way, though JavaScript has only positional parame- ters, you can simulate named parameters by passing a hash.    You can reorder or skip properties in a hash literal with no penalty. This is especially important in dojo.io.script.get, where a normal call speciﬁes only about half the possible parameters.    Finally, let’s suppose you call a function several times with the same parameters. Building a hash and then passing it to the func- tion over and over is more efﬁcient than parsing the arguments each time.  You can create complex hashes with many levels of nesting, all by sep- arating elements with commas and wrapping hashes with braces. This is handy in XHR and other Dojo APIs and is indispensable in declar- ing class structures. We’ll see an example of the latter in Chapter 9, Deﬁning Classes with dojo.declare, on page 225.  Function Literals  Unlike hash literals, which make a good deal of sense, function literals might throw you for a loop.  Before diving into function literals, you need to understand JavaScript’s idea of “functions as data.” In JavaScript numbers, strings, hashes,   JAVASCRIPT IDIOMS FOR CALLING XHR  44  arrays, objects, and multitudes of other types of data can be assigned to a variable or passed to a function or method. That’s nothing special. But in JavaScript, functions can be assigned to variables and passed to functions too. The function name represents a function deﬁnition, not a function call.  This technique makes your code shorter, simpler, and more expressive. An example will clarify. Suppose you have an array of hashes that you’d like to make into a list. Each hash has a few properties, each of which will be made into a hyperlink, like so:     Assume there's a    present. var listNode = document.getElementById "listOfUrls" ;     You want to turn this: var urls = [  { url: "http:  www.yahoo.com", title: "Yahoo" }, { url: "http:  www.ask.com", title: "Ask" }, { url: "http:  www.google.com", title: "Google" }   * into this:    Yahoo     Ask     Google    Your ﬁrst shot at it looks like plain ol’ procedural JavaScript:  for  var i=0; i < urls.length; i++  {  var listItem = document.createElement "li" ; listItem.innerHTML =  "<a href='" + urls[i].url + "'>" + urls[i].title + " ";  listNode.appendChild listItem ;  Bluggh! That middle assignment statement is nasty looking. Are the quotes balanced right? Are the subscripts off? You have to look awfully close to ﬁnd out. So, we use a trick from dojo.string:  for  var i=0; i < urls.length; i++  {  var listItem = document.createElement "li" ; listItem.innerHTML =  dojo.string.substitute " ${title} ", result ;  listNode.appendChild listItem ;  ];  *   }  }   JAVASCRIPT IDIOMS FOR CALLING XHR  45  That’s much better. The dojo.string.substitute method takes the hash in oneResult and applies the properties to a template. This template uses ${...}-style placeholders. So, ${url} is replaced with oneResult.url, and ${title} is replaced with oneResult.title.  Now about that for loop. How many times have you used i only to ﬁnd it was being used by some other inner or outer loop? OK, you don’t have to admit it. But isn’t there a better way to loop through arrays?  Dojo has a similar method, dojo.forEach, with an interesting signature. You pass an array and a function—not a function call, an actual func- tion. This function must deﬁne one parameter: an item. Here’s what we mean: the following function mirrors the inside of the previous exam- ple’s for loop:  dojo.string.substitute " ${title} ", oneResult ;  var listNode = document.getElementById "listOfUrls" ; function appendNewListItem oneResult  {  var listItem = document.createElement "li" ; listItem.innerHTML =  listNode.appendChild listItem ;  }  You pass the name of this function to dojo.forEach:  dojo.forEach  urls, appendNewListItem  ;  Your ﬁngers will instinctively reach for the parentheses when typing appendNewListItem. Don’t do it! You’re not passing the result of the func- tion call; you’re passing the function itself. Amazingly, dojo.forEach calls appendNewListItem  urls[0]  ; and then appendNewListItem  urls[1]  ;, and so on. Hmmmmm. That saves you an entire for loop. Now we’re getting somewhere!  And now we can talk about function literals. Just as you can use a hash literal in place of a hash, you can use a function literal in place of a function. Their general form is as follows:  function «parameters»  {  «body»  }  Function literals are sometimes called anonymous functions because they look like a function deﬁnition without a name. So, you can write the previous code using a function literal.   A WISH LIST WITH DOJO.DATA AND DOJOX.GRID.GRID  46  var listNode = document.getElementById "listOfUrls" ; dojo.forEach  urls, function oneResult  {  var listItem = document.createElement "li" ; listItem.innerHTML =  dojo.string.substitute " ${title} ", oneResult ;  listNode.appendChild listItem ;  } ;  We’ll see plenty more examples of function literals, but here’s what we need to know for Dojo XHR: XmlHttpRequest calls are asynchronous, meaning they return control to the JavaScript program immediately while they work in the background. We need to tell XHR, “This is what you do when the result comes back.” That’s perfect for a function literal, because most often the function is used only for that XHR call. Deﬁning a named function to call it only once feels like too much overhead. A function we pass to an asynchronous request is called a handler, or equivalently a callback. We want the process to “call back” our function when it’s ready.  The functions-as-data concept of JavaScript turns out to be extremely useful. Dojo uses it in XHR and also in surprising places such as ani- mations and declaring subclasses. We’ll discuss those later, but for now let’s dig into the ﬁrst project.  3.3 A Wish List with dojo.data and dojox.grid.Grid  The Justa Cigar Corporation is overhauling its web site, and we’ve just won the contract to write it. Customers on the Justa site are gung ho about cigars, and Justa wants to help them connect to each other, share information, and  Justa hopes  purchase cigars.2  Each Justa customer has a wish list of cigars with brand names, sizes, country of origin, and other information. The execs want to list this in a scrollable table and give the customer the ability to add, delete, and edit cigars in place without leaving the page. In Figure 3.2, on the next page, you can see the “cocktail napkin” view of what Justa wants. Already this is impossible with the old web technology because of the don’t-leave-the-page requirement. We’re going to need XHR to send add, delete, and edit requests to the server.  2. Just for the record, we don’t condone such carcinogenic activities. The point is you can use the same techniques for ﬁnding ice cream, cross-country skis, or ﬂat-screen televisions. Whatever ﬂoats your boat. Dojo will not judge you.   A WISH LIST WITH DOJO.DATA AND DOJOX.GRID.GRID  47  Figure 3.2: Wish-list user interface design  coffee stain omitted   dojox.grid.Grid is a good ﬁt for the user interface part. Grid acts like a mini-spreadsheet where you can view, sort, ﬁlter, and edit tabu- lar information. dojo.data provides plumbing between Grid and server- based data. Together they’ll form the backbone of the wish list.  Because Justa controls the web site and database, its IT department can write web services in any format we want. These web services will read from the wish-list database, translate the data to the right format, and send. Writing these server-side scripts is beyond the scope of this book, but Dojo can generally work with any server-side language and any database because they communicate over HTTP. If this notion is foreign to you, the sidebar on the following page gives you some help on where to start.  Fortunately, we can stub out the web services while writing the client. After all, XHR simply sends a request to a URL and gets data back in some standard format. A plain old text ﬁle will sufﬁce—it has a URL, and we can write it in some format. That makes the job small and easier to manage. But we still need to pick a data format. dojo.data has drivers for commonly used data formats such as XML, comma-   A WISH LIST WITH DOJO.DATA AND DOJOX.GRID.GRID  48  Server-Side Options  Dojo enables a signiﬁcant architectural shift. When scripting ﬁll- and-submit pages in a middle-tier language such as PHP, ASP, or JSP, both the navigation and HTML generation rest mostly in that language. With Dojo, more code executes on the client and less on the middle tier. But you still need some middle-tier code for the following:    Connecting to a database and passing the results in a  format Dojo understands    Proxying calls to external web services  PHP is a particularly adept language for these calls because proxying is a one-line call and JSON support is built in  at least to 5.2 and newer . But any language that can talk to HTTP servers and use databases will work.  Alternatively, you can use an enterprise service bus  ESB . This software is made for proxying and translation, and many require declarative conﬁguration in lieu of programming. Many ESB products are large and expensive, but Apache Synapse is an open source, lightweight ESB that’s a good match for Dojo.  separated variables  CSV , JSON, and HTML tables. Seeing this list, you might think XML is the way to go. But hold up a minute!  JSON, the Language  JavaScript Object Notation is a better choice for sending the wish-list data in our example. If you haven’t seen or used it before, you might wonder why we’d pick JSON over XML. After all, practically every pro- gramming language and every browser on Earth speaks XML. It’s self- descriptive, standardized, and mature.  But in browsers, XML suffers from two problems. First, browsers don’t implement XML standards uniformly. Second, and this is the deal- breaker, browser-based XML implementations are slow. That’s a prob- lem because the more interactive you want your interface, the chattier you have to be with the server, and the faster your data interchange format must be.   A WISH LIST WITH DOJO.DATA AND DOJOX.GRID.GRID  49  Enter JSON. In a nutshell, JSON data looks like the right side of a JavaScript assignment. For comparison, here is a snippet of XML data from our Justa wish lists:      4455   Don Pepin Garcia Delicias   7-50  ...     This is equivalent to the following JSON:  "wishListItem": {  "wishId": 4455, "description": "Don Pepin Garcia Delicias", "size": "7-50",  ... }  This looks suspiciously like a hash literal. And it is! However, JSON has more restrictions placed on it:    All strings, including the names on the left side of the colon  : ,  must be quoted.  Hash literals are not as strict.     Nested hashes and arrays are allowed on the right side of the colon. But the only primitive data allowed are single- or double- quoted strings, numbers, the boolean constants true and false, and the constant null. No expressions or variable names are allowed.  It’s really that simple. Dojo feeds the data to a JavaScript eval, gets back a hash, and gives it to you. But it also enforces the JSON quoting rules behind the scenes, and that’s an important security feature. Otherwise, someone could type in a wish-list item named while 1 ; and lock up someone’s browser.  If you’re given the choice of web service output to consume by Dojo, JSON is usually preferable to XML. It’s expressive, ﬂexible, and easy to manipulate in JavaScript. Adapters for popular server-side languages are plentiful, as you can see at http:  www.json.org. And it’s fast, fast, fast! Some studies have clocked it at 100 times faster than XML in a browser. This makes sense because JSON is “closer to the metal” of JavaScript and requires less translation. When you need cigar data, those extra clock cycles count!   A WISH LIST WITH DOJO.DATA AND DOJOX.GRID.GRID  50  A Stub Data Source  dojo.data has its own terminology, which we will cover completely in Chapter 10, dojo.data, on page 260. But here’s enough to build our test wish-list data. A data source is the URL from which the data comes. In our test case, the URL will be very simple: services cigar_wish_list.json. When we ﬁll out the stubs, we’ll probably send parameters along with it, as in services cigar_wish_list.php?userid=99555. A data store is the cor- responding dojo.data object that holds the data. Finally, an item is one data object. An item is like a database record but can have a more complex structure.  So, here’s a snippet from our data source, in services cigar_wish_list.json:  Download xhr_techniques services cigar_wish_list_abbrv.json  {  "identifier": "wishId", "label": "description", "items": [  {  }, {  }, {  "wishId": 4455, "description": "Don Pepin Garcia Delicias", "size": "7-50", "origin": "Nicaragua", "wrapper": "Corojo", "shape": "Straight"  "wishId": 4456, "description": "601 Habano Robusto", "size": "5-50", "origin": "Nicaragua", "wrapper": "Natural", "shape": "Straight"  "wishId": 4457, "description": "Black Pearl Rojo Robusto", "size": "4 3 4-52", "origin": "Nicaragua", "wrapper": "Natural", "shape": "Straight"  },  * ... *   ]  }  The structure may look complex on ﬁrst glance. Judicious use of white- space makes things a bit easier—here we use a style similar to a Java- Script program, lining up brackets and indenting common levels. Work- ing from the inside out, a wish-list item...  Download xhr_techniques services cigar_wish_list_abbrv.json  {  },  "wishId": 4455, "description": "Don Pepin Garcia Delicias", "size": "7-50", "origin": "Nicaragua", "wrapper": "Corojo", "shape": "Straight"   A WISH LIST WITH DOJO.DATA AND DOJOX.GRID.GRID  51  is a simple hash literal following the JSON rules. The brackets sur- rounding these hashes create an array of wish-list objects:  Download xhr_techniques services cigar_wish_list_abbrv.json  "wishId": 4455, "description": "Don Pepin Garcia Delicias", "size": "7-50", "origin": "Nicaragua", "wrapper": "Corojo", "shape": "Straight"  "wishId": 4456, "description": "601 Habano Robusto", "size": "5-50", "origin": "Nicaragua", "wrapper": "Natural", "shape": "Straight"  "wishId": 4457, "description": "Black Pearl Rojo Robusto", "size": "4 3 4-52", "origin": "Nicaragua", "wrapper": "Natural", "shape": "Straight"  },  * ... *   Finally, this array becomes the items property of the data source, as we saw earlier:  Download xhr_techniques services cigar_wish_list_abbrv.json  "identifier": "wishId", "label": "description", "items": [  "wishId": 4455, "description": "Don Pepin Garcia Delicias", "size": "7-50", "origin": "Nicaragua", "wrapper": "Corojo", "shape": "Straight"  "wishId": 4456, "description": "601 Habano Robusto", "size": "5-50", "origin": "Nicaragua", "wrapper": "Natural", "shape": "Straight"  "wishId": 4457, "description": "Black Pearl Rojo Robusto", "size": "4 3 4-52", "origin": "Nicaragua", "wrapper": "Natural", "shape": "Straight"  [  {  }, {  }, {  ]  {  {  }, {  }, {  },  * ... *   ]  }   A WISH LIST WITH DOJO.DATA AND DOJOX.GRID.GRID  52  Figure 3.3: The wish list: scrollable, sortable, and full of tasty cigars  We are then going to feed this into the dojo.data driver dojo.data. ItemFileReadStore. This driver expects JSON data in a speciﬁc format with the following properties: identiﬁer is the ﬁeld containing an item’s ID; label is the ﬁeld with the human-readable identiﬁer; and items is the data itself, which is an array of hashes. Not all dojo.data drivers are this restrictive: CSV and XML data sources do not require an identiﬁer ﬁeld, for example.  The IT people at Justa will write a server-side component that reads database records and writes the data into this format. But this ﬁxed data source will do for now.  The Data-Enabled Widget, dojox.grid.Grid  Grid widgets are very familiar to GUI designers. A grid is a spreadsheet- like “supertable” that allows editing, sophisticated display, and a well- structured event system. Grids are unfamiliar to most web program- mers, though, because they’re difﬁcult to construct from scratch.  The Dojox grid component is the state-of-the-art in web-enabled data grids, and it gives client-server grids a run for their money in features, performance, and stability. You can pipe dojo.data data stores into it with just a few lines of code.  The goal is to get to Figure 3.3. It looks pretty sophisticated, but every journey begins with a small step, so let’s begin.  Every grid needs data. A grid’s model is the set of data that is feeding the grid, named after the M in MVC architecture.   A WISH LIST WITH DOJO.DATA AND DOJOX.GRID.GRID  53  We’ve already built our data source, and making this a model requires just one   tag:  Download xhr_techniques wish_list_grid.html  <div dojoType="dojo.data.ItemFileReadStore"  jsId="wishStore" url="services cigar_wish_list.json">     This looks a lot like a Dijit component, but it’s not. It doesn’t display anything—which is usually a tip-off that it’s not from Dijit. And the dojo- Type= value does not begin with dijit.  In Section 12.1, What Exactly Is a Widget?, on page 319, we’ll learn the full story.  Instead, it acts more like an assignment statement. The jsId= attribute declares a JavaScript variable to hold the object. You can use these variables in your own JavaScript code, or, as we do here, feed the contents of one object into another. So, this tag sets up a dojo.data.ItemFileReadStore, a data store using JSON in the special format we used for cigar_wish_list.json.  With the model taken care of, we can deﬁne the grid itself:  Download xhr_techniques wish_list_grid.html  <table id="grid" dojoType="dojox.grid.Grid" store="wishStore"  query="{ wishId: '*' }" clientSort="true">       Cigar   Length Ring   Origin   Wrapper   Shape           Hmmm, that sure looks like an HTML  . . . although there’s a few extra attributes. But those extra attributes wield tremendous power. First, dojox.grid.Grid takes in the data store wishStore, deﬁned earlier. The grid can apply sorting and ﬁltering to the data store, designated by the attributes clientSort= and query=. The former is straightforward. The latter involves another hash literal deﬁning ﬁlter criteria. In this case, { wishId: ’*’ } means “Match every item that has a wishId property.” In our case, that’s all the records in the store.  Inside the   tag, it looks like a table with exactly one row. For our simple two-dimensional table type of grid, all we need are a few     A WISH LIST WITH DOJO.DATA AND DOJOX.GRID.GRID  54  tags, each of which deﬁne column characteristics. The ﬁeld property points to a ﬁeld in our data source.  You’ll learn more about that later.  And the body of the tag is used as the column header.  Let’s step back, review our work, and fold in some last-minute touches.

If you have the Firebug debugger installed in your browser, you can watch the XHR packets go over the network, as shown in Figure 3.4, on the next page.  dojo.data and dojox.grid provide a quick way to get XHR up and running against your domain’s web services, but what if you want to use ser- vices outside your network? You can write your own proxy in a server- side language that calls the outside service on your behalf. But for some specially written web services, there’s an even easier way.   RESEARCHING CIGARS USING JSONP  56  Figure 3.4: Firebug view of getting the wish list over XHR  3.4 Researching Cigars Using JSONP  The second part of the project adds lists of cigar-speciﬁc hyperlinks from Yahoo Search. Yahoo publishes its Search API through a JSONP- based web service, and we’ll use dojo.io.script to stitch it to the applica- tion. The user clicks a cigar name; Dojo calls the Yahoo web service, gets the hyperlinks, and displays them in a list underneath the grid. Click- ing another cigar name erases the previous list and displays results for the new cigar. The results look like Figure 3.5, on the following page.  http:  developer.yahoo.com is a good starting place for researching Yahoo web services. From there, the Search API documentation is a few clicks away at http:  developer.yahoo.com search web V1 webSearch.html. For this example, we’ll use the most current API at the time of this writ- ing, version 1. Yahoo is very good about keeping old APIs running for backward compatibility, so all the techniques here should work even if updated APIs are available.  Once there, we ﬁnd the following information about Yahoo Search. You need a Yahoo web application ID, for which you ﬁll out a form at http:  search.yahooapis.com webservices register_application. Under the terms and conditions, you are not obligated to keep this application ID protected. This is important to know for JSONP services, because the application ID must be sent down to the client browser.  Yahoo Search uses the HTTP GET command and a query string to pass parameters individually. This is called a REpresentational State Trans- fer  REST  protocol. The interesting parameter for us is query, which deﬁnes the search terms. The output can be returned in one of three formats: XML, serialized PHP, and JSON, depending on which output parameter you send. Obviously we want JSON here, but other situa- tions may call for other formats.   RESEARCHING CIGARS USING JSONP  57  Figure 3.5: Click a cigar, get a free search.  Generally, to use a web service, you need to know the following:    What URL do you call?   Where are the input parameters? For this service, we need the search terms, which are available in our grid. dojo.io.script func- tions can send an entire HTML form, a hash literal, or both. For JSONP services, the form ﬁeld names or the hash literal property names must match the web service parameters exactly.    How long should Dojo wait for a response? Since the Dojo XHR calls are asynchronous, you must deﬁne a comfortable waiting period before an error occurs.3    For JSONP services, which input parameter names the callback  function?    What should be done when the answer arrives? And what if there’s an error? Dojo handles these through callbacks—JavaScript func- tions called when an asynchronous function completes.  The ﬁrst four metadata items—url, timeout, content, and callbackParam- Name—are fairly straightforward, so let’s tackle those. From the API documentation, we ﬁnd the Yahoo Search URL is http:  search.yahooapis. com WebSearchService V1 webSearch. We set the timeout to ten seconds initially—during the testing phase, we may increase or decrease this time depending on the speeds we observe. For content, it seems we need three parameters for the call to succeed. Two of them—appid and out- put—are constants we ﬁx in the program. The other parameter, query, needs to be extracted from the grid. We’ll put a placeholder there for the time being.  3. Dojo can perform XHR calls synchronously as well. But because synchronous calls may fail to connect and cause the browser to lock up, they are generally not recom- mended. This is not Dojo’s fault per se; it’s a problem with any toolkit calling the browser’s XHR implementation.   RESEARCHING CIGARS USING JSONP  58  Finally, JSONP requires you to send a function name with the request, which it will use as the callback. Yahoo Search requires the callback function name to be sent in the callback parameter. Other JSONP ser- vices may require it in a different parameter, such as callthis. The call- backParamName variable of dojo.io.script.get serves this purpose, so you can specify "callback" for Yahoo Search  as we’ve done here , "callthis", or whatever the service requires.     URL for Yahoo Search url: "http:  search.yahooapis.com WebSearchService V1 webSearch",  Here’s what we have so far:  Download xhr_techniques yahoo_remote_script.html  dojo.io.script.get {     Send search term parameters:  content: {  appid: "DEMO", query: searchTerms, output: "json"  },     If the response takes longer than 10000ms  = 10 seconds , error out timeout: 10000,     Yahoo API requires you to send the callback function name in the    parameter "callback" callbackParamName: "callback",     The load and error functions will be filled in here  } ;  Just as we saw in Section 3.2, Literals and Hashes, on page 39, dojo.io. script.get takes just one parameter, which is a hash with many proper- ties. This makes it easy to read and understand. But. . . that searchTerms variable from the Yahoo Search API is bugging us. We need a good way to get it.  The Grid and Events  It looks easy enough. You click a grid row, the row highlights, and you extract the search term from the list. But where do you start? Is the grid a table? Do the cells have IDs?  Luckily, you don’t have to piece together the cigar name by “screen- scraping.” Remember that grids have a model. The model has all the unprocessed data in it. If you could just get the clicked row and map it to an item in the model, you could easily get the value you need.   RESEARCHING CIGARS USING JSONP  59  Fortunately, the Grid widget provides hooks for you called events. You are probably already used to HTML’s familiar events such as onClick or onMouseOut. These are the DOM level 0 events. Grid events are simi- lar and are named things like onRowDoubleClick or onCellHover. As we’ll learn in Section 6.2, Connecting to User-Deﬁned Events with Dojo, on page 117, these are Dojo user-deﬁned events that carry rich event infor- mation to functions we provide.  We’ll save most of the information for later. But for now, let’s just dive right into an event function for onRowClick:  Download xhr_techniques yahoo_remote_script_demo.html  <table id="grid" dojoType="dojox.grid.Grid" store="wishStore"  query="{ wishId: '*' }" clientSort="true">    var searchTerms = this.model.getRow evt.rowIndex .description; console.debug searchTerms ;                  Cigar   Length Ring   Origin   Wrapper   Shape   That   tag looks strange. Generally,   tags have type= "text javascript", right? Browsers, upon ﬁnding a type= they don’t recog- nize, will simply skip over it. That’s good for us. We don’t want the browser to simply execute this code on page load. Making the type "dojo connect" tags this script for use only by Dojo.  The args= attribute takes a list of JavaScript variable names and matches these up with the signature parameters. You can consider them the formal parameters of the method. So when Dijit calls the handler code, it will put the event object into the variable evt, which you can then use in the body of the handler.  Recall that handler is synonymous with callback.   Let’s work from the inside out on that assignment statement. Events such as onRowClick send useful information through the argument, in our case evt.   RESEARCHING CIGARS USING JSONP  60  One of the properties in evt is rowIndex, which contains the 0-based index of the row we just clicked. That’s useful. Then this.model.getRow  this meaning the grid  gets the row hash, which looks exactly like the hash in our model. For example, this.model.getRow 2  is just the follow- ing:  { "wishId": 4457, "description": "Black Pearl Rojo Robusto", "size": "4 3 4-52", "origin": "Nicaragua", "wrapper": "Natural", "shape": "Straight" }  We just grab the description property, and we’re done!  That’s pretty elegant. The method is deﬁned right in the tag that needs it, and a lot of the infrastructure is there for you. So, where do you ﬁnd these events? And how do you know the event data passed back? One way is to consult the online guide at http:  www.dojotoolkit.org, which lists all the event method signatures. As far as grid goes, we’ll be talking a lot about events in Chapter 14, Grid, on page 366 as well.  XHR Callbacks  Now, back to the business at hand. We have most of the properties ready for dojo.io.script.get except for the two meatiest ones: load and error. These two properties are callbacks—functions that run after an asynchronous event completes.  What do those functions look like? Here’s the rest of our dojo.io.script.get call:  Download xhr_techniques yahoo_remote_script.html     Function runs when Yahoo returns with the answer load: function searchResult  {     Zero out the current list listNode = dojo.byId "resultUl" ; listNode.innerHTML = "";  dojo.forEach searchResult.ResultSet.Result, function result  {  var listItem = document.createElement "li" ; listItem.innerHTML =  dojo.string.substitute   " ${Title}  ${Summary}", result   ;  listNode.appendChild listItem ;  } ;  },   RESEARCHING CIGARS USING JSONP  61     And this is the callback used when a web service communication error or    timeout occurs.    are still handled with load   error: function text  {  Note that errors returned from Yahoo in the response  alert "An error has occurred." ; return text;  }  } ;  We’ll go over the code inside load and error in a minute, but for now let’s concentrate on the form of these callbacks. load and error are called when the XHR answer arrives at the client PC. The browser calls either one or the other, but never both. The notion of callbacks may look a little strange at ﬁrst. Your natural inclination might be to call dojo.io.script.get like this:     WRONG! response won't hold the value you think var response = dojo.io.script.get ... ;    Do something with the response  Well, that sure looks easy, but it’s incorrect.4 It’s also not desirable. To guarantee a value in response, the JavaScript interpreter in the browser would have to block, that is, pause at this statement until the XHR mes- sage arrives. Remember, the Internet is involved. We can’t guarantee a response from the web service—their server might die, the Internet connections may be slow, and so on. That wouldn’t be so bad except Internet Explorer and Firefox both lock up waiting for an answer— their implementations of XHR, on which Dojo must rely, synchronously block the entire browser process. Your user is stuck. The Stop button won’t even work—killing the browser process is the only option.  The dojo.io.script.get method returns immediately, before the server has responded. When the response does come back, Dojo calls the load or error callback you speciﬁed in dojo.io.script.get. In Figure 3.6, on the next page, you can see a good overview of the process.  Let’s take the error callback ﬁrst since it’s the easiest. error must be a function with the signature function someVariable , where the text of the error message is send back through someVariable. In our example, we call it simply text.  If dojo.io.script doesn’t return a response, what does it return? It returns a dojo.Deferred 4. object, which we’ll see in Section 6.4, Managing Callbacks with dojo.Deferred, on page 123. With dojo.Deferred, you can chain callbacks to load and error, as in “When you’re done with all the successful callbacks, also do this one.” This allows for easy reuse of callbacks among XHR requests.   RESEARCHING CIGARS USING JSONP  62  Your Code  xhrGet    Web Service  Load Error Handler  Figure 3.6: UML sequence diagram of a Dojo XHR call  Note that error is called only when the process of sending or receiving fails. An incorrect URL, a bad Internet connection, or a slow response time  longer than our timeout property  will cause this to ﬁre.  However, it will not be called if the web service itself returns an error. For example, an address veriﬁcation web service could return an   tag if the address is not legal, but this is not considered an error by Dojo.  load is the most important callback. This is where we can ﬁrst view the response, which Dojo places in the searchResult parameter. But how do we extract the stuff we need from searchResult? Here’s where Firebug is really useful. The call console.dir searchResult ; dumps the entire contents of searchResult to the debug log. From there, as pictured in Figure 3.7, on the following page, we can view its structure.  We see that searchResults contains a ResultSet property, which in turn houses a Result array of hashes, each with the interesting properties title, url, and summary. Pay dirt!  And now it’s clear why we did that example back in Section 3.2, Func- tion Literals, on page 43. It’s easy to write a dojo.forEach loop that creates list items from these results and puts them in the list at the bottom. dojo.require ends the prologue.   REVIEWS WITH DOJO.XHRGET  63  Figure 3.7: Firebug showing the structure  Download xhr_techniques yahoo_remote_script.html  dojo.require "dojo.io.script" ;  And when we run the app and click a grid row, the search results pop out at the bottom, as shown in Figure 3.5, on page 57. Click a new row, get another list, and so on.  All in all, that was fairly painless XHR. With one small server-side com- ponent and one call to dojo.io.script.get, you have extended the reach of your application quite far. On-the-ﬂy searches like this were unthink- able just a few years ago.  JSONP services are nice, but not all web services are built on it. By far the most common web services use REST and XML. But even that isn’t so hard, as we’ll ﬁnd out.  3.5 Reviews with dojo.xhrGet  Justa has a great opportunity. The magazine Cigars Unlimited now offers its world-renowned cigar reviews via a web service. Justa pays a small fee each time the service is called, but it will make up that money easily by selling more cigars. The company wants an icon added to the grid, which the user will click to ﬁre the request and put the reviews in a list.  It would be nice to connect Dojo and JavaScript directly to the Cigars Unlimited web service. But there are two issues:    Cigars Unlimited’s web services, like most web services, don’t use JSONP. They use plain-vanilla REST and XML. We must call them with XHR, but an XHR request must obey the same-origin policy of browser-based JavaScript. That is, JavaScript can send XHR requests only to the same server from which it was loaded.   REVIEWS WITH DOJO.XHRGET  64    The terms of the web service agreement stipulate that you can request reviews only from a ﬁxed IP. If every Tom, Dick, and Mary could access the service from their client PC, Cigars Unlimited would make no money.  At the time of this writing, browser producers are discussing options for relaxing the same-origin policy. But even if that problem is solved, that service agreement stipulation is the showstopper.  This is a common Ajax problem, and a common solution is a proxy service. If the browser can’t communicate directly with the service, it can communicate with the proxy, and the proxy will communicate with the service. After all, your server-side language—be it PHP, JSP, ASP, Ruby on Rails—has no same-origin policy.  Since this book concentrates on Dojo, a client-side toolkit, we won’t dis- cuss how to write the proxy. There are many options for this, and the sidebar on page 48 gives a few of them. Instead, we’ll use the same tech- nique as in Section 3.3, A Wish List with dojo.data and dojox.grid.Grid, on page 46 and just place a sample XML ﬁle on the server. This will simulate the output of Cigar Unlimited’s web service:  Download xhr_techniques services ratings.xml        4     Rolled in an aesthetically pleasing reddish-brown wrapper, this cigar smokes well exuding a pleasant aroma. The smoke has a buttery, leathery quality with tea and cocoa bean notes, and a long, pleasant finish.        But how do you get the data from the server? Dojo provides low-level functions dojo.xhrGet, dojo.xhrPost, and others for this purpose. Fortu- nately, they share many characteristics with dojo.io.script.get, so learn- ing them will be a snap.  One more thing: we need to deal with XML and its APIs, which are less elegant than JSON’s. Dojo is heavily skewed toward using JSON and provides almost no facilities for helping out with XML. In our case, we will use the native DOM APIs to read XML data. There are other options: you can use a third-party JavaScript XML toolkit like Google’s or do a server-side translation of XML to JSON before hitting the client.   REVIEWS WITH DOJO.XHRGET  65  Using dojo.xhrGet  First we’ll gather the web service information, as we did in the previous example:    URL: services ratings.xml, which is our stub data source. We call it  with HTTP GET.    Input parameters: The Cigars Unlimited web site uses a query pa- rameter, and we also use that parameter to the proxy. Of course, our stub data source, since it’s not a program, will ignore this.    Timeout: Ten seconds.   Content type: XML. Note that JSONP services do not need this pa-  rameter, but dojo.xhr* functions do.  Also unlike dojo.io.script.get, there is no callbackParamName. But like dojo.io.script.get, the load and error callbacks are required.  Dojo’s four low-level XHR methods—dojo.xhrGet, dojo.xhrPost, dojo.xhrPut, and dojo.xhrDelete—correspond to the four HTTP commands GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. The method you use is determined by the web service, but most of the time it’s GET or POST.  So, let’s start coding! First we’ll place a blank   tag above the search result list to hold the rating description:  Download xhr_techniques ratings_xml.html        Then we’ll add to our onRowClick handler. Since the script is getting a little large, we delegate this code to a JavaScript function:  Download xhr_techniques ratings_xml.html  var searchTerms = this.model.getRow evt.rowIndex .description; getRating searchTerms ;  The calls to dojo.io.script.get and dojo.xhrGet will use the same error han- dler. So, we wisely refactor this into a separate function:  Download xhr_techniques ratings_xml.html     Share this error function function commonError text  {  alert "An error has occurred." ; return text;  }   REVIEWS WITH DOJO.XHRGET  66  And ﬁnally, there’s the meat and potatoes of the rating system:  Download xhr_techniques ratings_xml.html  function getRating searchTerms  {  dojo.xhrGet {     URL for our proxy that calls the rating service url: "services ratings.xml", content: { query: searchTerms }, timeout: 10000,     Set this to parse response into XML handleAs: "xml",     Function run when web service returns with the answer load: function ratingResult  {     Make an object out of the dynamic data for substitute. var reviewObj = { name: searchTerms };  var ratingNodes = ratingResult.getElementsByTagName "numerical" ; reviewObj.numerical = ratingNodes[0].firstChild.nodeValue;  var reviewNodes = ratingResult.getElementsByTagName "descriptive" ; reviewObj.descriptive = reviewNodes[0].firstChild.nodeValue;  var reviewPara = document.getElementById "ratingP" ; reviewPara.innerHTML =  dojo.string.substitute   " ${name} : ${numerical} stars ${descriptive}", reviewObj   ;  },  error: commonError  } ;  }  Much of the code is similar to the Yahoo Search lookup. The differences are as follows:    You must specify the handleAs parameter as XML. Other values  you can use here are json and text.    The load callback extracts data as parsed XML. Note the use of document.getElementsByTagName, which is standard JavaScript. It is rather inelegant compared to JSON’s rating.numerical equivalent, but it does the job.    There’s no dojo.require needed for dojo.xhr*. This and the other low-  level XHR methods are part of Dojo Core.   ERRORS AND DEBUGGING  67  Figure 3.8: Getting a cigar rating  So, now we’re ready to roll. Pull up the page, click a row, and the rat- ing appears between the Grid and the search result list, as pictured in Figure 3.8.  3.6 Errors and Debugging  In both of our examples, the error callback is admittedly somewhat mea- ger. Unlike standard submit-and-redraw web processing, XHR happens behind the scenes and will not display an error by default. Without adequate feedback, the user will not know anything has gone wrong. Still, an alert box is Draconian. Consider the effect if multiple errors happen at once and the user is bombarded with annoying feedback.  A lightweight alternative to alert   is the Toaster widget, also known as dojox.widget.Toaster. A Toaster widget is a box that pops up in the corner of the browser and then waits for a mouse click or simply fades out. It’s a good way to draw attention without being modal. We show one in Figure 3.9, on the following page.  Toaster comes from Dojox, the Dojo extension package. So, let’s toast that error! First we add dojo.require:  Download xhr_techniques ratings_xml_with_toaster.html  dojo.require "dojox.widget.Toaster" ;  The Toaster widget usually works best at the bottom of the web page. It’s not displayed until invoked, so in theory it could go anywhere. But placing it outside all other code keeps the DOM straight:  Download xhr_techniques ratings_xml_with_toaster.html  <div dojoType="dojox.widget.Toaster" duration="0"  messageTopic="xhrError" positionDirection="tr-left"  >  positionDirection= speciﬁes tr-left, meaning “in the top-right corner, moving in from the left.” messageTopic= is the topic that the Toaster   ERRORS AND DEBUGGING  68  Figure 3.9: dojox.widget.Toaster displays an error.  widget listens to for a message. Topics are part of Dojo’s publish-sub- scribe event system, which we’ll cover in great detail in Chapter 6, Asyn- chronous Programming, on page 101. But for now, think of a topic as a magazine subscription where one publisher sends out magazines to a list of interested subscribers. Here the magazine is xhrError, the error handler is the publisher, the Toaster is the subscriber, and a particular error message is a magazine issue.  Download xhr_techniques ratings_xml_with_toaster.html  function commonError text  {  dojo.publish "xhrError",  [{ message: text, type: "error", duration: 0 }]   ; return text;  }  And once again, hash literals swoop in to save the day. The publish- subscribe system passes messages of many different formats between components. Toasters understand message hashes with the properties message=, type=, and duration=. A duration= of 0 means keep the message displayed until the user clicks it. Toaster widgets stay in the corner of the screen, even as you scroll up and down the page. To test it, simply change the XHR URL to a ﬁle that doesn’t exist:  Download xhr_techniques ratings_xml_with_toaster.html  url: "services file_doesnt_exist.xml",  Of course, errors are sometimes debuggable, and you need a good tool to see the XHR communication in the background. Firebug is a great tool for that. To see XHR trafﬁc, open Firebug, and make sure the   ERRORS AND DEBUGGING  69  Figure 3.10: XHR Request tab in Firebug  Figure 3.11: XHR Response tab in Firebug  Console tab is showing. When you ﬁre off an XHR request of any kind, the Headers tab tells you the endpoints of the communication and any HTTP status codes. In Figure 3.10, you can see the parameters sent, nicely parsed, and displayed. In Figure 3.11, you can see the actual data received. It looks like this particular request was successful.  Dojo XHR does a lot with a little bit of code on your part. It handles cross-browser support, asynchronous processing, constructing query strings, and parsing the output all in the background. You provide the metadata for calling the service, and you provide the input data. By using JSON, when available, you can write efﬁcient, easy-to-read out- put processors in a few lines of code. What better way to plug your web applications into the vast network of services?   Part II  The Dojo APIs   Chapter 4  Dojo In Depth  Now that you’ve had a taste of what Dojo can do, we’re going to take a step back and explore Dojo in depth. Like any well-designed system, Dojo layers higher-level functionality on top of lower-level functionality. We’re going to start at the bottom and work our way up. This chapter sets the table for our journey. It covers a few foundational details that you’ll use in every Dojo application you write: how Dojo is organized, how to get a development copy, and how to load and initialize Dojo in your web pages.  4.1 Modularizing JavaScript  Dojo is implemented through static, client-side JavaScript scripts to- gether with a few supporting HTML templates and CSS style sheets. No server-side processing is required other than sending a static ﬁle, just as there’s no browser-side extension or plug-in.  Between Dojo and Dijit, there are about 150 scripts.1 Since Dojo is strictly a client-side toolkit, you must somehow load the particular script that contains the functionality you want to use. Further, since JavaScript does not include any formal concept of modules, names- paces, or source ﬁle composition, the sheer size of Dojo could lead to unmanageable complexity. How do you know which script to load to get a particular function? Do scripts depend on each other? How do you avoid loading the same script more than once? What about performance?  1. This number should stay fairly constant. Although existing scripts are undergoing constant reﬁnement, most new features are developed in Dojox.   MODULARIZING JAVASCRIPT  72  These problems are addressed by organizing the various Dojo function families into a hierarchy of modules. The term module is used loosely since JavaScript does not formally deﬁne the concept of a module. A Dojo module manifests itself as a JavaScript object; we’ll term this object the module object. All JavaScript objects  functions and data  that are members of a particular module exist as properties of that module object. Some of these properties may be other module objects— this results in a hierarchy of modules.  A Dojo module object is deﬁned  that is, a JavaScript object variable is instantiated  by one JavaScript source ﬁle; we’ll term this ﬁle the module primary script.2 When a module primary script is loaded, it may cause other scripts to load  see Section 11.2, The Dojo Loader, on page 290 . In this sense, a module may be decomposed into several source ﬁles, but exactly one of these ﬁles is responsible for deﬁning the module object. Finally, module primary scripts and module names reﬂect each other:    The ﬁles that make up all the modules are stored in a directory tree so that the path ﬁlename of a module primary script gives the module name. For example, the Dojo drag-and-drop man- ager module dojo.dnd.manager is stored at dojo-module-path dnd  manager.js  dojo-module-path gives the absolute path to the dojo module .    For the most part, when a module primary script is loaded into your JavaScript program, all JavaScript objects deﬁned by that module, with the exception of child module objects, are created as properties of the module object.3 Continuing the example, all public objects deﬁned by the module dojo.dnd.manager are created as properties of the JavaScript object dojo.dnd.manager. The root module in any such hierarchy of modules is deﬁned in the global scope. So, dojo is a global variable.  Here’s another way to look at the design: the module primary script ﬁlename implies the module name, which implies the JavaScript object name that holds all JavaScript objects deﬁned by the module. The con- verse equation is also true. 2. Module primary script is not an ofﬁcial Dojo term but rather a device we’re using to explain how things work. 3. There are a few exceptions to this rule. Some module primary scripts create additional objects that are not part of the module. For example, the Dijit module dijit.form.Button creates dijit.form.DropDownButton, dijit.form.ComboButton, and dijit.form.ToggleButton in addition to dijit.form.Button.   MODULARIZING JAVASCRIPT  73  The source code directory tree deﬁnes the hierarchy of JavaScript ob- jects that hold the Dojo function families. You can visualize these objects as a hierarchy of nested namespaces. This design allows for extremely ﬂexible organization. Here’s what the dojo  tree looks like  we opened only the subdirectories dnd and io—the other subdirectories are not empty :  Line 1   dojo  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  15  20  25  30  35  40   _base---------------->names that begin with a leading underscore  _firebug  cldr  data  date  dnd  are considered private  for internal use   autoscroll.js Avatar.js common.js Container.js Manager.js-------->defines the module "dojo.dnd.Manager" move.js Moveable.js Mover.js Selector.js Source.js  which happens to be a constructor function   io  iframe.js--------->defines the module "dojo.io.iframe" script.js  which is a regular module object   nls  resources  rpc  tests _base.js AdapterRegistry.js back.js behavior.js colors.js cookie.js currency.js date.js DeferredList.js dojo.js--------------->the entry point for the toolkit fx.js i18n.js NodeList-fx.js number.js OpenAjax.js parer.js regexp.js string.js tests.js  must be loaded first by a script tag   MODULARIZING JAVASCRIPT  74  The tree shown here calls out a few conventions used throughout the toolkit. First, if a module deﬁnes a single constructor function, then its name is capitalized to indicate that the module deﬁnes a class.4 Second, a few scripts and modules have names that begin with an underscore. These are considered private and are used internally by other modules. Since they will be automatically included if you need them, you can pretty much ignore them.  The breadth and depth of Dojo is one of its greatest strengths, but Dojo is big. Classifying functions into smaller and smaller subgroups makes such a large system easier to digest than a single massive list of func- tions. Needless to say, the reference manual  see http:  api.dojotoolkit. org   is organized along the same hierarchy. This is nothing but good design—reassuring, if not terribly novel.  Furthermore, we don’t have to download the entire, massive toolkit in order to get just a few key functions. Since the toolkit is divided up into small chunks, we are required to download only the parts that we actually use and then only when we actually need them.  Let’s take it one last step. Since the script ﬁlename can be deduced from the module name, why not write some JavaScript code to manage the whole script downloading process for us? This is the function of the Dojo loader, which we’ll discuss in Section 11.2, The Dojo Loader, on page 290. Further, once all the development is done and we’re ready to release our new application to production, why not package sev- eral modules together so they can all be sent to the browser in a sin- gle JavaScript ﬁle? This is the function of the Dojo build system  see Section 11.3, Optimizing Deployment with the Dojo Build System, on page 299 .  Consider the implications of the last two features taken together. Dojo divides source code up optimally from the programmer’s point of view while suffering no performance penalty when it comes time to publish the application on the Web  serving lots of little script ﬁles would result in sluggish performance . And you can use Dojo’s module, loader, and build system when developing and deploying your own code. Although this functionality is necessary for large applications, it can be com-  4. JavaScript doesn’t explicitly include the concept of a class as do other languages. But, most aspects of the class concept are available in terms of constructor functions and prototypal inheritance. We’ll discuss these concepts in detail in Chapter 9, Deﬁning Classes with dojo.declare, on page 225.   DOJO SOURCE CODE ORGANIZATION  75  pletely ignored if all you need is some basic Ajax or browser normal- ization functionality. Just load the modules you need, and forget about the loader and the build system.  4.2 Dojo Source Code Organization  The module decomposition  and therefore the source code  for the Dojo toolkit is divided into three trees:    Dojo: The core toolkit that includes libraries that are useful in nearly any program; the contents of this tree is referred to as Dojo Core.    Dijit  Dojo widgets : A framework for building HTML user interface controls  widgets  as well as a library of many prebuilt widgets. Dijit depends on Dojo.    Dojox  Dojo extensions : Projects that may not be needed in every single app or may not be 100% stable yet because they’re push- ing on the edge of what’s possible in browsers today  say, GFX . Many of the projects in Dojox would be considered highly mature in the context of other toolkits. But Dojo sets the bar so high for Core  API documentation and tests  and Dijit  API documentation, tests, a11y, and i18n  that it’s easier in many cases for projects to continue to mature as extensions. Each project in Dojox includes a readme ﬁle that explains the state of the project. We’ll look at the occasional Dojox module, but most of Dojox is beyond the scope of this book.  The root directory of the dojo  tree includes the ﬁle dojo.js; a script ele- ment must load it before you do anything else with the toolkit. dojo.js is the module primary script for the module dojo. When dojo.js is evalu- ated, the global variable dojo  an object  is created, and properties are added to it that make up the minimal runtime system deﬁned by Dojo.  In addition to dojo.js, the root of the dojo  tree deﬁnes several other mod- ules. Each of these is a child to the dojo module  remember, modules can contain other modules . For example, the module primary script number.js is located in the root directory of the dojo  tree and deﬁnes the module dojo.number. In this sense, dojo.js is different from any other ﬁle in the root: dojo.js causes the module dojo to be created; all other siblings to dojo.js cause modules that are children of dojo to be cre- ated  for example, dojo.number . Similarly, the root directory of the Dijit   DOJO SOURCE CODE ORGANIZATION  76  tree includes the ﬁle dijit.js, which serves as the entry point for Dijit and exhibits the same kind of special behavior.  As far as possible, the directory trees capture dependencies. So, for example, it is always true that for some imaginary modules dojo.x and dojo.x.y, dojo.x.y depends on module dojo.x. There is nothing to be gained by learning all of the module dependencies. Each module will ensure that its prerequisite modules are loaded.  The Catalog of Dojo Modules  Now that we’ve seen how Dojo is organized, let’s see what’s actually in it. First and foremost, there is the module dojo that includes the following functionality:5    Environment properties: A small set of variables that indicate var- ious properties of the runtime environment  for example, browser version and capabilities .    Language extensions: Functions that ﬁll in a few elements miss- ing from the core JavaScript library  see Chapter 5, JavaScript Language Extensions, on page 83 .    Asynchronous programming: Functions for programming events and asynchronous callbacks  see Chapter 6, Asynchronous Pro- gramming, on page 101 .    DOM programming: A library of functions that makes program- ming the DOM more pleasant  see Chapter 7, DOM Utilities, on page 140 .    XHR programming: Functions for communicating with the server via XHR objects  see Chapter 8, Remote Scripting with XHR, script, and iframe, on page 178 .    Object-oriented programming: A function for creating powerful, ﬂexible class hierarchies  see Chapter 9, Deﬁning Classes with dojo.declare, on page 225 .    The Dojo loader: Functions that load JavaScript scripts and Dojo modules  see Chapter 11, The Dojo Loader and Build System, on page 286 .  The dojo  tree includes several other modules that are not loaded auto- matically as a result of loading dojo.js in a script tag; you must thus  5. Most of the dojo module is implemented in the scripts contained in the directory _base. But this is an implementation detail that doesn’t affect the typical user.   DOJO SOURCE CODE ORGANIZATION  77  explicitly load them with a dojo.require function call, which we’ll see in Section 4.3, dojo.require, on page 80. They include the following:    dojo.back: Back button functionality for browser applications that  don’t navigate by loading new URLs    dojo.behavior: “Behaviors” attachable to sets of nodes   dojo.cldr: A Common Locale Data Repository  CLDR  implementa-  tion; works in concert with dojo.i18n    dojo.colors: Convenient CSS color manipulation functions   dojo.cookie: Simple HTTP cookie manipulation   dojo.currency: Parse, format, and i18n functions for currency data   dojo.data: Functions to access a generalized data source together  with an implementation for several types of data sources   dojo.date: Parse, format, and i18n functions for date data   dojo.dnd: DOM drag and drop   dojo.fx: DOM effects   dojo.i18n: Support for multiple locales; works in concert with dojo.    dojo.io: Functions for communicating with a server via script and   cldr  or iFrame elements    dojo.number: Parse, format, and i18n functions for number data   dojo.parser: HTML parser   dojo.regexp: Functions that help with building regular expressions   dojo.rpc: Remote procedure call  RPC  framework   dojo.string: A few common, otherwise-missing, string functions  We will be covering the module dojo thoroughly, and along the way, we’re also going to cover many of the other modules found in Dojo Core.  Dijit Modules  The Dijit modules are contained in a separate source code tree and are deﬁned from the root module dijit  not dojo.dijit . These modules imple- ment Dojo’s HTML widget system, which is fully described in Part III of the book.  Getting the Source  At the time of this writing, Dojo is available from four primary sources:    You can ﬁnd the current release at http:  dojotoolkit.org downloads where the Dojo Foundation publishes one gzipped tarball that includes the dojo , dijit , and dojox  trees of the latest release. The   LOADING DOJO  78  dojo, dijit, and dijit-all modules are packaged in both compressed and uncompressed resources; all the remaining resources are not compressed. We’ll discuss compressing and packaging in Chap- ter 11, The Dojo Loader and Build System, on page 286.  Sometimes this is referred to as the binary build because some resources are packaged and compressed. Except for a few images, no true binary  that is, something other than text  resources are included; every resource is a JavaScript, CSS, or HTML ﬁle. Distri- butions that don’t contain any packaged or compressed resources are referred to as source builds.    You can ﬁnd current and previous, binary, and source builds, in zipped and gzipped tarball resources, together with MD5 check- sums at http:  download.dojotoolkit.org .    AOL serves binary builds from its content delivery network  CDN ;  see http:  dev.aol.com dojo.    The source is also available for anonymous checkout from the SVN repository at http:  svn.dojotoolkit.org src . The current develop- ment trunks are rooted at  dojo trunk,  dijit trunk,  dojox trunk, and  util trunk. Tagged releases are stored in  tags. There’s also a set of svn:externals deﬁnitions at http:  svn.dojotoolkit.org src view anon  all trunk  that pulls in all four trunks in one anonymous checkout.    Finally, the Trac bug-tracking database includes browser access  to the SVN trees. All things Trac start at http:  trac.dojotoolkit.org.  4.3 Loading Dojo  Now it’s time to actually load the toolkit so we can start using it. dojo.js must be loaded before any other Dojo module or any of your own code that uses Dojo. Here is the absolute minimum statement required in your HTML document:      This line assumes that dojo.js is in the directory  dojoroot dojo .  A few runtime conﬁguration switches can be set when loading dojo.js. Let’s look at that next.   LOADING DOJO  79  Alex Says. . .  Debugging Tools for Internet Explorer  The biggest debugging headaches always seem to occur on Internet Explorer 6 and 7. Since the full-blown Firebug isn’t available there, we need to augment the arsenal. First, you’ll need the Internet Explorer Developer Toolbar exten- sion  available at http:  www.microsoft.com Downloads details. aspx?familyid=E59C3964-672D-4511-BB3E-2D5E1DB91038 . This is a marginally passable clone of the excellent Web Developer tool- bar for Firefox. Despite its warts, the Internet Explorer Web Devel- oper toolbar makes clearing the Internet Explorer cache much faster, and some of its DOM inspection facilities are useful in a pinch. Next, make sure you avoid the Microsoft Script Debug- ger  a toy  and instead use the Microsoft Script Editor  not a toy , which is found on the Ofﬁce 2003 install discs. Microsoft pushes the full-blown Visual Studio and its Visual Web Devel- oper variant for handling this kind of deep debugging, but I wouldn’t touch them with a pole. The downloads are gigan- tic, the install interminable, and the beneﬁt over MSE marginal  if that . That matters all the more when you’re installing your debugging tools in a virtual machine. All of my Internet Explorer development and debugging is done in VMs, and I can’t rec- ommend that highly enough. Don’t bother with things that pre- tend to let you run Internet Explorer 6 side by side with Inter- net Explorer 7 or Internet Explorer 8—they’re not the same as having the “real thing” because of some fundamental fea- tures of Internet Explorer’s design. Microsoft has recognized this ﬂaw and makes prerolled virtual machine images avail- able  available at http:  www.microsoft.com Downloads details. aspx?familyid=21EABB90-958F-4B64-B5F1-73D0A413C8EF , although they’re available only for Microsoft’s Windows-only  albeit free  Virtual PC runtime. I personally use a mix of Parallels and VMware for my virtualization needs, but use whatever works best for you—just make sure you’re testing!   LOADING DOJO  80  -  -  -  5  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  Runtime Conﬁguration  Back in the tutorial given in Chapter 2, Powerful Web Forms Made Easy, on page 20, we used the djConﬁg attribute in the script element that loaded dojo.js to specify the conﬁguration switch parseOnLoad. Here is what that script element looked like:  Line 1  <script  type="text javascript" src=" dojoroot dojo dojo.js" djConfig="parseOnLoad: true">     The same thing could be accomplished by explicitly setting the global variable djConﬁg. Since this must be set before dojo.js is loaded, the client program must create and initialize djConﬁg. This can be done in a single statement:  Line 1     djConfig= {parseOnLoad: true};       <script  type="text javascript" src=" dojoroot dojo dojo.js">     Each of these methods accomplishes the same result. We prefer the djConﬁg attribute method since the conﬁguration settings are encap- sulated in the element that loads dojo.js. But if you are troubled by including nonstandard attributes, then use the other method  see the Alex Says. . . , on the next page if you really are troubled . If you hap- pen to use both methods, any conﬁguration switch set by the djConﬁg attribute will override any properties set in the djConﬁg global variable.  dojo.require  What if you need something that’s not in the module dojo  that is, not loaded as a result of script including dojo.js ? For example, what if you need to do some remote scripting with dojo.io.script? How do you get this module loaded?  The answer is that everything else gets loaded with the function dojo. require.6 It keeps track of the modules already loaded and ensures that  It can also load scripts that don’t deﬁne modules. This is an advanced feature we’ll  6. discuss in Chapter 11, The Dojo Loader and Build System, on page 286.   LOADING DOJO  81  Alex Says. . .  Using Nonstandard HTML Attributes  Dojo uses nonstandard HTML attributes to set conﬁguration switches and conﬁgure Dijit widgets. This may raise some eye- brows, but in every case where it’s allowed, we also provide ways to do equivalent things without nonstandard attributes.  We agree that, as a general principle, standards should be followed—so long as they don’t get in the way of doing real work. After all, the very reason for standardizing is to make doing real work easier. But, when the cost of following them is greater than the cost of ignoring them, then they ought to be ignored. Dojo is above all  pardon the word  pragmatic. It exists solely to help build great applications. And anything that gets in the way of this goal is fungible, particularly when the default behavior of every browser on the planet is to allow the behavior in question. Nonstandard attributes are a “spirit of the law” type of technique, and we’re happy to see that HTML 5  currently in draft form  explicitly allows these so-called expando attributes, in effect legitimizing the approach Dojo has taken for years.  It is sad, though, that we even need to be having this discus- sion. Internet Explorer had HTCs for deﬁning new element types and Mozilla implemented XBL, but they are not compatible with each other, so Dojo’s widget system jumps into the breech to allow you to easily specify new “elements” in your document. It’s our sincere hope that someday in the future all of this will be deprecated in favor of something like XBL2, but until then, pragmatism rules.   LOADING DOJO  82  modules aren’t loaded more than once  it simply returns immediately if the module already exists . It guarantees the requested module has loaded successfully before returning or throws an exception.  The sole required argument  a string  to dojo.require gives a module name. As discussed above in Section 4.1, Modularizing JavaScript, on page 71, these names map to the ﬁle system. For example, "dojo.a.b.c" maps to the script dojo-module-path a b c.js, and loading the script is as simple as writing the following:  dojo.require "dojo.a.b.c" ;  There’s actually a bit more to say about dojo.require, but since this addi- tional material overlaps deployment issues, we’re going to put the rest of the story on hold until Chapter 11, The Dojo Loader and Build Sys- tem, on page 286.  Now that we have Dojo loaded and initialized, let’s start using it. We’ll begin with several little but useful extensions to core JavaScript. That’s the subject of the next chapter.   Chapter 5  JavaScript Language Extensions  Dojo provides some functions that, loosely speaking, extend the core JavaScript library. These functions are not attached to a particular problem domain but rather are foundational to JavaScript program- ming. They are also at the very bottom of the dependency hierarchy.  The material in this chapter demonstrates some of JavaScript’s true beauty and power. We’ll see functions that write other little JavaScript functions on the ﬂy, resulting in highly expressive, powerful, yet easy code. If you’re already a JavaScript  or functional programming  guru, then you’ll breeze through the material; if not, get set to use JavaScript for something more than gloriﬁed BASIC!  We’ll begin by exploring dojo.hitch, a function that, directly or indi- rectly, is pervasive in Dojo. Next we’ll look at Dojo’s array functions— which actually are Mozilla JavaScript 1.6 core library functions. Unfor- tunately, not all browsers implement them yet. We’ll conclude with a few utilities functions that test manipulate an object’s type structure. All in all, the functions described will make your programs easier and more enjoyable to write.  5.1 Binding with dojo.hitch  Sometimes you need to pass a method of an object to another function as an argument. At one time or another, just about every programmer has tried to write something like someFunction someObject.someMethod  to solve this problem...and failed. dojo.hitch solves this problem of bind- ing context to a method.   BINDING WITH DOJO.HITCH  84  Alex Says. . .  dojo.hitch Is Important  dojo.hitch is very important for two reasons. First, JavaScript functions are not bound to the scope in which they’re deﬁned. Languages such as Python have “implicit binding,” which allows the assignment of function references to pseudomagi- cally hold on to their “enclosing” object. JavaScript has no such implicit wrapping. Said another way, JavaScript functions are “promiscuous.” They take easily to whatever scope you exe- cute them in, and understanding how and why this is so pro- vides deep insight into JavaScript as a language. Binding con- text and or arguments is an idiom used frequently in functional programming  aka currying .∗  Understanding JavaScript as a functional language can make you a much better JavaScript programmer. Second, many important Dojo functions take a context and a function as arguments, so getting used to the pattern will make many parts of Dojo feel more familiar. In each case, the semantics of these arguments are the same as with dojo.hitch.  In practical ∗. Pure functional programs have no concept of terms, this means they don’t have an assignment operation or other side effects. If such a concept sounds exciting, check out [AS96], [Mac90], or my slides on aspect-oriented and functional programming in JavaScript  http:  alex.dojotoolkit.org wp-content AOP_and_FP_in_JS.pdf .  state.  Binding Context  Let’s begin by exploring that naive attempt mentioned earlier to pass a method  m  of an object  o  as an argument to some function that will call o.m. Here’s a simple object that accumulates a sum and returns the result. We’ll use theAccumulator.getResult for o.m in our example:  Line 1  var theAccumulator= {  total: 0, clear: function   {  this.total= 0;  }, add: function x  {  this.total+= x;  }, getResult: function   {  10  return this.total;  }  };  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -   BINDING WITH DOJO.HITCH  85  Next, we need a function that takes another function as an argument to demonstrate passing theAccumulator.getResult as a parameter. A func- tion that prints the return value of calling its single argument will work:  Line 1    display a message box with the result of calling f... function printResult f  {  alert "result= " + f   ;  }  With this in place, let’s use theAccumulator to add 100 to 200 and then print the total by calling printResult, passing theAccumulator.getResult as the argument. At one time or another, just about every programmer has tried something like this:  Line 1  theAccumulator.clear  ; theAccumulator.add 100 ; theAccumulator.add 200 ;    this is wrong! printResult theAccumulator.getResult ;  We expect to see “result= 300” printed in the message box, but instead, the message box prints “result= undeﬁned.” Here’s the problem: when theAccumulator.getResult is passed to printResult, the function isn’t bound to any context. So, when the parameter f is invoked by printResult, this ref- erences the global object space and the global variable total is evaluated, not theAccumulator ’s total. The problem can be corrected by writing this:  printResult function  {return theAccumulator.getResult  ;} ;  When the function function  {return theAccumulator.getResult  ;} is called by printResult, getResult is explicitly bound to theAccumulator, and “result= 300” is printed in the message box as expected.  The function dojo.hitch manufactures these little functions for us. For the moment, we’ll limit the discussion to cases where dojo.hitch is given one or two arguments  it can take more, which we will discuss shortly . If two arguments are given, then the ﬁrst argument  an object  gives the context in which the second argument  a function or string designat- ing a function  should execute. dojo.hitch takes these arguments and returns a function that invokes the second argument in the context of the ﬁrst. Here’s how dojo.hitch works in code:  Line 1  dojo.hitch o, o.f ;    o an object, f a member function of o, returns... function   {return o.f.apply o, arguments ;}  dojo.hitch o, "f" ;    o an object, f the name of a member function of o, returns... function   {return o["f"].apply o, arguments ;}  -  -  -  -  -  -  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  5   BINDING WITH DOJO.HITCH  86  The only difference between the two forms is that the second argument is given as an identiﬁer in the ﬁrst example and a string in the second. When the second argument is a member function of the ﬁrst argument as shown earlier  we’ll see that this need not be the case in a moment , the second form saves some typing.  We can use dojo.hitch to write the function in the motivating example. This...  Line 1  printResult function  {return theAccumulator.getResult  ;} ;  becomes the following:  printResult dojo.hitch theAccumulator, "getResult"  ;  Binding a member function to an object that deﬁnes that member is almost always what you want, but it is perfectly legal to bind an ordi- nary function or a function that’s a member of another object. Here’s how dojo.hitch works in both cases:  Line 1  dojo.hitch o, f ;    o an object, f a function, returns... function   {return f.apply o, arguments ;}  dojo.hitch o, p.f ;    o, p objects, o!=p, f a member function of p, returns... function   {return p.f.apply o, arguments ;}  By deﬁnition, this type of binding causes f, which is not a member of o to execute in the context of o. You can visualize this as a kind of dynamic, per-function mixing  as in mixin . This technique is actually a lot more useful than you might think; here’s an example that demon- strates the use pattern.  Assume you have the function showData that gets a number from a data source and pushes it into a document element. The function might look something like this:  Line 1  function showData   {  var x= this.getData  ; dojo.byId "showData" .innerHTML= "The result= " + x;  -  -  -  }  Notice that the data displayed by showData depends upon the value of this when showData is invoked. So, showData must be bound to a context that deﬁnes getData, and binding showData to different contexts will cause it to show different data.  -  -  -  -  -  5   Here are a couple of different data sources to exercise showData:  BINDING WITH DOJO.HITCH  87  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  Line 1    generates 1, 2, 3, ... var dataSrc1 = {  value: 0, getData: function   {return this.value++;}  };  };    generates 5, 10, 15, ... var dataSrc2 = {  value: 0, getData: function   {return  this.value+= 5 ;}  Finally, here’s an example of binding showData to these different data sources and hooking them to a click event.1  dojo.byId "f3" .onclick= dojo.hitch dataSrc1, showData ; dojo.byId "f4" .onclick= dojo.hitch dataSrc2, showData ;  Clicking the "f3" element causes the ﬁrst data source to be accessed, while clicking the "f4" element causes the second data source to be accessed.  If only one argument is given to dojo.hitch, then it is assumed that the context argument was omitted. Specifying null for the ﬁrst argument has the same effect. Either way, the function is executed in the global object space. Here’s how dojo.hitch works with these types of arguments:  Line 1    note: dojo.global holds a reference to the global object space    first form dojo.hitch null, f ;   f a function, is the same as... dojo.hitch f ;   which returns...  f    second form dojo.hitch null, "f" ;   is the same as... dojo.hitch "f" ;   which returns...  function   {return dojo.global[f].apply dojo.global, arguments ;}  The ﬁrst form selects f from the current scope, while the second form selects global f  that is, f in the global scope . In both cases, using dojo.hitch to bind a function with null isn’t very useful—until we also bind arguments, the next topic in our discussion.  If we weren’t trying to demonstrate hitch, we would actually bind showData to dataSrc1 1. and connect to the click event by writing dojo.connect dojo.byId "f3" , "click", dataSrc1, show- Data ; it’s similar for binding dataSrc2. See Section 6.1, Programming DOM Events with Dojo, on page 101 for details about dojo.connect.   BINDING WITH DOJO.HITCH  88  Binding Arguments  If you step back and think about it for a moment, you’ll realize that the context in which a function is executed could be viewed as just another argument to the function. Since we just showed how dojo.hitch is used to bind context, you might ask, “Is it possible to bind other arguments?” As you probably guessed, the answer is “yes.”  To motivate our discussion, consider a case where you want to pass additional arguments to an event handler and these arguments are determined when the handler is connected rather than when the han- dler is invoked. Heuristically, you’d like to do something like this:    this won't work! dojo.byId "someId" .click= handler someArg ;  This won’t work because the statement immediately calls handler and then passes the result as the handler—not a function that invokes han- dler someArg . We can ﬁx it by using a function literal:  dojo.byId "someId" .click= function  {handler someArg ;};  Just like binding context, dojo.hitch can be used to build these lit- tle functions on the ﬂy. If more than two arguments are provided to dojo.hitch, then a function object is manufactured that executes the passed function in the correct context and provides the extra argu- ments when the manufactured function object is executed. Here’s what it looks like in pseudo-JavaScript:  Line 1  dojo.hitch context, f, a1, ..., an ;   returns...  -  -  function  {return context.f.apply   context, [a1, ..., an].concat arguments  ;};  [a1,..., an].concat arguments  creates an array of arguments that’s passed to context.f when it is invoked. The ﬁrst n arguments are those that were provided when dojo.hitch was called; the remaining arguments  if any  are provided when the function object manufactured by dojo.hitch is invoked.  Since this can be a bit confusing, here’s a quick example to drive it all home. First, deﬁne a function that takes three arguments and prints out the concatenated arguments to a message box:  function print3Args a1, a2, a3  {  alert a1 + a2 + a3 ;  }  Next, use dojo.hitch to preset two of the arguments:  var printArg= dojo.hitch null, print3Args, "this", " is " ;   BINDING WITH DOJO.HITCH  89  Finally, exercise printArg by invoking it with a single argument:  Line 1  printArg "easy." ;   ...prints "this is easy"    effectively, print3Args "this", " is ", "easy."  was called.  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  printArg "beautiful." ;   ...prints "this is beautiful"    effectively, print3Args "this", " is ", "beautiful."  was called.  printArg "not the key to life!" ;    ...prints "this is not the key to life!"   effectively, print3Args "this", " is ", "not the key to life!  was called.  In the previous code, dojo.hitch manufactured a function called print- Arg, which calls print3Args with the ﬁrst and second arguments set to "this" and "is", respectively. Any arguments provided to printArg when it is invoked are passed along to print3Args subsequent to the ﬁrst two arguments.  We also illustrated that both the context and the function must be spec- iﬁed when binding arguments. If the function is a method on another object, then there’s nothing new here. But if the function is just an ordi- nary function deﬁned in the current scope when passed to dojo.hitch, then null must be speciﬁed for context when binding arguments.  Recognizing that forcing null to be provided in these situations is a bit inconvenient, Dojo provides the function dojo.partial that does not accept a context argument. In effect, dojo.hitch null, f,...  is equivalent to dojo.partial f,... .  If we return to our motivating example, we wanted to bind arguments to an event handler when it was connected rather than when it is invoked. dojo.hitch allows us to solve the problem without explicitly writing out a function literal.  dojo.byId "someId" .click= function  {handler someArg ;};  dojo.byId "someId" .click= dojo.hitch null, handler, someArg ;  So the following...  becomes...  or, equivalently...  dojo.byId "someId" .click= dojo.partial handler, someArg ;  Binding context and arguments to a function and returning another function is a cornerstone of functional programming. You will use dojo. hitch —directly or indirectly—all the time. You simply can’t be a good Dojo programmer without understanding it well.   5.2 JavaScript 1.6 Array Methods  JAVASCRIPT 1.6 ARRAY METHODS  90  Ask yourself, how many times have you written something like for  var i= 0; i<someArray.length; i++ ? Although the body of the loop is unique each time, the looping control statement is not, and this is an excellent time to employ the power of JavaScript to eliminate such rote code.  Indeed, JavaScript 1.6, as deﬁned by Mozilla, includes several built- in array methods that help with these kinds of tasks.2 Dojo provides the same functions for browsers that don’t implement JavaScript 1.6 natively:    dojo.indexOf: Returns the ﬁrst index of a matching item in an array    dojo.lastIndexOf: Returns the last index of a matching item in an    dojo.every: Tests whether all elements in an array cause a test    dojo.some: Tests whether some elements in an array cause a test  or -1 if not found  array or -1 if not found  function to return true  function to return true    dojo.ﬁlter: Creates a new array composed of all elements in a array  that pass through a ﬁlter function    dojo.map: Creates a new array composed of the results of calling a  function on every element in a array    dojo.forEach: Passes each element in an array to a function  There are good reasons to use these Dojo functions. Certainly the code is cleaner and more expressive. Further, there is less opportunity to make many common coding mistakes since you don’t have to hand- code a loop each time you need one of the algorithms.  Notice that dojo.every, dojo.some, dojo.ﬁlter, dojo.map, and dojo.forEach iterate through an array, applying a function  that we’ll call the call- back function  to each element in the array to achieve some result. Not surprisingly, these functions have the same signature:  a, f, context , where a is the array, f is the callback function, and context  optional  is the context in which to execute f. Effectively, given f and context, the callback function is given by dojo.hitch context, f .  Similarly, a single signature is deﬁned for the callback function:  item, index, array , where item and index are the current array element and index in the iteration and array is the array.  2. See http:  developer.mozilla.org en docs Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference:Global_Objects:Array.   JAVASCRIPT 1.6 ARRAY METHODS  91  Let’s work through a few quick examples here. A for loop that iterates through an array is probably the most frequently uttered code phrase of all time. Usually, it looks like this:  for  var i= 0, end= theArray.length; i<end; i++  {    do something interesting with theArray[i]  dojo.forEach is a drop-in replacement:  dojo.forEach theArray, function x {    called once for each array element   do something interesting with x which is theArray[i]  We speciﬁed a function literal for the callback function—a common idiom. Further, in our callback function, we didn’t deﬁne the index and array arguments. This is perfectly legal and quite common. Of course, the arguments will be passed even if you don’t use them.  There is one gotcha here. The JavaScript 1.6 array methods are deﬁned by the built-in Array class, whereas the Dojo counterparts are just plain functions that must be given the target array as the ﬁrst argument. Therefore, there is an extra argument required  the array  when the Dojo versions of these functions are used. Just for comparison, here is forEach in JavaScript 1.6:  theArray.forEach function x {    called once for each array element   do something interesting with x which is theArray[i]  Now that we’ve seen the basics, let’s exercise each function in the API. We’ll use the array src= [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] as input. Here’s the code required to see whether all or some of the contents of src are odd numbers:  }  } ;  } ;  Line 1  var src= [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -    see if every element is odd... var allOdd= dojo.every src, function x {  return x%2;  } ;   allOdd is now false    see if some element is odd... var someOdd= dojo.some src, function x {  10  return x%2;  } ;   someOdd is now true   JAVASCRIPT 1.6 ARRAY METHODS  92  We can also make a new array that has just the odd numbers:  Line 1    filter just the odd numbers out of src... var odds= dojo.filter src, function x {  return x%2;  } ;   odds is now [1, 3, 5]   src is STILL [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  Next, let’s make a new array by doubling each element in the src array:  Line 1    make a new array by doubling each element in src... var multiplyBy2= dojo.map src, function x {  return x*2;  } ;   multiplyBy2 is now [2, 4, 6, 8, 10];   src is STILL [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  None of this is particularly surprising or complicated. And that’s exactly the point. It’s much better than handwritten loops for all the reasons listed in the beginning of this section.  To demonstrate the context argument, let’s calculate the sum of the contents of src. First, we need an accumulator object:  Line 1  var accumulator= {  total: 0, add: function x {this.total+= x;}  };  Now we’ll use dojo.forEach to pass each element in src to accumulator:  accumulator.total= 0; dojo.forEach src, accumulator.add, accumulator ;   accumulator.total is now 15  In the previous examples, notice that passing a function literal implies a fair amount of rote syntax:  Line 1  function item [, index] [, array]  {    function-body  }  The really interesting part is the function body. Recognizing this, these functions can accept the function body as a string. When this technique is used, a function is created on the ﬂy with the parameter names item, index, and array. Here are all the examples rewritten in this alternate syntax:  Line 1    see if every element is odd... var allOdd= dojo.every src, "return item%2;" ;   allOdd is now false  -  -  -  5  -  -  -  -  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -   JAVASCRIPT 1.6 ARRAY METHODS  93  10  15  20  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  5  -  -  -  5  -    see if some element is odd... var someOdd= dojo.some src, "return item%2;" ;   someOdd is now true    filter just the odd numbers out of src... var odds= dojo.filter src, "return item%2;" ;   odds is now [1, 3, 5]   src is STILL [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]    make a new array by doubling each element in src... var multiplyBy2= dojo.map src, "return item*2;" ;   multiplyBy2 is now [2, 4, 6, 8, 10];   src is STILL [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  var accumulator = {total: 0}; dojo.forEach src, "this.total+= item;", accumulator ;   accumulator.total is now 15  The last example that accumulates a sum demonstrates a gotcha: the function is executed in the global scope unless a context argument is provided and is not closed on any local variables. For example, you can close on local variables when using the function literal syntax:  Line 1  var total= 0; dojo.forEach src, function x {  total+= x;  } ;   total is now 15  Line 1  var total= 0; try {  } catch  e  {  alert e ;  }  dojo.forEach src, "total+= item;" ;  But something similar won’t work using the function-body-as-a-string syntax:  The previous code will throw an exception since total is not deﬁned in the global scope.  This leaves us with the trivial dojo.indexOf and dojo.lastIndexOf. These functions search an array for the ﬁrst last occurrence of an object. Both have the signature  a, target, startIndex , where a is the array, target is the element to search for, and startIndex is the location in the array to begin the search. The JavaScript operator == is used to satisfy the search condition, and -1 is returned if a match is not found.   SUPPOR T FOR POLYMORPHISM  94  Here are a few examples:  Line 1  -  -  -  5  -  var src= [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5]; var result; result= dojo.indexOf src, 3 ;   result is now 2 result= dojo.indexOf src, 3, result+1 ;   result is now 3 result= dojo.lastIndexOf src, 3 ;   result is now 4 result= dojo.lastIndexOf src, 3, result-1 ;    result is now 3  Simple. Expressive. Too bad everything isn’t so easy!  5.3 Support for Polymorphism  Polymorphism allows us to invoke a function and have the function do the right thing depending upon the types of the arguments provided. For example, invoking the method area on an instance of type Circle does something different than invoking area on an instance of type Rect- angle. In both cases, the instance could be viewed as the ﬁrst argument to the function area, which performs a computation depending upon the type of this ﬁrst argument. In this sense, area is polymorphic.  It happens that most polymorphic functions resolve on a single type. It is easy enough to build such functions—just make them a method of each type that supports the function. However, sometimes this isn’t practical for one or both of the following reasons:    It is undesirable to include the method in the type deﬁnition  for example, the type’s interface may be sprawling or closed, or the method may depend on several concepts independent of the type .    The function’s behavior depends on more than one argument’s  type.  In both cases we’re left with branching to different execution paths based on the arguments’ types. Most of the time, you’ll be able to use JavaScript’s instanceof operator to determine argument types. Occa- sionally instanceof doesn’t work with the fundamental types. For exam- ple:  Line 1  function t1 theObject {  return  theObject instanceof String ;  } function t2 theObject {  return  typeof theObject == "string" ;  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  }  var b;   SUPPOR T FOR POLYMORPHISM  95  10  -  -  -  -    b is false   b is true  b= t1 "test" ; b= t2 "test" ; s= new String "test" ; b= t1 s ; b= t2 s ;    b is true   b is false  Certain JavaScript interpreters included in various browsers also con- tain errors that further confound the problem with other types  for example, calculating whether an object is a function in Safari .  Dojo rescues us with a set of functions that abstract away all these problems:    dojo.isString test : Returns true if test is either a string literal or a    dojo.isArray test : Returns true if test is an Array or derives from    dojo.isFunction test : Returns true if test is a function or derives from    dojo.isObject test : Returns true if test is null, an object, an array,  string variable  Array  function  or a function    dojo.isArrayLike test : Returns true if test has a ﬁnite length property  and is not a string, a function, or a DOM form node    dojo.isAlien test : Returns true if test is a built-in function that  should report as a function but does not  Although JavaScript 1.x does not include the concept of function over- loading, you can get the same effect by using these functions to branch code based on argument types. Essentially, this allows you to build functions that have semantics based upon not only their name but also upon the types of the arguments provided to the function at runtime. Here’s an example of the use pattern:  Line 1  function someFunction theValue { if  dojo.isString theValue   {  _someFunction_string theValue ;  } else if  dojo.isFunction theValue   {  _someFunction_func theValue ;  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  } else {  }  }  throw new Error "improper type for someFunction" ;  In the example, we dispatched to “private” functions based on the ac- tual type of theValue.   COMBINING, STRUCTURING, AND COPYING OBJECTS  96  This question arises: when should type calculations  that is, expres- sions that use types as operands  be used to alter the behavior of a sin- gle function compared to just deﬁning multiple functions and instruct- ing client code to call the correct version? There are two reasons to use type calculations to simulate function overloading:    When the function is called by client code that may not know the argument types, factoring the type calculations into the function eliminates this code from being duplicated at every location that the function is called.    To simplify the client API by providing fewer functions that work  in more situations.  Clearly, a single function should always be used when conditions given by the ﬁrst reason exist. On the other hand, the second reason is largely a matter of taste. But remember, if type calculations are used, then those calculations will be executed every time the function is executed, resulting in a performance hit. If the calculations are complicated and the function is invoked frequently, this performance hit may be notice- able. We generally use the following heuristic:  1. Always factor argument type calculations into the function when  the calling clients do not know the types of the arguments.  2. Tend to factor argument type calculations into the function when the function call is written frequently  that is, written in the code  with a few, well-understood argument signatures.  3. Otherwise, tend to deﬁne a family of functions that requires differ-  ent parameter signatures if any of the following conditions exist:    When the function is private    When the function is called frequently during execution    When the type calculations are complicated  5.4 Combining, Structuring, and Copying Objects  We’re going to spend an entire chapter exploring how to use the function dojo.declare to build constructor functions that create classes of objects  see Chapter 9, Deﬁning Classes with dojo.declare, on page 225 . Some- times dojo.declare is much more than you need. For example, copy- ing the properties from one object into another object is a common   COMBINING, STRUCTURING, AND COPYING OBJECTS  97  JavaScript programming pattern, and you shouldn’t have to deﬁne a new class just to get this functionality. Dojo helps by deﬁning several lightweight functions that accomplish per-object structure and content manipulations.  Mixing Objects  The function dojo.mixin dest, src1, [src2, [...]]  copies all the properties from the object s  src1, src2, ..., into dest. Copying is accomplished with the JavaScript assignment operator. So, numbers, booleans, and strings are copied by value, while all other types are copied by reference.  Let’s look at a couple of common use patterns. Say you have an object myObject and you want to copy several properties into it. You could do it manually:  Line 1  myObject.prop1= 123.456; myObject.prop2= "hello, world"; myObject.someProp= yourObject;  Or, you could use dojo.mixin to accomplish the same thing:  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  Line 1  dojo.mixin myObject, {  prop1: 123.456, prop2: "hello, world", someProp: yourObject} ;  Of course, this works with named objects...  Line 1  myObject.prop1= yourObject.prop1; myObject.prop2= yourObject.prop2; myObject.someProp= yourObject.someProp;  which becomes the following:  dojo.mixin myObject, yourObject ;  dojo.mixin is slightly less verbose and adds a bit of modularity when compared to the manual method—both good things.  There are a few things to notice about dojo.mixin. First, if the destination object already has a property that is speciﬁed in a source object, then the original property will be overwritten. Further, when more than one source object is provided, the rightmost source wins. Here’s an example that demonstrates this phenomenon:  myObject= {p: 1}; dojo.mixin myObject, {p:2}, {p:3} ;   myOjbect.p is now set to 3!   COMBINING, STRUCTURING, AND COPYING OBJECTS  98  What Is a Prototype?  Every object in JavaScript contains a reference to another object termed its prototype. Since the prototype is another object itself, it also contains a reference to its prototype. This forms a chain of objects. The chain terminates with the proto- type for the built-in Object type.  When a property of an object is read, JavaScript looks for the property in the object. If not found, JavaScript then looks in the prototype object, the prototype of the prototype, and so on, up the prototype chain until the property is found or the chain is exhausted. Since a method is just a property that happens to be a function, this is how method dispatching occurs, and this system is called prototypal inheritance.  Second, with the exception of any property in Object’s prototype, prop- erties from the source object are fully enumerated. This means that any property that is deﬁned in the prototype chain of each source object will be copied—up to but not including Object’s prototype. If you need a quick refresher on prototypes, see the sidebar on the current page.  Finally, sometimes the name can be misleading. dojo.mixin does not cre- ate a mixin class  we’ll talk about mixin classes in Chapter 9, Deﬁn- ing Classes with dojo.declare, on page 225 . Instead, it is augmenting the source object by “mixing in” the properties from one or more other objects.  Copying Objects  Sometimes you need to copy a variable by value. This is easy if the variable is a number, boolean, or string since the semantics of the JavaScript assignment operator copy these types by value. But, if you need to copy any other type, the JavaScript assignment operator won’t work  remember, it copies anything other than numbers, booleans, and strings by reference . Instead, you must traverse the entire object, including any nested objects, and create new instances at each node in the traversal. The function dojo.clone src  accomplishes exactly this functionality.  To visualize the differences between assigning, mixing, and cloning, we’ll create an object, exercise all three copy techniques, and then   COMBINING, STRUCTURING, AND COPYING OBJECTS  99   cid:13  cid:14  cid:22  cid:17  cid:16    cid:11  cid:13  cid:13  cid:14  cid:11  cid:12  cid:13  cid:7  cid:15  cid:5  cid:16    cid:5  cid:11  cid:8  cid:4    cid:12  cid:15  cid:19  cid:13    cid:3  cid:15  cid:12  cid:11  cid:13  cid:7  cid:15  cid:5    cid:13  cid:14  cid:22  cid:27  cid:16    cid:5  cid:11  cid:8  cid:4    cid:12  cid:15  cid:19  cid:13    cid:3  cid:15  cid:12  cid:11  cid:13  cid:7  cid:15  cid:5    cid:13  cid:14  cid:22  cid:28  cid:16    cid:5  cid:11  cid:8  cid:4    cid:12  cid:15  cid:19  cid:13    cid:3  cid:15  cid:12  cid:11  cid:13  cid:7  cid:15  cid:5    cid:1  cid:2  cid:3  cid:4  cid:5  cid:6  cid:4  cid:7  cid:8  cid:9  cid:10  cid:11  cid:3  cid:11  cid:12  cid:4  cid:1    cid:1  cid:2  cid:3  cid:4  cid:5  cid:6  cid:4  cid:7  cid:8  cid:9  cid:10  cid:11  cid:3  cid:11  cid:12  cid:4  cid:1    cid:1  cid:2  cid:3  cid:4  cid:5  cid:6  cid:4  cid:7  cid:8  cid:9  cid:10  cid:11  cid:3  cid:11  cid:12  cid:4  cid:1    cid:17  cid:18    cid:17  cid:18    cid:17  cid:18    cid:26  cid:7  cid:12  cid:4  cid:19  cid:13  cid:4  cid:14  cid:16    cid:12  cid:7  cid:13  cid:22    cid:20  cid:2  cid:7  cid:12  cid:4  cid:19  cid:13  cid:4  cid:14  cid:21    cid:12  cid:15  cid:25  cid:5  cid:13  cid:14  cid:22    cid:20  cid:23  cid:24  cid:21    cid:7  cid:8  cid:9  cid:5  cid:10  cid:11  cid:12  cid:13  cid:8  cid:9  cid:8  cid:9  cid:14  cid:12  cid:5  cid:11  cid:13  cid:5  cid:15  cid:5  cid:13  cid:5  cid:2  cid:16  cid:5  cid:17  cid:11  cid:2  cid:8  cid:9  cid:11  cid:17  cid:18  cid:8  cid:19  cid:2    cid:1  cid:2  cid:2  cid:3  cid:4  cid:5  cid:6    cid:12  cid:7  cid:13  cid:22    cid:20  cid:2  cid:7  cid:12  cid:4  cid:19  cid:13  cid:4  cid:14  cid:21    cid:12  cid:15  cid:25  cid:5  cid:13  cid:14  cid:22    cid:20  cid:23  cid:24  cid:21   Figure 5.1: Effects of different copy methods  draw out the resulting object space. The source object contains another object to fully demonstrate the differences. Here is the code:  Line 1    create an object with some properties var bicester= {city: "Bicester", country: "UK"}; var attraction= {name: "Blenheim Palace", cost: 15, location: bicester};  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  var try1, try2, try3; try1= attraction; try2= dojo.mixin {}, attraction ; try3= dojo.clone attraction ;  In Figure 5.1, you can see the objects that are created by the code. Note how the JavaScript assignment operator  try1= attraction  just added another name to the source object  this is an example of a so-called shallow copy . At the other extreme, dojo.clone ensured that a com- pletely new object space was created  a so-called deep copy .  Copying Array-like Objects  The last kind of copying that comes up occasionally involves turning array-like objects  for example, the built-in arguments object  into a real array. The function dojo._toArray src, start  creates an array and ﬁlls it with src[start], src[start+1],..., src[src.length-1]. start is optional and, if miss- ing, is assumed to be zero.   COMBINING, STRUCTURING, AND COPYING OBJECTS  100  Privacy in the Bedroom  Remember when you were a kid playing and you tried to hide by jumping into a bed and pulling the covers over your head? You couldn’t be seen, but everybody knew you were there because of the big breathing, laughing lump in the bed.  We jokingly call variables with names that start with an under- score bed lump functions. They are supposed to be private, but everybody can see and use them. These kinds of private functions are every bit as robust as those found in the public interface. The only potential downside is that they are slightly  depending upon the function  more likely to change in future releases. As we explore the Dojo APIs, we’ll describe a few bed lump functions that are particularly useful and unlikely to change in future releases.  Note the requirements for the source object: it must be an object and deﬁne the property length that returns an integer. In Dojo, functions that begin with an underscore are “kinda, sorta” private; see the sidebar on this page for details.   Chapter 6  Asynchronous Programming  If you want to program the browser to do anything dynamically—and we mean anything—you must hook up your code to a DOM event. Then you ﬁnd out that there are two different event APIs. Not to be outdone, Internet Explorer provides a third API—complete with memory leaks for good measure. And a detailed study of these APIs reveals several browser-dependent inconsistencies and idiosyncrasies. Event program- ming quickly becomes a huge headache.  Fortunately for us, Dojo includes a complete event programming frame- work that ﬁxes these problems. But Dojo doesn’t stop with events. Event programming is an example of the asynchronous programming model, and Dojo includes several function families to build all kinds of interesting and powerful programs using this model.  This chapter is all about asynchronous programming with Dojo. We start by exploring Dojo’s solution to the event programming mess cre- ated by the browser vendors. Then we look at how Dojo extends the event framework to handle user-deﬁned events and further leverages user-deﬁned events to provide a publish-subscribe framework—very cool stuff. We conclude the chapter with an in-depth example of Dojo’s Deferred class, which manages complex interactions between asynchro- nous functions, their callbacks, and other interested processes.  6.1 Programming DOM Events with Dojo  Dojo provides a single DOM event framework that works identically across all supported browsers; Dojo even ﬁxes the memory leaks that come for free with Internet Explorer. Dojo’s DOM event framework func- tions mostly like the W3C DOM Level 2 event model  available from   PROGRAMMING DOM EVENTS WITH DOJO  102   cid:9  cid:4  cid:7  cid:10  cid:2  cid:3  cid:4    cid:1  cid:2  cid:3  cid:4  cid:5  cid:6  cid:7  cid:8  cid:3    cid:3  cid:2  cid:3  cid:4  cid:5   !  cid:19  cid:17  cid:16  cid:25  cid:6  cid:3  cid:29  cid:11  cid:24  cid:10  cid:27  cid:3  cid:30  cid:6  cid:12  cid:27  cid:8  cid:12  cid:31  cid:6    cid:24  cid:16  cid:18  cid:9  cid:3  cid:6   cid:18  cid:5  cid:5  cid:16  cid:4  cid:20    cid:1  cid:2  cid:3  cid:4  cid:5  cid:6  cid:7  cid:8  cid:9  cid:10  cid:11  cid:5  cid:12  cid:13  cid:8  cid:4  cid:14  cid:6  cid:15  cid:16  cid:14  cid:8  cid:12   "   cid:17  cid:18  cid:4  cid:12  cid:5  cid:8  cid:16  cid:4  cid:19  cid:20  cid:6  cid:21   cid:6  cid:6  cid:22  cid:22  cid:23  cid:16  cid:6  cid:9  cid:16  cid:24  cid:3  cid:5  cid:13  cid:8  cid:4  cid:14  cid:6  cid:8  cid:4  cid:5  cid:3  cid:25  cid:3  cid:9  cid:5  cid:8  cid:4  cid:14   cid:26     $   cid:7  cid:3  cid:17  cid:11  cid:18  cid:27  cid:5  cid:6  cid:28  cid:25  cid:16  cid:12  cid:3  cid:9  cid:9  cid:8  cid:4  cid:14   Figure 6.1: Event processing in the browser  http:  www.w3.org TR DOM-Level-2-Events  . In cases where the browser does this anyway, Dojo simply passes event handler connection  disconnection requests to the DOM functions addEventListener  removeEventListener. Where the browser model is grossly different from the W3C model, Dojo simulates the W3C model. Finally, where the W3C model leaves openings for implementation-deﬁned behavior, Dojo deﬁnes this behavior.  Here’s the event-driven programming model in a nutshell: when some- thing happens  the event , a function is automatically invoked  the han- dler . The event, sometimes called a signal, may be a device event such as a mouse gesture or a software event such as submitting a form. The handler, also called a listener or callback, is a function that’s passed a well-deﬁned set of arguments and that executes in a well-deﬁned con- text. In Figure 6.1, you can see a conceptual view of how event pro- gramming works in the browser.  Writing Event Handlers  We’ll explore Dojo’s DOM event framework by writing a simple event handler that prints out information about an event; later, we’ll use Dojo to connect the handler to a click event. Along the way we will describe event propagation and default processing—both of which can be affected by an event handler. We’ll also look at Dojo’s extension to the W3C model for handling keyboard events.   PROGRAMMING DOM EVENTS WITH DOJO  103  The Handler Signature  Handlers are functions. The Dojo event framework provides a single argument termed the event object to handler functions; this object con- tains several properties methods that describe control the event as speciﬁed by the W3C event model—even when the browser happens to be Internet Explorer, which doesn’t implement this model natively. If you’re writing a handler that doesn’t need the event object, just deﬁne a function with no parameters.1 Since we’ll use the event object to log information about the event, our handler function includes a parameter to receive the event object:  Line 1  function handleClick eventObj {    TODO...print information about the event  -  -  }  Three types of event objects form a single-inheritance chain: MouseEvent derives from UIEvent, which derives from Event. The complete event type space is shown in Figure 6.2, on the following page  the diagram also shows keyboard event objects, which we’ll discuss in a moment . The diagram includes the read-only properties available with each event object type.  The actual type of event object passed to a handler function depends upon the type of event being processed. In Figure 6.3, on page 116, you can see the event catalog that gives the event object type provided with each event.  Since we’re eventually going to hook up our handler to a click event, we’ll receive an event object of type UIEvent. Our handler uses this object to print out information about the event to the debugging console:  Line 1  function handleClick eventObj {  console.log   "Event " + eventObj.type + "  on DOM node " + eventObj.target.id + "; currentTarget= " + eventObj.currentTarget.id ;  -  -  -  5  -  }  Notice that our handler doesn’t return a value. Handlers shouldn’t return values, and anything returned will be ignored.  In JavaScript, it’s perfectly legal to provide a function with more arguments than 1. deﬁned parameters. Dojo will provide an event object to the handler even if the handler doesn’t deﬁne a parameter to receive it  that is, arguments[0] will always hold the event object .

We’ll do that soon, but ﬁrst, let’s look at a few details of the Dojo DOM event framework.  Keyboard Event Objects  The Event, UIEvent, and MouseEvent types are standardized by the W3C DOM Level 2 event model. Unfortunately, W3C doesn’t mention key- board events  oops! . Dojo augments the model slightly by adding prop- erties to the Event interface for key up down press events  also depicted in Figure 6.2, on the preceding page .  When writing handlers that connect to keyboard events, beware that different browsers use different virtual key codes for the same key. For example, F10 is 121 in Firefox and Internet Explorer but 63245 in Safari. Dojo rescues us with dojo.keys, which provides a map from a special key name to a virtual key code. For example, we can write the following:  Line 1  function someKeyDownHandler eventObj  {  switch  eventObj.keyCode  {  case dojo.keys.F10:   process F10 key....  console.log "you just pressed the F10 key" ; break;  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -    etc...  }  10  }  This code will work in any Dojo-supported browser. The following spe- cial keys are available as properties of dojo.keys:    SHIFT, CTRL, ALT, CAPS_LOCK, NUM_LOCK, SCROLL_LOCK   TAB, SPACE   ENTER, ESCAPE, PAUSE   SELECT, CLEAR   PAGE_ UPDOWNLEFTRIGHT , HOME, END,  LEFTRIGHT _ARROW,   INSERT, BACKSPACE, DELETE   NUMPAD_0..NUMPAD_9, NUMPAD_PLUS, NUMPAD_MINUS, NUMPAD_  MULTIPLY, NUMPAD_DIVIDE, NUMPAD_ENTER, NUMPAD_PERIOD     LEFTRIGHT _WINDOW   F1..F15   HELP   PROGRAMMING DOM EVENTS WITH DOJO  106  Event Propagation  Depending upon the event, the browser may dispatch a single event to many DOM nodes; this process is called event propagation. Handlers can affect propagation, and it’s important to understand propagation in order to construct optimal handler code.  Consider a click event: when a user clicks a DOM node, a click event is dispatched to the target node  the node upon which an event occurs is the target node  and then to its parent, grandparent, and so on, up to the top of the document tree. This dispatching process is called bub- bling. Right or wrong, the W3C Event speciﬁcation does not fully bubble some events, and Dojo does not change this behavior. In Figure 6.3, on page 116, you can see that events that bubble are marked with a B.  Bubbling allows us to consolidate code at parent nodes. For example, let’s say we have a div node that contains 100 child subtrees that are all identical in structure and all require an identical handler for a click event. We could attach the same handler to the 100 subtrees, or we could attach a single handler to the parent div. The single handler can then inspect the target property of the event object to determine the actual subtree that was clicked. This is clearly a better way.  Often, you will want to stop bubbling. For example, if a node lower in the tree handles an event and that handler directly calls a handler higher in the tree, then we surely don’t want to call the higher handler again as a consequence of bubbling. This is easily accomplished:  Line 1  function someHandler eventObj  {    do something interesting...    now, stop bubbling... eventObj.stopProgagation  ;  -  -  -  5  -  }  Many browsers can execute capturing before the event is dispatched to the target node. Capturing works exactly the opposite of bubbling: the event dispatcher calls every click handler attached to every node that is an ancestor of the target node, starting with its most distant relative and ending with its parent.  So, the maximum event propagation path is given as follows:  1. Capturing phase: call handlers attached to ancestors of the target  node, starting with the most distant and ending with the parent  2. Call handlers attached to the target node   PROGRAMMING DOM EVENTS WITH DOJO  107  3. Bubbling phase: call handlers attached to ancestors of the target  node, starting with the parent and ending with the most distant  When a handler is attached to an event, it is attached to either the capturing phase or the bubbling phase; if you want to see the event during both phases, then two handlers must be attached  although both handlers could be the same function .  Propagation can be stopped by any handler anywhere along the process by calling stopPropagation on the event object.  It is also possible to skip the capturing phase without affecting the last two steps, and this is exactly how the Dojo event framework works. This is a Good Thing. When you think about it, capturing is usually wrong.2 Capturing implies that more-general handlers are called before more-speciﬁc handlers. Why bother putting a handler lower in the DOM tree unless you want to “override” some handling higher in the tree? Of course, the higher-level handler can still be called directly from the lower-level handler if desired. This is much like calling a superclass method from within an overridden subclass method.  Let’s enhance our click handler to prevent bubbling when Shift + click is pressed:  Line 1  function handleClick eventObj {  console.log   "Event " + eventObj.type + "  on target " + eventObj.target.id + "; currentTarget= " + eventObj.currentTarget.id ;    eventObj is of type MouseEvent if  eventObj.shiftKey  {    stop bubbling shift-click was pressed. eventObj.stopPropagation  ;  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  }  }  In a moment we’ll hook this handler up to every node in a small DOM tree. The example will show bubbling in action  by pressing click  , and bubbling stops immediately  by pressing Shift + click  .  2. There is one case where handling an event during the capturing phase is required: capturing the mouse  that is, intercepting all mouse messages . Currently, Dojo does not expose a public interface to this functionality, and you must implement mouse capturing directly.   PROGRAMMING DOM EVENTS WITH DOJO  108  Default Processing  Each DOM event causes the browser to execute some default process- ing whether or not a handler is attached. For example, when the user clicks the submit button on a form, the browser sends the form data to the server. Event handlers can cancel the default processing for some kinds of events. For example, a submit event handler might prevent submitting a form to the server by canceling the default processing if errors are detected on the form.  Event handlers can cancel default processing by calling the preventDe- fault method on the event object like this:  Line 1  function someHandler eventObj  {    do something interesting...    now, prevent the default processing... eventObj.preventDefault  ;  }  See Figure 6.3, on page 116, which shows a list of the events that are cancelable.  Finally, the convenience function dojo.stopEvent event  calls both event. preventDefault   and event.stopPropagation  .  Line 1  function someHandler eventObj  {    do something interesting...    the statement... dojo.stopEvent eventObj ;    ...is exactly equivalent to... eventObj.stopProgagation  ; eventObj.preventDefault  ;  10  }  -  -  -  5  -  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  That’s all there is to writing handlers. Next, we’ll solve the problem of connecting handlers to DOM events.  Connecting Handlers  Dojo provides the function dojo.connect for connecting handlers to DOM events  later, we’ll see that dojo.connect can do more . It is the key to the Dojo event framework since it causes event handlers to work as we’ve described, independent of any particular browser. It has the following signature:  handle= dojo.connect obj, event, context, handler    PROGRAMMING DOM EVENTS WITH DOJO  109  Essentially, calling dojo.connect obj, event, context, handler  connects a handler to a DOM node event as if the W3C DOM method obj. addEventListener event, dojo.hitch context, handler , false  had been called. And Dojo does this even if the current browser is an Internet Explorer version that does not directly support addEventLister.  The ﬁrst two parameters, obj  a DOM node  and event  a string , deﬁne the event. In Figure 6.3, on page 116, you can see a list of avail- able DOM events and their names. The second two parameters, context  optional, an object  and handler  a function or string , deﬁne the han- dler. The context parameter is syntactic sugar for designating a handler that requires binding a function to a context  for example, a method to an object  without calling dojo.hitch explicitly. We’ll see this pattern used frequently in Dojo. If dojo.hitch is a little hazy, take a quick trip to Section 5.1, Binding with dojo.hitch, on page 83 for a refresher.  Armed with dojo.connect, we can connect the event handler on which we’ve been working. First, let’s build a little document to exercise our handler:  Download asynchronous-programming event.htm  Line 1           Now is the time to understand events!          connect disconnect handlers with dojo.connect disconnect.      Handlers are always passed an event-object.      Don't use "this" to reference the current target.      Events that can bubble always bubble; events never propagate.      Keyboard events and associated event objects are fully defined.           20     We’ll connect the handler to each DOM node in the body subtree:  Line 1  function connectExercise   {  dojo.connect dojo.byId "body" , "click", handleClick ; dojo.connect dojo.byId "body-div" , "click", handleClick ; dojo.connect dojo.byId "body-div-p" , "click", handleClick ;  10  15  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -   PROGRAMMING DOM EVENTS WITH DOJO  110  dojo.connect dojo.byId "body-div-ol" , "click", handleClick ; dojo.connect dojo.byId "body-div-ol-li-1" , "click", handleClick ; dojo.connect dojo.byId "body-div-ol-li-2" , "click", handleClick ; dojo.connect dojo.byId "body-div-ol-li-3" , "click", handleClick ; dojo.connect dojo.byId "body-div-ol-li-4" , "click", handleClick ; dojo.connect dojo.byId "body-div-ol-li-5" , "click", handleClick ;    Note!!   all the lines above can be replaced with   dojo.query "body *" .connect "click", handleClick ;   see Chapter 7  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  15  }  Since our handler does not require any particular context, we omitted the context argument.  It’s important to keep in mind that we’re building a demonstration of various event framework functionality—not optimal code to handle click events on all nodes of a DOM subtree. For example, although we’ve con- nected to every node to demonstrate bubbling, a “real” program would just connect the handler to the root of the subtree since the handler does the same thing no matter where it’s connected. Also, we explic- itly connected each node by ﬁnding the node by its id attribute. We’ll see how this can be done in a single line when we explore dojo.query in Section 7.2, Finding and Editing Nodes, on page 145.  When the document is loaded and the second list item is clicked, the console will ﬁll up with the following messages:  Line 1  -  -  -  Event click  on target body-div-ol-li-2; currentTarget= body-div-ol-li-2 Event click  on target body-div-ol-li-2; currentTarget= body-div-ol Event click  on target body-div-ol-li-2; currentTarget= body-div Event click  on target body-div-ol-li-2; currentTarget= body  Notice how the ﬁrst message shows that eventObj.currentTarget and even- tObject.target are identical. As the event bubbles up, eventObject.target stays constant, but eventObject.currentTarget changes to reﬂect the han- dler’s position in the subtree. Clicking the same list item with the Shift key pressed causes the handler to stop bubbling, resulting in a single message being sent to the debug console:  Line 1  Event click  on DOM node body-div-ol-li-2; currentTarget= body-div-ol-li-2  Several different handlers can be connected to the same  node, event  using dojo.connect. In this case, the handlers may be called in any order. This is usually enough to suggest that it is a bad idea to con- nect multiple handlers. If you need to connect multiple handlers, it is   PROGRAMMING DOM EVENTS WITH DOJO  111  almost always better to write a function that combines the handlers in a well-deﬁned order. For example:  Line 1  function myClickHander1 event  {   * as required *   } function myClickHander2 event  {   * as required *   } dojo.connect someDomNode, "click",  function event { myHandler1 event ; myHandler2 event ; }  The example uses a function literal to create a handler that calls two other handlers in a well-deﬁned order. Also notice that we omitted the context argument. Remember, dojo.connect calculates the handler func- tion by calling dojo.hitch context, handler . Since context was not pro- vided, the handler in the example is calculated as follows:  Line 1  dojo.hitch   function event { myHandler1 event ; myHandler2 event ; }  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -   ;   ;  This is exactly the effect we want. It also demonstrates a gotcha: the value of this will not reference the current target node when the han- dler is called. Although not speciﬁed by any standard, most native browser event APIs set this to reference the current target DOM node when the handler is invoked. But dojo.connect connects the result of dojo.hitch context, handler  to the event, and the whole purpose of hitch is to call handler with this==context.3  Our advice: don’t write code that assumes this references the current target in event handlers. Doing so will lead to brittle code that is not standards-compliant. Instead, use event.target or event.currentTarget, de- pending upon the semantics of the handler.  At this point, we can write handlers and connect them to events, but where do we put all the calls to dojo.connect? We’ll answer that next.  Executing Initialization Code with dojo.addOnLoad  When we call dojo.connect to connect a handler to a DOM node, we’d better make sure that the DOM tree has been built by the browser  3. Of course you could force the context to be the node by writing something like dojo.connect node, "click", node, f .   PROGRAMMING DOM EVENTS WITH DOJO  112  Alex Says. . .  The Good, the Bad, and Internet Explorer  The Dojo event system attempts to ﬁll in the most common problems with browser event system implementations, but we wouldn’t need to if all browsers implemented the W3C DOM Level 2 event model correctly. Internet Explorer 6 and 7 haven’t even attempted to implement the W3C model, but that’s the tip of the iceberg.  Internet Explorer has the potential to leak memory when event handlers contain circular references or when the handler ref- erences an object that points back to the DOM node to which the handler is attached. This happens all the time, some- times by accident. When a circular reference chain is created between native browser objects and user JavaScript code, Internet Explorer isn’t “smart” enough to decrement the refer- ence counts to zero even though both objects are no longer referenced. The solution to this problem is to track all the connections and disconnect them manually before the page unloads, allowing the built-in garbage collector to fully ﬂush its references. With Internet Explorer 7, Microsoft implemented a system to try to ﬂush references more completely, but it also falls down when nodes are left “dangling” in the JavaScript object space but aren’t attached to the visible document. The web community is still waiting on Microsoft to ﬁx this decade- old problem deﬁnitively. Tracking connections by hand is long- winded and error prone, and Dojo handles it for you if you use dojo.connect.  for  relatively simple web pages with a short Of course, lifetime, browser resource leaks are inconsequential. Your objects may not grow very large, and users may not spend enough time in the application for the cumulative leakage to slow things down noticeably. When writing more advanced applications—particularly single-page applications—resource leaks can cause huge performance hits to the point of mak- ing the application unusable. So long as you connect using Dojo’s event API, you can ignore these types of browser errors completely.   PROGRAMMING DOM EVENTS WITH DOJO  113  and any other JavaScript that the handler references has been down- loaded and evaluated. And what if our application requires other ini- tialization work—maybe it creates some bookkeeping data structures or does some DOM manipulation? Here, again, we need to be sure that the JavaScript resources that we’ve dojo.required and or the DOM tree are ready for use. All of these problems are solved by the function dojo.addOnLoad.  dojo.addOnLoad takes a reference to a function and guarantees that the provided function is executed immediately after the following three conditions are met:    The DOM tree has been built by the browser and is available for use by client code. Note, this is different from saying that every resource  for example, images  has been loaded.    All JavaScript resources demanded through the Dojo loader have  been loaded.    All Dojo widget parsing has been completed. As we saw in Chap- ter 2, Powerful Web Forms Made Easy, on page 20, Dojo lets you specify widgets directly in the HTML code. When you include Dojo widgets like this, Dojo must parse the HTML and replace each embedded widget with the actual HTML that implements the wid- get. If djConﬁg.parseOnLoad is true, then this is accomplished as soon as the DOM tree is loaded by the browser but before any function registered with dojo.addOnLoad is executed.  dojo.addOnLoad can be called any number of times, and each function given as an argument will be executed in the order it was provided. The argument can be either a reference to a function or a method name on an object. Here is an example of each usage:  Line 1  dojo.addOnLoad f ; dojo.addOnLoad function  { * statements * } ;   a function literal dojo.addOnLoad o, "f" ;    the function o["f"]    the function f  Let’s cross the ﬁnal “t” in the event example. Here’s the completed code, including the call to dojo.addOnLoad:  Download asynchronous-programming event.htm  Line 1  function handleClick eventObj {  console.log   "Event " + eventObj.type + "  on DOM node " + eventObj.target.id + "; currentTarget= " + eventObj.currentTarget.id ;  -  -  -  -  -  5  -   PROGRAMMING DOM EVENTS WITH DOJO  114  10  15  20  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  25  }  }  }    eventObj is of type MouseEvent if  eventObj.shiftKey  {    stop bubbling shift-click was pressed. eventObj.stopPropagation  ;  function connectExercise   {  dojo.connect dojo.byId "body" , "click", handleClick ; dojo.connect dojo.byId "body-div" , "click", handleClick ; dojo.connect dojo.byId "body-div-p" , "click", handleClick ; dojo.connect dojo.byId "body-div-ol" , "click", handleClick ; dojo.connect dojo.byId "body-div-ol-li-1" , "click", handleClick ; dojo.connect dojo.byId "body-div-ol-li-2" , "click", handleClick ; dojo.connect dojo.byId "body-div-ol-li-3" , "click", handleClick ; dojo.connect dojo.byId "body-div-ol-li-4" , "click", handleClick ; dojo.connect dojo.byId "body-div-ol-li-5" , "click", handleClick ;  dojo.addOnLoad connectExercise ;  That’s all there is to the Dojo DOM event framework. From the pro- grammer’s point of view, the Dojo event framework couldn’t be simpler:    dojo.connect disconnect connects disconnects handlers.    Handlers are always passed an event-dependent event object that  gives details about the event.    Use the target currentTarget property of the event object instead of  this to get to the target current target DOM nodes.    Events that can bubble always bubble; the capturing phase is  always disabled.  the W3C speciﬁcations .    Keyboard events and associated event objects are deﬁned  unlike    Initialization functions that connect events should be called by  registering them with dojo.addOnLoad.  And, most important, all of this is browser-independent.  We’ll conclude this section with a handy table that includes everything you need to know about the catalog of DOM events.   PROGRAMMING DOM EVENTS WITH DOJO  115  Alex Says. . .  Use dojo.addOnLoad Rather Than DOM onload  Simple pages perform initialization by attaching to the onload event of the window object, but this won’t scale. What if some other bit of code wants to listen to onload? If they register after you, will your code get called? How can you ensure that your onload handler isn’t breaking someone else’s handler? I’ve seen large development teams stopped in their tracks because someone checked in a stray window.onload = function  {.... Dojo’s onload mechanism gives you a simple way to reg- ister multiple handlers, and using it can save you serious headaches.  Then there’s the question of what we mean by “onload.” The browser’s default onload event is not ﬁred until all external resources referenced on the page are loaded. This means we must wait for all images, objects, CSS ﬁles, and the rest to download. If the page contains many and or large external resources and or the connection is slow, the user is presented with a dysfunctional page  since the initialization code hasn’t run —perhaps for a signiﬁcant period of time. We want our wid- gets and progressive enhancements to start rendering as soon as pos- sible, and in an ideal world, the browsers would give us events for all of these steps in the page-building process  “oncssload,” “onimgload,” “ondomparsed,” and so on . Instead, there is a patchwork of browser- speciﬁc hacks and workarounds that let us try to determine whether we can say that things are “loaded” well before all the images are fully resolved...but these may also not be what we want. If our code is counting on the layout being “stabilized” and then some extra bit of CSS gets loaded that changes the rules, our widgets may appear to be “broken.” The semantic we’d really like to implement is some- thing like “onlayoutstable,” which is roughly the point at which all CSS rules are applied and all images have dimensions  if not actual con- tent . There’s no native event for this, but Dojo does its best to ﬁgure out when this happens, and that is when handlers registered through dojo.addOnLoad are called.  If you’re using the cross-domain loader, say by loading Dojo from AOL’s CDN, then some of the JavaScript resources that your page needs may not be available even when the native onload ﬁres. dojo.addOnLoad is smart about this and won’t ﬁre until all the mod- ules are available, no matter what package mode you’re using.  Lastly, if you prefer using dojo.connect, you can connect to the dojo.loaded event instead of dojo.addOnLoad since all three meth- ods are deﬁned as soon as dojo.js is included.

lists each event name  this is the name you provide as the event argument to dojo.connect , a description of what causes the event to occur, and the following three attributes that apply to each event:    The type of event object passed to handlers    Whether the event bubbles  B means yes     Whether the default processing associated with the event is can-  celable  C means yes   4. Actually, almost all of these events are ﬁred by the browser, and Dojo leverages this fact. Some keyboard events in some browsers are ﬁred synthetically by Dojo.   CONNECTING TO USER-DEFINED EVENTS WITH DOJO  117  Now that we’ve looked at DOM events, you might ask yourself whether the idea of events could be extended to your own objects. With Dojo, the answer is a resounding “yes!” Let’s see how.  6.2 Connecting to User-Deﬁned Events with Dojo  To understand user-deﬁned events, let’s think about what’s happening behind the scenes when an event is ﬁred. What, exactly, is the “thing” that causes a handler to be called? For example, you might respond, “a mouse click.” But the browser is several layers of abstraction above a hardware device driver, so it’s not the switch on the mouse that causes the event—at least not directly. And, semantic events certainly have nothing to do with hardware. Really, it’s the execution of some func- tion that causes handlers to be invoked. For example, in Windows, when a mouse button is pressed, a message is inserted into the mes- sage queue. The browser’s message loop retrieves this message and calls a function that processes the message. The execution of this func- tion  that we’ll call the trigger function  is the “event” that causes the mouse click handlers to be invoked. Dojo takes this idea to the obvious extreme: dojo.connect can hook up handlers to any function—not just DOM events.  This functionality often eliminates the need for scaffolding machinery. For example, in a traditional application system, you might have a set of command objects  say, menus  and a set of command handlers. Then you would build some scaffolding to hook the two objects together. The command handlers “register” with the scaffolding, the command objects signal the scaffolding, and the scaffolding marshals signals from the command objects to the command handlers. All of this is unneces- sary with dojo.connect. Just connect the command handler directly to the command object, and you’re done.  Let’s see how such a system might be implemented—it will help you to visualize what’s going on behind the scenes if this concept is new.  Hooking JavaScript Functions  Say we have a function, f, and we want to augment f with a call to console.log "exiting f"  after f completes. Here’s one way to do it:  Line 1  var g= f; f= function   {  -  -  -  5  -  };  var result= g.apply this, arguments ; console.log "exiting f" ; return result;   CONNECTING TO USER-DEFINED EVENTS WITH DOJO  118  A function is an object like any other object. Indeed, when we say the “function f,” we are really saying the “function object that the variable f references.” The previous code uses this fact to hold a reference to the original deﬁnition of f in the variable g. Then f is replaced by a new function that calls to the original f, saves the result, writes to the debug console, and ﬁnally returns the saved result.  Dojo uses this idea as follows: when the dojo.connect parameters obj and event specify a JavaScript function rather than a DOM node event, dojo.connect replaces that function with a new function that ﬁrst calls the original function and then ﬁres the handler given by the context and handler parameters. Let’s try it by ﬁrst deﬁning a function that prints out “hello, world” and then hook an event to it:  function f   {  console.log "hello, world" ;  function myHandler   {  console.log "Hello from f's handler!" ;  }  }  var handle= dojo.connect "f", myHandler ;  When f is invoked, you’ll see two console messages: “hello, world” fol- lowed by “Hello from f’s handler!”  Connecting User-Deﬁned Events  dojo.connect is an overloaded function that connects a handler to either a DOM event or a trigger function based upon the obj argument:    If obj is a DOM node, then event  a string  must specify a DOM event deﬁned by that node. This type of event was the subject of Section 6.1, Programming DOM Events with Dojo, on page 101.    If obj is an object but not a DOM node, then obj[event]  event, a string  must specify a function, and this function is used as the trigger function.    If obj is null or missing, then dojo.global[event]  event, a string  must specify a function, and this function is used as the trigger func- tion. Notice that event is always a string; this gives dojo.connect a way to determine whether obj was omitted.   CONNECTING TO USER-DEFINED EVENTS WITH DOJO  119  Line 1  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  Here are examples of the last two usages:    missing obj; event is a string: dojo.connect "functionName", context, handler ;   is equivalent to explicitly specifying null for eventOwner dojo.connect null, "functionName", context, handler ;   in both cases, the triggering function is dojo.global["functionName"]    recall that dojo.global references the global object space     with a non-null obj, an object, not a DOM node: dojo.connect obj, "functionName", context, handler ;   the triggering function is obj["functionName"]  When dojo.connect is used to connect a handler to a trigger function, the handler is automatically invoked after the trigger function com- pletes and is passed the same arguments that were provided to the trigger function. Unlike connecting multiple handlers to a DOM event, when multiple handler functions are connected to a triggering function, they are ﬁred in the order in which they were connected.  The rest of dojo.connect works just as we’ve already discussed. The handler is always calculated to be dojo.hitch context, handler   context, optional, an object; handler, a string or function , and the returned value can be used to dojo.disconnect the handler.  Let’s drive these points home with a quick example. We’ll deﬁne a func- tion printArgs that simply prints out its arguments to the console. Then we’ll hook up two handlers to printArgs that also print their arguments. So we can keep everything straight in the output, we’ll have each func- tion print it name. Here is the code:  Line 1    print functionName  a string  and all of the elements of args  an array    to the console function giveMessage functionName, args  {  var message= "In " + functionName + "; the arguments are: "; dojo.forEach args, function arg {message+= arg.toString   + " ";} ; console.log message ;    here is the function that we'll hook up to generate the event... function printArgs   {  giveMessage "printArgs", arguments ;    here is the first event handler... function firstHandler   {    this handler uses the arguments object to gain access to its arguments giveMessage "firstHandler", arguments ;  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  15  }  }  }   PUBLISH-SUBSCRIBE  120  }  20  25  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  30    and the second event handler... function secondHandler a1, a2  {    this handler explicitly declares what it expects for arguments giveMessage "secondHandler", [a1, a2] ;    connect the firstHandler to fire whenever printArgs is invoked... dojo.connect "printArgs", null, "firstHandler" ;    and likewise for secondHandler.... dojo.connect "printArgs", null, "secondHandler" ;    let's exercise our exercise... printArgs 1, 2 ;  When you run this code, you’ll see the following console messages, in order:  1. “In printArgs; the arguments are: 1 2”  2. “In ﬁrstHandler; the arguments are: 1 2”  3. “In secondHandler; the arguments are: 1 2”  Notice that the handlers were called in the order that they were con- nected, and the arguments passed to the handlers were exactly those passed to the triggering function.  There is one small gotcha: in order to work its magic, Dojo replaces the original trigger function with a new function that orchestrates calling both the original trigger function and the handlers. If you come along later and replace the Dojo-provided trigger function with another func- tion, the events will stop ﬁring. So if you need to replace a triggering function, you must reconnect any handlers connected to that function. Disconnecting the old handlers is optional. So long as you don’t hold on to a copy of the handles returned by dojo.connect, all objects created after the old connections will be garbage collected.  Dojo itself leverages dojo.connect to provide a publish-subscribe frame- work.  6.3 Publish-Subscribe  In Section 3.6, Errors and Debugging, on page 67, we used publish- subscribe to publish messages  XHR failure information  about xhrError. A Toaster widget that subscribed to the topic popped up on the screen and displayed the failure information when an XHR transaction failed. The cool thing about the whole design was that a single Toaster widget   PUBLISH-SUBSCRIBE  121  that subscribed to the xhrError topic just once could receive and process any number of messages from any number of sources; similarly, the XHR error functions didn’t even know that a Toaster widget existed. We skipped a lot of detail when we gave the Toaster example; let’s cover the whole story now.  In the publish-subscribe pattern, several functions register their inter- est in a “topic.” Later, some process can publish something about the topic. Of course, in the context of a JavaScript program, the “some- thing” published is just a set of arguments, and the action of “publish- ing” is accomplished by calling each subscriber with the given argu- ments. Dojo implements this pattern by providing three functions:  handle= dojo.subscribe topic, context, handler   Causes the function given by dojo.hitch context, handler  to be in- voked when topic  a string  is published via dojo.publish. Returns handle that may be used to take down the connection by dojo. unsubscribe  see next .  dojo.unsubscribe handle   Removes the connection previously made by dojo.subscribe. handle is the object returned by dojo.subscribe.  dojo.publish topic, args   Publishes topic  a string  by calling all subscribers to the topic, passing the arguments given by args  an array  to each subscriber. The subscribing functions are called in the order in which they were subscribed.  Dojo leverages its own event machinery to implement publish-subscribe in about four lines of code. For all of us old C++ systems programmers, that’s impressive! Take a look at connect.js in the Dojo source if you are interested.  Let’s create a little example to demonstrate just how publish-subscribe works. Assume we have the topic “Numbers” that “publishes” numbers one at a time. Further assume that we are interested in accumulat- ing the total of the numbers published as well as printing the current total after each publication. Here’s one way to solve this problem with publish-subscribe:  1. Deﬁne an accumulator object that has a method that accumulates  a running total; subscribe the method to the “Numbers” topic.  2. Deﬁne a function that prints the current total as given by the  accumulator; subscribe this function to the “Numbers” topic.   PUBLISH-SUBSCRIBE  122  Here is the code:  Line 1    a simple object that accumulates a sum of numbers... var numberAccumulator = {  total: 0, add: function x {this.total+= x;}    subscribe numberAccumulator.add to the topic "Numbers" dojo.subscribe "Numbers", numberAccumulator, "add" ;    prints numberAccumulator.total function showTotal   {  console.log "The total is: " + numberAccumulator.total ;  5  };  }  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  15  20    subscribe showTotal to the topic "Numbers" dojo.subscribe "Numbers", showTotal ;    test it...   NOTE: arguments passed as an array! dojo.publish "Numbers", [1] ; dojo.publish "Numbers", [2] ;  1. “The total is 1”  2. “The total is 3”  The program prints the following messages to the console in order:  dojo.publish "numbers", [1]  causes a call to numberAccumulator.add 1  fol- lowed by a call to showTotal 1 . This demonstrates how dojo.publish must be provided an array for its second argument, but it deals the contents of the array out as individual arguments to all subscribed functions. Since showTotal doesn’t care about the arguments, it just ignores them.  Also notice that the example demonstrates how to connect a handler that is a method on an object  line 8  as well as just a simple function  line 16 .  Publish-subscribe is a very useful design pattern. The key to its power lies in its ability to separate concerns. The “publishing” process need not concern itself with the consequences of publishing but rather is concerned only with knowing when and what to publish. On the other hand, subscribers need concern themselves only with taking actions consequent to some publication. Indeed, publishers and subscribers don’t even need to know about each other. Since each process  that is, each publisher and each subscriber  is independent, the complexity of   MANAGING CALLBACKS WITH DOJO.DEFERRED  123  each process is consequently decreased, which, in turn, increases the chances that each process will function as desired.  All things considered, both DOM and user-deﬁned events are fairly easy to understand and use, particularly since Dojo works out browser incompatibilities for us. When we start working with more complicated asynchronous processes, this won’t be true, and we’ll want and need more capabilities. So, let’s turn our attention to these more advanced models starting with Dojo’s Deferred class.  6.4 Managing Callbacks with dojo.Deferred  Event programming is an example of a simple, loosely coupled asyn- chronous programming system. Communications between triggering functions and handlers are conceptually limited to a binary signal that says an event occurred. Yes, there is the event object, but the informa- tion contained within the object is very generic in nature. There is no provision for communicating more-elaborate results  for example, error conditions , and there isn’t any process control  for example, canceling or chaining the handlers . Sometimes, more is needed.  In this section, we’re going to explore dojo.Deferred—a Dojo class that manages more advanced interactions between an asynchronous func- tion and one or more callback functions. Since some of the conceptual framework can be a bit abstract and theoretical, we’ll work through a real-world example that illustrates how to use Deferreds effectively. Along the way, we’ll see that building systems with Deferreds results in powerful, simple, and elegant solutions to otherwise-complicated asyn- chronous programming problems.  The Example: Building a High-Performance Display Engine  Let us consider the example of displaying a panel of data from a data- base. The process is governed by a display engine that makes a request to the server for both the metadata  background decoration, layout information, and user interaction logic  and the data  ultimately deﬁned by some query . When the metadata arrives, the panel is created and initialized with various HTML controls, decorations, and event logic. Similarly, the data is stored in a cache when it arrives. Finally, after both the metadata and the data arrive, the data is pushed into the HTML controls on the panel, and the panel is released to the user.

Figure 6.4: Naïve display engine design  A naïve implementation might use the algorithm given in Figure 6.4. The good thing about this design is that it is very simple and would surely work. Unfortunately, the browser may freeze for several seconds while the data and metadata are being retrieved. Further, the design retrieves and processes the metadata and data serially rather than con- currently as expressed by the process description. Our goal is to come up with an implementation that solves these problems while keeping the design simple.

This will keep the browser from freezing. Here are a few other reasons for this design:    It is possible—even likely—that the metadata is already in a local browser cache. However, if we bundle the metadata with the data, then there is no chance that the metadata would ever be cached since the data is always changing.    It’s also possible that the metadata may be cached at an edge server, a physically different server than where the data resides. Clearly, two independent queries ought to be used in this scenario.   After either the metadata or the data is received, there is some pro- cessing that takes place before both items are required to complete the overall task. Why not get this work done with the ﬁrst arriving component while the other component is still transmitting?   MANAGING CALLBACKS WITH DOJO.DEFERRED  126  In Figure 6.5, on the previous page, you can see a revised design that uses two asynchronous processes. The algorithm gets started by call- ing display, which sets up some infrastructure to coordinate the rest of the work, ﬁres off two asynchronous functions  getData and getMeta- data , and then returns. The asynchronous functions signal two call- back functions  continueWithData and continueWithMetadata  when they complete. The callbacks take processing as far as possible along each fork and then call ﬁnish, which joins the two asynchronous processes into a single thread of execution that ﬁnishes up by displaying the data as given by the metadata.  If we implemented this system in terms of user-deﬁned events, we’d have to build a fair amount of scaffolding that has nothing to do with the problem at hand. Fortunately, dojo.deferred already contains this scaffolding. So, we’ll use it to build the solution. Let’s start by imple- menting display.  Implementing the Controlling Process  Notice that the various functions are tightly coupled, as depicted in Fig- ure 6.5, on the preceding page. Each function takes some information from the function before it, does something, and passes information to the next function. By deﬁning all the functions within the display func- tion, we can implement this coupling by sharing a local variable. Here is our ﬁrst attempt:  Line 1    implements a display engine:   display the data given by query in the panel given by panelId function display panelId, query {    displayInfo is a shared bookkeeping area var displayInfo = { panelId: panelId, query: query, processCompleteCount: 0  10  };    get an HTML div in which to place the panel   allocatePanel is provided by the pane management logic of our application displayInfo.div = allocatePanel displayInfo ;    TODO 1   make an asynchronous call to get the data   after the asynchronous call finishes,   continue by calling continueWithData  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  15  20   MANAGING CALLBACKS WITH DOJO.DEFERRED  127  25  30  35  40  45  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -    TODO 2   make an asynchronous call to get the metadata   after the asynchronous call finishes,   continue by calling continueWithMetadata    process the data as far as we can without the metadata function continueWithData data {    put the data in an application-wide cache   for use with other requests   no need to wait for the metadata to do this! cacheData data ;    save quick access to the data displayInfo.data = data;  finishDisplay  ;  }    process the metadata as far as we can without the data function continueWithMetadata metadata {    set up the HTML and other control structures   given by the metadata   no need to wait for the data to do this! preparePanel metadata ;    save quick access to the metadata displayInfo.metadata = metadata;  finishDisplay  ;  50  }    when continueWithData and continueWithMetadata have completed,   finish with the display process function finishDisplay  {  55    TODO 3  }  }  Try reading the code like a novel. Read each line, including comments, sequentially. We think this code is really elegant, and it’s all because of the powerful programming paradigm that dojo.Deferred provides.  As for the TODOs, somehow we have to query the server for the data  metadata asynchronously and then, upon completion of each of these functions, call continueWithData continueWithMetaData, passing the re- ceived data metadata. So, we need machinery to coordinate an asyn- chronous function call with a callback function. This is exactly what dojo.Deferred does.   MANAGING CALLBACKS WITH DOJO.DEFERRED  128  Registering Callbacks with dojo.Deferred  dojo.Deferred is a constructor function that creates objects that manage the interaction between a single asynchronous function call, a chain of one or more callback functions, and other clients that are interested in the asynchronous operation.5 The Deferred interface includes methods for the asynchronous function to signal normal or abnormal completion and return results as well as methods that let other clients:    Specify a chain of functions to execute upon normal and or ab- normal completion of the asynchronous function  that is, a chain of callbacks .    Check to see whether the asynchronous function completed and,  if so, access any results returned.    Cancel waiting for the asynchronous function.  Typically, the process making the asynchronous call creates a Deferred instance, shares it with the asynchronous function, adds one or more callbacks, and then forgets about it.  Getting back to our example, we have two independent callback func- tions, namely, continueWithData and continueWithMetadata, which con- tinue after the asynchronous functions that get the data and metadata complete. We can use Deferreds to set this up:    TODO 1 partial implementation... displayInfo.dataDeferred= new dojo.Deferred  ; displayInfo.dataDeferred.addCallback continueWithData ;   still TODO:   somehow, get the data asynchronously and signal   displayInfo.dataDeferred when this completes    TODO 2 partial implementation... displayInfo.metadataDeferred= new dojo.Deferred  ; displayInfo.metadataDeferred.addCallback continueWithMetadata ;   still TODO:   somehow, get the metadata asynchronously and signal   displayInfo.metadataDeferred when this completes  The example shows that callback functions are registered by calling the Deferred method addCallback. We will discuss registering callback functions in detail in Section 6.4, Specifying Callbacks and Errbacks, on page 132.  5. Remember, any Dojo function that starts with a capital letter is a constructor function and consequently deﬁnes a class.  Line 1  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10   MANAGING CALLBACKS WITH DOJO.DEFERRED  129  The asynchronous functions that retrieve the data and metadata could be some kind of remote scripting call  see Chapter 8, Remote Scripting with XHR, script, and iframe, on page 178  or a call to a Java applet, plug-in, or some other kind of browser extension. From the perspective of the display engine, it doesn’t matter how the data metadata is actu- ally retrieved; all that matters is that when the data metadata arrives, the Deferred objects are notiﬁed of the result.  We’ve implemented the asynchronous functions as mock services. They take a reference to the passed Deferred as well as the data query meta- data panelId. The completed example included in the code download displays a form with buttons to signal success or failure. If the success button is clicked, then the mock service calls the callback method of the associated Deferred, passing back the query panelId. We’ll talk about handling errors after we get the success case worked out. Here is how the asynchronous mock data service is implemented:  Line 1  var theDataRequest;   holds the data query var theDataDeferred;   holds the Deferred that controls the data service    the data service asynchronous function call... function makeAsynchronousServerDataCall theDeferred, theRequest {  5  theDataDeferred= theDeferred; theDataRequest= theRequest;    the "real" asynchronous call would go here;   the mock server just displays the request in the form... dojo.byId "serverMockDataQuery" .innerHTML= theRequest;    success and fail event handlers to simulate a service... function returnData e {  dojo.stopEvent e ; theDataDeferred.callback "result "+theDataRequest+" " ;  } function failData e {  dojo.stopEvent e ; theDataDeferred.errback "failed" ;  }   hook up the handlers to the form buttons... dojo.addOnLoad function  {  dojo.connect dojo.byId "dataReturn" , "click", returnData ; dojo.connect dojo.byId "dataError" , "click", failData ;  Deferred.callback is always passed a single argument that holds the result of the asynchronous function computation  line 17 . Since Java- Script is not capable of returning multiple results as some languages  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  15  20  25  }  } ;   MANAGING CALLBACKS WITH DOJO.DEFERRED  130  do, exactly one argument is expected. In the event you need to pass multiple results, simply wrap the results in either an array or an object. Here is the HTML form that makes the mock service go:  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  Line 1      Server Mock      The data query is...           10                   With this and similar code in place for the metadata service, we can complete TODO 1 and 2:  Line 1    TODO 1 implementation... displayInfo.dataDeferred= new dojo.Deferred  ; displayInfo.dataDeferred.addCallback continueWithData ; makeAsynchronousServerDataCall displayInfo.dataDeferred, query ;    TODO 2 implementation... displayInfo.metadataDeferred= new dojo.Deferred  ; displayInfo.metadataDeferred.addCallback continueWithMetadata ; makeAsynchronousServerMetadataCall displayInfo.metadataDeferred, panelId ;  Let’s now turn to TODO 3, which joins the two asynchronous callback functions once they’ve both completed. The idea is to keep track of how many asynchronous processes have completed and, when they’ve all completed, continue with the process. Here is the JavaScript:  Line 1    when continueWithData and continueWithMetadata have completed,   finish with the display process function finishDisplay   {    TODO 3 implementation... displayInfo.processCompleteCount++; if  displayInfo.processCompleteCount==2  {    both have completed... populatePanelWithData displayInfo ; releasePanelToUser displayInfo ;  10  }  }  The example also nicely demonstrates how to fork a single process into several processes  implemented as asynchronous function calls  and later join the processes back into a single process.   MANAGING CALLBACKS WITH DOJO.DEFERRED  131  At this point, the basic display engine is complete and works perfectly so long as no abnormal conditions are encountered. If you step back for a moment, you’ll notice a fairly complex algorithm was expressed in very clear and concise code. This was one of the promises we made at the beginning. Next we’ll expand on the solution to include error handling.  Handling Errors  What should we do if either or both asynchronous calls fail? Perhaps the panel div was initialized with a message saying “Retrieving Data.” If either asynchronous function fails, this message will stay forever, without any further notiﬁcation to the user about the true status of the request. We must do better.  dojo.Deferred can register callback functions to execute if when an error occurs. To avoid confusing “error path” callbacks with normal path call- backs, we’ll call them errbacks. Naturally, they are registered with the dojo.Deferred method addErrback.  For our display engine, upon failure of either asynchronous function, we can use addErrback to hook up an errback that asks the user if he would like to retry the operation. If the user says “OK,” then a new asynchronous function call is made; if the user says “cancel,” then the div can be ﬁlled with a message saying the request failed.  Since the new design sets up the asynchronous function calls twice— the initial call and the call made by the retry—let’s encapsulate this work in a couple of functions. Here’s the code for getting the data  the code for getting the metadata looks similar :  Line 1    important: this is put inside the function display   function getData   {  displayInfo.dataDeferred= new dojo.Deferred  ; displayInfo.dataDeferred.addCallback continueWithData ; displayInfo.dataDeferred.addErrback handleDataError ; makeAsynchronousServerDataCall displayInfo.dataDeferred, query ;  -  -  -  -  -  5  }  We’ve done two things here. First, we encapsulated TODO 1 in the function getData. getData must be deﬁned within the body of the func- tion display so that all the referenced functions and data are visible. Second, in addition to registering a callback function, we registered the errback function handleDataError  line 5 .   MANAGING CALLBACKS WITH DOJO.DEFERRED  132  Next, let’s write handleDataError; it’s trivial:  Line 1    important: this is put inside the function display      informs the user that an error occurred retrieving the data   gives the user the option to retry or cancel function handleDataError  {  giveRetryCancelMessage   "The server failed to deliver the data.", getData, function   {   cancel function    retry function  10  doCancel displayInfo.dataDeferred ;  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  }   ;  }  The implementation of giveRetryCancelMessage isn’t important to the discussion. It simply displays a dialog box that presents a message, asks the user whether she would like to retry or cancel, and provides OK cancel push buttons. When the user clicks one of the buttons, giveRetryCancelMessage calls the appropriate function. Since getData is given as the retry function, another asynchronous call will be attempted if the user selects retry. Similarly, if the user clicks cancel, doCancel will be called. We’ll say more about doCancel in a moment.  Our display engine is nearly complete. But before we do more, let’s take a closer look at registering callbacks and errbacks.  Specifying Callbacks and Errbacks  The callback processing in the example is simple: if the asynchronous call succeeds, call one function  for example, continueWithData ; other- wise, call another function  for example, handleDataError . Most of the time, this is all you’ll need. For more-complex scenarios, Deferreds are capable of registering a list of callback and errback functions, and the functions will be executed in the order they were registered.  Deferreds maintain a queue that holds the functions waiting to execute. Callback errbacks are always added to the queue in pairs—a callback paired with an errback. As the queue is traversed, one or the other functions is called depending upon whether the Deferred instance is in a normal or error state  we’ll discuss these states in a moment .   MANAGING CALLBACKS WITH DOJO.DEFERRED  133  There are four methods for appending continuation functions to the end of the queue:  addCallback context, f   Add the  callback, errback  pair given by  dojo.hitch context, f , null . When a null is encountered while traversing the queue, the entry is just ignored, and processing proceeds to the next entry.  addErrback context, f   addBoth context, f   Add the  callback, errback  pair given by  null, dojo.hitch context, f  ; null is handled as described previously.  Add the  callback, errback  pair given by  dojo.hitch context, f , dojo.hitch context, f  .  addCallbacks callback, errback   Add the  callback, errback  pair given by  callback, errback .  Any of these methods can be called during the lifetime of the Deferred object. If the asynchronous call has already been completed and the queue is empty, then the newly registered callback errback is executed immediately; otherwise, it goes to the back of the queue.  Each successive callback errback is passed the result of the previ- ous function in the queue. So, the ﬁrst callback errback is passed the result of the asynchronous function, the second callback errback is passed the result of the ﬁrst, and so on.  A Deferred enters an error state under any of the following conditions:    The asynchronous function returns a result by calling the Deferred  method errback.    The asynchronous function or any subsequent callback errback  returns a result that is an instanceof Error.    Any callback errback throws an exception. If this occurs, then the Deferred instance will catch the exception, and the caught excep- tion object becomes the next result.  On the other hand, a Deferred enters a nonerror state when the original asynchronous function or any subsequent callback errback returns a result that is not an instanceof Error. This means that a Deferred object can enter into and out of an error state, and as the queue is traversed, either the callback or errback function is executed depending on the   MANAGING CALLBACKS WITH DOJO.DEFERRED  134  error state  that is, processing can switch back and forth between the callback and errback functions .  You can always query the current state of a Deferred object through its ﬁred property:    -1 indicates that the Deferred object is still waiting for the asyn-  chronous function to ﬁnish computing.    0 indicates that the Deferred object has received results and is in  a nonerror state.  a error state.    1 indicates that the Deferred object has received results and is in  Given a Deferred instance d, the last results computed are also always available through d.results[d.ﬁred].  Of course, there’s no limitation on the type of single argument that is returned. This brings up the mind-boggling possibility that a callback  errback might return a Deferred. When this happens, any subsequent callback errback function is not called until the returned Deferred has results.  Canceling Callback Processing  Let’s get back to our example. So far, the panel starts life by telling the user that it is working on retrieving the data. If everything goes as planned, the data is displayed after both the data and the metadata arrive. On the other hand, if an error occurs, the user is given the option to retry or cancel the operation. So at this point, the user can cancel the request only if an error occurs.  There are other situations where the request should be cancelable. For example, the user may want to cancel the operation before it either completes or returns an error. Other processes may like to cancel asyn- chronous processing as well. Deferred provides a solution to just this problem.  When the Deferred method cancel is called on a Deferred instance that is still waiting on the asynchronous function, it stops waiting, sets its internal state to indicate an error  sets its ﬁred property to 1 , and begins traversing the callback queue. On the other hand, if the asyn- chronous function has already returned results and the queue has already been traversed, cancel has no effect except for one very odd cir-   MANAGING CALLBACKS WITH DOJO.DEFERRED  135  cumstance: if the last callback errback executed returned yet another Deferred instance as its result, then this other Deferred is canceled.  The default cancel processing can be a bit harsh since it just creates a JavaScript Error instance and starts down the error callback queue. Fortunately, there is a gentler way. The Deferred constructor takes an optional single argument—a function termed the canceler. If cancel is invoked on a Deferred instance that was created with a canceler, then the canceler is called with that Deferred instance passed as an argu- ment. Armed with this information, we can make the ﬁnal adjustments to the function display.  First we need to write a canceler function. It should cancel the other Deferred and clean up the panel. Here it is:  Line 1    Important: this function is put inside the function display  . function doCancel theDeferred  {    execute this routine for the first Deferred canceled only... if  !displayInfo.dataDeferred  {  return;  }    figure out which Deferred was canceled and take   a reference to the other Deferred var temp= displayInfo.dataDeferred==theDeferred ?  displayInfo.metadataDeferred : displayInfo.dataDeferred;    ensure this routine is executed only once displayInfo.dataDeferred= null; displayInfo.metadataDeferred= null;    cancel the other Deferred temp.cancel  ;    clean up the display destroyPanel displayInfo ;  }  Because the Deferred instance that is canceled ﬁrst must cancel the other Deferred instance, a little care is required to avoid inﬁnite recur- sion. The ﬁrst Deferred instance canceled clobbers both displayInfo. metadataDeferred and displayInfo.dataDeferred so that the canceler will return immediately when the other Deferred instance is canceled.  The canceler should be hooked up to both Deferred instances when they are created, so the following line...  displayInfo.dataDeferred= new dojo.Deferred  ;  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  15  20   MANAGING CALLBACKS WITH DOJO.DEFERRED  136  should be replaced with this line:  displayInfo.dataDeferred= new dojo.Deferred doCancel ;  And this must also be done for displayInfo.metadataDeferred. It is impor- tant to remember that when a Deferred instance is canceled, the error functions in the callback queue will be invoked. Since we don’t want to give the user a “retry cancel” message after she cancels, we’ll modify the function handleDataError to give the message box only if the process has not been canceled. Here is the revised handleDataError  the errback for getMetadata looks similar :  Line 1    informs the user that an error occurred retrieving the metadata   gives the user the option to retry or cancel function handleDataError  {  if  displayInfo.dataDeferred  {  giveRetryCancelMessage   "The server failed to deliver the data.", getData, function   {   cancel function    retry function  doCancel displayInfo.dataDeferred ;  }   ;  } else {  }  15  }    the process was canceled  Finally, a cancel button could be placed on the initial panel that cur- rently says “Retrieving Data,” and a click handler should be connected that executes displayInfo.dataDeferred.cancel  .  That’s it for our display example. We included the completed display function here so that you can read the ﬁnished code in a single, con- tinuous presentation. A fully operational example, including mock data and metadata services, is available in the code download.

It has normal processing, has full error recovery, and is user cancelable. The code is easy to read and under- stand while also being very concise. We could have wired all this func- tionality together with events, but Dojo’s Deferred did most of the work for us, so this was unnecessary.  If you ﬁnd yourself having trouble with Deferreds, try not to worry too much about how they do things; instead, concentrate on what they do. Also, there’s no need to bother with Deferreds unless the design includes problems like chaining callbacks and or canceling. Deferreds shine in these situations, transforming an unmanageable mess of spaghetti into clean code.   Chapter 7  DOM Utilities  Document Object Model  DOM  programming seems almost trivial. The document is represented by a tree of nodes, and each node has a set of properties. You control the appearance of the document by inserting, deleting, and or moving nodes and editing their properties. Too bad it’s really not that easy.  As usual, the browser environment makes simple things difﬁcult. Al- though the W3C-speciﬁed DOM API is fairly complete, it’s frequently inconvenient.1 Often, several lines of JavaScript are required to accom- plish a trivial programming chore. And then there’s the always-present browser incompatibilities.  Much of Dojo was built to solve this problem. We’ve already seen this at a high level of abstraction with Dijit widgets back in Chapter 2, Pow- erful Web Forms Made Easy, on page 20. But sometimes you need to be closer to the metal and manipulate raw DOM nodes directly. Dojo includes low-level functions that make this work easier, allowing you to do more in fewer lines than you thought possible. We’ll show you how in this chapter as we explore Dojo functions that ﬁnd, insert, delete, and move nodes as well as functions that get set styles, classes, and other attributes.  7.1 Core Dojo DOM Utility Functions  We’ll spend most of this chapter reﬁning an ugly, static HTML docu- ment into an elegant, dynamic user interface; it’ll even include a little animation. But, ﬁrst we need to cover some basic Dojo DOM utility  1. The W3C DOM speciﬁcations begin at http:  www.w3.org DOM DOMTR.   CORE DOJO DOM UTILITY FUNCTIONS  141  functions that you just can’t live without. Knocking these out now will also keep us moving quickly through the rest of the material.  Perhaps the most basic DOM programming task is grabbing a Java- Script reference to a DOM node using the value of an id attribute. The W3C DOM API provides the function getElementById to do this. Unfortu- nately, Internet Explorer ﬁgured out how to implement it incorrectly.2 Dojo includes the function dojo.byId that works across all browsers. dojo.byId takes a string argument that gives the value of the id attribute for a target DOM node and returns a reference to that node.3 An op- tional second argument  a DOM Document object  may be provided to indicate the document to search. If missing, then dojo.doc—equivalent to window["document"] unless explicitly changed—is assumed.  Given a reference to a DOM node, setting getting the node’s class, style, and or other attributes are chores you’ll do again and again. The native APIs provided by the major browsers are all somewhat painful owing to the W3C speciﬁcation, browser incompatibilities, or both. Dojo provides alternative functions:    dojo.hasClass dojo.addClass dojo.removeClass dojo.toggleClass:  Tests for adds removes toggles a class string within a node’s class attribute. Since the class attribute can contain a list of several classes, these functions eliminate the tedious string work that is required when working with single class names within the list.    dojo.style: Gets and sets the style for a node; normalizes for browser  incompatibilities.    dojo.attr dojo.hasAttr dojo.removeAttr: Gets and sets tests removes  attribute values from a node.  The ﬁrst argument to all of these functions is either a DOM node or a string that gives the id attribute value of a DOM node. If an id string is given, then the target node is always retrieved by calling dojo.byId. The operation of these functions is fairly trivial, but each function has a few subtleties that are easily missed by skimming the reference manual. So, we’ll demonstrate each function, including the subtleties.  The class functions  hasClass, removeClass, toggleClass, and addClass  all take two arguments—a node and a class string. Usually, the class string contains a single class name, but this need not be the case.  2. getElementById will fail in Internet Explorer and Opera  ﬁxed at v9.50a1  in some cases; see http:  webbugtrack.blogspot.com 2007 08 bug-152-getelementbyid-returns.html for the story. 3. dojo.byId also accepts a DOM node for the ﬁrst argument in which case it just returns the node. This can be useful for writing functions that take either a DOM node or an id attribute value—as do most of Dojo’s DOM utility functions.   CORE DOJO DOM UTILITY FUNCTIONS  142  Here’s a Firebug console session that shows some examples:  Download dom core-dom-utils.js  Line 1  >>>   get a node to play with... >>> var node= dojo.byId "top" ;  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  15  20  25  30  35  40  45  >>>   class names are added to the right side... >>> dojo.addClass node, "c1" ; >>> node.className; "c1" >>> dojo.addClass node, "c2" ; >>> node.className; "c1 c2"  >>>   adding a class already there does nothing... >>> dojo.addClass node, "c2" ; >>> node.className "c1 c2"  >>>   "c2 c1" NOT already there... >>> dojo.addClass node, "c2 c1" ; >>> node.className; "c1 c2 c2 c1"  >>>   nothing surprising here... >>> dojo.hasClass node, "c1" ; true >>> dojo.hasClass node, "c2" ; true >>> dojo.hasClass node, "c1 c2 c2" ; true >>> dojo.hasClass node, "c3" ; false  >>>   classes are removed from the left side... >>> dojo.removeClass node, "c1" ; >>> node.className; "c2 c2 c1" >>> dojo.removeClass node, "c2 c2" ; >>> node.className; "c1"  >>>   nothing surprising here... >>> dojo.toggleClass node, "c2" ; >>> node.className; "c1 c2" >>> dojo.toggleClass node, "c2" ; >>> node.className; "c1"  At line 18, adding the class string "c2 c1" to the className attribute with a current value of "c1 c2" demonstrates the biggest gotcha. dojo.addClass   CORE DOJO DOM UTILITY FUNCTIONS  143  appends a string value  not necessarily a single class name  to a class- Name attribute value if that string value doesn’t already exist in the current value. Since "c2 c1" does not exist in "c1 c2", it is appended, resulting in a new className attribute value of "c1 c2 c2 c1".  dojo.toggleClass can take a third argument  a boolean  that explicitly adds or removes the class string. This provides some syntactic sugar that can make some expressions more palatable:  Download dom core-dom-utils.js  Line 1    assume error is a boolean...  dojo.addClass someNode, "displayAsError" ;  dojo.removeClass someNode, "displayAsError" ;  if  error  {  } else {  }    becomes...  dojo.toggleClass someNode, "displayAsError", error ;  Next, we’ll look at dojo.style. This function can take one, two, or three arguments. As usual, the ﬁrst argument is a DOM node or id string. If only one argument is given, then a W3C computed style object is returned. The second argument  a string  identiﬁes a style to get or set. Finally, the third argument  a string  provides a style value to set. Here’s more of the previous Firebug console session that demonstrates these functions:  Download dom core-dom-utils.js  Line 1  >>>   single-argument variety => a getter >>>   returns a reference to a computed style object just >>>   like the DOM Window.getComputedStyle function >>> dojo.style node ; ComputedCSSStyleDeclaration borderLeftWidth=0px borderTopWidth=0px  >>>   three-argument variety => a setter >>>   styles values are just like in a style sheet >>> dojo.style node, "border", "2px solid black" ; "2px solid black"  >>>   two-argument variety => a getter for a particular style >>>   NOTE: style names are CAMEL CASE! >>> dojo.style node, "borderTopWidth" ; 2  >>>   this WILL NOT WORK!  style names are camel case  >>> dojo.style node, "border-top-width" ; 0  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  15   CORE DOJO DOM UTILITY FUNCTIONS  144  Notice that style names are the same as those deﬁned by the style prop- erty of a DOM node, not the names used in a style sheet  for example, borderTopWidth, not border-top-width .  Finally, the attribute functions take a DOM node or id string, an attri- bute name  a string , and optionally an attribute value  a string . The two-argument varieties test, get, or remove the attribute; the three- argument version sets the attribute:  Download dom core-dom-utils.js  Line 1  >>>   3 arguments => setter >>>   sets the attribute "name" to "foo" >>> dojo.attr node, "name", "foo" ;  >>>   2 arguments => getter >>>   returns "foo" >>> dojo.attr node, "name" ; "foo"  >>>   no surprise here... >>> dojo.hasAttr node, "name" ; true  >>>   this all works with user-defined attributes... >>>   add an attribute.. >>> dojo.attr node, "myAttrib", "myValue" ;  >>>   get its value... >>> dojo.attr node, "myAttrib" ; "myValue"  >>>   check existence... >>> dojo.hasAttr node, "myAttrib" ; true  >>>   remove it... >>> dojo.removeAttr node, "myAttrib" ; >>> dojo.hasAttr node, "myAttrib" ; false  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  15  20  25  -  -  -  5  There’s also an alternative two-argument setter that takes a hash for the second argument that contains a set of  attribute-name, attribute- value  pairs to set. This is quite convenient when setting multiple attri- butes on the same node:  Download dom core-dom-utils.js  Line 1  dojo.attr "nodeId", {  tabIndex: "-1", customAttr: "custom value", title: "an awesome node"  } ;   FINDING AND EDITING NODES  145  That’s it for the necessary foundation. Let’s move on to something more interesting.  7.2 Finding and Editing Nodes  We have a challenge. We’ve been given some trivial HTML that displays a list of questions:  Download dom questions-book-frags.htm  Line 1        Programmer Interview Questions                  Yes    No  Are you a C programmer?    Yes    No    Don't know  Have you read Kernighan and Ritchie?  10  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  15             When rendered, it looks like Figure 7.1, on the following page. Not too good. We need to ﬁx it so that the questions are shown on alternating bands of light and dark gray, the options are lined up in columns, and the layout keeps looking good even when the user dynamically changes the viewport or text size. Also, notice how the second, fourth, sixth, and eighth questions are relevant only if the preceding question is answered “yes.” We’ll change the behavior of the form to animate an even question into view when its owning question is marked “yes” and out of view when marked “no.”  But  there’s always a but! , there are rules: we can’t modify the source HTML  we can modify the contents of the head element ; we can modify the DOM tree after the source is parsed by the browser; and, no, we can’t cheat by replacing the whole thing with a JavaScript-generated table. We’ll call this the “question-list challenge”; as we solve the puz- zle, we’ll demonstrate each major area covered by Dojo’s DOM utility functions.   FINDING AND EDITING NODES  146  Figure 7.1: A poorly formatted set of questions  dojo.query  As a ﬁrst step, we’ll color the background of the questions alternate shades of gray. To do this, we need to get the set of question nodes and then set the background color style as we traverse the list. Specif- ically, we need to get the set of p nodes that are descendents of the div node with the class questions. Hmmm...sounds like a CSS selector. But browsers don’t give JavaScript access to their CSS query engines; fortunately, Dojo includes this functionality.4  The function dojo.query takes a CSS selector and returns an array of nodes that match the selector. The array of nodes is returned in a Dojo NodeList object, which behaves as if it were a subclass of Array. NodeLists include the Mozilla JavaScript 1.6 array extensions  discussed in Sec- tion 5.2, JavaScript 1.6 Array Methods, on page 90  as well as a few con- venience functions for common node manipulation  we’ll look at these in Section 7.2, dojo.NodeList Capabilities, on page 154 .5  If you’re not familiar with CSS selectors, [Mey06] is an excellent reference.  4. 5. NodeList is not a subclass of Array but rather an Array object with several per-object   FINDING AND EDITING NODES  147  dojo.query also accepts an optional second argument that gives the subtree to search; if the second argument is missing, then the docu- ment is assumed. Providing a subtree limits the search, resulting in a sometimes-dramatic performance improvement. As usual when speci- fying a DOM node, the second argument can be either a node or the id  a string  of the target node.  We have enough information to use dojo.query to get all the question nodes in our document. Here’s how to do it:  Download dom frags.js  Line 1  dojo.query "div.questions p" ;  This returns a Dojo NodeList that contains all the question nodes. Since NodeList deﬁnes the method forEach, setting the background color could not be easier:  Download dom questions1.htm  Line 1  dojo.query "div.questions p" .forEach function node, i {  dojo.addClass node,  i % 2  ? "lightBand" : "darkBand" ;  -  -  } ;  The code sets the class attribute on odd lines to lightBand and on even lines to darkBand.  The same technique can be used to ﬁx up the form’s title paragraph  the p element that contains the text “Programming Interview Questions” . We’re after the ﬁrst p element child of the form. The CSS selector form > p serves this up perfectly:  Download dom questions1.htm  Line 1  dojo.addClass dojo.query "form > p" [0], "formTitle" ;  There is a big gotcha here. dojo.query always returns a Dojo NodeList. It just doesn’t matter that the particular CSS selector will ﬁnd only a single element. So when you need to access a NodeList as if it were just a single element, you must specify this by selecting the ﬁrst element with [0].6  methods added. Currently, it’s impossible to derive from Array without undesirable side effects. 6. As we’ll see in Section 7.2, dojo.NodeList Capabilities, on page 154, this line could also be written as dojo.query "form > p" .addClass "formTitle" ;.   To make any of this work, we have to load dojo.js and a style sheet. Here’s the head element:  FINDING AND EDITING NODES  148  Mastering Dojo - DOM Utilities Demonstration - Question List Challenge Step 1  Download dom questions1.htm  Line 1              @import "questions.css";     10  <script  type="text javascript" src=" dojoroot dojo dojo.js" djConfig="isDebug: true">         function  {  function layout1  {  } ;  }  }   ;        dojo.addOnLoad layout1 ;  Download dom questions.css  Line 1  * {  margin:0; border:0; padding:0; font-family:arial;  5  }  10  }  body {  .formTitle {  padding: .5em;  background-color:FCFCFC;  15  20  25  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  dojo.addClass dojo.query "form > p" [0], "formTitle" ; dojo.query "div.questions p" .forEach function node, i {  dojo.addClass node,  i % 2  ?

We still have some work to do, but before we ﬁnish the challenge, let’s take a moment to talk about dojo.query selectors and dojo.NodeList in detail.  dojo.query Selectors  dojo.query supports many  but not all  CSS 3 selectors, as speciﬁed at http:  www.w3.org TR css3-selectors selectors. In Figure 7.3, on page 152, you can see the rows of the selector summary table, as it appears in the W3C standard, that are supported by dojo.query at the time of this writing [GÇH+05]. The second column gives an example of each query that can be used with the demonstration we’ll develop in a moment.  dojo.query is likely to evolve and support more selectors as well as other types of query languages  for example, XPath . Currently, dojo.query is implemented in JavaScript since most browsers fail to give public access to their internal CSS query engines.   FINDING AND EDITING NODES  150  Figure 7.2: Improvement  If when browsers provide access, dojo.query will simply pass query re- quests through to the native CSS engine.  Let’s build a demonstrator page that we can use to experiment with CSS selectors. First we need a little HTML document with enough ele- ments, structure, classes, and attributes to demonstrate each selector in action:  Download dom query-demo.htm  Line 1        5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  Section 1          Introduction Text             Section 1.1   FINDING AND EDITING NODES  151  15  20  25  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  5  15  20     Section 1.1, Paragraph-1            Section 1.1, Paragraph-2  class=special   Section 1.1, Paragraph-3  myAttrib="special"        Section 1.1, Paragraph-4  myAttrib="special-1 special-2 special-3"              Next, we’ll add a form to the bottom of the page that collects a CSS selector string. When the form is submitted, dojo.query ﬁnds the set of nodes described by the selector string, and then each node in the set is outlined in a red border. Here’s the code:  Line 1     Download dom query-demo.htm     Enter selector string; press &lt;enter&gt; to process:              dojo.addOnLoad function  {  10  dojo.connect dojo.byId "qform" , "submit", function e {    stop default processing and propagation    we really don't want to submit the form  dojo.stopEvent e ;    erase any previous borders... dojo.query "*", "fixture" .style "border", "" ;    set all elements found by the query to have a red border... var query= dojo.byId "query" .value; dojo.query query, "fixture" .style "border", "2px solid red" ;  } ;  } ;     If we type “.special” into the input box and hit Enter , the second para- graph of section 1.1 will be outlined by a red border, as shown in Fig- ure 7.4, on page 153.

So, the following...  dojo.query selector .style style, value ;  is equivalent to this:  dojo.query selector .forEach function n {dojo.style n, style, value ;} ;  You can use this technique in your own development work. When you’re having trouble understanding the behavior of a CSS selector, you can add a form like the one we just developed to the bottom of your HTML document. Or, if you’re using Firebug, forget about the form, and just type the dojo.query function call into the console to see what it returns.  Before we leave dojo.query, let’s explore the NodeList objects it returns.   FINDING AND EDITING NODES  154  Alex Says. . .  dojo.query Today, querySelectorAll Tomorrow  Where it makes sense, Dojo is built to be compatible with upcoming standards. Eventually, these standards should be implemented by all browsers, and when they are, they’ll be faster and easier to use than the scripted alternatives. dojo.query is a great example. The W3C Selectors API standard  http:  www.w3.org TR selectors-api  describes an API for query- ing the DOM tree with CSS selectors and the Web API’s work- ing group has speciﬁed a programmatic variant, the func- tion querySelectorAll, which returns an array of nodes just like dojo.query does. Dojo’s CSS query engine has always been fast, and by keeping the query syntax to just what CSS provides, the design avoids getting into a situation where sending a scripted query engine down the wire will always be required. Instead, Dojo uses querySelectorAll on the browsers that support it sanely. Sooner or later, dojo.query will become nothing more than a call into querySelectorAll plus some syntactic sugar on the returned array. Best yet, the API won’t change and you can get the speedup of having the query engine implemented in C++ on the browsers that support it now, knowing full well that things will only get faster and smaller in the future without backward- compatibility headaches. Investing in a toolkit that is paying attention to the evolution of the Web is already paying divi- dends for Dojo users.  dojo.NodeList Capabilities  NodeList objects are arrays with several additional per-object methods. They include all of the JavaScript core Array methods  concat, join, pop, and the rest .7 These all work as expected. For example, given myN- odeList  a NodeList , myNodeList.slice 2, 5  returns a new NodeList object that consists of the third through ﬁfth elements of myNodeList.  We already mentioned that NodeList also includes the Mozilla JavaScript 1.6 array functions indexOf, lastIndexOf, every, some, map, and forEach. So, instead of writing this...  dojo.forEach someNodelist, function node { *do something with node* } ;  7. NodeList does not override join; consequently, join will return a result, but it usually isn’t very useful.   FINDING AND EDITING NODES  155  you can write this:  someNodelist.forEach function node { *do something with node* } ;  Finally, NodeList includes a few methods that are syntactic sugar for applying common functions to each element. These methods are sum- marized here  myNodeList is a NodeList object :    coords: Gets the top, left, height, and width of each node with dojo.coords  see Section 7.4, Positioning with CSS and Dojo, on page 161 .

Extending dojo.query  dojo.query is quite powerful out of the box. But, depending on your needs, you may ﬁnd it convenient to add methods to the objects that dojo.query returns. For example, you might want to “yellow-fade” all the elements with the HTML class changed and then remove the class—that is, you’d like to write something like this:  dojo.query "container .changed" .fadeAndClear  ;  The key to extending dojo.query is understanding that it returns a dojo.NodeList instance. So to get the desired effect, you must add a property to the prototype object  see Section 9.2, Proto- types and Prototypal Inheritance, on page 226 for a discussion of prototypes  of the NodeList constructor function:  dojo.NodeList.prototype.fadeAndClear= function   {  this.forEach function node {  dojo.anim node, {backgroundColor:yellow} ; dojo.removeClass node, "changed" ; }   ; return this;  };  Typically, you’ll want to ensure that methods added to dojo.NodeList return the source instance so that several functions can be chained like this:  dojo.query "container .changed" .doThis  .doThat  .doTheOther  ;    orphan: Removes nodes that are caught in a ﬁlter from their par- ent by the DOM function Node.removeChild; the nodes are also removed from the source NodeList. The ﬁlter must be a single- expression CSS selector  for example, .someClass ; if the ﬁlter is missing, then all nodes in the NodeList are removed. It returns the removed nodes. Note that since the nodes are returned, they are not destroyed.  Notice how attr  setter version , style  setter version , addClass, remove- Class, place, and connect all return the source NodeList. This allows sev- eral of these functions to be chained so that many operations can be accomplished in one statement.   INSER TING, MOVING, AND DELETING DOM NODES  158  Figure 7.5: The basic structure for two questions  For example, you can add the class "error" and remove the class "warning" to myNodeList in one statement by writing this:  myNodeList.addClass "error" .removeClass "warning" ;  Now that we have a good handle on how to ﬁnd DOM nodes and edit their properties, let’s turn to the other side of DOM programming— manipulating the contents and structure of the DOM tree.  7.3 Inserting, Moving, and Deleting DOM Nodes  When we left the question-list challenge, the questions were colored with alternating shades of gray. As a second step, we’ll get the options to line up in columns and make sure they stay lined up when the user changes the text size.  Example of DOM Tree Manipulation  To solve this part of the challenge, we’ll change the structure of the doc- ument slightly. Each question will be contained in a div.question node  a div element with the class question . Each question option and the question text will be contained in p nodes that are children of the new div.question node with the classes qOption and qText, respectively. We’ll ﬁnish the structure by decorating it with nodes from the original docu- ment. In Figure 7.5 you can see the basic structure for two questions.  The new structure makes it easy to position the options and question text in columns. The option paragraphs are ﬂoated left, and their widths are set to the maximum width of all options in the containing column. The question text is padded on the left enough to accommodate the sum   INSER TING, MOVING, AND DELETING DOM NODES  159  Figure 7.6: Original and new structure for a single question  of the widths of all the option columns. This design causes the options and the questions to line up.8  In Figure 7.6, you can see the before and after shots for a single ques- tion. Looking at the diagram, here’s what needs to be done:  For each question...  1. Create a div.question node  A .  2. For each option in the current question  3 then 6 ...  a  Create a p.qOption node  B then C . Place this new node as the  last child of the div.question node  A .  b  Place the original span node  3 then 6  in the new p.qOption  node.  8. Of course, there are many ways to solve the problem at hand  for example, it could be done without any node manipulation, relying solely on CSS styles . This is a teaching example constructed to demonstrate some Dojo functions.   INSER TING, MOVING, AND DELETING DOM NODES  160  3. At this point, the only thing left in the original question node  1  is the question text  2 . Placing the original question node  1  as the last child of the div.question node  A  ﬁnishes the structure for a single question.  Moving Nodes with dojo.place  The function dojo.place inserts a node relative to another node. This one function is easier to use and replaces the W3C functions appendChild, replaceChild, and insertBefore. dojo.place takes a source node, a reference node, and a position  "before"; "after"; "ﬁrst"; "last"; an integer; or missing, which implies "last"  and inserts the node relative to the reference node as given by position:    before after: The node is placed before after the reference node as    ﬁrst last: The node is placed as the ﬁrst last child of the reference  a sibling.  node.    n: The node is placed as the nth child of the reference node; zero  implies the ﬁrst child.  As usual, the node to be placed and or the reference node can be spec- iﬁed by providing a DOM node or an id value for the target DOM node.  dojo.place and dojo.query make implementing the algorithm a snap:  Download dom questions2.htm  Line 1  function restructure  {  var questionGroup= dojo.query "div.questions" [0];  note [0]! dojo.query "p", questionGroup .forEach function node {  var question= createNode "div", "question" ; dojo.place question, questionGroup, "last" ; dojo.query "span", node .forEach function choiceNode {  var choice= createNode "p", "choice" ; dojo.place choice, question, "last" ; dojo.place choiceNode, choice, "last" ;  } ; dojo.place node, question, "last" ;  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  } ;  }  restructure is hooked up to ﬁre by dojo.addOnLoad. The function does not include the alternate shading accomplished earlier; this will be weaved back into the loop later. Finally, the function createNode is a little three- liner that creates a new DOM node and sets its class attribute.   POSITIONING DOM NODES  161  Download dom questions2.htm  Line 1  function createNode tag, className {  var newNode= document.createElement tag ; dojo.addClass newNode, className ; return newNode;  -  -  -  5  }  There are a couple of other DOM structure functions that we should mention since they didn’t make it into the example. First, there’s dojo. isDescendant node, ancestor , which returns true if node is a descendant of ancestor. And there’s the bed lump function dojo._destroyElement node  that destroys node and all of its children in a browser-independent manner that doesn’t leak. The arguments in these functions can be either DOM nodes or ids.  Now that we have the structure set, we can move on to positioning elements.  7.4 Positioning DOM Nodes  Dojo provides several functions that take all the pain and mystery out of positioning DOM nodes. For example, to set the  top, left  position of a DOM node with CSS styles, you must write something like this:  dojo.style myNode, "top", 20 ; dojo.style myNode, "left", 30 ;  That’s pretty verbose code for something as simple as setting a couple of coordinates. Dojo’s positioning functions are more concise; they also clean up a few browser incompatibilities. After a quick review of CSS positioning, we’ll describe Dojo’s positioning functions, and then we’ll use them to align the columns in the question-list challenge.  Positioning with CSS and Dojo  In addition to positioning a DOM element with the normal ﬂow  position style static , CSS provides for positioning and sizing a block-level DOM element relative to the browser’s viewport  ﬁxed , relative to its contain- ing parent node  absolute , or relative to its position in the normal ﬂow  relative .9 The various metrics deﬁned by CSS are shown in Figure 7.7, on the next page.  Internet Explorer  at least up to version 7  does not support ﬁxed positioning, and  9. even Dojo cannot rectify this.   POSITIONING DOM NODES  162  Figure 7.7: CSS positioning metrics  The diagram shows the two “box models” provided by CSS; these deﬁne the semantics of the width and height styles.    “content-box” where the width height style is equal to the content  width height. This is the default model.    “border-box” where the width height is equal to the width height of the  left border + content width + right border   top border + content height + bottom border . This is available in browsers that support the CSS style box-sizing.10  The left, right, top, and bottom styles are the offset from the containing block’s margin edge to the target block’s margin edge  for example, see Figure 7.8, on the following page .  Consult [Mey06] for a detailed discussion of the arcana of CSS posi- tioning if any of this is new to you.  Dojo deﬁnes positions and sizes by a JavaScript object with the prop- erties l  left position or extent , t  top position or extent , w  width or left+right extent , h  height or top+bottom extent , x  horizontal scroll offset , and y  vertical scroll offset —all in pixels. We’ll term this object  10. Peter-Paul Koch has a nice write-up on this at http:  www.quirksmode.org css box.html.   POSITIONING DOM NODES  163  Figure 7.8: CSS positioning metrics  a Dojo box object, and it is used with most of the positioning functions. For example:  var box= dojo.marginBox myNode ;  box is a Dojo box object with the properties l, t, w, and h, which give the left, top, width, and height of the margin box of myNode.  The semantics of a box object property  whether the property is a posi- tion or an extent  depend upon the context in which the box object is used. For example, the function dojo.marginBox returns  top position, left position, width, height , whereas dojo._getMarginExtents returns  top extent, left extent, top+bottom extent, left+right extent  of the margins.  Dojo provides two public functions, dojo.marginBox node, box  and dojo. borderBox node, box , that can be used to get or set the position and or size of the DOM node given by node. In both cases, box  optional  is a Dojo box object, without the x and y scroll offsets. If box is missing, then the functions get the current value of the appropriate box  the margin box or border box, depending upon which function you call . You can move and or size a box by providing a box object.   POSITIONING DOM NODES  164  For example:  Download dom core-dom-utils.js  Line 1    node is a DOM node  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10    move node to 20 pixels right and 30 pixels down from the reference box   the box size is not changed. dojo.marginBox node, {l:20, t:30} ;    size the box to 40 pixels wide by 50 pixels high   the box top-left corner is not moved dojo.marginBox node, {h:40, w:50} ;    do both of the operations above at once dojo.marginBox node, {l:20, t:30, h:40, w:50} ;  Now that’s easy! Dojo also includes quite a few bed lump functions that get set various other box metrics:    _getMarginExtents node, computedStyle : Gets the height width of  the node’s margins.  node’s padding.  node’s borders.    _getPadExtents node, computedStyle : Gets the height width of the    _getBorderExtents node, computedStyle : Gets the height width of the    _getPadBorderExtents node, computedStyle : Gets the height width of  the sum of the node’s padding and border.    _getMarginBox node, computedStyle : Gets the left, top, width, height    _getBorderBox node, computedStyle : Gets the left, top, width, height  of the node’s margin box.  of the node’s border box.    _getContentBox node, computedStyle : Gets the left, top, width,  height of the node’s content box.    _setBox node, l, t, w, h, u : Sets the node’s left, top, width, height. Pass NaN to omit setting any dimension. u  the metric units to use  is optional and defaults to pixels; specify a string  for example %  to override default behavior.    _usesBorderBox node : Returns dojo.boxModel=="border-box"  node.  browsers seem to tagName=="TABLE" treat table and button elements as the border box even if not explic- itly set in the style sheet .   node.tagName=="BUTTON"    _setContentSize node, w, h, computedStyle : Sets the node’s content  box size.   POSITIONING DOM NODES  165    _setMarginBox node, l, t, w, h, computedStyle : Sets the node’s margin  box; pass NaN to omit setting any dimension.    coords node, includeScroll : Gets the margin box and scroll offset for a node with absolute positioning. The scroll offset is given relative to the browser viewport when includeScroll is true and relative to the document otherwise.    getComputedStyle node : Returns the CSS computed style object  for the node.  Finally, boxModel is a string  "content-box" or "border-box"  that affects how box getters setters compute space. It defaults to "content-box" un- less Internet Explorer or Opera is in quirks mode but can be changed by user code.  Many of these functions take a computedStyle object that can be created by dojo.getComputedStyle. In all cases, this object is optional and will be automatically initialized if not passed  this design allows a small optimization when a get set sequence is called on the same node .  The _get*Extents functions all return an object with the properties l, t, w, and h. In each case, l t is the size of the left top metric, and w h is the size of the left+right top+bottom metric. For example, assume the node myNode has left top right bottom borders of 5 10 15 20. Then dojo._getBorderExtents will return the object {l: 5, t: 10, w: 20, h: 30}.  We have more than enough to solve the question-list positioning prob- lem, so let’s do that next.  Dynamic Positioning Nodes  To ﬁnish the question-list challenge layout, we need to calculate the widest option in each column; this value determines the width of each column. Then each option’s margin box is set to the calculated width for the column in which it resides and ﬂoated left. The question text is padded by the total of all the column widths so that the questions always line up. Here’s the code:  Download dom questions3.htm  Line 1    get the questions in a NodeList... var questions= dojo.query "div.question" ;    find the maximum width of each column... var widths= [];  -  -  -  5   POSITIONING DOM NODES  166  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  20  25  10  } ;  } ;  } ;  } ;  } ;  questions.forEach function qNode {  dojo.query "p.choice", qNode .forEach function choiceNode, i {  var w= widths[i]  0; widths[i]= Math.max w, dojo.marginBox choiceNode .w ;    set each option to the maximum width just calculated... questions.forEach function qNode {  15  dojo.query "p.choice", qNode .forEach function choiceNode, i {  dojo.marginBox choiceNode, {w: widths[i]} ;    calculate the total width of all the columns... var paddingLeft= 0; dojo.forEach widths, function w {paddingLeft+= w;} ;    pad the question text by this width... dojo.query ".questionText" .forEach function node {  dojo.style node, "paddingLeft", paddingLeft+10+"px" ;  Since the algorithm iterates through the questions two times, the code takes a reference to the NodeList that holds the questions rather than issuing two identical queries  line 2 . Although dojo.query is fast, this kind of small optimization is usually a good idea.  Next, the maximum width of each column is found by iterating through each option list for each question  lines 6 and 7 ; dojo.marginBox is used to get the width of each option. The calculations are applied by setting the margin box of each option with dojo.marginBox  line 16 , computing the sum of the option column widths  line 21 and 22 , and setting the padding-left style of the question text with the sum  line 26 .  The question list now looks like Figure 7.9, on the next page.  Part of the challenge included ensuring the layout looks good when the user resizes the viewport or text size. For example, the layout must recalculate when the user presses Ctrl + .  Since there’s no event that’s ﬁred when this happens, the code must monitor the text size. We did this by wiring the layout function to a timer that ﬁres every two seconds.   POSITIONING DOM NODES  167  Figure 7.9: Done  The layout function is augmented with a couple of lines that check to see whether the text size actually changed since the last time it was called:  layout3.titleNode= layout3.titleNode  dojo.query "form > p" [0]; var box= dojo.marginBox layout3.titleNode ; if  layout3.basis && box.w==layout3.basis.w && box.h==layout3.basis.h  {  Download dom questions3.htm  Line 1  function layout3  {  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  return;  } layout3.basis= {w: box.w, h: box.h};    the rest of the function omitted...  The code checks the size of the title paragraph and compares it to the last check. If it changes, then the text size must have changed, and the layout is recomputed. Both the title node and the last check are stored as properties of the layout function so that they persist between timer events.   ANIMATION  168  The layout function is hooked to a timer:  Download dom questions3.htm  window.setInterval layout3, 2000 ;  7.5 Animation  Neither HTML nor the W3C DOM model includes any support for ani- mation. However, animation can be implemented by setting a timer and drawing a new object on each timer event. Dojo includes a small but powerful set of functions to help you do this, which we’ll explore next. We’ll ﬁnish our discussion with an enhancement to the question-list challenge.  DHTML Animation Basics  Let’s begin by brieﬂy describing the underlying concept. Computer- based animation, whether in the browser or some other environment, works just like a movie or cartoon. A series of individual pictures  or frames  is rapidly displayed. So long as there is not too much time or difference between each picture, the human brain puts the pictures together so that they look like a smooth motion.  Here’s a quick demonstration—we will refer to this example as the “bouncing-div”—that moves a div node across the browser viewport, bouncing off each side:  Download dom bouncing-div.htm  Line 1          5     Mastering Dojo - DOM Utilities - Bouncing DIV  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  15     ball {  position: absolute; width: 20px; height: 20px; background-color: blue;  }     <script  type="text javascript" src=" dojoroot dojo dojo.js" djConfig="isDebug: true">  20      ANIMATION  169  25  30  35  40  45  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -     var currentPosition= 0; var leftToRight= true;  function moveNode  {    get the ball node var ball= dojo.byId "ball" ;    move it  leftToRight ? currentPosition++ : currentPosition-- ; dojo.marginBox ball, {l: currentPosition} ;     twiddle leftToRight if about to go off the end var containerBox= dojo.marginBox "frame" ; var ballBox= dojo.marginBox ball ; if  leftToRight  {  if  currentPosition+ballBox.w-1 > containerBox.l+containerBox.w  {  leftToRight= false;  if  currentPosition < containerBox.l  {  leftToRight= true;  } else {  }  }  }  }  dojo.addOnLoad function  {  window.setInterval moveNode, 20 ;  50  } ;             55              The timer is set to call moveNode every 20ms  line 50 . moveNode  line 27  moves the div.ball node 1 pixel to the right until it hits the end of the containing box, then reverses course, and so on, forever. If you try the demo on your own computer, you’ll see the limits of DOM-based animation—particularly as you crank the timer interval down toward zero.11 Although there is a little jerkiness, it’s good enough for most uses. And, it’s the only way to do animation without a plug-in.  11. You can try setting the timer to 1ms and see that the browser will fail to execute a timeout this fast. Currently, the shortest interval the browser will ﬁre is between 10ms and 20ms.   ANIMATION  170  Animating with dojo.animateProperty  The function dojo.animateProperty returns a dojo._Animation object that can be used to animate a set of style properties on a DOM node. It takes a hash that includes a node, a set of styles to animate on the node, and optionally, several other properties. The animation is then executed by calling the play method on the returned object. So, the bouncing-div could be moved from one side to the other with dojo.animateProperty like this:  Download dom animation-examples.htm  Line 1  var ball= dojo.marginBox "ball" ; var containerBox= dojo.marginBox "frame" ; dojo.animateProperty {  node: dojo.byId "ball" , properties: {  left: {  start: containerBox.l, end: containerBox.l+containerBox.w-ball.w  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  }  }  } .play  ;  Not all styles can be animated. For example, animating the style overﬂow  which takes on the values visible, hidden, and scroll  is meaningless. Animating works only for styles that can take on continuous numeric values  like left in the previous example . And, as we’ll see in a minute, this includes colors—even when speciﬁed as words. For example, it is legal to animate between red and blue.  As shown in the example, the properties to animate are themselves given in a hash. The manner in which each property is animated is controlled by the values of start, end, and units, which give the starting and ending values of the style. The units sufﬁx “px” is assumed.  If the desired animation needs something else  for example “%” , then set units explicitly; otherwise, omit it as we did. start or end can be omitted in which case the value of the style immediately before the animation is played is used for missing speciﬁcation. So if you spec- ify backgroundColor: {start: yellow} and the current background color is white when the animation is played, then the animation will play back- groundColor: {start: "yellow", end: "white"}. And, yes, this is the so-called yellow-fade animation.   ANIMATION  171  Here’s the complete function call:  Download dom animation-examples.htm  Line 1  dojo.animateProperty {  node: someNode, properties: {  backgroundColor: { start: "yellow"  }  }  } .play  ;  Download dom animation-examples.htm  Line 1  dojo.animateProperty {  node: someNode, properties: {  backgroundColor: { start: "yellow"  }  }  } .play  ;  10    can also be stated like...  The previous examples invoked play immediately without saving the returned object to a local variable. However, taking a reference to the returned object and manipulating it directly is perfectly legal. Argu- ments can be set reset, and methods can be called. For example, here are two calls that look quite different but accomplish the same thing:  var myAnimation1= dojo.animateProperty {} ; myAnimation1.node= someNode; myAnimation1.properties= {backgroundColor: {start: "yellow"}}; myAnimation1.play  ;  15  Speciﬁcally, you can call the same animation object several times:  Download dom animation-examples.htm  Line 1    take a reference to the returned object... var myAnimation= dojo.animateProperty {  node: someNode, properties: {  backgroundColor: {  start: "red", end: "blue"  }  }  } ;  10    play it... myAnimation.play  ;  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -   ANIMATION  172  -  -    play it again, sam...after waiting 3s myAnimation.play 3000 ;  The example illustrates an important point: the method play returns immediately; the animation plays in the background consequent to timer interrupts. So, writing myAnimation.play  ; myAnimation.play   would cause the animation to immediately restart. You would not see two dis- tinct animations. The example used a timer to play the animation the second time well after the ﬁrst animation completed.12  As implied by the function signature, you can animate several proper- ties at once. Here’s the div moving across the screen and changing its color:  Download dom animation-examples.htm  Line 1  var ball= dojo.marginBox "ball" ; var containerBox= dojo.marginBox "frame" ; var animation= dojo.animateProperty {  node: dojo.byId "ball" , properties: {  left: {  start: containerBox.l, end: containerBox.l+containerBox.w-ball.w  }, backgroundColor: {end: "red"}  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  }  } .play  ;  1000  10  _Animation objects include several properties that can be set either by the argument to dojo.animateProperty or on the object itself:    duration: The length of the animation in milliseconds; defaults to    repeat: The number of times to repeat the animation; defaults to 0   rate: Frequency of timer in milliseconds for animation; defaults to    delay: The number of milliseconds to delay the animation after  play is called; defaults to 0  _Animation objects are controlled through the following methods:    play: Plays the animation   pause: Pauses the animation; animation can be restarted from the  paused position by calling play  12. There is a better way to do this: dojo.fx.chain myAnimation, myAnimation . We’ll talk about dojo.fx at the end of this section.   ANIMATION  173    stop: Stops the animation; calling play will restart from the begin-  ning    gotoPercent: Goes to a certain point in the animation   status: One of paused, playing, stopped  As their descriptions indicate, the operation of these methods is quite straightforward. Finally, there are several events deﬁned on _Animation objects:    onBegin: Fired after play returns during ﬁrst timer event   onAnimate: Fired before each timer event   onEnd: Fired after the last timer event   onPlay: Fired every time play is invoked   onPause: Fired if when the animation is paused   onStop: Fired if when the animation is stopped  Client code must connect to these events by dojo.connect  or equiva- lent . Here’s an example that connects the bounding-div animation to the onBegin, onAnimate, onEnd, and onPlay events:  Download dom animation-examples.htm  Line 1  var ball= dojo.marginBox "ball" ; var containerBox= dojo.marginBox "frame" ; var animation= dojo.animateProperty {  node: dojo.byId "ball" , properties: {  left: {  start: containerBox.l, end: containerBox.l+containerBox.w-ball.w  var feedbackNode= dojo.byId "target2" ; feedbackNode.innerHTML= ""; function append text  {  feedbackNode.innerHTML= feedbackNode.innerHTML + " " + text;  dojo.connect animation, "onBegin", dojo.partial append, "onBegin"  ; dojo.connect animation, "onAnimate", dojo.partial append, "."  ; dojo.connect animation, "onEnd", dojo.partial append, "onEnd"  ; dojo.connect animation, "onPlay", dojo.partial append, "onPlay"  ;  animation.play  ;  Each handler prints out its feedback by adding text to the target para- graph node.  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  15  20  }  } } ;  }   ANIMATION  174  Animating with dojo.anim  Although dojo.animateProperty is very powerful, it’s also a bit cumber- some to use for many common animation tasks. The function dojo.anim solves this problem by wrapping dojo.animateProperty with a more con- venient, if somewhat less powerful, interface. The easiest way to under- stand dojo.anim is to simply look at its implementation:  Line 1  dojo.anim = function node, properties, duration, easing, onEnd, delay {  node, duration  dojo._Animation.prototype.duration,  Download dom animation-examples.htm  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  return dojo.animateProperty {  node: duration: properties: properties, easing: onEnd:  easing, onEnd  } .play delay0 ;  };  For example, this makes the yellow-fade task a one-liner:  Download dom animation-examples.htm  Line 1  dojo.anim someNode, {backgroundColor: {start: "yellow"}} ;  In practice, you should use dojo.anim anywhere you don’t need to con- trol any of the dojo.animateProperty features that dojo.anim doesn’t rec- ognize  for example, any of the events other than onEnd  and want the animation to unconditionally play  perhaps after a delay .  Let’s get back to the question-list challenge and bring it to life with dojo.animateProperties.  Animating the Question-List Challenge  Remember how the second, fourth, sixth, and eighth questions are rel- evant only if the preceding question is answered “yes”  see Figure 7.9, on page 167 ? Now, we’ll change the behavior of the form to animate an even question into view when its owning question is marked “yes” and out of view when marked “no.”  We’ll call the odd questions “pQuestions” for primary questions and the event questions “sQuestions” for secondary questions. Here’s the plan:  1. Connect a click event to one of each of the pQuestions’ option nodes; this gets ﬁred if any of the option nodes change value. The handler will animate the sQuestion into view if the pQuestion was marked “yes” and out of view if marked “no.”   ANIMATION  175  2. Change the color banding to color a pQuestion sQuestion pair the same color. This signals that an sQuestion is part of a pQuestion when it is shown and makes the interface look good when it’s not.  3. Calculate the height of each sQuestion; record the value as the  custom attribute qHeight of the sQuestion node.  4. Initialize the height of an sQuestion to zero if the owning pQues-  tion is not answered “yes.”  The changes to the restructure function are quite minor:  Download dom questions4.htm  Line 1  function restructure  {  dojo.query "form > p" .addClass "formTitle" ;  var questionsDiv= dojo.query "div.questions" [0]; dojo.query "p", questionsDiv .forEach function node, questionNumber {  var pQuestion= ! questionNumber % 2 ;  var band=  questionNumber % 4 <2 ? "lightBand" : "darkBand";  var className= "question " + band; var question= createElement "div", className ; dojo.place question, questionsDiv, "last" ; dojo.query "span", node .forEach function choiceNode {  var choice= createElement "p", "choice" ; dojo.place choiceNode, choice, "last" ; dojo.place choice, question, "last" ;  if  pQuestion && choiceNode.firstChild.value=="yes"  {  dojo.connect question, "click",  dojo.partial checkSQuestion, question, choiceNode.firstChild  ;  }  } ;  }  } ; dojo.addClass node, "questionText" ; dojo.place node, question, "last" ;  Deciding how to color a question  line 8  involves trivial arithmetic: the color changes every two questions instead of every other question.  We used dojo.partial to construct the handler  line 20 . This way, when the handler is called, the required nodes are passed into the handler already initialized and ready to go—no need to query or navigate from  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  15  20  25   the event object. Here is the event handler that’s ﬁred when the pQues- tion option is changed:  ANIMATION  176  Download dom questions4.htm  Line 1  function checkSQuestion pQuestion, choiceNode {  var sQuestion= pQuestion.nextSibling;    assume we're showing the sQuestion... var start= 0, end= dojo.attr sQuestion, "qHeight" ;    if hiding, then reverse start and end... if  !choiceNode.checked  {  10  start= end; end= 0;  }  dojo.anim sQuestion, {  backgroundColor: {start: "yellow"}, height: {start: start, end: end}  } .play  ;  }  The routine animates the height to end at the value that the layout routine  see the next code snippet  saves in the custom attribute qHeight if the pQuestion is marked “yes” or to end at zero otherwise. Leveraging dojo.anim makes this routine trivial! When a pQuestion is changed to “yes,” the question list after that pQuestion slides down, revealing the sQuestion. The opposite occurs when a pQuestion is marked “no.”  Finally, here is the changed main loop in the layout routine:  Download dom questions4.htm  Line 1    find the maximum width of each column and   calculate height and show hide the sQuestions... var widths= []; questions.forEach function qNode, questionNumber {  5  dojo.query "p.choice", qNode .forEach function choiceNode, i {  var w= widths[i]  0; widths[i]= Math.max w, dojo.marginBox choiceNode .w ;  } ;    calculate the height of the sQuestions;   hide if the primary is NOT "yes" if  questionNumber % 2  {    let the browser layout engine calculate the height... dojo.style qNode, "height", "" ; var height= dojo.style qNode, "height" ;    stuff the height into a custom attribute for use by the event handler...  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  15  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  15   ANIMATION  177  dojo.attr qNode, "qHeight", height ;    hide the question if the pQuestion isn't yes... if  !dojo.query "input[value='yes']", qNode.previousSibling [0].checked  {  dojo.style qNode, "height", 0 ;  20  -  -  -  -  -  -  25  }  } } ;  Remember, this routine may get called anytime the user does some- thing that changes the layout  for example, resizes the viewport or changes the text size . So before we get the height of the sQuestion  line 15 , the height style is set to empty  line 4 , which lets the browser calculate the height as if it were shown. After we record this value in the qHeight attribute, the sQuestion height is set back to zero if the owning pQuestion is not marked “yes.”  The technique of sliding in a box like we did here is so common in modern browser user interface design that Dojo includes the functions dojo.wipeIn and dojo.wipeOut that wrap this functionality. Each function takes a hash with semantics just like dojo.animateProperty and returns a dojo._Animate object that will wipe in out the node given in the args hash. Here is the event handler implemented with dojo.wipeIn Out:  Download dom questions4.htm  Line 1  function checkSQuestion pQuestion, choiceNode {  var f= dojo.fx[choiceNode.checked ? "wipeIn" : "wipeOut"]; f {node:pQuestion.nextSibling} .play  ;  -  -  -  }  dojo.wipeIn Out are part of the module dojo.fx, which is not included in Dojo base, so you must dojo.require "dojo.fx"  for this to work. dojo.fx includes a few other useful functions:    slideTo: Slides a node from its current position to a position given  by the top, left styles of properties    chain: Chains an array of separate _Animate objects into a single new _Animate object that runs each of the provided objects one after the other    combine: Chains an array of separate _Animate objects into a single new _Animate object that runs all the provided objects concurrently   Chapter 8  Remote Scripting with XHR, script, and iframe  Remote scripting is the process of communicating with a server from a client-side script without requiring a page reload. Several techniques have evolved that implement remote scripting using only the browser’s native capabilities.1 These are some of the most important advances in browser-based programming since they eliminate the page-at-a-time paradigm and allow the browser to behave like any other modern client in a client-server system. Remote scripting is also the basis for a wide range of UI techniques. Controls that change behavior based on partial user input  for example, displaying a list of words after a few characters are typed , forms that validate on the server without reloading when an error is detected, and single-page web applications are all examples of UIs that require remote scripting.  8.1 Native Remote Scripting  There are three well-known methods to implement native remote scripting:    Using an XMLHttpRequest  XHR  object   Dynamically loading an iframe element   Dynamically loading a script element  1. Although this is one of the cornerstones of Ajax, these techniques were known well before 2005 when the term Ajax was coined; Ajax implies much more than just remote scripting.   NATIVE REMOTE SCRIPTING  179  Each method has advantages and disadvantages. Although XHR began life as a Microsoft-only technology, it is now available in all modern browsers. It allows for full control of the HTTP transaction  URL, head- ers, content , can use any HTTP method  GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD , and can be executed both synchronously and asynchronously. On the other hand, because of the same-origin policy, an XHR object cannot communicate with a server that resides at a different origin than the document that contains the script making the service request.2 Finally, the XHR API cannot send ﬁles to the server like a normal form POST.  Dynamic iframes are still subject to the same-origin policy, but they solve the problem of POSTing a ﬁle without reloading the page. On the other hand, the script technique is free from the same-origin policy and can address any URL.  iframes expect an HTML response message, while dynamic script ele- ments expect a script for the response message. In either case, receiving content types other than those expected  for example, XML or JSON  is problematic. In such cases, machinery is required to wrap the response message appropriately at the server and unwrap it at the client.  Both iframe and script techniques offer very limited HTTP method sup- port: POST and GET are possible with iframe; script supports only GET.  In the ﬁnal analysis, you need all three techniques:    When you need to send a ﬁle to the server asynchronously, use  the iframe technique.    When you need to get around the same-origin restriction, use the  script technique  typically JSONP .    Use XHR for everything else.  Unfortunately, each of the three methods are implemented quite dif- ferently. And then there’s the usual browser mess of incompatibilities and memory leaks to deal with. It shouldn’t be this hard to make a quick server request and receive a response. But, unless and until the browser venders agree on a uniﬁed API, this is what we’re left with. Dojo rescues us by providing a simple, consistent, and powerful set of functions that execute an HTTP transaction through any of the three methods on all supported browsers. These functions are the main sub- ject of this chapter. We’ll ﬁnish up by showing one application of remote  2. Origin is given by protocol, domain name, and port number. The same-origin policy is a security feature.   USING THE DOJO XHR FRAMEWORK  180  scripting  web services  and solving a problem that comes with remote scripting  making the browser’s Back button work .  8.2 Using the Dojo XHR Framework  Much has been written about native XHR objects elsewhere, so rehash- ing this information is beyond the scope of this book.3 We do want to mention that not all browsers create XHR objects in the same way. Nor do the objects they create all work the same way. And ﬁnally, there are sequences of asynchronous and synchronous calls that can be made on some browsers that will lock the browser. Of course, Dojo ﬁxes all of these problems behind the scenes, so you don’t need to give them another thought.  But even if none of these problems existed, native XHRs would still lack several important features required for the construction of modern web applications:    Support functions to encode URL parameters and HTML form ele-    Functions for processing common types of response text  for ex-  ments  ample, JSON     The ability to time out a request   The ability to cancel a request   Robust and easy-to-use error recovery  Dojo’s remote scripting functions include all of these features. The core functions are dojo.xhrGet, dojo.xhrPost, dojo.rawXhrPost, dojo.xhrPut, dojo.rawXhrPut, and dojo.xhrDelete, which correspond to the HTTP meth- ods GET, POST  two variants , PUT  two variants , and DELETE.4 We’ll refer to these functions collectively as the Dojo dojo.xhr* functions.  Calling dojo.xhr*  Each of the dojo.xhr* functions takes a single argument hash named args that fully describes the request. The properties deﬁned by args are the same for all six functions, and default values are deﬁned for many of these properties. The dojo.xhr* functions are quite powerful, and args  3. Chapter 20 in [Fla06] provides a nice description about native XHR programming. 4. As of Dojo version 1.1, there’s also the function dojo.xhr that takes the XHR verb  GET, POST, and so on  as the ﬁrst argument.   USING THE DOJO XHR FRAMEWORK  181  controls this power. We’ll start with a simple proof-of-concept exam- ple, and then we’ll build and use a web page to demonstrate each args property.  We’ve made every attempt to avoid discussing server-side issues, but remote scripting involves making a request to and receiving a response from a server. The code download includes a very simple Ruby WEBrick server that implements all of the server-side functionality included in this chapter.  Let’s start with a simple dojo.xhrGet function call. Here’s how to HTTP GET from the URL demo id1  a relative URL  and display the contents of the response in an alert box:  Download remote-scripting remote-scripting.js  Line 1  function example1  {  dojo.xhrGet {  url: "demo id1", load: function response {alert response ;}, error: function error {alert error.message ;}  -  -  -  -  -  5  } ;  }  In this example, the server returns a response that includes the text “hello, world” when the resource demo id1 is requested.  In the example, args speciﬁed three items:    url  a string : Typically, the URL does not include the user or pass- word components  if necessary at all  or any component after the path  the parameter or query components . We’ll see how these are speciﬁed in a moment. Because of the same-origin policy, the URL is almost always a relative URL.    load: The function to call on successful completion of the request.   error: The function to call upon failure of the request.  And we relied upon default values for these items:    handleAs  a string : How to preprocess the response; defaults to handle as "text", which implies no preprocessing is executed on the response    sync  a boolean : Sends the XHR synchronously or not; defaults to    preventCache  a boolean : Prevents cached resources from being  send asynchronously  returned; defaults to false   USING THE DOJO XHR FRAMEWORK  182  We’ll discuss each of these items in more detail later in this section.  The example sends the response to an alert box if the XHR was suc- cessful; if the XHR fails, then the message given by the Error instance created as a result of the failure is sent to the alert box.  The result of a dojo.xhr* call is passed as the ﬁrst argument to the load  upon success  or error  upon failure  functions. If the call succeeded, then the result is the content that was retrieved by the XHR call after it’s passed through a content handler. The default content handler just passes the content as received from the server; we’ll discuss other con- tent handlers shortly. If the call failed, then the result is a JavaScript Error object that describes the error.  It is also possible to specify one function to handle both success and failure conditions by providing a function for the args property handle. For example:  Download remote-scripting remote-scripting.js  Line 1  function example2  {  dojo.xhrGet {  url: "demo id1", handle: function response {  if  response instanceof Error  {    failed... alert "failed: " + response.message ;  } else {    success... alert 'succeeded: "' + response + '"' ;  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  }  }  } ;  15  }  args, ioArgs, and Handler Functions  When the dojo.xhr* functions orchestrate the XHR call, they synthesize the full set of arguments required to make the call and place the result in a hash named ioArgs. The synthesized arguments come from three places:    Directly from args  for example, the URL in the previous example    Indirectly from args  for example, a parameter string may be cal-  culated from a HTML form node given in args     Default values  for example, sync in the previous example    USING THE DOJO XHR FRAMEWORK  183  ioArgs is always passed as the second argument to the load, error, and handle functions  from now on, we’ll refer to the load error handle func- tions collectively as the handler functions . Finally, the handler func- tions are called in the context of args—that is, when these functions are executed, this references args.  Before we go further, let’s set up an example framework that we’ll use to demonstrate Dojo’s remote scripting functions. Here’s a web page that can select and trigger an example. It also contains a pre element to hold the response and a div element to hold object dumps.

Try again." ;  20  dojo.addOnLoad function  {  dojo.connect dojo.byId "exTrigger" , "click", doExample ;  When the button is pressed, the value is retrieved from the text ﬁeld. If it is a valid example function, then the function is executed; other- wise, a warning is given. For example, entering “1” and clicking the button results in executing the function example1. The event is stopped because we don’t want to submit the form. Now we can go about writing several example functions to demonstrate the dojo.xhr* functions.  To begin, let’s improve the “hello, world” example by writing a handler function that dynamically ﬁlls the pre element with the response and dumps the contents of this and ioArgs.   USING THE DOJO XHR FRAMEWORK  185  Here’s that code:  Download remote-scripting remote-scripting.js  Line 1  function handler1 response, ioArgs {  var error= response instanceof Error; var responseText= error ? response.message : response; var resultNode= dojo.byId "result" ; resultNode.innerHTML= responseText.replace  < g, "&lt;" ; dojo.toggleClass resultNode, "error", error ; dojo.byId "objects" .innerHTML=  dumpObject {"this": this, ioArgs: ioArgs} ;  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  }  }  function example3  {  dojo.xhrGet {  url: "demo id1", handle: handler1  15  } ;  The handler function is trivial. If the call was successful, it pushes the response into the pre element; otherwise, it pushes the text of the Error object into the element. Any left-angle brackets in the response are escaped so that we can see the contents of the response rather than the rendering in case the response is HTML. Finally, handler1 uses the function dumpObject to format an object into a set of nested tables.5 Executing exercise3 results in the output given in Figure 8.1, on the next page in Firefox.6  There you can see that both this and ioArgs.args reference the args hash that was passed to dojo.xhrGet. The second argument passed to handler1 is the ioArgs hash that was constructed by dojo.xhrGet. Within ioArgs, you can see the following:    ioArgs.url  a string  gives the URL for the call; in this case, it’s equiv- alent to args.url, but we’ll see that the URL can also be read from a form attribute.    ioArgs.query  a string  gives any URL query parameters.   ioArgs.handleAs  a string  says how to preprocess the response be-  fore passing to the handler functions.  5. dumpObject doesn’t do anything that a Firebug console dump couldn’t accomplish other than make the screen shots for this dead-tree book easier to read. The full text of dumpObject is included in the code download. 6. Executing this example in different browsers shows how native XHR objects are struc- tured quite differently across different vendors.   USING THE DOJO XHR FRAMEWORK  186  Figure 8.1: Objects returned by dojo.xhr    ioArgs.xhr  a native XHR object  is the actual XHR object used to  execute the XHR call.  If you need to access objects in the handler functions that are deter- mined when the XHR call is made, then two techniques are available.  Of course, you can also use a global variable, but that’s a bit sloppy.  First, the handler function can be closed on the objects like this:  Download remote-scripting remote-scripting.js  Line 1  function example4  {  5  -  -  -  -  -  -    get some variables that we'll use in the handler function... var targetNode= dojo.byId "result" ;    make a handler closed on the variables we made... function handler2 response {  var error= response instanceof Error; var responseText= error ? response.message : response;   USING THE DOJO XHR FRAMEWORK  187  targetNode.innerHTML= responseText.replace  < g, "&lt;" ; dojo.toggleClass targetNode, "error", error ;    note: NOT dumping anything... dojo.byId "objects" .innerHTML= "";  }  }  10  15  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  15    make the XHR call... dojo.xhrGet {  url: "demo id1", handle: handler2  20  } ;  }  When handler2 is called, targetNode on lines 9 and 10 will still hold the value calculated at line 3.  Second, you can also pass the objects directly in the args hash. A little caution is required to avoid using a property name that’s already in use by the Dojo functions; we’ll use the property _user. Here’s the same example with targetNode passed in args:  Download remote-scripting remote-scripting.js  Line 1  function example5  {  function handler3 response {  var error= response instanceof Error; var responseText= error ? response.message : response; this._user.targetNode.innerHTML= responseText.replace  < g, "&lt;" ; dojo.toggleClass this._user.targetNode, "error", error ;    note: ONLY dumping this... dojo.byId "objects" .innerHTML=  dumpObject {"this": this} ;    make the XHR call... dojo.xhrGet {  url: "demo id1", handle: handler3, _user: {targetNode: dojo.byId "result" }  } ;  }  Since this references args when handler3 is called and also since args._user. targetNode was initialized prior to the XHR call, it will be there waiting for us in the handler. Passing objects around in this manner is slightly more efﬁcient than creating a closure, but in most cases the speed differences are inconsequential, and you should look to other factors such as clarity of expression to decide which technique to employ.   USING THE DOJO XHR FRAMEWORK  188  Alex Says. . .  JSON Vulnerabilities  Given the obvious security issues surrounding cross-domain scripts and data, it might then surprise you to learn that the dynamic nature of JavaScript also places regular JSON data at risk via an attack inartfully named cross-site request forgery  aka CSRF  and JavaScript hijacking. Brieﬂy, CSRF uses your ses- sion cookies against you. Say you’re logged into FooBlog and it uses cookies to authenticate users. Part of the FooBlog applica- tion hands back a list of private comments that users have left for the moderators, not to be seen by other users; furthermore, let’s assume that FooBlog hands this data back as a JSON doc- ument. Seems pretty straightforward.  Now, during your daily FooBlog moderation work, you see a message that is interesting, but you haven’t heard of the com- menter, so you click the link to go to the website. Upon visiting the site  Evil.com , the page at Evil.com tries to make a cross- site script request to include the moderation feed JSON into the document. Because JSON is just JavaScript and will be eval- uated as such and because your browser is already authen- ticated on FooBlog, this request will succeed. But remember that this is all happening inside your browser, not on Evil.com’s servers. How could your data be at risk here? Well, it turns out that the dynamic nature of JavaScript allows you to reprogram the constructor function for even the most fundamental classes like Object. Since the included JSON ﬁle will execute as a script and the anonymous objects inside it will be instantiated via the Object constructor, this gives a script on the Evil.com page an in. Using this language loophole, it’s possible to use CSRF to attack sensitive JSON data living at stable or predictable URLs.   USING THE DOJO XHR FRAMEWORK  189  Content Handlers  When the response is successfully received, it is passed through the content handler speciﬁed by the handleAs property  a string  of args. Six content handlers are available:    "text"  the default handler : No processing takes place; the response  text is returned without any transformation.    "json": The response is processed as JSON by the function dojo. fromJson, and the resulting object is returned. dojo.fromJson takes a single argument string, evaluates it, and returns the result.    "json-comment-ﬁltered": The text within a  *... *  comment is pro- cessed as JSON by dojo.fromJson, and the resulting object is then returned. See the Alex Says. . . , on page 195 to learn about com- ment-ﬁltered JSON.    "json-comment-optional": If the response contains a  *... *  comment, then the text within the comment is processed as JSON by dojo. fromJson, and the resulting object is returned; otherwise, the entire response is processed as JSON by dojo.fromJson.    "javascript": The response is processed as JavaScript by dojo.eval; and the result is returned; dojo.eval evaluates the response in the global scope.    "xml": The result of the XHR method responseXML is returned.  In the examples so far, we did not specify a value for args.handleAs; therefore, the response was handled as "text", and no transformation took place before the response was passed to the handler functions. To exercise each of the content handlers, assume the server returns the following responses when sent these URLs  note that the responses are strings of characters, not JavaScript objects :  demo id2  demo id3  demo id4  {"ﬁrstName": "George", "lastName": "Bush", "address": {"street": "1600 Penn- sylvania Avenue NW", "city": "Washington", "state": "DC", "zip": "20500"}}   *{"ﬁrstName": "George", "lastName": "Bush", "address": {"street": "1600 Penn-  sylvania Avenue NW", "city": "Washington", "state": "DC", "zip": "20500"}}*   Number dojo.byId "exId" .value  * 10   USING THE DOJO XHR FRAMEWORK  190  demo id5    George  Bush   <address  street="1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW" city="Washington"  state="DC" zip="20500"  >   Now we can demonstrate retrieving JSON by setting args.handleAs to "json":  Download remote-scripting remote-scripting.js  Line 1  function handler4 response, ioArgs {  var error= response instanceof Error; var responseText= error ? response.message : ioArgs.xhr.responseText; var resultNode= dojo.byId "result" ; resultNode.innerHTML= responseText.replace  < g, "&lt;" ; dojo.toggleClass resultNode, "error", error ; dojo.byId "objects" .innerHTML=  dumpObject {response: response} ;  }  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  15  function example6  {  dojo.xhrGet {  url: "demo id2", handleAs: "json", handle: handler4  } ;  }  The example constructs a new handler  handler4  that displays both the raw response and the ﬁnal result after applying the content handler to the raw response. Usually, you won’t be interested in the raw response, but it is available at ioArgs.xhr.responseText  line 3 . Notice that the pro- cessed response is not text but, rather, is a full-ﬂedged JavaScript object. In Figure 8.2, on the next page, you can see the result of running example 6.  If you run the example with the debug console open, you will see a warning appear something like ”Consider using mimetype:text json- comment-ﬁltered to avoid potential security issues with JSON end- points  use djConﬁg.usePlainJson=true to turn off this message .”  There are two solutions to eliminating this message. First, you can follow the instructions and set djConﬁg.usePlainJson to true when load- ing dojo.js  see Section 4.3, Loading Dojo, on page 78 . Otherwise, you can change the server to send comment-ﬁltered JSON and specify "json- comment-ﬁltered" for args.handleAs.   USING THE DOJO XHR FRAMEWORK  191  Figure 8.2: Retrieving JSON  Here’s what that looks like:  Download remote-scripting remote-scripting.js  Line 1  function example7  {  dojo.xhrGet {  url: "demo id3", handleAs: "json-comment-filtered", handle: handler4  -  -  -  -  -  5  } ;  }  The resulting output is given in Figure 8.3, on the next page.  Notice that the "json" handler prohibits comment-ﬁltered JSON, while "json-comment-ﬁltered" requires it. The handler "json-comment-optional" solves this problem by treating the response as "json-comment-ﬁltered" and falling back to "json" if this fails. The code download includes exam- ples 8 and 9 that demonstrate the "json-comment-optional" handler.  Specifying "javascript" for args.handleAs causes the response text to be evaluated in the global scope by dojo.eval. Our test server has concocted a little calculation based on the value of the inputexId element when the URL demo id4 is requested.   USING THE DOJO XHR FRAMEWORK  192  Figure 8.3: Retrieving comma-ﬁltered JSON  Here’s the example:  Download remote-scripting remote-scripting.js  Line 1  function example10  {  dojo.xhrGet {  url: "demo id4", handleAs: "javascript", handle: handler4  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  }  } ;   returns "Number dojo.byId "exId" .value  * 10"  The resulting output is given in Figure 8.4, on the following page.  Finally, specifying "xml" for args.handleAs causes the XHR responseXML property to be returned as the result. Some help is given in certain cases where Internet Explorer fails to properly parse a good document.   USING THE DOJO XHR FRAMEWORK  193  Figure 8.4: Retrieving JavaScript  Here’s the example to get an XML document:  Download remote-scripting remote-scripting.js  Line 1  function example11  {  function handler5 response, ioArgs {  var error= response instanceof Error; var responseText= error ? response.message : ioArgs.xhr.responseText; var resultNode= dojo.byId "result" ; resultNode.innerHTML= responseText.replace  < g, "&lt;" ; dojo.toggleClass resultNode, "error", error ; dojo.byId "objects" .innerHTML=  dumpObject {response: response} ;  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  15  10  }  dojo.xhrGet {  url: "demo id5", handleAs: "xml", handle: handler5  } ;  }  The resulting output is given in Figure 8.5, on the next page.  Controlling the HTTP Transaction  At its heart, an XHR simply executes an HTTP transaction. So far, we’ve seen only how to specify the URL. Let’s look at other aspects of the HTTP transaction that can be conﬁgured.   USING THE DOJO XHR FRAMEWORK  194  Figure 8.5: Retrieving XML  First, the XHR open method can accept optional user and password values for servers that require authentication. These values can be set by the args properties user and password, respectively. Setting args. preventCache to true causes the parameter "dojo.preventCache=current- timestamp" to be appended to the URL. Since the current time will change with each XHR execution, the URL will change, and any cache should be defeated.  A hash of headers to be sent with the transaction can be given at args.headers. The Content-Type header can be speciﬁed in either args. contentType or args.headers["content-type"]. At most, one of these loca- tions should be used; if completely missing, then Content-Type defaults to "application x-www-form-urlencoded". If you make a mistake and spec- ify the content type in both places, the value of args.contentType wins.   USING THE DOJO XHR FRAMEWORK  195  Alex Says. . .  Securing JSON  First, it should be noted that securing JSON is an issue only for sensitive data. Serving public data via JSON or JSONP at stable URLs is often a good idea. For sensitive data, you need to do something different, though. You want to ensure that your use of the data on the same domain  usually retreived with XHR  exhibits some property that thwarts cross-domain requests via a   tag. To do this, you’ll either add JavaScript com- ments around the contents of your JSON or put a while 1 ; line at the beginning of your data. Both techniques allow process- ing of the text via a regex before parsing the JSON when requested on the same domain  via XHR  but thwart inclu- sion via   tags. The while 1 ; solution is considered supe- rior because it reduces the risk of data attempting to inject escape sequences, although Dojo today uses json-comment- ﬁltered  JSON with comments around it  as a default and warns if JSON data is requested via XHR without this kind of protection.  In any case, the strongest solutions to these problems are on the server side: sensitive data should not be served at predictable URLs, and some security token other than cookies should be used to validate a request. One good solution is to force the requesting system to include the contents of one of the cook- ies in the body of the request, which is something a script on the same domain can easily do but Evil.com’s script can’t. Regard- less, assertions that JavaScript toolkits need to “do something” about CSRF and JavaScript hijacking are largely bogus. Dojo goes as far as it can to help developers do the right thing, but real solutions to CSRF all require server-side code to be ﬁxed.   USING THE DOJO XHR FRAMEWORK  196  Setting args.sync to hold the identity true causes the XHR to be executed synchronously. Note carefully that args.sync must be set to the boolean value true  that is, sync===true must evaluate to true  in order for to send the XHR synchronously. So, for example, sync:1 would not do the trick; you must say something like sync:true or sync: !!callSynchronously . You should avoid making synchronous XHR calls since the browser will be locked until the call returns.  Finally, URL query parameters can be speciﬁed by providing them in the args.content hash directly.  Let’s put all of this together and execute an XHR transaction that exer- cises these properties. Here’s an example:  Download remote-scripting remote-scripting.js  Line 1  dojo.xhrGet {  url: "demo id6", user: "john", password: "open-sesame", content: {  param1: "someParamValue", param2: 2.7183  }, contentType: "text plain", headers: {  myKey: "someValue", anotherKey: 3.1416  }, synch: true, preventCache: true, handleAs: "json-comment-filtered", handle: handler12  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  15  } ;  }  When you run the example in Firefox with Firebug, you’ll see the actual URL used is http:  john:open-sesame@localhost:8002 remote-scripting  demo id6?param1 = someParamValue&param2 = 2.7183&dojo.preventCache= 1209234790968. Notice the URL includes the user ID password fragment john:open-sesame@. The parameter fragment ?param1=someParamValue& param2=2.7183&dojo.preventCache=1209234790968. param1 and param2 were set by args.content, while dojo.preventCache was set since args. preventCache was true  1203402063531 was the current time the XHR was executed .   USING THE DOJO XHR FRAMEWORK  197  The args property timeout can be used to set the time in milliseconds to wait for the XHR to complete. Of course, timeout is meaningful only when the XHR is executed asynchronously. If the XHR has not com- pleted within the allotted time period, then it will be aborted, and the error and or handle function will be called. If timeout is omitted, the XHR will time out as provided by the browser.  Using Forms  Often a form is used to collect information that is passed to the server through an XHR transaction. Unlike native XHR objects that provide no help in bundling the information contained in the form, the dojo.xhr* functions do most of this work for you. Let’s look at an example; ﬁrst we need a form:  Download remote-scripting remote-scripting2.htm  Line 1      Name:      Sex:    Male    Female      The contents of the form can be transacted with the server by specifying the form node or id attribute of the form node in the args.form property. The URL is taken from the form’s action attribute. Here’s the code:  Download remote-scripting remote-scripting.js  Line 1  function example13  {  dojo.xhrGet {  form: "exForm", handleAs: "json-comment-filtered", handle: handler4  } ;  }  -  -  -  -  -  5  -  -  -  -  -  5  Assuming the user supplied “Jane Doe” for the name and clicked the female radio button, then an HTTP GET transaction is executed with the relative URL demo id7&name=Jane%20Doe&sex=f. What could be simpler?  There are two places where certain XHR parameters can be “overde- termined.” For example, the URL can be speciﬁed both in args.url and in the form’s action attribute. Similarly, both the contents of the form and the value of args.contents are destined to the parameters portion of the URL  or, as we’ll see in a moment, the POST body content . In each   case, when there is a clash, the values in args win. For example, writing this...  USING THE DOJO XHR FRAMEWORK  198  Download remote-scripting remote-scripting.js  Line 1  function example14  {  dojo.xhrGet {  form: "exForm", content: {sex: "m", anotherParam: 3.1416}, handleAs: "json-comment-filtered", handle: handler4  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  } ;  }  results in the parameter string demo id7?name=Jane%20Doe&sex=m& anotherParam=3.1416. Notice how "sex=f" from the form was overwritten by "sex=m" as speciﬁed by content. Sorry, Jane.  Posting and Other HTTP Methods  dojo.xhrPost works just like dojo.xhrGet except that an HTTP POST transac- tion is executed and parameters given by args.content and args.form are sent in the HTTP request body rather than as a query string encoded in the URL.  dojo.rawXhrPost also executes an HTTP POST transaction, but it com- pletely ignores args.content and args.form. Instead, the string value of the args.postData property is sent verbatim in the request body.  dojo.xhrPut and dojo.rawXhrPut work like dojo.xhrPost and dojo.rawXhrPost except that an HTTP PUT transaction is executed. In similar fashion, dojo.xhrDelete works like dojo.xhrGet.  It’s easy to get confused about all of this; here’s a summary of how parameters are speciﬁed:    The request parameters for dojo.xhrGet, dojo.xhrDelete, dojo.xhrPost, and dojo.xhrPut are speciﬁed by args.content and args.form  both properties are optional . When there is a clash and both args. content and args.form try to specify a value for the same property, args.content wins.    The request parameters for dojo.rawXhrPost and dojo.rawXhrPut are speciﬁed, verbatim, by the postData and putData properties of args, respectively; the parameters in args.content and args.form are ignored.   REMOTE SCRIPTING WITH SCRIPT  199  And here’s a summary of how parameters are sent in the request:    The request parameters for dojo.xhrGet and dojo.xhrDelete are en-  coded as a parameter string and appended to the URL.    The request parameters for dojo.xhrPost, dojo.xhrPut, dojo.rawXhrPost,  and dojo.rawXhrPut are sent in the request body.  The Rest of the Story  In most cases, XHR calls should be made asynchronously  this is easily accomplished by leaving args.sync uninitialized . When the native XHR object returns a response, the dojo.xhr* functions ﬁrst call the content handler and then pass the results of this call to the load error handler function speciﬁed in args. This pattern of a chain of functions executing after an asynchronous function completes should sound familiar since it is precisely the pattern dojo.Deferred manages that we discussed in Section 6.4, Managing Callbacks with dojo.Deferred, on page 123. So, it’s no surprise that the dojo.xhr* functions use dojo.Deferred instances to manage the XHR call.  Each of the dojo.xhr* functions constructs a dojo.Deferred object that manages the XHR process, and the dojo.xhr* function calls the Deferred’s callback with the result of the content handler. This starts processing down the Deferred callback queue. Usually, there is only one callback function waiting—the function speciﬁed by args.load or args.handle. If an error occurred  for example, the XHR fails or times out , then the dojo.xhr* function calls the Deferred’s errback, passing the Error object. Again, this usually results in executing the function speciﬁed by args. error or args.handle.  In most cases, you won’t care about all this gory detail—you’ll just specify a handler function. But some designs can be expressed quite elegantly in terms of the callback queue implemented by dojo.Deferred. Since the dojo.xhr* functions return the dojo.Deferred object that con- trols the XHR process, you can add functions to the callback errback queues as well as cancel the XHR.  8.3 Remote Scripting with script  When you need to dynamically load a JavaScript resource from a server that resides at a different origin than the document, XHR won’t work because of the same-origin policy. Instead, inserting a script element into the document is the method of choice. The idea is simple: create   REMOTE SCRIPTING WITH SCRIPT  200  a script element, set its source attribute to reference the resource, and then attach the element to the document. Here’s the code:  Download remote-scripting remote-scripting.js  Line 1  -  -  -  var element = dojo.doc.createElement "script" ; element.type = "text javascript"; element.src = url; dojo.doc.getElementsByTagName "head" [0].appendChild element ;  The resource identiﬁed by the URL given at line 3 will be downloaded and evaluated. And since there is no restriction on the src attribute of a script element, any resource on any server can be referenced. This gets around the same-origin restriction.7 There is still one problem to solve: how do you know when the script has arrived and been evaluated?  Detecting Dynamically Loaded Scripts  This problem has two common solutions. First, assuming the client- side code downloading the script has knowledge of some variable de- ﬁned by the script, then the client-side code could set a timer and watch for this variable to become deﬁned. Finding the variable exists indicates that the script has been downloaded and evaluated. Here is a complete example that implements this idea:  Download remote-scripting remote-scripting.js  Line 1  function example15  {  function loadScript url, checkString {  var element = dojo.doc.createElement "script" ; element.type = "text javascript"; element.src = url; dojo.doc.getElementsByTagName "head" [0].appendChild element ; var intervalId= setInterval check, 50 ;  function check  {  if  eval "typeof " + checkString + "  != 'undefined'"   {  clearInterval intervalId ; o = dojo.getObject checkString ; dojo.byId "result" .innerHTML = o.result.replace  < g, "&lt;" ;  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  15  }  }  }  }  loadScript "demo id8", "id8Object"   7. While dynamic script technique solves the same-origin restriction, it still has the lim- itation that only JavaScript content can be transferred. If you need to retrieve something else  for example, text, HTML, or XML , then that something else must be wrapped in a JSON object.   REMOTE SCRIPTING WITH SCRIPT  201  Alex Says. . .  Cross-Domain Scripts and Security  Browsers are naive. For as much commerce is done online and for as much effort is put into web application security, browsers today enforce more or less the same set of rules about where code and data comes from as they did a decade ago. The same-origin policy  see http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Same_origin_ policy  that browsers enforce isn’t part of any W3C speciﬁcation, and for the most part, it has served to keep private data private when implemented robustly enough. The theory has been that if you can keep bad things from getting into the page, then there’s no problem. All data and code that live on the same page therefore have unfettered access to each other.  But things are changing, and as mashups become ever more common, it has become accepted practice to pull in data and scripts from multiple domains. In many cases, this is actu- ally desirable for performance reasons, and browsers make no attempt to stop this unless a page is served in “SSL mode.” Because browsers are designed to trust things that somehow got into the page, scripts loaded from other servers can pro- vide both code and data to applications. In fact, the Web critically depends on this feature: without it, most ad services would fail because they use cross-domain script loading to hand pages customized, targeted ads for each visitor. The JSONP style of data loading takes advantage of this feature, but as you can imagine, there are some security risks involved. What if the script that you’re pulling in is compromised? Or what if the data isn’t correctly escaped? These are serious issues that need server-side solutions for now and browser-based solutions soon  Google Gears’ cross-domain thread worker is a promis- ing option . Today, it’s best to pull in cross-domain scripts from places that you can trust and avoid it otherwise.   REMOTE SCRIPTING WITH SCRIPT  202  For this to work, the server must send back some JavaScript that actu- ally deﬁnes the watched variable. Our test server sends back the fol- lowing code for the URL demo id8:  Download remote-scripting remote-scripting.js  id8Object= {}; id8Object.result= "exercise15--hello, world";  When this code is evaluated, the function dojo.setObject causes the object exercise15.myObject to be deﬁned. The next timer interrupt will ﬁnd eval "typeof exercise15.myObject  != ’undeﬁned’"  to evaluate to true, stop the timer, and push the result into the web page.  This method isn’t ideal since it requires all scripts downloaded in this manner to maintain at least one object name that is unique to each script. This is to say, scripts that may have no knowledge of each other must somehow construct identiﬁers that are unique—which requires some knowledge of each other!8  The second method to determine when the script has been downloaded requires some coordination between the browser and the server. When the browser makes a request for a script, it informs the server of a callback function name through the URL query string. The server then delivers a script that calls the designated function with the result of the script. Exercise 16 demonstrates this technique:  Download remote-scripting remote-scripting.js  Line 1  function example16  {  function loadScript url, callback {  dojo.setObject callback, function o {  dojo.byId "result" .innerHTML = o.result.replace  < g, "&lt;" ;  var element = dojo.doc.createElement "script" ; element.type = "text javascript"; element.src = url + "?callbackName=" + callback; dojo.doc.getElementsByTagName "head" [0].appendChild element ;  loadScript "demo id9", "exercise16.myCallback"   5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  }   }  }  In practice, there are techniques for choosing names  for example, the Microsoft Guid-  8. Gen program  that virtually assure clashes will not occur.   REMOTE SCRIPTING WITH SCRIPT  203  Our test server sends back the following code for the URL demo id9:  Download remote-scripting remote-scripting.js  exercise16.myCallback {"result": "hello, world"} ;  When the previous code is downloaded and evaluated by the dynamic script element, exercise16.myCallback is executed, and result is pushed into the web page. Notice that the example effectively delivers a JSON object to the callback function. This technique is called JSONP because it prepends JSON with a function call. JSONP is becoming increasingly common and used by several large information suppliers.  Dojo Support for Dynamic Script Elements  While these techniques are implemented quite differently when com- pared to orchestrating an XHR call, functionally they are very similar: a URL is speciﬁed, and a response is received. Dojo leverages this fact and provides the function dojo.io.script.get that works much like dojo.xhrGet.  dojo.io.script.get takes a single argument hash called args, which has semantics mostly the same as the args used with the dojo.xhr* func- tions  we’ll term the args hash used with dojo.io.script.get “script args” to avoid confusion . The script args properties content, headers, query, time- out, and preventCache have the same semantics as the dojo.xhr* func- tions. Since the response is always JavaScript and usually JSON  JSON could be used to encode any other type—HTML, XML, or others , there is no need to specify a content handler, and args.handleAs is ignored. There are also a couple of additional properties that orchestrate the two dynamic scripting techniques we just discussed.  To make a dynamic script call that signals completion by deﬁning a variable, set args.checkString to the variable name. Here is example 15 reimplemented using dojo.io.script.get:  Download remote-scripting remote-scripting.js  Line 1  dojo.require "dojo.io.script" ; function example17  {  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  function handler17 response, ioArgs {  var error= response instanceof Error; var responseText= error ? response.message : id8Object.result; var resultNode= dojo.byId "result" ; resultNode.innerHTML= responseText.replace  < g, "&lt;" ; dojo.toggleClass resultNode, "error", error ; dojo.byId "objects" .innerHTML=  dumpObject {response: response, ioArgs: ioArgs} ;  }   REMOTE SCRIPTING WITH SCRIPT  204  15  -  -  -  -  -  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  15  dojo.io.script.get {  url:"demo id8", checkString:"id8Object", handle:handler17  } ;  }  dojo.io.script is not included in dojo.js, so it must be dojo.required explic- itly. This is done at line 1. The resulting output is given in Figure 8.6, on the next page. Note that, upon success, the result passed to the han- dler function is ioArgs, not the response. In fact, it is impossible to gain access to the verbatim text that is sent to ﬁll the script element. Presum- ably, the client side knows which objects to expect from the script, so the result of the dynamic script can be accessed directly, as we’ve done at line 6 in the example. In keeping with the idea that dojo.io.script.get works like dojo.xhr*, ioArgs is also passed as the second argument. Sim- ilarly, an Error object and ioArgs are passed to error handle functions if an error occurs  for example, if a timeout as speciﬁed by args.timeout occurs .  dojo.io.script.get also implements the JSONP protocol. The parameter name in which to stuff the callback function name is speciﬁed by args. callbackParamName. Here is example 18 reimplemented using dojo.io. script.get:  Download remote-scripting remote-scripting.js  Line 1  function example18  {  dojo.require "dojo.io.script" ;  function handler18 response, ioArgs {  var error= response instanceof Error; var responseText= error ? response.message : response.result; var resultNode= dojo.byId "result" ; resultNode.innerHTML= responseText.replace  < g, "&lt;" ; dojo.toggleClass resultNode, "error", error ; dojo.byId "objects" .innerHTML=  dumpObject {"response": response, ioArgs: ioArgs} ;  }  } ;  }  dojo.io.script.get {  url:"demo id9", callbackParamName:"callbackName", handle:handler18  The resulting output is given in Figure 8.7, on page 206. Notice that Dojo constructed the URL demo id9?callbackName=dojo.io.script.jsonp_ dojoIoScript1._jsonpCallback. The query parameter was "callbackName" as   REMOTE SCRIPTING WITH SCRIPT  205  Figure 8.6: Executing dojo.io.script.get  speciﬁed in args.callbackParamName, and dojo.io.script.get created a call- back function named dojo.io.script.jsonp_dojoIoScript1._jsonpCallback. It was up to the server to return a script that calls this function, passing a single argument according to the semantics of the delivered script. The callback function implemented by dojo.io.script.get is simply a func- tion that receives a single argument, and whatever is passed for this argument is forwarded to the load handle functions. Usually the sin- gle argument is a JavaScript object, in which case the call is just a simple JSONP transaction, but there is nothing preventing the server from sending a script that passes something other than an object  for example, a number or string  to the callback function.   REMOTE SCRIPTING WITH SCRIPT  206  Figure 8.7: dojo.io.script.get with a callback  The single argument sent to the callback function is passed on as the ﬁrst argument to the load handle functions; the second argument is ioArgs. Errors are handled as usual.  As with the dojo.xhr* functions, dojo.io.script.get returns a dojo.Deferred instance that manages the process. ioArgs contains two additional pub- lic properties:    id: The HTML id attribute for the dynamically created script element   json: The argument passed to the callback function  applicable only  when args.callbackParamName is speciﬁed   If JSONP is used  by providing args.callbackParamName , then the dy- namically created script element will be automatically destroyed some time after the callback function has executed. On the other hand, if args.checkString is given, then it is left to the client code to manage the lifetime of the script element. You can destroy this element by calling the function dojo.io.script.remove ioArgs.id .   REMOTE SCRIPTING WITH IFRAME  207  Finally, Dojo’s script machinery includes the function dojo.io.script. attach that takes two arguments, id and url  both strings , and dynami- cally creates a script element with the id attribute value given by the id and the src attribute given by the url. This is just a convenience function when you need to dynamically add a script element.  8.4 Remote Scripting with iframe  The last native remote scripting technique that Dojo supports uses an iframe element to retrieve a response from the server. This is similar to the dynamic script technique just discussed. A hidden iframe element is dynamically created and attached to the document. Then either the iframe’s src attribute is set to the target URL  resulting in an HTTP GET  or a form is submitted with its target attribute set to the URL  resulting in either GET or POST depending upon the form’s method attribute . The completion of the HTTP transaction is detected by hooking an event to the iframe’s onload event, and the contents of the iframe hold the response.  The server response must be an HTML document since this is the only content that an iframe can legally contain. If the URL is actually deliver- ing some other content type  for example, JSON , then the server-side and client-side code must agree on a method to wrap and unwrap the content in HTML. Finally, the iframe technique is subject to the same- origin policy. So if the source URL references a different origin than the main document, it is impossible to share data between the two docu- ments. Given all this pain, why would you ever want to use the iframe technique?  Historically, some browsers didn’t implement the XHR API. In this case, the iframe technique was essentially equivalent to the script technique when retrieving from the same origin as the main document  retrieving HTML is slightly easier with iframes; retrieving JavaScript is slightly easier with script elements . Now that XHR is universally available, XHR should be favored over iframes since iframes are a hack. But there is still one place where iframes are required: XHRs can’t post a ﬁle; iframes can. So if you want to post a ﬁle asynchronously without a plug-in, the iframe technique is your only choice.  Dojo Support for Scripting with iframes  The function dojo.io.iframe.send implements scripting with iframes and has semantics almost identical to the dojo.xhrGet and dojo.xhrPost func-   REMOTE SCRIPTING WITH IFRAME  208  tions. It takes a single argument, args, that deﬁnes the same properties as dojo.xhr* args  we’ll term the args hash used with dojo.io.iframe.send “iframe args” to avoid confusion . iframe args also deﬁnes the additional property method  a string  that designates which HTTP method  GET or POST  to use for the transaction.  Let’s look at an example; ﬁrst we need a form with a ﬁle input element:  Download remote-scripting remote-scripting3.htm  Line 1     <form id="exForm" method="post" action="demo id11"  enctype="multipart form-data">  Name:      Sex:    Male    Female   About me:  <input type="file"  name="aboutMe" size="40" maxlength="255">         And here’s how to use dojo.io.frame.send to HTTP POST the contents of the form asynchronously:  Download remote-scripting remote-scripting.js  Line 1  dojo.require "dojo.io.iframe" ; function handler20 response, ioArgs { if  ! response instanceof Error   {  dojo.byId "objects" .innerHTML=  dumpObject {response: response, ioArgs: ioArgs} ;  } else {  var resultNode= dojo.byId "result" ; resultNode.innerHTML= response.message; dojo.toggleClass resultNode, "error", true ; dojo.byId "objects" .innerHTML=  dumpObject {response: response, ioArgs: ioArgs} ;  }  }  } ;  }  15  function example20  {  dojo.io.iframe.send {  form: "exForm", url: "demo id11", method: "post", handleAs: "json", handle: handler20  10  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  20   REMOTE SCRIPTING WITH IFRAME  209  dojo.io.iframe is not included in dojo.js, so it must be dojo.required explic- itly. This is done at line 1. The iframe args argument should look familiar. The example explicitly set args.url and args.method, but these two prop- erties could have been omitted in which case they would have been taken implicitly from the form’s action and method attributes, respec- tively. If you specify these properties in both places, args wins. Finally, dojo.io.iframe.send returns the dojo.Deferred object that controls the pro- cess just like dojo.xhr*.  The example gave "json" for args.handleAs. dojo.io.iframe.send also allows "html", "text", and "javascript", but it does not support "xml". When "html" is given, the document object that is contained by the iframe is returned. Other response types require more work since the result is embedded in the HTML document that is contained by the iframe. dojo.io.iframe.send makes the assumption that the response will contain a single HTML textarea element that holds the result. For the example, the server returned the following HTML:  Download remote-scripting remote-scripting.js  Line 1        -  -  -  5         {result: "OK"}   textarea elements are fairly easy to work with, but certain kinds of con- tent will cause problems. For example, if the JSON {"nasty": " "} were embedded in a textarea element, the browser would fail to parse the document correctly, and the transaction would fail. These problems can be avoided by using HTML character entities to encode ampersand and left-angle bracket characters.  Following this advice, the nasty example looks like  {nasty: "&lt; textarea>"} , which parses successfully. This is a server- side issue and can largely be avoided by minimizing the use of iframes for anything other than posting a ﬁle; if you need to retrieve complicated content, use dojo.xhr*.  There is one small gotcha in dojo.io.iframe. When dojo.io.iframe.send is called the ﬁrst time, it dynamically creates an iframe element and ap- pends it to the main document. When this element is created, the src attribute is set to dojo-module-path resources blank.html  remember, dojo- module-path gives the path to the dojo module . So long as you are serving Dojo from your own server, everything will work perfectly. How-   REMOTE SCRIPTING WITH IFRAME  210  ever, if you’re retrieving Dojo from another server  for example, from a CDN server  or you are executing HTTPS GET transactions through dojo.io.iframe.send after loading dojo.js with the HTTP scheme, then the transaction will fail since the src of an iframe can’t change the origin.  The djConﬁg property dojoBlankHtmlUrl can be used to specify the src attribute when the iframe is created. So, for example, if the main doc- ument resides at https:  www.someCompany.com main.htm and you are using the cross-domain version of Dojo sourced from the AOL CDN server, you must specify dojoBlankHtmlUrl like this:  Download remote-scripting remote-scripting.js  Line 1  <script  -  -  -  5  -     type="text javascript" src="http:  o.aolcdn.com dojo 1.1.0 dojo dojo.xd.js" djConfig=  "dojoBlankHtmlUrl: 'http:  www.someCompany.com dojo resources blank.html'">  If you forget to set dojoBlankHtmlUrl under these circumstances, you will get a console warning message, and dojo.io.iframe.send will fail as described earlier.  iframe Utility Functions  dojo.io.iframe includes three utility functions that are useful if you are building machinery that uses iframes. The function dojo.io.iframe.create creates a new iframe and appends it to the document. It takes the name, onload, and src attribute values  all strings  as arguments. The onload and src arguments are optional; if the src argument is miss- ing, then the value of dojo.conﬁg["dojoBlankHtmlUrl"]  dojo.moduleUrl "dojo", is used. To create the iframe element <iframe "resources blank.html"  name="myIframe" onload="loadMyIframe  ;" src="demo id11"> , write the following:  dojo.io.iframe.create "myIframe", "loadMyIframe  ;", "demo id11" ;  Once you have an iframe, you can force a new document to dynami- cally load with the function dojo.io.iframe.setSrc. This function takes an iframe name that’s been previously created and a URL and reloads the iframe. A third parameter  a boolean  instructs the function to use the DOM function location.replace, instead assigning to the location property when specifying the new URL. This results in keeping the navigation out of the browser history.   LEVERAGING REMOTE SCRIPTING TO ACCESS WEB SERVICES  211  So, to change the content of the iframe we created earlier to some other content  say "other content" , write the following:  dojo.io.iframe.setSrc "myIframe", "other content", true ;  Finally, dojo.io.iframe.doc takes a DOM node that references an iframe element and returns the document contained by that element.  8.5 Leveraging Remote Scripting to Access Web Services  The three native remote scripting techniques we’ve been discussing are fairly primitive: send a request; get a response. The formulation and semantics of both the request and the response are left to the program- mer. It is possible to build higher levels of abstraction. What’s even better is that we can use these higher abstractions to interface with several commercial web service providers  for example, Yahoo Search Services, http:  developer.yahoo.com search .  Broadly speaking, a web service is a set of information products that are accessible by executing an HTTP transaction. For example, con- coct a magical URL, and you’ll get back a JSON object that describes the result of a web search from Yahoo. While not required, many web services publish a description of the service in a computer-readable language. This presents an opportunity to build abstractions by using these service descriptions to automatically produce code that interfaces with the described services. Dojo’s remote procedure call machinery implements this idea.  Remote Procedure Calls Deﬁned  Loosely speaking, a remote procedure call  RPC  is a mechanism for one process to execute a function in another process and receive the result as if the function call were local. Although it’s true that any interprocess communication  IPC  ultimately executes a function in another process, the bit about “as if the function were local” is what differentiates RPC from generic IPC.  All RPC systems have similar design. A package is constructed by the calling process that contains the identiﬁcation of the function to call as well as the argument values to pass to that function. The package is sent to the executing process, which executes the function, creates a package that contains the result, and sends the result package back to the calling process. For example, say an HTTP server publishes the   LEVERAGING REMOTE SCRIPTING TO ACCESS WEB SERVICES  212  function add at the URL http:  calculator.com and uses JSON to package the request and results. We could calculate “1 + 2” by sending the server {proc: "add", op1: 1, op2: 2}; the server should return {"result": 3}. The full call might look like this:  Download remote-scripting remote-scripting.js  Line 1  function example21  {  function add x, y  {  var result; dojo.xhrPut {  url: "http:  calculator.com", content: {proc: "add", op1: x, op2: y}, synch: true, handle: function result_  {  result= result_;  } } ; return result;  }  var one_plus_two= add 1, 2 ;  alert "add 1, 2 = " + one_plus_two ;  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  15  20  }  The call add 1, 2  at line 16 looks just like a local function call, yet the function is actually executed on a remote server.  Most RPC systems include a description language that is used to de- scribe the functions published by the remote server. Descriptions are fed into machinery that generates proxies to the remote functions. In the previous example, the function add starting at line 3 is a proxy.  There are two popular ways to package the RPC request and response over HTTP: JSON-RPC9 and XML-RPC.10 In our view, JSON is lighter and easier to use than XML  at least in the web app arena  without losing any signiﬁcant functionality.  The service description language for JSON-RPC is the Simple Method Description  SMD  language. At the time of this writing, there is no ofﬁ- cial, approved standard for SMD. However, the Dojo developers respon- sible for Dojo’s RPC machinery  Dustin Machi and Kris Zyp  are work-  9. See http:  json-rpc.org wd JSON-RPC-1-1-WD-20060807.html. 10. See http:  www.xmlrpc.com .   LEVERAGING REMOTE SCRIPTING TO ACCESS WEB SERVICES  213  ing hard within the JSON-RPC community11 to ﬁnalize a standard. It is likely that SMD will eventually look like the example given at http:   dojotoolkit.org ~dmachi rpc V2example-3.smd.  As of version 1.1, Dojo provides some support for JSON-RPC in both Dojo and Dojox. Since neither JSON-RPC nor SMD is an approved stan- dard, this part of Dojo is likely to experience some evolution in the near future. Still, the architecture is stable, and it is unlikely that new func- tionality will break existing functionality. Most important, the current RPC system is worth knowing about since it can be used to build and deploy elegant and useful services.  Executing RPCs with dojo.rpc  Dojo’s RPC machinery takes an SMD description and produces an ob- ject that can be used to make remote procedure calls. Here’s an exam- ple SMD description for a service that publishes the functions add and subtract:  Download remote-scripting remote-scripting.js  Line 1  var arithmeticService = { serviceURL: "demo id7", methods: [{  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  15  name: "add", parameters: [{ name: "op1", type: "number"  }, {  name: "op2", type: "number"  }] }, {  name: "subtract", parameters: [{ name: "op1", type: "number"  }, {  name: "op2", type: "number"  20  }]  }]  };  Assuming the server at demo id7 accepts requests and delivers respon- ses in JSON, the function dojo.rpc.JsonService will take this description  11. http:  groups.google.com group json-rpc   LEVERAGING REMOTE SCRIPTING TO ACCESS WEB SERVICES  214  and return an object that can be used to make the function calls.12 dojo. rpc.JsonService expects a single argument that speciﬁes the SMD de- scription in one of three ways:    As a URL  a string  that delivers a JSON-comment-optional re- sponse that contains the SMD description; an HTTP GET transac- tion is used.    As an SMD description object in the form of a JSON string. The string must be provided in an object at the property smdStr so the constructor can differentiate it from a URL string.    As an SMD object  an object .  Assuming the SMD description of arithmeticService given earlier, here is an example of passing the SMD as an object:  Download remote-scripting remote-scripting.js    don't forget the keyword new! var calculator = new dojo.rpc.JsonService arithmeticService ;  We’ll term the objects created by dojo.rpc.JsonService RPC dispatchers. They include a method for each item in the methods array of the SMD description; we’ll term these RPC dispatcher methods. RPC dispatcher methods should be called with arguments described by the associ- ated params array in the SMD description and return a dojo.Deferred object that executes the remote procedure call  we’ll term this the call- controlling Deferred . You access the results by providing callback func- tions to call-controlling Deferred. For example, we could use arithmetic- Service to calculate 3 + 4 and send the result to an alert like this:  Download remote-scripting remote-scripting.js  Line 1  calculator.add 3, 4 .addCallback function result {  alert "3 + 4= " + result ;  -  -  } ;  calculator is the RPC dispatcher, add is an RPC dispatcher method, and calculator.add 3, 4  returns a call-controlling Deferred that controls the remote procedure call to add.  RPC dispatcher methods execute a dojo.xhrPost to make the remote pro- cedure call. The contents of the post is a JSON object with the proper- ties method  a string, the method name , params  an array, the argu- ments provided , and id  an integer, starting at 1 and incremented  12. Notice that JsonService is capitalized, indicating that the function is a constructor that returns new objects of the class dojo.rpc.JsonService.   LEVERAGING REMOTE SCRIPTING TO ACCESS WEB SERVICES  215  with each remote procedure call made on a particular RPC dispatcher object . The example will post the following:  Download remote-scripting remote-scripting.js  {"params":[3,4],"method":"add","id":1}  The response from the server must be a JSON object; this object is passed to the call-controlling Deferred’s errback or callback methods as follows:  Line 1    resultObject is the JSON object returned... if  resultObject.error!=null  {  call_controlling_deferred.errback parseError resultObject  ;  } else {  }  call_controlling_deferred.callback owning_rpc_dispatcher.parseResults obj  ;  If an error is indicated, then the call-controlling Deferred’s errback method is called, as shown earlier  line 3 . Otherwise, the call is as- sumed to have completed successfully, and the result object is trans- formed by the owning RPC dispatcher method parseResults and then passed to the call-controlling Deferred’s callback method  line 5 . dojo. rpc.JsonService provides the following default parseResults method:  Line 1    resultObject is the JSON object returned... function parseResults resultObject  {  if  dojo.isObject resultObject   { if  "result" in resultObject  {  return resultObject.result;  } if  "Result" in resultObject  {  return resultObject.Result;  } if  "ResultSet" in resultObject  {  return resultObject.ResultSet;  }  } return resultObject;  15  }  For our example, the server returns {"result": "7"}, which achieves the desired effect with the default implementation of parseResults. parseRe- sults can be replaced if the semantics of the server require something else. For example, assuming arithmeticService returns JSON objects like {"arithmeticServiceResult": "7"}, a customized parseResults could be used like this:  var calculator = new dojo.rpc.JsonService arithmeticService ; calculator.parseResults= function resultObject {  return resultObject.arithmeticServiceResult;  }  -  -  -  5  -  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10   LEVERAGING REMOTE SCRIPTING TO ACCESS WEB SERVICES  216  A server can indicate an error by returning an object that includes the properties error and id. The property error may be an object, string, or number. If an object, then it must contain the properties message  a string , code  no type requirements , and error  no type requirements . RPC dispatcher methods extract information out of the response object when an error is indicated as follows:  Line 1    resultObject is the JSON object returned... function parseError resultObject  {  var error; if  typeof resultObject.error == 'object'  {  error = new Error resultObject.error.message ; error.code = resultObject.error.code; error.error = resultObject.error.error;  } else {  error = new Error resultObject.error ;  } error.id = resultObject.id; error.errorObject = resultObject; return error;  }  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  Dojo also includes the function dojo.rpc.JsonpService that works with servers that return JSONP instead of JSON. dojo.rpc.JsonpService lever- ages dojo.io.script to execute the JSONP transaction. The script args call- backParamName property defaults to "callback" but can explicitly be set by specifying a value for the property callbackParamName in the RPC dispatcher returned by dojo.rpc.JsonpService. For example, assume that arithmeticService returns JSONP and expects that callback parameter name to be speciﬁed in the URL parameter "arithmeticService-callback- name". Here’s how to do it:  var calculator = new dojo.rpc.JsonpService arithmeticService ; calculator.callbackParamName = "arithmeticService-callback-name";  Now, we can use calculator very much as with the dojo.io.JsonService:  calculator.add {op1: 3, op2: 4} .addCallback function result {  Download remote-scripting remote-scripting.js  alert "3 + 4= " + result ;  } ;  Notice that the parameters must be passed in a hash with their names  "{op1: 3, op2: 4}" . Since JSONP uses the dynamic script remote script- ing technique, the parameters have to be passed in the URL, and con- sequently, they need names. The calculator.add resulted in the URL demo id7?op1=3&op2=4&dojo.preventCache=1203893657656&arithmeticSer\ vice-callback-name=dojo.io.script.jsonp_dojoIoScript1._jsonpCallback.   LEVERAGING REMOTE SCRIPTING TO ACCESS WEB SERVICES  217  Using Dojo RPC with Yahoo  Yahoo offers a number of free services that are easy to use with dojo.rpc. We’ll demonstrate how to use the web search service  http:  developer. yahoo.com search web V1 webSearch.html . To actually use this example, you’ll have to navigate to Yahoo developer services and register to get your own appid—a key that gives you access to the services  we didn’t publish our real appid in the book .  The ﬁrst thing we need is some SMD that describes the service. Lucky for us, this is already done: the ﬁle tests resources yahoo_smd_v1.smd in the dojo  directory of the source release includes a JSON object that describes many of the Yahoo services. We simply cut out the web search service used for this example. Here’s what that looks like:  Download remote-scripting rpc-demo.htm  Line 1  var smd= {  "SMDVersion":".1", "objectName":"yahoo", "serviceType":"JSON-P", "required": {  "appid": "dojotoolkit", "output": "json"  }, "methods":[        WEB SEARCH    {  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  15  20  25  30     http:  developer.yahoo.com search web V1 webSearch.html "name":"webSearch", "serviceURL": "http:  api.search.yahoo.com WebSearchService V1 webSearch", "parameters":[  { "name":"query", "type":"STRING" }, { "name":"type", "type":"STRING" }, { "name":"region", "type":"STRING" }, { "name":"results", "type":"INTEGER" }, { "name":"start", "type":"INTEGER" }, { "name":"format", "type":"STRING" }, { "name":"adult_ok", "type":"INTEGER" }, { "name":"similar_ok", "type":"INTEGER" }, { "name":"language", "type":"STRING" }, { "name":"country", "type":"STRING" }, { "name":"site", "type":"STRING" }, { "name":"subscription", "type":"STRING" }, { "name":"license", "type":"STRING" }  ]  }  ]  }   BOOKMARKING AND THE BACK BUTTON WITHOUT NAVIGATING  218  Next we need to use this SMD to create an RPC dispatcher. Since Yahoo is at a different origin than the main document, dojo.rpc.JsonpService must be used:  -  -  -  5  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  Download remote-scripting rpc-demo.htm  Line 1  dojo.require "dojo.rpc.JsonpService" ; dojo.addOnLoad function   {  var service= new dojo.rpc.JsonpService   smd, {appid: "your-appid-goes-here"} ;  } ;  Notice that the call to create the RPC dispatcher is made by a function registered to dojo.addOnLoad. This ensures that dojo.rpc.JsonpService will be loaded before any attempt is made to access objects deﬁned by dojo.rpc.JsonpService.  Finally, the service is called through the RPC dispatcher method web- Search. In the following example, the query asks for web pages that contain “mastering dojo” located on the pragprog.com site. webSearch returns a dojo.Deferred.  Download remote-scripting rpc-demo.htm  Line 1  dojo.require "dojo.rpc.JsonpService" ; dojo.addOnLoad function   {  var service= new dojo.rpc.JsonpService   smd, {appid: "your-appid-goes-here"} ;  var theResult= service.webSearch   {query:'"mastering dojo"', site:"pragprog.com"} ;  theResult.addCallback function result {  console.dir result ;  } ;  10  } ;  The example dumps the result to the debug console. In a real appli- cation, the result would be traversed, and HTML would be built that displayed the results.  8.6 Bookmarking and the Back Button Without Navigating  None of the remote scripting techniques we’ve been discussing changes the DOM window.location property. As a result, it is impossible to book- mark a remote scripting operation, and therefore the state of the web page cannot be moved backward and forward through the browser’s Back and Forward buttons. In many cases, it doesn’t matter. For exam- ple, displaying an error message shouldn’t be bookmarked. But, if you are building a web site that displays signiﬁcant static content without   BOOKMARKING AND THE BACK BUTTON WITHOUT NAVIGATING  219  Figure 8.8: Acmecorp single web page  changing the page URL, the Back Forward buttons and bookmarking are important. Dojo includes machinery to ﬁx this problem.  A Simple Single-Page Web App  Let’s build a web site that sells products to Wile E. Coyote and Tom the Cat. It has four pages: Home, Dynamite, Rockets, and Contraptions. Each of these pages has identical title banners and menus; only the content is different. In Figure 8.8, you can see the Home page.  The web site is implemented by a single HTML ﬁle that dynamically loads the content portion of the page through an XHR call when a menu item is clicked. Here’s the ﬁle:  Download remote-scripting acme-corp acme-corp0.htm  Line 1            Mastering Dojo - Remote Scripting     @import "acme-corp.css";     5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -   BOOKMARKING AND THE BACK BUTTON WITHOUT NAVIGATING  220  10  <script  type="text javascript" src=" dojoroot dojo dojo.js" djConfig="isDebug: true">   15  <script  type="text javascript" src="acme-corp0.js">           Acme Corporation   Tools for Coyotes and Cats Named Tom    Home   Dynamite   Rockets   Contraptions                        The menu is implemented by the set of anchors within divmenu. When an anchor is clicked, a handler executes a dojo.xhrGet to retrieve the content and then push it into divcontent:  Download remote-scripting acme-corp acme-corp0.js  Line 1  function loadContent fragment {  dojo.xhrGet {  url: fragment + ".htm", handleAs: "text", handle: function response {  dojo.byId "content" .innerHTML = response;  } } ;  }  15  }  20  }   function doMainMenu e {  dojo.stopEvent e ; var fragment= e.target.getAttribute "href" .split "" [1] loadContent fragment ;  dojo.addOnLoad function  {  dojo.connect dojo.byId "menu" , "click", doMainMenu ; loadContent "home" ;  20  25  30  5  10  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -   BOOKMARKING AND THE BACK BUTTON WITHOUT NAVIGATING  221  As usual, initialization is accomplished by a function that is ﬁred by dojo.addOnLoad. The anchor click events are handled by the divmenu handler; the event object target property will hold the actual anchor that was clicked. Since acme-corp.htm doesn’t actually contain any content, the Home page content is also loaded as part of initialization.  The design assumes that the content is included in the resources home. html, dynamite.html, and the rest. Here’s what dynamite.htm looks like:  Download remote-scripting acme-corp dynamite.htm   Dynamite to Blow Things Up   Try these great products that go boom!   Running the page at this stage demonstrates the problem: the URL in the navigation bar never changes even though the user can navigate to four seemingly distinct web pages. Further, the browser history is never changed, so the Back and Forward buttons don’t work, and the only page that can be bookmarked is the Home page. Clearly, these deﬁciencies are unacceptable for a commercial web site.  Navigation Single-Page Web Apps with dojo.back  The Dojo module dojo.back includes machinery to ﬁx these problems. The idea is to manually change the DOM property window.location when content changes by setting the window.location.hash property. Editing this property has the effect of changing the URL in the address bar and adding an item to the browser history but does not reload the page since only the fragment identiﬁer  that’s the part of the path URL after the  character  is changed. With the browser history ﬁlled with distinct URLs, the Back and Forward buttons will cause navigation to these URLs by changing window.location. dojo.back watches window.location and ﬁres an event when it changes. Your code can connect to this event to load content as indicated by the changed fragment identiﬁer.  Although dojo.back does all the heavy lifting, your code is responsi- ble for signaling a navigation by sending a “state” object to dojo.back. dojo.back will extract the fragment identiﬁer from the state object and use it to change window.location.hash as well as store the state object for later use when navigating with the Back Forward buttons. When dojo.back detects back forward navigation, it retrieves the state object associated with this and ﬁres functions that are included in that object to signal that a back or forward navigation was demanded. To get all of this to work, we need to build a state object class, initialize dojo.back, and pass state objects to dojo.back at each content navigation.   BOOKMARKING AND THE BACK BUTTON WITHOUT NAVIGATING  222  The state object must include the property changeUrl, which holds the fragment identiﬁer associated with a particular state. Optionally, the state object can include the functions back and or forward. dojo.back ﬁres these when Back-button or Forward-button navigation occurs. State object classes can be complex or simple depending upon what meaning your application attaches to clicking the Back and Forward buttons. For example, if an application treats the Back Forward but- tons as undo redo buttons, then the state objects will hold undo redo data. Our example uses the buttons to signal a URL change, so the state objects don’t need anything other than the required changeUrl property.  Here is the revised code that implements the state object class and then uses it to make the Back Forward buttons work properly:  Download remote-scripting acme-corp acme-corp.js  Line 1  dojo.require "dojo.back" ;  function   {  function getFragment  {  var parts= window.location.href.split "" ; if  parts.length==2  {  return parts[1];  } else {  return "home";  10  }  var State = function fragment {  this.changeUrl = fragment;  dojo.extend State, { back: function   {  loadContent this.changeUrl ;  }, forward: function  {  loadContent this.changeUrl ;  function loadContent fragment {  dojo.xhrGet {  url: fragment + ".htm", handleAs: "text", handle: function response {  dojo.byId "content" .innerHTML = response;  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  15  20  25  30  35  }  }  } } ;  } } ;  }   BOOKMARKING AND THE BACK BUTTON WITHOUT NAVIGATING  223  function doMainMenu e {  dojo.stopEvent e ; var fragment= e.target.getAttribute "href" .split "" [1] loadContent fragment ; dojo.back.addToHistory new State fragment  ;  dojo.addOnLoad function  {  dojo.connect dojo.byId "menu" , "click", doMainMenu ; var initialFragment= getFragment  ; loadContent initialFragment ; dojo.back.setInitialState new State initialFragment  ;  40  45  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  }  }   50  }   ;  dojo.back is not included in dojo.js, so it must be loaded with dojo.require  line 1 . The rest of the code is wrapped in a function literal that’s imme- diately executed to avoid polluting the global namespace  lines 2 and 50 . Our state object class is deﬁned at lines 13 through 24; dojo.extend adds functions to the prototype object of a constructor function. The Back and Forward functions simply load the content indicated by the given state.  In addition to hooking up the event handler  line 44 , the initialization function calculates the fragment identiﬁer of the page and loads the ini- tial content implied by this identiﬁer  lines 45 and 46 . This technique allows the page to be bookmarked. For example, if the page is loaded from   acme-corp.htmdynamite, then the dynamite content will be loaded. getFragment  line 4  handles calculating the fragment identiﬁer; it returns "home" if the URL doesn’t include one. dojo.back.setInitialState must be called with a state object that represents the ﬁrst page  line 47 . Notice that a call to dojo.back.addToHistory was added to doMainMenu  line 40  whenever a content navigation occurs; dojo.back.addToHistory takes a state object that represents the state of that particular history item. This causes dojo.back to edit window.location.hash as well as push a new state object on its own history stack. loadContent didn’t change from its original version.  Finally, to make Internet Explorer work correctly, dojo.back.init must be called from a script element in the body of the main page.  Download remote-scripting acme-corp acme-corp.htm     dojo.back.init  ;      BOOKMARKING AND THE BACK BUTTON WITHOUT NAVIGATING  224  Loading the page and navigating by clicking the menu items results in the proper content being loaded without a page reload just like before, but now the fragment identiﬁer of the URL changes with each click. After making a few menu selections, you can use the Back and For- ward buttons to trace backward and forward over the sequence of con- tent you selected. Each time a Back Forward button is clicked, the back forward function is called in the context of the state object asso- ciated with that particular history item. This object holds the fragment identiﬁer that is used to reload the content.  Notice that the pages can also be bookmarked. And, since the initial- ization code looks for a fragment identiﬁer, the bookmarks will load the correct content.   Chapter 9  Deﬁning Classes with dojo.declare  JavaScript doesn’t explicitly include the concept of classes, yet the core language can be used to build object systems that work similarly to those found in languages that include native support for object-oriented programming  Java, Ruby, C++, and the rest . Of course, building a class deﬁnition system is a lot of work. Fortunately, Dojo does this for you. dojo.declare, the subject of this entire chapter, deﬁnes class deﬁ- nition machinery, complete with single-inheritance, mixins, two-phase construction, and several other features.  Since JavaScript is a dynamic language, it can generate code on the ﬂy that can be consumed immediately  we ﬁrst talked about this idea in Section 5.1, Binding Context, on page 84 . Dojo leverages this capabil- ity with the function dojo.declare, which takes the deﬁnition of a class as input and produces a constructor function that creates instances of that class. This function is so powerful that it is possible to map its arguments to most of the class deﬁnition syntax found in other lan- guages, and visa versa.  9.1 Why Use Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript?  At this point, you might ask the question, why do I care about doing object-oriented programming in JavaScript? There are a couple of ways to answer this question. The ﬁrst reason for learning dojo.declare is that it is pervasive in Dojo. Every Dijit widget is deﬁned by a dojo.declare function call. If you ever want to deﬁne a new widget or specialize an existing one, understanding dojo.declare is a prerequisite. dojo.data, Dojo’s powerful session data framework, uses dojo.declare. As of ver- sion 1.1, there are nearly 400 classes deﬁned by Dojo, Dijit, and Dojox in terms of dojo.declare.   DEFINING A SIMPLE CLASS  226  The second reason for learning dojo.declare is that object-oriented pro- gramming allows you to write programs at a higher level of abstrac- tion  your code is closer to the problem  in a manner that is more robust  your code is modular, orthogonal, minimal, reusable, and all those other good things . Although it’s true you don’t need something as heavy as object-oriented programming to hang a little function off a click event, with Dojo you can write browser-based JavaScript pro- grams that do big things. For example, it is possible to move the entire view component of a Model-View-Controller to the browser. Real view components are complex; dojo.declare gives you the power to conquer this complexity with object-oriented techniques. And this isn’t theoreti- cal hand waving; in Part IV of the book, we’ll use dojo.declare extensively to build just such a view component.  dojo.declare is one of the most misunderstood, even mysterious, func- tions deﬁned by Dojo. It’s the subject of many forum questions, and its misuse abuse is the root cause of many failed attempts to mod- ify some existing class. Because of this, we’re going to use a classic teaching example to demonstrate dojo.declare exhaustively. This keeps the “what” we are building out of the way of “how” we are building it. The example may not be very exciting, but trust us, the investment in understanding this material will pay huge dividends.  9.2 Deﬁning a Simple Class  A good understanding of core JavaScript language concepts is required to use Dojo’s class deﬁnition machinery effectively. Just to make sure we are all “singing from the same sheet of music,” let’s review a few concepts.  Prototypes and Prototypal Inheritance  Every object in JavaScript includes a reference to another object termed the ﬁrst object’s prototype. Since the prototype is another object itself, it also contains a reference to its prototype. This forms a chain of objects. The chain terminates with the prototype for the built-in Object type. Although you can’t access an object’s prototype directly as if it were an ordinary property, we’ll show an object’s prototype as the property __PROTO__ when we draw diagrams.  When a property of an object is read, JavaScript looks for the prop- erty in the object. If not found, JavaScript then looks in the object’s   DEFINING A SIMPLE CLASS  227  prototype, the prototype’s prototype, and so on, up the prototype chain until the property is found or the chain is exhausted. Since a method is just a property that happens to be a function, this is how method dispatching occurs, and this system is called prototypal inheritance.  This explanation does not apply when a property is written. When a property is written to an object, it is automatically created if it does not already exist. Notice that looking up a method is a read-only operation even if executing the method found results in changing the contents of the object.  An object’s prototype reference is set when it is created, and there is no way to change this reference for the lifetime of the object. Since there are two ways to create objects in JavaScript, there are two ways to set an object’s prototype reference. First, every object created by an object literal has its prototype reference set to the prototype of the built-in type Object:1  Line 1  var o1= {}; var o2= {}; var o3= new Object  ;   o1, o2, and o3 all have the same prototype object  Second, every object created by the keyword new combined with a con- structor function has its prototype reference set to the prototype prop- erty of the constructor function:  Line 1  var p1= {}; function SomeConstructor  {} SomeConstructor.prototype= p1; SomeConstructor.prototype.constructor= SomeConstructor;  var o1= new SomeConstructor  ; var o2= new SomeConstructor  ;   o1, and o2 have the same prototype object, p1  -  -  -  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  Here’s the punch line:  type chains.    Class hierarchies are simulated in JavaScript by building proto-    Class instances are created by constructor functions that hold references to these prototype chains in their prototype properties.  1. An object literal is an object deﬁned inline by enclosing zero or more properties with curly braces. For example, in the statement var x= {name: "dojo", version: 1.1}, the curly braces and everything in between are the object literal.   DEFINING A SIMPLE CLASS  228  object  instance  property  method  class  type  And dojo.declare builds these prototype chains and constructor func- tions for us. Finally, here are a few key terms:  An instance of the JavaScript type Object  note the capital O , which is an area of memory that holds values for a set of properties.  Synonym for an object.  A named storage location contained by an object.  A property that references a function.  An abstract notion of a set of objects that contain the same prop- erties and deﬁne the same semantics for each contained property.  Synonym for a class.  object space  A set of objects that was created as a result of executing some code.  The Shape Class Hierarchy  The shape hierarchy is used so often when teaching object-oriented programming techniques that you’re probably already familiar with it. It may be a little artiﬁcial, but it eliminates many distracting debates about “is a” versus “has a” relationships, behaviors versus data, and other issues. The shape hierarchy we’ll use is given in Figure 9.1, on the next page. It has the following characteristics:    A shape has a color; that’s all we can say about a shape.   A circle is a shape that has a radius and can calculate its area.   A rectangle is a shape that has a length and a width and can  calculate its area.    A position is a point on an x-y plane and can be moved.   A positioned shape is a shape and is a position. This class is not drawn in the diagram because dojo.declare does implement multi- ple inheritance. We’ll see how to solve the problem of a positioned shape in Section 9.4, Mixins and Multiple Inheritance, on page 239.

Deﬁning a Simple Class with dojo.declare  In JavaScript-speak, “deﬁning a class” means deﬁning a constructor function that will create objects with the properties  data and methods  that the class contains. This is exactly what dojo.declare does. It takes three arguments:  className  a string   The name of the constructor function that is created; in idiomatic JavaScript, the name of a constructor function also serves as a class name.  This name is created in the global object space. Since creating variables in the global object space is usually a bad thing, you can use a dot-separated name to store the new constructor in another object space. For example, if "myNamespace.Shape" was given, then the constructor function will be created as the property Shape in the object myNamespace, and the object myNamespace will be created as a property of the global object if it didn’t already exist.  superclass  null, a function, or array of functions   Describes the superclass  optional  and additional classes that are mixed in  also optional . We’ll describe this fully in the next two sections.   DEFINING A SIMPLE CLASS  230  props  a hash   Speciﬁes  name, value  pairs to add to the prototype object for the class being deﬁned.  If a function is provided with the name constructor, then this func- tion, termed the initializer, is used to initialize new objects.  We’ll start by deﬁning the class Shape since it’s at the base of the hier- archy, doesn’t use inheritance, and is very simple:    It has the per-instance property color  a number , which is initial-  ized to black  zero .    It has the prototype property, setColor  a method , which takes a single argument color. This method updates the color property with the value given by its argument.2  Here’s how to use dojo.declare to create the class Shape with these prop- erties:  Line 1  dojo.declare     the name of the constructor function  class  created... "Shape",    this is where the superclass  if any  goes... null,    this object contains everything to add to the new class's prototype... {    default property values can go in prototype... color: 0,    here is the single prototype method... setColor: function color {  this.color= color;  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  15  }  }   ;  The three arguments are given at lines 3, 6, and 9. The props argument  line 9  is usually provided as an object literal as shown in the example. props also includes the default value for the color property  line 11  and the single method setColor  line 14 .  2. For now, the method setColor doesn’t do anything that couldn’t be done by just access- ing the property color directly. But it’s easy to imagine that setColor may include side effects  like setting an HTML element’s style  in a real application.   DEFINING A SIMPLE CLASS  231  Figure 9.2: The Shape object space  Now that Shape is deﬁned, we can use it:  Line 1    create a new Shape instance... var s= new Shape  ;    exercise it... var check1= s.color; s.setColor 0x0000FF ;   shape.color is now red var check2= s.color;    check2 is red    check1 is 0  -  -  -  -  -  5  In particular, notice that the keyword new is required to create new instances just like any other constructor function  dojo.declare does not create an object factory .  The Objects Created by dojo.declare  In Figure 9.2, you can see what dojo.declare creates for our Shape exam- ple. The diagram also includes the single instance of Shape we created with the statement var s= new Shape  . The object space constructed has many capabilities.   DEFINING A SIMPLE CLASS  232  The Shape constructor function created by dojo.declare is the func- tion object  2  in the diagram; in addition to the prototype property, it includes the following properties:    superclass: References the prototype object of the superclass, if any. Since Shape has no superclass, superclass is set to undeﬁned. We’ll talk about superclasses in the next section.    mixin: References the prototype object of the mixin class, if any. Since Shape has no mixins, mixin is set to undeﬁned. We’ll talk about mixins in Section 9.4, Mixins and Multiple Inheritance, on page 239.    extend: Advanced functionality; we’ll discuss this later.  The unnamed object  3  is referenced by the prototype property of the Shape constructor function. This is the object that will serve as the prototype for every Shape object created by the Shape constructor. It contains the following properties:    _constructor: References the initializer function  if any ; recall that the initializer is passed in props.constructor. The initializer should accomplish any per-instance initialization required for the class. You should never call this function directly  notice that it’s marked private by the leading underscore ; the constructor function man- ufactured by dojo.declare will automatically call it when a new object is created.    declaredClass: The value of the ﬁrst argument given to dojo.declare.  This can be useful for debugging.    constructor: References the Shape constructor function. This imple- ments the standard JavaScript idiom where, given a constructor function ctor, ctor.prototype.constructor references ctor.    inherited: References a function used to call superclass methods;  we’ll discuss this in a later section.    Each of the properties contained in the props hash is assigned by the JavaScript assignment operator  =  to an identically named property in the prototype. In the example, there were two prop- erties, color and setColor  a function . Owing to the deﬁnition of the assignment operator, some properties may be copied by value, while others are copied by reference.    Since Shape did not designate a superclass, the prototype of the prototype references the one and only root prototype for every object created  1 .   DEFINING A SIMPLE CLASS  233  The Elegance of JavaScript  Take another look at Figure 9.2, on page 231. We put a vertical line on the diagram to separate the objects that are instances of the class from objects that deﬁne the class. Do you see the elegance of the system as a whole? Everything is an object. The constructor function is an object. The prototype inheritance chain is made of objects. This is the reason JavaScript doesn’t need the extensive “class-deﬁnition” syntax that is present in so many “object-oriented” languages. Yet, JavaScript can be used to describe class systems with all of the power of these other languages. In a way, JavaScript gives you a free lunch— the ability to deﬁne class systems without the need for a special syntax to do it. Now that’s elegant!  Finally, we created one Shape instance referenced by the variable s  5 .  Standard Use Patterns  dojo.declare follows standard JavaScript idioms when it creates con- structor functions. One implication is that the JavaScript instanceof operator works as expected. For example:  var s= new Shape  ; var check1= s instanceof Shape;   check1 is true var check2= s instanceof Object;   check2 is true  Sometimes you need to know the exact type of an object. In this case, you can’t use the JavaScript instanceof operator because it will tell you only whether the target type is somewhere in the prototype chain. Instead, you need to know the constructor function that created the object—this reveals the exact type of the object. As mentioned earlier, dojo.declare includes a reference to the constructor function in the con- structor property of the prototype object. For example, you can get to the constructor of s by writing this:  s.constructor  According to the semantics of JavaScript, access to the constructor function for an object implies access to the prototype of that object. The prototype of s is given by the following:  s.constructor.prototype   9.3 Deﬁning a Subclass with Single Inheritance  DEFINING A SUBCLASS WITH SINGLE INHERITANCE  234  In the shape hierarchy, circles and rectangles are also shapes. This is to say that circles and rectangles have all the properties that shapes have, plus a few others to make them behave as circles and rectangles. If we were to deﬁne circles and rectangles in isolation, we would lose an important piece of information: any operation valid on shapes is also valid on circles and rectangles. To capture this information, we don’t deﬁne circles and rectangles in isolation but rather deﬁne them as reﬁnements of shape. In object-oriented parlance, we say that Circle and Rectangle are derived from Shape and inherit from Shape, that Shape is the superclass to Circle and Rectangle, and that Circle and Rectangle are subclasses of Shape.  In the previous section we created a class that had no user-deﬁned ancestors.  We say “user-deﬁned” because all objects in JavaScript ulti- mately inherit from Object; this is built in to the language and can’t be changed.  Now let’s turn our attention to deﬁning the subclasses Cir- cle and Rectangle. Recall from Section 9.2, The Shape Class Hierarchy, on page 228 that Circle has the per-instance property radius, Rectangle has the per-instance properties length and width, and both Circle and Rectangle have the prototype property area  a method .  To derive from a superclass, you need to specify the superclass as an argument to dojo.declare. Prototype properties and the optional initial- izer for the new subclass are speciﬁed in the props hash as usual. dojo.declare sets up the object space for you and creates a construc- tor that ensures the superclass constructor chain is called properly when creating new objects. Assuming Shape is already deﬁned, here’s the code to deﬁne the Circle and Rectangle classes:  Line 1  dojo.declare   "Circle",   classname...  Shape,   superclass: Circle inherits from Shape...    props hash... {    default value for radius... radius: 0,  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  15    the property named "constructor" is used to initialize new instances... constructor: function radius  {  this.radius= radius  this.radius;  },   DEFINING A SUBCLASS WITH SINGLE INHERITANCE  235  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  20  30  35  50  60    these go in the prototype for Circle... setRadius: function radius  {  this.radius= radius;  },  area: function   {  return Math.PI * this.radius * this.radius;  }  }  25   ;  dojo.declare   "Rectangle",   classname... Shape,   superclass: Rectangle inherits from Shape...    these go in the prototype for Rectangle... setLength: function l  {    props hash... {    default values for l, w... length: 0, width: 0,  constructor: function l, w  {  this.length= l  this.length; this.width= w  this.width;  40  },  this.length= l;  45  },  setWidth: function w  {  this.width= w;  },  area: function   {  return this.length * this.width;  }  }  55   ;    create a Circle and exercise it... var c= new Circle 5 ; var test= c.area  ;    Circles are also shapes... c.setColor 0x0000FF ;  From the previous code, we can see that in order to inherit a superclass, we simply state the superclass’s constructor as the second argument to dojo.declare.   DEFINING A SUBCLASS WITH SINGLE INHERITANCE  236  Line 1    creating a new circle... var c= new Circle 5 ;  -  -  -  5  -  This has two effects:    dojo.declare will set up the new class’s prototype object to refer-  ence the superclass’s prototype object.    The constructor function that dojo.declare manufactures will call the superclass’s constructor before calling the subclass’s initial- izer function.  This last point is worth repeating in code. The following gets executed when a new Circle object is created:    ...results in the Circle constructor executing the following... Shape.apply this, arguments ; Circle._constructor.apply this, arguments ;  This ensures proper per-instance initialization all the way up the inher- itance hierarchy. The previous example also demonstrates that initial- izer functions can take arguments. We’ll have an extended discussion about initializer function arguments in Section 9.5, Preprocessing Con- structor Arguments, on page 248.  The Circle Object Space  In Figure 9.3, on the following page, you can see the object space for Circle. If we had drawn it, Rectangle would be similar. Although not drawn, Circle and Rectangle constructors reference the same Shape con- structor; similarly, the Circle and Rectangle prototype objects reference the same Shape prototype object. This works since there are no ref- erences pointing down and out of the Shape part of the object space into classes derived from Shape. Otherwise, Circle, and its associated prototype property, looks and works just like Shape and its associated prototype property.  Calling Superclass Methods  Frequently a subclass will override a function deﬁned by a superclass, and further, the overridden function will call the superclass’s version of that function. dojo.declare automatically includes the function inherited in every prototype object. When this.inherited is called from any subclass method, it invokes the same method in the superclass.  To make this idea crystal clear, let’s have Circle override Shape’s set- Color method as follows: if the sum of the red-green-blue components   DEFINING A SUBCLASS WITH SINGLE INHERITANCE  237  Figure 9.3: The Circle object space   DEFINING A SUBCLASS WITH SINGLE INHERITANCE  238  is greater than 350, accept the change; otherwise, ignore the change. Here is how such an override could be done:  Line 1  dojo.declare   "Circle", Shape, {    default value for radius... radius: 0,    the property named "constructor" is used to initialize new instances... constructor: function radius  {  this.radius= radius  this.radius;  5  10  20  25  30  35  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  },  },  }  }  }   ;  setRadius: function radius  {  this.radius= radius;  15  },  area: function   {  return Math.PI * this.radius * this.radius;  setColor: function  color  {  var total=    color & 0xFF0000  >> 16  +   color & 0x00FF00  >> 8  +  color & 0x00FF ;  if  total>350  {  this.inherited arguments ;    exercise the new functionality... var c= new Circle  ; c.setColor 0x010203 ;   should result in no-op var test1= c.color; c.setColor 0x808080 ;   should set the color var test2= c.color;    test2 is 0x808080    yup, test1 is 0  This example is admittedly artiﬁcial, but it does illustrate the ability to get to a speciﬁc function in the inheritance hierarchy. Eventually, you’ll probably have to reach into the hierarchy. Now you know how to do it.  Manually Adding Superclass Methods  In rare circumstances, you come across the need to add or change a method in a class deﬁned by dojo.declare, but you don’t want to   MIXINS AND MULTIPLE INHERITANCE  239  -  -  -  5  -  -  -  5  } } ;  } } ;  derive a subclass or change the current class deﬁnition  maybe such an action would break other code somehow . This is easily accomplished by adding changing a property in the class prototype. For example, we could add the property setBorderStyle to Shape by writing the following:  Shape.prototype.setBorderStyle= function style  {  this.borderStyle= style;  };  Dojo even includes the helper function dojo.extend that takes a con- structor function and a hash of properties and copies the contents of the hash into the constructor’s prototype property. setBorderStyle could be added to Shape with dojo.extend like this:  Line 1  dojo.extend Shape, {  setBorderStyle: function style  {  this.borderStyle= style;  There is one gotcha here: adding methods to prototypes of classes deﬁned with dojo.declare breaks the inherited method we just discussed. To ﬁx this problem, each constructor function returned by dojo.declare includes the method extend that takes a hash of properties to copy to the class’s prototype. Here’s the correct way to add setBorderStyle to Shape:  Line 1  Shape.extend {  setBorderStyle: function style  {  this.borderStyle= style;  To add properties to the prototype property of any constructor function deﬁned with dojo.declare, always use the dojo.declare-provided extend. For constructor functions not deﬁned by dojo.declare, you should use dojo.extend to add properties to the prototype.  9.4 Mixins and Multiple Inheritance  So far, we’ve explored deriving one class from another single class. Naturally, this technique is called single inheritance. Single inheritance says “subclass is a superclass” but with some more specialized func- tionality added. For example, Circle “is a” Shape, but with a radius and the ability to calculate its area. But how do you model a situation where a new subclass is more than one thing?   MIXINS AND MULTIPLE INHERITANCE  240  Figure 9.4: The PositionedCircle prototype chain  In our little Shape hierarchy depicted Figure 9.1, how should we model the notion of a Shape positioned in an HTML document? Surely it’s reasonable that a positioned object “is-a” position.3  Since the abstract idea of a shape is independent of a position, it would be wrong to derive Shape from Position, or visa versa. What we’d like to do is include both Shape and Position as superclasses of Circle and Rectan- gle. This is to say that Circle would inherit both Shape and Position. Nat- urally, this technique is called multiple inheritance. Unfortunately, it’s not supported by the prototypal inheritance model that JavaScript pro- vides. Although there is nothing that Dojo can do to ﬁx this, dojo.declare does include the ability to deﬁne classes with most of the effects of mul- tiple inheritance.  3. For some of the object-oriented lawyers out there, we hear you objecting that a posi- tioned object “has-a” position; it “is-NOT-a” position. We’ll take your objection under consideration, but note that we might like to move shapes, which implies that modeling them as positions is reasonable. In any event, this argument is not germane to teaching how Dojo implements mixins.   MIXINS AND MULTIPLE INHERITANCE  241  The idea is simple. If you have a class  the mixin class  with function- ality that you’d like to include in a new class but have already spent your one inheritance ticket, then just push another empty object onto the prototype chain and “mix in”  copy  all of the properties from the mixin class. In Figure 9.4, on the previous page, you can see how this idea works when creating a PositionedCircle—a Circle that has all the functionality of a Position. An extra prototype object is pushed on top of PositionedCircle’s prototype chain, and this object holds references to all the properties in Position. It’s important to notice that this extra object fully enumerates Position’s prototype object, which means it will hold all properties that exist anywhere in Position’s prototype chain. The rest of PositionedCircle’s prototype chain looks just like Circle’s prototype chain: Circle’s prototype references Shape’s prototype, which references Object’s prototype. You can view this as a sort of deep aggregation. Rather than aggregating an instance of another class as a property, you aggregate the deﬁnition  that is, the contents of the prototype chain  of another class.  Deriving Classes with Mixins  With the theory out of the way, let’s use dojo.declare to deﬁne the class PositionedCircle. First we need to deﬁne the class Position, which models a point on an x-y plane that can be moved:  Line 1  dojo.declare  "Position", null, {  x: 0, y: 0,  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  15  20  constructor: function x, y {  this.x= x  this.x; this.y= y  this.y;  setPosition: function  x, y  {  },  },  this.x= x; this.y= y;  move: function  deltaX, deltaY  {  this.x+= deltaX; this.y+= deltaY;  }  }   ;   MIXINS AND MULTIPLE INHERITANCE  242  Alex Says. . .  Class Design in JavaScript  If you’re coming from a community with lots of rules imposed either by the language or by convention, you may be surprised by some of the idioms you’ll see in JavaScript. For example, in JavaScript, it’s convenient to include default values for vari- ous properties in the prototype object. This technique has three nice side effects. First, it eliminates a set of assignment state- ments in the initializer that would be executed each time a new object is created. This is incredibly important in keeping code terse, which is a primary goal of JavaScript development because of the nature of how scripts are sent to browsers. Sec- ond, it allows a default value to be easily changed at runtime; you would have to create a subclass to change default values set in the initializer. Third, it encapsulates the properties a par- ticular class deﬁnes in an object  the prototype  rather than in lines of code  the initializer , which would need to be executed for every object initialization.  You’ll also notice that positional constructor arguments were used in the examples presented in this chapter; this was inten- tional to highlight various initialization issues that come with sub- classing. However, it’s often better to deﬁne initializers that take a single hash argument that’s used to initialize new objects. Dojo uses this convention heavily and extends it with a second optional positional argument, which may be a reference to a DOM node that the constructed instance should act on. Using a terse convention like this makes it easy to understand how to construct a broad variety of object types without having to know the speciﬁcs of each class’s constructor. Remembering the order of many positional arguments can also be painful  although code-completing editors help a lot . Also, if vari- ous combinations of arguments are optional, then you’ll either have to specify null for the optional arguments or build some really tricky logic in the initializer to ﬁgure out what the client intended  and “really tricky” usually translates to buggy fol- lowed by impossible . Finally, there’s the problem of argument juggling when subclassing, as discussed in this chapter. Having your classes follow the “property object plus optional node” convention makes it simple to integrate with others, makes it easy to subclass, and leans on a convention that all Dojo devel- opers already know.   MIXINS AND MULTIPLE INHERITANCE  243  There is nothing new here. Position is a simple base class that doesn’t inherit from any other user-deﬁned class.  Now, we’ll use dojo.declare, Position, and Circle to create the new con- structor function PositionedCircle that creates objects that have all of the power of both Circles and Positions. Here is the code:  Line 1  dojo.declare   "PositionedCircle",    inherits from Circle and mixes in Position [Circle, Position],  constructor: function radius, x, y {  this.setPosition x, y ;  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  {  }   ;  10  }  Notice that the superclass argument to dojo.declare is an array. When an array is given, the ﬁrst element in the array is interpreted as the super- class, and any subsequent elements are interpreted as mixin classes. In Figure 9.5, on the following page, you can see the object space that is built  it includes the Position constructor and prototype but does not include the Circle and Shape constructors and prototypes .  As a consequence of copying properties from the mixin Position, the pro- totype chain of PositionedCircle contains the properties setPosition and move  9 . These properties reference the same function objects as the setPosition and move properties in Position’s prototype object.  Note that when dojo.declare copies a property from the mixin class, a regular JavaScript assignment expression is used, which results in copying references unless the property held is a boolean, integer, string, or null value, in which case the property is copied by value. This isn’t a problem since the prototype chain should contain read-only properties; it’s probably a design mistake to include updateable data in prototype objects.4  Per-instance Initialization  The constructor functions manufactured by dojo.declare call all the mixin constructors just like they call the superclass constructor chain,  4. Per-class updateable data should be made a property of the constructor function.   MIXINS AND MULTIPLE INHERITANCE  244  Figure 9.5: The PositionedCircle object space   MIXINS AND MULTIPLE INHERITANCE  245  as we discussed earlier. In code, the following gets executed when a new PositionedCircle object is created:  Line 1    creating a new PositionedCircle... var pc = new PositionedCircle 5, 1, 2 ;    ...results in the function PositionedCircle executing the following... Circle.apply this, arguments ;   ...which results in... Shape.apply this, arguments ;    ...then the mixin constructor is executed... Position.apply this, arguments ;  10    ...finally the init function is executed... PositionedCircle._constructor.apply this, arguments ;  This code reveals the algorithm used for the constructors that dojo. declare makes:  1. Call the superclass constructor function  line 5 . This step is exe- cuted  line 7  all the way up the inheritance chain to the root class. 2. Call all mixin constructor functions  line 10 , in the order they are  given in the superclass array.  3. Call the initializer function  line 13 .  Let’s step back for a minute and see whether we’ve accomplished our mission of making a class that behaves as both a Circle and a Position. If we exercise an instance of PositionedCircle, all of the Position methods work just as if the object were a Position and all of the Circle methods as if the object were a Circle:  Line 1  var pc= new PositionedCircle 5, 1, 2 ;    try the Shape functionality... var color1= pc.color; pc.setColor 0x0000FF ; var color2= pc.color;    color1 is black    color2 is now red    try the Circle functionality... var radius1= pc.radius;   radius1 is 5 var area1= pc.area  ; pc.setRadius 10 ; var radius2= pc.radius;   radius2 is 10 var area2= pc.area  ;    area1 is 78.54    area2 is 314.16    try the Position functionality... var position1= [pc.x, pc.y];   position1 is [1, 2]; pc.move 3, 5 ; var position2= [pc.x, pc.y];   position2 is [4, 7];  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  15   MIXINS AND MULTIPLE INHERITANCE  246  Alex Says. . .  Caveats for Object-Oriented Experts  Notice that the prototype chain  depicted in Figure 9.4, on page 240  puts the mixin under the new subclass being deﬁned. So, for example, if one of Position’s methods calls this.inherited arguments , properties deﬁned in PositionedCircle’s prototype are never considered. This is contrary to one view of the role of a mixin that says a mixin is an incomplete class that is put on top of some other class that contains methods required to complete the mixin class. A classic example is the idea of an enumerator with methods such as ﬁnd, map, and sort that are plopped on top of various container classes like vector, list, and tree. The enumerator implements certain algorithms  for exam- ple, map , assuming certain other functions are provided by the hosting class  for example, ﬁrst, next, end . Depending on the algorithm, the mixin class may call this.inherited arguments , and the design given would fail. [BC90] provides a detailed dis- cussion on the theory of mixins.  Also notice that the mixin properties hide any properties of the same name lower in the prototype chain. We’ll discuss this in detail in a later section. But, clearly, dojo.declare does not imple- ment a model that is equivalent to multiple inheritance, and we are not making this claim.  The reason Dojo is not working too hard to expose a more clas- sical OO model inside JavaScript is that it would be both brit- tle and slow. dojo.declare is designed so that you can com- pose classes not deﬁned by dojo.declare with those that are, and systems that try to do more rigorous, class-based OO often ﬁnd that it’s harder to mix and match code developed inside the assumptions their system with code developed elsewhere. dojo.declare isn’t perfect, but it helps you “play well with oth- ers” and is a prime example of where Dojo’s strong emphasis on going as far as the language will let you—and no further— pays off in both speed and stability. By respecting the principle of least astonishment, we give good JavaScript hackers a nat- ural path to writing classes more tersely and give novice users an abstraction that’s good-enough to let them be productive quickly and discover the power of the language progressively.   MIXINS AND MULTIPLE INHERITANCE  247  So, on this level, we can say that we’ve succeeded. Still, there is one material difference.  Type Testing with Mixins  To see one difference between the mixin pattern and true multiple inheritance, notice that a class that is deﬁned by mixing in another class has all the capabilities of the mixed-in class but is not an instance of the mixed-in class. Contrast this to deriving a subclass from a super- class: the subclass is an instance of the superclass. Most of the time this distinction doesn’t matter. As long as an object provides the behav- ior of some class, then we can use it as if it were an instance of that class. Of course, this is the concept of “duck typing”  that is, if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it’s a duck . Still, this is a key difference between using mixins and multiple inheritance.  And, this difference has a practical implication. Looking at Figure 9.5, on page 244, notice that our new class, PositionedCircle, has the pro- totype object chain given by the objects  6 –> 4 –> 7 –>Shape.prototype– >Object.prototype. Position is not in the chain. Consequently, an instance of PositionedCircle is an instance of PositionedCircle, Circle, Shape, and Object but is not as instance of Position. Here are the consequences in code; notice that line 8 shows pc is not a position:  Line 1  var pc= new PositionedCircle 5, 1, 2 ;  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  var test; test= pc instanceof PositionedCircle;   test is true   test is true test= pc instanceof Circle;   test is true test= pc instanceof Shape;   test is true test= pc instanceof Object; test= pc instanceof Position;   test is false!  When testing whether an object is a class that may be included as a mixin, you can’t use the JavaScript instanceof operator. Instead, you must test the object for the existence of a set of properties that indicate the type you are looking for  that is, a property signature .5  That’s it for mixins basics.  5. You may have noticed that dojo.declare ﬁlls the declaredClass property of the synthetic prototype objects used to hold mixin properties with a synthetic name. Although you could inspect this name to determine what’s been mixed in, the algorithm used to create the synthetic name may change. Indeed, it is possible that the synthetic name may be removed from future versions of dojo.declare.   PREPROCESSING CONSTRUCTOR ARGUMENTS  248  This leaves us with three details to discuss regarding inheritance and mixins:    How to handle constructor argument signatures that are different  between the subclass, the superclass, and any mixins    How to handle property name clashes when deriving and mixing   How to implement two-phase construction  Let’s turn our attention to the ﬁrst issue, sorting out constructor argu- ment signatures when we use derivation and or mixins.  9.5 Preprocessing Constructor Arguments  Consider the problem of creating and initializing a new PositionedCir- cle object. Shapes don’t take any constructor arguments, Circles take a radius argument, and Positions take x and y arguments. Clearly, we have three constructor signatures:   ,  radius , and  x, y . On the other hand, the constructor of PositionedCircle should deﬁne the signature  radius, x, y . Then, we can create and initialize a new PositionedCircle object by writing the following:    radius=5, x=1, y=2 var pc= new PositionedCircle 5, 1, 2 ;  The constructor function that dojo.declare creates must somehow deal out any arguments to the superclass and the mixins. By default, argu- ments passed to the constructor are just blindly passed ﬁrst to the superclass’s constructor, then to each mixin’s constructor, and ﬁnally to the subclass’s initializer. In code, this looks like this following:  Line 1    writing... var pc = new PositionedCircle 5, 1, 2 ;    results in the following being executed... Circle.apply this, [5, 1, 2] ;   call Circle's superclass... Shape.apply this, [5, 1, 2] ;   call PositionedCircle's mixin... Position.apply this, [5, 1, 2] ;  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  }    call PositionedCircle's initializer--if there is one... if  PositionedCircle.prototype._constructor  {  PositionedCircle.prototype._constructor.apply this, [5, 1, 2] ;   PREPROCESSING CONSTRUCTOR ARGUMENTS  249  Circle will be initialized correctly because it expects a single argument— the radius. Since the radius is the ﬁrst argument in the PositionedCircle constructor signature, Circle will use the argument correctly and ignore the last two arguments.  Similarly, Shape will just ignore all of the arguments. Unfortunately, Position fails to initialize properly. It expects two arguments,  x, y , but gets three arguments,  radius, x, y . So, it will interpret radius as x and x as y and will ignore the last argument.  If you look at our deﬁnition of PositionedCircle, you’ll see that we pro- vided an initializer that explicitly initializes the Position mixin. Here is the initializer again:  function radius, x, y {  setPosition x, y ;  }  The initializer we provided correctly accepts three arguments: radius, x, and y. Consequently, it reinitializes the Position instance variables with the correct values of x and y. But, before setPosition is called in this initializer, the Position instance properties x and y will be initialized with the values intended for radius and x  recall the constructors of the superclass and all mixins are called before the initializer .  Using this technique to ﬁx up all the initialization mistakes, although a bit sloppy, will work in many cases. But sometimes this is not good enough since some initializers will cause bad side effects  for exam- ple, throw an exception  if they are passed improper arguments. We will use PositionedCircle to illustrate how we can massage constructor arguments.  Having Your Way with Constructor Arguments  dojo.declare accepts a preprocessor that reformats constructor argu- ments before passing them on to the superclass and mixin s  class constructors. The preprocessor is speciﬁed by providing a function for the property preamble in the props hash argument of dojo.declare. If speciﬁed, the function is passed the set of arguments provided to the subclass constructor  that is, the constructor created by dojo.declare  and returns an array of arguments that are passed to the superclass and mixin s  constructors.   PREPROCESSING CONSTRUCTOR ARGUMENTS  250  So, let’s assume that a preamble was provided to PositionedCircle; then, when a new PositionedCircle is created, the PositionedCircle constructor calls the superclass and mixin constructors by executing the following:  Line 1    writing... var o = new PositionedCircle radius, x, y ;  -  -  -  -  -  5    results in calling the superclass and mixin constructors like this... var superArgs = PositionedCircle.prototype.preamble.apply this, [radius, x, y] ; PositionedCircle.prototype.superclass.apply this, superArgs ; PositionedCircle.prototype.mixin.apply this, superArgs ;  Notice that the preamble takes a set of arguments and returns an array. Although there is no restriction on what processing is accomplished by a preamble, typically a preamble is used to reformat arguments from a format expected by the subclass to a format expected by the superclass and any mixins. And this algorithm works all the way up the single- inheritance chain. For example, another preamble could be speciﬁed for Circle, which would ﬁx up arguments for the Shape constructor.  Preambles solve argument-reformatting problems when there is no mix- in or when both the superclass and all mixins expect the same argu- ments. Unfortunately, the design fails when there is both a superclass and one or more mixins that expect different argument signatures. The PositionedCircle class is an example of such a failure since Circle  the superclass  and Position  a mixin  take different argument signatures.  To solve the problem, you need to create a class, sometimes termed a shim class, that derives from the mixin class and provides a preamble that picks and orders constructor arguments. Here is the shim class we need with Position:  Line 1  dojo.declare "PositionedCircleShim", Position,  preamble: function radius, x, y {  return [x  null, y  null];  -  -  -  -  -  5  {  }  }   ;  Note carefully that preamble is provided with the arguments that were passed to the owning constructor and returns an array; this is a little obtuse the ﬁrst time you write a preamble.  PositionedCircleShim works just like Position except that it initializes its superclass Position correctly when it is provided the signature  radius, x,   PREPROCESSING CONSTRUCTOR ARGUMENTS  251  -  -  -  5  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  y —which is precisely the signature that PositionedCircle is going to give it. With this in place, we can deﬁne PositionedCircle to mix in Positioned- CircleShim  no preamble is given for PositionedCircle :  Line 1  dojo.declare   "PositionedCircle", [Circle, PositionedCircleShim], {}   ;  Notice that the new PositionedCircle does not need an initializer func- tion since Position will be initialized correctly now. Here is what actually happens when a new PositionedCircle object is created:  Line 1    creating a new PositionedCircle... var pc = new PositionedCircle 5, 1, 2 ;   ...results in the function PositionedCircle executing the following...    call the single inheritance chain...   the superclass of PositionedCircle... Circle.apply this, [5, 1, 2] ;    which calls Shape, the superclass of Circle... Shape.apply this, [5, 1, 2] ;    call the mixin class... PositionedCircleShim.apply this, [5, 1, 2] ;    ...which results in executing... Position.apply this,  15  PositionedCircleShim.prototype.preamble.apply this, [5, 1, 2]  ;    ...which reduces to Position.apply this, [1, 2] ;    lastly, call PositionedCircle's initializer--if there is one... if  PositionedCircle.prototype._constructor  {  20  PositionedCircle.prototype._constructor.apply this, [5, 1, 2] ;  }  Circle is still passed three arguments even though it uses only one. However, since the ﬁrst argument passed is correct, there is no need to shim Circle.  Using Hashes to Specify Arguments  Often the problem of constructor argument signature incompatibilities can be eliminated by using a single hash as a constructor argument to pass initialization values.6  6. Of course, hashes can have name clashes just as positional arguments have position clashes, but these are less likely.   RESOLVING PROPER TY NAME CLASHES  252  -  -  -  5  -  -  -  Line 1  var shape = new PositionedCircle {  For example:  x: 1, y: 2, radius: 5  } ;  This is a popular JavaScript idiom. If each class uses this idiom, then initializers can simply pick out the properties they need.  Often initialization does not require any speciﬁc processing other than copying the values out of the hash into the new instance object. In these cases, dojo.mixin can be used to quickly accomplish this task. For example, Shape’s initializer could be written as follows:  Line 1  constructor: function args {    args is a hash of initial property values dojo.mixin this, args ;  }  Notice how this initializer correctly initializes Circle and Position when a new PositionedCircle is given the hash {x: 1, y: 2, radius: 5} as previously! In case there are some classes  either superclasses or mixins  lower in the hierarchy that rely on positional arguments, preambles can be used, as we discussed earlier, to pick the appropriate argument signature out of the hash.  Generally speaking, if a constructor takes more than three or four argu- ments, then it’s probably a good candidate to use the single-argument hash technique. This technique is also less susceptible to typing the parameters in the wrong order when expressing code.7  9.6 Resolving Property Name Clashes  There’s another potential problem when we use dojo.declare to create a new class that’s derived from a superclass and mixes in a mixin class. Since the mixin’s prototype properties are mixed into a new class’s pro- totype chain above the superclass, a mixin’s property will be found before a superclass’s property if the properties have the same name. This is almost certainly what you don’t want. The new class is derived from the superclass, so instances of the new class are also instances of the superclass; they are not instances of the mixin.  7. Of course, you can still express hashes that include properties with misspelled names quite easily.   RESOLVING PROPER TY NAME CLASHES  253  Alex Says. . .  Make the 80% Case Easy  The main argument against deﬁning initializers that take single- argument hashes is parsimony. If you have a class that has a very common construction pattern that requires only a few val- ues, then specifying this...  var x= new MyClass {  thisProperty: 1, thatProperty:2, theOtherProperty:3  } ;  is a royal pain. But there’s an easy solution—deﬁne a quick helper:  function makeMyClass thisProperty, thatProperty, theOtherProperty {  return new MyClass {  thisProperty: thisProperty, thatProperty: thatProperty, theOtherProperty: theOtherProperty  } ;  }  Now you can write var x= makeMyClass 1, 2, 3 . Ahhh, that’s bet- ter. And, you’ll never forget to type new! By the way, this is exactly what Dojo does all the time. For an example, compare dojo.animateProperty to dojo.anim.  Now you can write var x = makeMyClass 1, 2, 3 . With the wrapper function, you can also avoid typing new. Inside of Dojo, we use this wrapper style all the time to ﬁrst expose powerful APIs and then provide easy-to-use versions for the 80% case.   RESOLVING PROPER TY NAME CLASHES  254  Yet accessing the property resolves to the mixin property. The object behaves like something it’s not. Let’s drive this point home with our PositionedCircle example.  If you examine the set method names of the Shape, Circle, and Posi- tion classes, you see setColor, setRadius, and setPosition, respectively. But, in Shapes, the only thing to set is a color; likewise, Circles set only radii, and Positions set only—you guessed it—positions. So, why the long method names? Let’s rename all these methods to set. With this mod- iﬁcation, which is very possible if you didn’t have control of the whole hierarchy, the set method for PositionedCircles calls Position.set, and it’s difﬁcult to get to the other set methods. Here’s code that illustrates the problem:    assume that Shape, Circle, and Position all define   "set" rather than "set ColorRadiusPosition "... var pc = new PositionedCircle  ;   radius=0, x=0, y=0 pc.set 5 ;   oops! calls Position.Set instead of Circle.Set... var test; test = pc.radius;   radius is still 0, but... test = pc.x;   x was set to 5   it can be done...painfully... Circle.prototype.set.apply pc, [5] ;   but at least it worked; test is 5 test = pc.radius;  First we need to stop the mixin from stepping on our superclass’s method. The idea here is to rename the mixin’s property to something that doesn’t clash. How about setPosition? This can be done immediately after the class deﬁnition like this:  Line 1  dojo.declare   "PositionedCircle", [Circle, PositionedCircleShim], {}   ; PositionedCircle.extend {  setPosition: Position.prototype.set  } ; delete PositionedCircle.superclass.set;  Since we deleted set from PositionedCircle’s superclass prototype  the synthetic prototype object that holds all of Position’s prototype proper- ties , a call to set on a PositionedCircle object will ﬁnd Circle.set. So, let’s try it:  var pc= new PositionedCircle 5, 1, 2 ;   radius=5, x=1, y=2 pc.setPosition 3, 4 ;   call Position.Set... pc.set 6 ;   call Circle.Set...  Line 1  10  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -   TWO-PHASE CONSTRUCTION  255  This is looking a lot better. There is a gotcha here: renaming has the undesirable side effect of breaking the built-in inherited function: call- ing this.inherited arguments  will not work from a function that has been renamed. In practice, this problem rarely occurs. Nevertheless, it is a limitation of the current dojo.declare implementation.  Next let’s turn our attention to disambiguating Shape.set and Circle.set. This is simply a design error. When Circle was deﬁned, it deﬁned the method set that was also deﬁned in the superclass Shape, but Circle. prototype.set was not an override to Shape.prototype.set. Indeed, Circle. prototype.set has completely different semantics to Shape.prototype.set; therefore, it should be a different name. The original design was more correct; we made the original change only as a teaching example.  So far, the discussion has been limited to properties that end up in the prototype object. It is also possible for per-instance property names to clash. Resolving this problem requires a great deal of care since renam- ing these properties has broad implications: prototype methods that manipulate per-instance properties do not know about name changes that the subclass may make. Frankly, these types of clashes need to be avoided to begin with by employing good coding techniques that have nothing to do with dojo.declare.  9.7 Two-Phase Construction  Occasionally, you’ll want to deﬁne a superclass that accomplishes some processing in its initializer that requires the instance to be fully ini- tialized. This causes a problem when a subclass is derived from the superclass because the superclass’s initializer is executed before the subclass’s; therefore, the processing that required the object to be fully initialized is executed before the subclasses initializer runs. Since this is a bit obtuse in words, let’s look at an example.  Say the class Base includes the statement doSomething this  in its initial- izer, and further assume that doSomething requires that the instance referenced by this must be fully initialized. The Base initializer might look something like this:  Line 1  dojo.declare "Base", null, {  constructor: function   {    initialize the instance as required...    now that the instance is initialized, call doSomething this ;  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  } } ;   TWO-PHASE CONSTRUCTION  256  This works ﬁne. But next, the class Subclass is derived from Base. Since Subclass’s constructor calls Base’s initializer before Subclass’s initializer, the Subclass instance passed to doSomething will not be fully initialized. This design requires a constructor algorithm that ﬁrst initializes the object all the way up the inheritance chain and then does one more thing  so-called two-phase construction .  Two-phase construction is speciﬁed by providing a function for the property postscript in the props hash argument of dojo.declare. After a new object has been fully initialized  the superclass and mixin con- structors and the subclass initializer have been called , the method postscript is called in the context of the new instance and is passed the arguments provided at construction. Unlike preambles that are called all the way up the inheritance chain, postscript, if provided, is called only from the most-derived class’s constructor. Of course, if a postscript is provided in a superclass and not overridden in a subclass, the super- class postscript will be called. Similarly, a superclass’s postscript method can be called from a subclass’s overridden postscript method by writing this.inherited arguments  as inside the overridden method.  Let’s work through a quick example. We’ll build a toy hierarchy that requires two-phase construction, demonstrate the problem, and then ﬁx it by deﬁning a postscript. Every initializer in the hierarchy pushes the arguments it receives into the instance variable args. The second phase of construction formats args into a JSON string and dumps the string to the console. Here is a base class that ﬁts the bill and works as far as it goes:  Line 1  dojo.declare "Base", null, {  constructor: function   {  this.args = {base_args: dojo._toArray arguments }; console.log dojo.toJson this.args, true  ;  } } ; var x= new Base 1, 2, 3 ;  Next, we’ll derive a subclass from Base. We’ll include a preamble to pass only the ﬁrst three arguments to Base:  Line 1  dojo.declare "Subclass", Base, {  constructor: function   {  this.args.subclass_args= dojo._toArray arguments ;  }, preamble: function args  {    the superclass  Base  only gets the first three arguments... return dojo._toArray arguments .slice 0, 3 ;  -  -  -  -  -  5  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  } } ;   CREATING CUSTOM OBJECTS WITHOUT CONSTRUCTORS  257  10  var x= new Subclass 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ;  This causes the second phase to stop working. When Base’s initializer dumps the contents of args, it misses Subclass’s arguments.  The problem can be ﬁxed by adding a postscript to Base and moving the dump to the postscipt:  Line 1  dojo.declare "Base", null, {  constructor: function   {  this.args = {base_args: dojo._toArray arguments };  }, postscript: function  {  console.log dojo.toJson this.args, true  ;  When the Subclass instance is created, both Base’s and Subclass’s ini- tializers are called before postscipt is called. Subclass can override Base’s postscript by deﬁning its own. Overridden postscripts almost always call the superclass method, as demonstrated here:  Line 1  dojo.declare "Subclass", Base, {  constructor: function   {  this.args.subclass_args= dojo._toArray arguments ;  }, preamble: function args  {    the superclass  Base  only gets the first three arguments... return dojo._toArray arguments .slice 0, 3 ;  }, postscript: function  {  10  console.log "In Subclass's postscript." ; this.inherited arguments ;  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  } } ;  }  }   9.8 Creating Custom Objects Without Constructors  Usually, the prototype object is connected to an object implicitly via the constructor function that created the object. But, sometimes it is useful to create a single new object and exercise direct control over the prototype object—without going to the bother of creating a new constructor function. dojo.delegate obj, props  creates and returns a new object with the prototype reference pointing to obj. The optional props argument is mixed into the new object by dojo.mixin.

Notice how the prototype of newObject was set to base. This is the whole point. By the way, newObject.greet   returns “hello, my name is John.”  Given the power of dojo.declare, dojo.delegate is rarely needed. However, if you are building some kind of specialized class deﬁnitional machinery  akin to dojo.declare  or if you need to create a single object with a speciﬁc superclass, dojo.delegate will come in handy.  If nothing else, this chapter has shown off some really powerful Java- Script.8 The function dojo.declare is very capable and can be used to build class hierarchies that model complex real-world things. Certainly, the Dojo toolkit employs dojo.declare extensively.  In fact, all the capabilities of dojo.declare are expressed in about sixty-ﬁve lines of  8. code, lending even more evidence that JavaScript is quite a powerful language.   CREATING CUSTOM OBJECTS WITHOUT CONSTRUCTORS  259  We’ve also pointed out some edge cases that you may run against if you are doing something outside of dojo.declare’s design bounds. Look for some of these cases to be ﬁxed with minor enhancements to dojo.declare. However, one of the key requirements of dojo.declare is to keep it light. And, since so much of Dojo uses dojo.declare, an incom- patible signature change just isn’t going to happen  nor should it ! So, there are some things that dojo.declare might never do  for example, more complete multiple inheritance renaming support . Look for more- advanced object systems in Dojox to solve these kinds of problems. But, even when available, such a system should probably be used only if required. In almost all cases, dojo.declare will solve your object mod- eling problems.   Chapter 10  dojo.data  Some web pages crave data. Data providers send it in all different for- mats: JSON, XML, comma-separated, and so on. Data consumers refor- mat the data in all kinds of ways: in tabular or hierarchical display, in drop-down boxes, and so on. The result is a veritable Tower of Babel. A drop-down widget must learn how to speak JSON and XML. So must a Grid widget. So must a tree widget. On the other end, data providers may need to speak different dialects of JSON: one for drop-downs, one for grids, and one for trees.  To straighten up this mess, the Dojo programmers invented a single API speciﬁcation called dojo.data. The spec maps out four standard sets of methods called features: one each for reading, writing, identifying, and notifying. A driver class implements some or all of the dojo.data features. Bundled with Dojo are drivers for JSON, XML, CSV, and other data formats but also drivers for web services such as Flickr and Picasa. In other words, dojo.data abstracts not just the data format but the source as well.  The data might be an in-memory data structure, a stream of JSON or XML, a distributed database on another machine, or a web service from across the Internet. Now a widget need speak only one language— dojo.data—to get data from a provider, no matter what the source.  The main JavaScript object you’ll use is a data store, which is an instance of the driver. Each data store connects to one and only one set of data. In your application, one driver class may have many data store objects spawned from it.   THE BIG PICTURE  261  10.1 The Big Picture  Working with dojo.data involves the following steps:  1. Choose the widget, or determine what you’ll need to do with the  data store in JavaScript.  2. Choose a dojo.data driver that ﬁts your needed data format, data source, and features. Often the widget will determine which fea- tures you need. If the bundled drivers don’t ﬁt your needs, you may subclass a bundled driver or write your own.  3. Create your data store object declaratively or programmatically. 4. Hook the data store to your widget, or interact with the data store  in your own JavaScript code.  In this chapter, we’ll hit each of these steps. In the process you’ll learn about Dijit’s data-enabled incremental search widgets FilteringSelect and ComboBox.  In Figure 10.1, on the following page, you can see the relationships among the driver, the dojo.data specs, the data, and your code. dojo.data is actually four speciﬁcations called features, each of which packages a set of related methods. A driver may choose to implement some or all of these features. The driver ItemFileReadStore implements the methods in features dojo.data.Read and dojo.data.Identity. dojo.data.Read speciﬁes, among other methods, a fetch method. The widget calls fetch, which gets JSON data from the server or its cache, massages it, and makes it available through getValue and other Read methods.  Bundled Drivers  Dojo comes complete with the following dojo.data drivers:    dojo.data.ItemFileReadStore, dojo.data.ItemFileWriteStore, and dojox.  data.QueryReadStore for JSON    dojox.data.XmlStore for XML   dojox.data.CsvStore for comma-separated variables   Drivers for various photo-sharing web services: dojox.data.

But before doing that, it’s essential to get a proper fundamental grounding.  Relational database technology is pervasive in web applications, so you probably already know its terminology: databases, tables, rows, and columns, and so on. But dojo.data drivers talk to more than just databases, so the dojo.data documentation uses different, wider, and more inclusive terms. For example, what you would traditionally call a “column” in a database, a “property” in JSON, or a “tag name” in XML becomes a property in dojo.data land.  It’s important to know these terms since they’re used in many dojo.data method names. You won’t ﬁnd a getRows method in the documentation, for example, but you will ﬁnd getItems. That trips up many folks using dojo.data for the ﬁrst time.   THE BIG PICTURE  263  Alex Says. . .  Session Data != Model Data  Most major web app frameworks include an interface to a rela- tional database. I’m not a fan of relational databases for many web- development tasks. Although the relational model is clearly a good method for storing large volumes of inter-related persistent data  OK, that’s Rawld talking, but he’s not wrong , it’s just as clearly not the pre- ferred method to manipulate session data  that is, data the UI is using .  The reason for this is pretty simple. One of the relational model’s pri- mary strengths is that it can return the answers to interesting questions— questions that weren’t considered when the database was con- structed. It does this by storing all data in a set of predicates and pro- viding a language  unfortunately, SQL  to reason with those predicates. But, we don’t need any of this complexity when we’re displaying a data set in a form. When we’re wiring up a UI, we’re nearly always talking to a service that can answer a particular question. The return data is often a simple document, either a ﬂat list of answers or possibly a nested group of properties and their values! Further, since we’re concerned with other things in the UI—such as changing an item in one place results in chang- ing it every place—the data model used to back a UI needs features the relational model may not handle well, particularly when it comes to enforcing security constraints or other business logic. Additional code is needed, and it’s best not to replicate that on both sides of the wire.  That’s one of the key ideas behind dojo.data: constructing a sim- ple session and service-oriented data model that includes functional- ity needed to develop robust UIs. The abstractions in dojo.data are designed to allow widgets to interface with disparate data sources though a uniﬁed API without taking on responsibilities that the browser can’t handle well anyway. For instance, it’s the UI’s job to provide user feedback when an operation might take a little while, so many of the dojo.data abstractions are explicitly asynchronous to make sure that the UI code has a chance to communicate effectively about the state of the app. Conversely, dojo.data makes no explicit gaurantees about data’s relationships to other bits of data, allowing data stores to be implemented on top of existing services and without forcing data store authors to think about tasks that the browser can’t do efﬁciently any- way. By making things that should be the browser’s job easy and things that should usually happen on the server harder, dojo.data helps keep applications out of the gutter in terms of performance.  dojo.data is there to make building UIs easy. Nothing more, nothing less.   THE BIG PICTURE  264  data store  A JavaScript object that makes available the data from a data source. A data store is always an instance of a dojo.data driver class. The terminology is a bit jarring at ﬁrst, but you can think of a data store as a “mini-driver”: one that handles the operations of one particular data source.  A data store connects to exactly one data source, which is in turn backed by a URL or a JavaScript string. You can have more than one data store deﬁned for a particular data source—for example, you can provide read-only access through one data store and read- write access through another.  data source  The URL or JavaScript string variable where the raw data comes from. If you use the URL method, which is more common, the data may be fed from a static ﬁle, a server program hooked to a database, or some other form of web service. The dojo.data driver doesn’t care where the data comes from or how it’s generated. It cares only what format the data is in. The data may be nested, which separates it from a pure relational table. This is analogous to table or nested tables.  attribute  value  multivalue  item  A ﬁeld name, for example “Street Address.” This is sometimes called a property. This is analogous to column.  The contents of an attribute, for example, “1127 North Spring Ave.”  One to many values belonging to the same attribute. This is anal- ogous to storing an array in a database column  which some data- bases let you do; others don’t .  An object in the data store containing attributes and values. Items in the same data store aren’t required to have the same attributes; for example, one item may have an addressLineFive attribute, and another may not. But they usually have some attributes in com- mon, or else items would be impossible to display and compare. This is analogous to row.   THE BIG PICTURE  265  To make things interestingly recursive, an attribute’s value may itself be an item. You can have nested items, items with more than one parent, and even circularly related items.  A value used to uniquely identify an item within a single data store. When a data store has an identity, each item in that store must provide an identity value. Some drivers force you to provide the identity in an attribute, but some drivers generate it for you. If you’re providing the identity, it is very important to ensure identity values are unique—most dojo.data drivers will alert you if they ﬁnd a violation. This is analogous to primary key.  An attribute functioning as the human-readable equivalent of an identity. For example, an item may have the identity customerNum- ber:999135 and the label customerName:"Jane Public". Data-enabled widgets such as Tree use the label as an item’s visible symbol. Unlike identity values, label values do not need to be unique.  A request for some subset of data store items. A query is a hash whose property name-value pairs are matched against items. This is analogous to the WHERE clause of a SQL select.  internal data representation  The private data structures that a data store uses to cache data in local memory  for example XML DOM nodes, JavaScript hashes, or arrays of arrays .  The parameters that are used to limit and sort a set of items. This includes the query, sorting attributes, upper and lower limits, and handlers.  The operation that takes a request and returns items matching that request. This may trigger a server request via XHR, or it may not  for example, if the data is cached .  Now that we’re working with a standard terminology, we can talk about driver features. Here, we’re using the word feature in the precise way dojo.data deﬁnes it, that is, as a group of related methods. dojo.data  identity  label  query  request  fetch  Features   THE BIG PICTURE  266  methods are grouped into features named Read, Write, Identity, and Noti- ﬁcation. A driver may implement some or all of these features. So, for example, ItemFileReadStore and ItemFileWriteStore use the same JSON- based data format, but only the latter has the Write and Notiﬁcation fea- tures. Still, the Read methods are the same no matter what driver you use, and that’s the beauty of the dojo.data speciﬁcation.  A driver’s features are usually listed in its documentation, but you may also call the method data store.getFeatures  , which returns a hash with properties named after the dojo.data features. For example, if ifrs is of type dojo.data.ItemFileReadStore, then ifrs.getFeatures   returns { dojo.data. Read: true, dojo.data.Identity: true }. The latter technique is useful for writ- ing generalized data-enabled widgets, where you have no idea which driver is on the other side.  Here are the features and their methods’ general responsibilities:  dojo.data.Read  A driver is fairly useless without this feature, because its methods enable fetching items and reading the attributes inside. Not sur- prisingly, all bundled dojo.data drivers implement this. The Read feature contains methods to load items, view their attributes, com- pare an item value, handle multivalued attributes, paginate, sort, and ﬁlter the items.  dojo.data.Write  This feature enables writing to the items as well. These methods change the in-memory copy of the data, but they can also save data back to a server. Some drivers like ItemFileWriteStore allow a custom save handler to precisely control client-to-server writing. We will look at an example in Chapter 13, Tree, on page 341.  dojo.data.Identity  Closely aligned with Read, Identity methods perform quick unam- biguous random-access lookups. To use these methods, each data store item must have a unique identity value. The Dijit compo- nents ComboBox, FilteringSelect, and Tree require the Identity feature.  dojo.data.Notiﬁcation  This feature allows you to hook into data store events. You provide an appropriately named handler to the driver, and the driver then calls it whenever that event occurs. For example, if you provide an onDelete handler to a Notiﬁcation-enabled data store, that handler   THE BIG PICTURE  267  is called whenever an item is deleted. This is particularly useful for posting new, updated, or deleted records back to the server.  The bundled drivers implement these features:    The dojo.data.ItemFileReadStore, dojox.data.QueryReadStore, and dojox.data.CsvStore drivers implement the dojo.data.Read and dojo. data.Identity features.    The dojo.data.ItemFileWriteStore driver implements dojo.data.Read,  dojo.data.Identity, dojo.data.Write, and dojo.data.Notiﬁcation.    The dojox.data.XmlStore driver implements the dojo.data.Read and  dojo.data.Write features.    The dojox.data.PicasaStore, dojox.data.FlickrStore, and dojox.data.  SnapLogicStore drivers implement the dojo.data.Read feature.  An Example Using dojo.data.ItemFileReadStore  Let’s look at a concrete example of a data store using ItemFileReadStore to see where all these terms apply. We have some JSON-formatted experi- mental data in code data datasources genetox.json.1 Each item describes a genetic experiment: apply a foreign agent to a live subject, and see whether it causes genetic damage. So, for example, the ﬁrst experi- ment describes subjecting vivo mammalian somatic cells to irradiated potato extract. The results, under the result attribute, are “no conclu- sion.”  Moral: Stay away from the irradiated potato extract aisle of your supermarket, just in case.   JSON data handled by the ItemFileReadStore must follow this structure:  {  identifier: «identifierAttribute», [ label: «labelAttribute»,] items: [  «identifierAttribute»: «idValue», [«labelAttribute»: «labelValue»,] «attribute1»: «value1», «attribute2»: «value2», ...  {  }, ...  ]  }  1. The sample data comes from GENETOX, a U.S. government database of toxic genetic effects on organisms. This is just one of the free, fun databases available at http:  www.nlm.nih.gov.   DOJO.DATA AND INCREMENTAL SEARCH  268  identity  label  { identifier: “docno”   label: “substance”    items: [      { docno: 39,        substance: “ALLOXAN”,        taxonomy: “Chromosomal effects”,        date: “19910822”,        specimen: “Neurospora”,        result: “positive”      }   ] }  item  attribute  value  Figure 10.2: A dojo.data.ItemFileReadStore data source  The identiﬁer property points to the identiﬁer attribute in items. The optional label property points to the label attribute. Finally, the data itself comes in items, always an array of JSON hashes even if there are 0 or 1 of them.  Our test data, whose ﬁrst few lines are shown in Figure 10.2, ﬁts that structure. Each item has the identiﬁer attribute, in this case docno, and the label attribute, in this case substance.  So, that’s an ItemFileReadStore-based data store in a nutshell. For this chapter, we’ll concentrate on this driver and its cousin QueryReadStore. Another popular driver, ItemFileWriteStore, will show up in Chapter 13, Tree, on page 341. The important thing here is that an item is an item is an item, no matter what dojo.data driver you use.  With a sure grounding in the fundamentals, we can start shoveling data into widgets.  10.2 dojo.data and Incremental Search  A popular Ajax user interface pattern is the incremental search box, sometimes known as a suggestion widget. Dijit implements incremental search in two widgets: dojo.form.FilteringSelect and dojo.form.ComboBox.   DOJO.DATA AND INCREMENTAL SEARCH  269  Each gets its suggestion data from a dojo.data data source, and each resembles a   tag. But FilteringSelect limits your choices to the provided suggestions, while ComboBox does not.  These widgets outperform a   when the number of options is high. Here’s how: suppose you have 1,000 options. A regular   would create all 1,000   tags. Dijit’s incremental search wid- gets instead display a small number of matching options after each keystroke. Each of these option sets is called a page, and the page size is the number of items displayed at one time. If the page size is 30, the ﬁrst keystroke will generate one page of 30 items, the second will gen- erate another page of 30 items, and so forth. This technique is called lazy rendering, because the widget creates option markup only when absolutely necessary.  In the next few sections, we’ll set up a FilteringSelect with suggestions from the experiment data store. The customization options are similar in ComboBox, and we’ll show a few unique features of each.  Creating a Data Store Object  To begin the widget, you must ﬁrst instantiate the data store object. As with most things in Dojo, you can create the data store object declara- tively or programmatically. Here’s the declarative style:  Download data genetox_def.html  <div dojoType="dojo.data.ItemFileReadStore"  url="datasources genetox.json" jsId="genetoxStoreDeclarative"  >  The declaration requires a driver class name, speciﬁed in dojoType=. jsId= declares a JavaScript variable holding the data store handle. You’ll use that variable to connect the data store to the widget.  Different drivers require different sets of attributes. With ItemFileRead- Store, you may specify either the url= attribute or the data= attribute, but not both. URL-backed data stores get data from a server. The data= property, on the other hand, speciﬁes a JavaScript string holding the data. This method is rarer but occasionally useful for small, client- generated data stores. The programmatic version is similar:  Download data genetox_def.html  genetoxStoreProgrammatic =  new dojo.data.ItemFileReadStore {  url: "datasources genetox.json"  } ;   DOJO.DATA AND INCREMENTAL SEARCH  270  Once you have the data store handle in a JavaScript variable, you can pass it to the incremental search widget like this:  Download data genetox_def.html  <div dojoType="dijit.form.FilteringSelect"  store="genetoxStoreProgrammatic" labelAttr="substance" searchAttr="docno" name="substance" >  So, you have a pipe carrying data from the data store to the widget. Now you just need to control the ﬂow a bit.  Pulling Suggestion Values  In our example, throwing the entire data store of experiments at the widget is way too much. So, you must tell the widget the suggestions are values in the substance attribute like this:  Download data genetox_def.html  <div dojoType="dijit.form.FilteringSelect"  store="genetoxStoreProgrammatic" labelAttr="substance" searchAttr="docno" name="substance" >  Here, the labelAttr= property points to the human-readable label attri- bute, and searchAttr= points to the server-consumable value. You can think of it like an   tag with labelAttr= containing the option body and searchAttr= containing the option’s value attribute.  When you type some letters in the FilteringSelect, the attribute speci- ﬁed in labelAttr= is matched against it. FilteringSelect, in the background, copies the corresponding value in searchAttr= into a hidden ﬁeld. When the form is submitted, this is the value sent.  We’ll see how this mech- anism works in Chapter 15, Form Controls, on page 394.  It’s just like a   in that respect.  AutoComplete  FilteringSelect takes a lot of the guesswork out of typing a value, but not all of it. Suppose the user types PZ, which matches no values, and tries to press Tab . In that case, the value is considered illegal, and the Tab is ignored. And what about the opposite problem? Perhaps they type PH, which matches many documents. What happens if the user tries to tab out then?   DOJO.DATA AND INCREMENTAL SEARCH  271  Figure 10.3: Autocomplete helps a user select the appropriate value.  Here, FilteringSelect’s autoComplete= attribute can help. Set to true, the ﬁrst document matching PH will automatically display in the ﬁeld, and the user can simply tab out to set it. This is illustrated in Figure 10.3. Set to false, the user must either type the entire document name or select it by arrowing down the drop-down list and pressing Enter .  ComboBox, which accepts values not in the data store, does not have to deal with this stuff. Like a regular textbox, it passes the displayed text to the server as name. So, ComboBox has only a searchAttr= attribute.  Queries  Sometimes you may not want all the values available for suggestions, just a subset of them. For instance, you may want to display sub- stances with experiments performed in 2001. Queries can help you here.  Many of Dojo’s bundled drivers like ItemFileReadStore and XmlStore sup- port a “semistandard” query language that you can tap into. It’s not a full regular expression or SQL-like query language: there are no ORs, NOTs, set operations, numerical comparison operators, or joins. The standard format is as follows:  { «attribute1»: "«expression1»"  [, «attribute2»: "«expression2»"] , ...  }   PAR TITIONING WITH QUERYREADSTORE  272  The commas are implied ANDs, so query="{ date:’2001*’, result:’positive’}" matches 2,001 documents with a positive result. In the expressions, the wildcard * matches any sequence of characters  including the empty string , and ? matches one character. You use the * operator like this:  Download data genetox_init_query.html  <div dojoType="dijit.form.FilteringSelect"  store="genetoxStoreDeclarative" searchAttr="docno" labelAttr="substance" name="subname" query="{ date: '1995*' }"  >  This query language also supports two query modiﬁers, which you pass as a hash literal to queryOptions=:  ignoreCase  deep  Setting ignoreCase to true initiates a case-insensitive search.  When the driver supports nested items, setting deep="true" will cause these nested items to be searched as well. Nesting is a sub- ject we’ll cover in Chapter 13, Tree, on page 341.  dojo.data does not require all drivers to support this query language. The example that ends this chapter—Section 10.5, A Yahoo Search Driver, on page 280—does not support wildcards, mainly because the backing Yahoo Search web service doesn’t allow them. But since all bundled dojo.data-enabled widgets assume the same query language, it’s a good idea to support it as far as possible.  10.3 Partitioning with QueryReadStore  FilteringSelect lazy renders data by constructing one page of items at a time from browser memory. That speeds up a drop-down list of 1,000 items. Now suppose you have 100,000 options. Many Dojo users try to feed a FilteringSelect a data store of this magnitude, only to ﬁnd the performance drop substantially. How could that be? After all, you are still rendering a page of items at a time, right?  Why You May Need Partitioning  The bottleneck is in ItemFileReadStore. The driver creates an XHR request from the URL you provide. When the ﬁrst fetch occurs from FilteringSelect   PAR TITIONING WITH QUERYREADSTORE  273   that is, the ﬁrst keystroke , ItemFileReadStore dutifully loads everything that  path to myjson.json returns—all 100,000 items. XHR requests can- not say, “Give me the data from  path to mydata.json, but only items 300–330.” It’s all or nothing.  To its credit, ItemFileReadStore makes the XHR request only once and caches all the items in browser memory. So when the second keystroke into a FilteringSelect generates the second fetch to ItemFileReadStore, it simply hands over the page of items from the cache.  Still, at 100,000 items, it’s the initial load that kills performance. The driver must take all the data and pull out a page worth of items to match the query FilteringSelect constructs from the keystrokes. When faced with a job this big, you really need a different design. Hmmmmm.  The server is not doing much work. If it could do the sorting and select- ing job and then send down just the page of data needed, the browser could be free to do the rendering. You’d use less network bandwidth and less client processing. This technique is called partitioning: you split a large job between a client partition and a server partition.  Fortunately, Dojo comes bundled with a partitioning JSON driver called dojox.data.QueryReadStore. It implements the same dojo.data APIs that dojo.data.ItemFileReadStore does and reads the same data format. But it delegates the sorting and selection to the server. The server portion is not magic—you must program it in your server-side language. That part is beyond the scope of this book. Still, programmers ﬁnd this natural when they already have a server-side program converting data  say, from a database  to JSON for Dojo’s use.  Translating dojo.data Queries to Server URLs  It’d be nice to simply replace dojoType="dojo.data.ItemFileReadStore" with dojoType="dojox.data.QueryReadStore" and leave it at that. In fact, you can try it, but the search box will perform even worse than ItemFileReadStore. It all stems from fetching philosophies. ItemFileReadStore is absolutely conservative—it will issue only one XHR request no matter how many times one calls fetch. QueryReadStore is absolutely liberal—it will issue an XHR request for every fetch. If your URL passes back 100,000 items and you use it unchanged in QueryReadStore, it will keep fetching the same 100,000 items over and over again. Uggggh. That’s not the direc- tion we want to go!   PAR TITIONING WITH QUERYREADSTORE  274  The server needs more information. It needs to know what records to look for, how many to return, and how to sort them. That sounds a lot like a dojo.data request. And in fact, if your server program could parse and understand a request like this. . .  Download data datasources simple_request.js  {  }  query: {name: "A*"}, queryOptions: {ignoreCase: true}, sort: [{attribute:"name", descending:false}], start: 100, count: 10  then everything would be hunky-dory. But different server-side pro- grams require different forms of URLs. For example:  mystore.php?query=A%&page=1&itemsperpage=10&sort=name  Rather than be dictatorial, QueryReadStore allows you to plug in code to rewrite the dojo.data request as a URL. You do this by writing a subclass of QueryReadStore and using that for your driver instead.  Fortunately, the subclass you must write will be quite simple. You only need to override the fetch method, which will rewrite the request hash into server parameters. You’ll place the parameters in a hash literal and assign it to the QueryReadStore property serverQuery, which resembles the content hash of dojo.xhr*.  In our example, there are a couple of transformations. First, QueryRead- Store’s wildcard character * must be replaced with the server program’s wildcard character %. Second, the count parameter is copied to the server parameter itemsperpage= and the query parameter to q=. Finally, a starting row, 100, must be transformed into a page number, 10. Here’s the complete driver you need:  Download data datasources sample_rewriter.js  dojo.provide "dojobook.data.datasources.sample_rewriter" ;  dojo.require "dojox.data.QueryReadStore" ;  dojo.declare   "dojobook.data.datasources.sample_rewriter", dojox.data.QueryReadStore, {  fetch:function request  {  request.serverQuery = {  q: request.query.substance.replace "*", "%" ,   CALLING READ METHODS FROM JAVASCRIPT  275  itemsperpage: request.count, page: Math.floor request.start   10   };     Call superclasses' fetch return this.inherited arguments ;  }  } ;  QueryReadStore sends both the request.query and the request.serverQuery properties combined. In the previous example, mystore.php?q=A&page=10& itemsperpage=10&query=A*&start=1&count=10 gets sent. As long as the extra parameters do not interfere with the server program, you needn’t worry about it. If they do, you can simply null out request.query.ﬁeld in the QueryReadStore subclass.  10.4 Calling Read Methods from JavaScript  Up until now, we’ve let the widgets call the various driver methods. Now we’ll call them ourselves from JavaScript. This extends the range of what you can do with data stores. For example, you can loop through a data store’s values to ﬁnd the maximum. You can rig a Button widget to add an item to the data store. Or you can duplicate-check a newly entered value against existing data store values. Of course, you can use JavaScript to write your own data-enabled widget as well. Ah, the possibilities!  You’ll use Read more than any other feature in your own code. In Chap- ter 13, Tree, on page 341, we’ll cover the important methods of Write, Notiﬁcation, and Identity.  As with widgets, to use a data store you must ﬁrst create a data store object as we detailed in Section 10.2, Creating a Data Store Object, on page 269. That gives you a JavaScript variable with the data store object in it. Then you call methods on it.  fetch and Pagination  Let’s start with fetch. Functioning much like SQL’s SELECT verb, fetch takes a query, a sorting hash, and parameters for the page location  start, count , then grabs the appropriate items from the data source. It’s a fairly complex function call, but it’s usually the ﬁrst method you call on a data store. Once you learn it, the rest of the dojo.data methods make sense.   CALLING READ METHODS FROM JAVASCRIPT  276  fetch takes only one parameter: the request hash whose properties are as follows:  {  query:  * String or hash *  queryOptions:  * hash *  sort:  * Array of hashes *  start:  * Number *  count:  * Number *     Handlers scope:  * Object *  onBegin:  * function *  onItem:  * function *  onComplete:  * function *  onError:  * function *   } → dojo.data.Request  Most requests need only a subset of these properties. You’ve seen some of them before: in particular, query and queryOptions for selecting. Some of the properties are ignored in some drivers; for example, a driver that does not support sorting will not recognize the sort parameter.  Some drivers support pagination, and like querying, it can be done on the client or server. ItemFileReadStore paginates solely on the client, meaning it gets all the data from the server at once but can hand over a page of results at a time. QueryReadStore can paginate on the client or the server; with server pagination, the server program must recognize parameters identifying the page. For example, in the previous section, our PHP program needed the parameters page and itemsperpage.  The properties start, which is the item number you want fetched ﬁrst, and count, which is the number of items you want returned, deﬁne the scope. You usually initialize these to 0 and your desired page size, respectively. fetch adds the count to the start property and hands the request object back on return. To get the next page, you just re-pass this request object to fetch.  Sorting  Many bundled dojo.data drivers  ItemFileReadStore and XmlStore among them  support client-side sorting as well. You simply pass the sort prop- erty an array of hash literals. Each hash corresponds to one attribute of a compound key. The classic example is “last name, ﬁrst name” in which there are two attributes—last name and ﬁrst name—scrunched into one compound key.   CALLING READ METHODS FROM JAVASCRIPT  277  Each sort array hash has the following attributes:  attribute  descending  This is the data store attribute whose values you want to sort.  By default, values sort in ascending order. Set this attribute to true to sort descending instead. null is considered higher than any other value, so they sort to the bottom for ascending order and the top for descending.  The order of the attributes goes from most signiﬁcant to least. So, the compound key [ {attribute: "date"}, {attribute:"substance"} ] sorts ﬁrst by date and then, for two documents with the same date, by substance.  fetch Handlers  The scope property value becomes this in the handlers onBegin, onItem, onComplete, and onError. It is similar to the context parameter in dojo. hitch.  These handlers are similar to those used in remote scripting methods like dojo.xhr*. fetch itself does not return items. Instead, it kicks off an asynchronous request and returns control to your program immedi- ately. The fetch continues in the background, ﬁrst waiting for the data from the XHR request and then assembling the data into items. The handlers you provide in the onBegin, onItem, onComplete, and onError properties execute at key points during the process. These handlers, listed here in the order they’re called, are as follows:  onBegin Number itemCount   The onBegin handler is called before the ﬁrst item returns. If the dojo. data driver can determine the number of items beforehand, it is passed in itemCount; otherwise, it’s set to -1. A popular use of this handler is to initialize a dijit.ProgressBar widget with the total number of items and then use the onItem handler to update the progress.  onItem dojo.data.Item item   onItem is called when an item is available for processing. You can use the item to, for example, keep a running sum of values. When the onItem handler returns, the fetching continues.  onError Error errorData   If a transmission error occurs, the driver calls your onError handler. Like the error handler in dojo.xhr*, this reports only errors getting the data, not errors reported from the server, such as “no data found.”   CALLING READ METHODS FROM JAVASCRIPT  278  Also like dojo.xhr*, the error data is passed back in the ﬁrst parameter.  onComplete dojo.data.Item[] items   Finally, the onComplete handler is called after all the items are fetched. If there’s no onItem handler, the ﬁrst argument will be an array of all the items. If there is an onItem handler, this parameter will be null. Essentially, this means you can process the items one-by-one through onItem or all at once with onComplete, but not both.  More Read Methods  Once you’ve fetched items, you can read them:  datastore.hasAttribute dojo.data.Item item, String attr  → Boolean datastore.getLabel dojo.data.Item item  → Object datastore.getValue dojo.data.Item item, string attr  → Object  One common mistake is trying to call methods on an item. You always call dojo.data methods on a data store object. If you’re calling per-item methods, item is always the ﬁrst parameter, not the object.  hasAttribute returns true if an item has a particular attribute. This may look strange if you’re used to relational tables, where all rows have the same set of columns. Data store items, on the other hand, may or may not have a particular speciﬁed attribute, which is the reason for the test. getLabel and getValue return the value for the label attribute or an arbitrary attribute, respectively.  The following example shows a fetch in action and illustrates some of the other Read methods. This code will list all the specimen values in a bulleted list with duplicates removed.  Download data genetox_api_demo.html  Line 1  var genetox =  new dojo.data.ItemFileReadStore {  url: "http:  localhost dojobook data datasources genetox.json"  } ;     Organisms will be placed in a dictionary var organismList = new dojox.collections.SortedList  ;     Fetch all the values once the page has loaded dojo.addOnLoad function   {  genetox.fetch {  onBegin: function   {  console.debug "Begun" ;  },  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  15   CALLING READ METHODS FROM JAVASCRIPT  279  onError: function errData, request  { console.debug "Error Occurred" ; console.dir errData ;  onItem: function item  {  if  ! genetox.hasAttribute item, "endOfFile"   {  console.debug "Loaded "+genetox.getLabel item  ; var spec = genetox.getValue  item, "specimen" ; organismList.add spec, spec ;  },  }  },     When everything's done, list them in the page onComplete: function items, request  { listNode = dojo.byId "resultUl" ; organismList.forEach function  org  {  var listItem = document.createElement "li" ; listItem.innerHTML = org; listNode.appendChild listItem ;  20  25  30  35  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  } ;  }  } ;  40  } ;  The onItem handler at lines 22 to 28 executes once for each item fetched. The last item in the data store is a sentinel record { endOfFile: true } for which the hasAttribute call at line 23 tests.  The getLabel call gets the label of an item, where the label attribute is in the data store  in our data store, that’s substance . Finally, the getValuecall at line 25 simply gets the value for the named attribute in the given item.  The code saves all specimens in a dojox.collections.SortedList collection, which simultaneously sorts the values and ignores all duplicates. The onComplete handler from lines 31 to 38 simply reads the set back out, writing it to a bulleted list. onComplete doesn’t touch the data store at all. That makes sense because when an onItem handler is provided, onComplete gets nothing passed to it.  The fetch operation does a lot of work. But the Read feature has many more useful methods as well, and rather than list them all, we’ll actually build a driver implementing Read and Identity. It’s not as difﬁcult as you’d think!   A YAHOO SEARCH DRIVER  280  <script src=”http:   search.yahooapis.com   ..

But there’s nothing limiting you to your own network or data formats. With a little work, you can build a dojo.data driver connecting to web services beyond your network. Really! The driver we’ll build will call Yahoo Search with terms like “ben and jerrys” and feed the results into a grid, much like the cigar example in Chapter 3, Connecting to Outside Services, on page 37. But the resulting code is easier and reusable.  In Figure 10.4, you can see the strategy. You send the Yahoo Search service some terms, and Yahoo sends back a page of results in JSON format. It’s not appropriate for ItemFileReadStore for two reasons. First the web service is out of the browser’s domain, and ItemFileReadStore, being based on dojo.xhrGet, must follow the same-domain rule. Second, the web service results are not in ItemFileReadStore format.   A YAHOO SEARCH DRIVER  281  But our driver won’t care. It’ll use JSONP to get around the same- domain rule and use it right from the fetch method. And it’ll use Yahoo’s own search results structure as its internal structure. For example, Yahoo sends back its results array in the property Results.Result. Remem- ber that a dojo.data driver is a black box. It doesn’t matter how the driver stores the data internally, as long as the dojo.data methods re- spond properly.  It is customary and helpful to link each item to its store through an added property _S. We need this to properly enforce methods like isItem. If someone were to hand off an item to isItem, it could be from a different data store even if the attributes and values are identical to a given item. To prevent such mixups, you simply compare the _S property with the data store  in the this variable .  So, ﬁrst you deﬁne the class itself. A data store needn’t be a subclass of any dojo.data class; it needs to implement only the dojo.data APIs. Each search request requires only one dynamic parameter, the search terms, so those are deﬁned ﬁrst in the constructor call.  Download data datasources YahooSearchStore.js  dojo.declare "dojobook.data.datasources.YahooSearchStore", null, {  searchTerms: "",  constructor: function args {  if  args && args.searchTerms  {  this.searchTerms = args.searchTerms;  }  },  Now we’ll implement the Read API methods, one by one. First, get- Features returns the APIs the driver implements. getAttributes deﬁnes attributes so that driver users can iterate through them with getValue. Fortunately, you don’t need attributes for every data element Yahoo returns—just ones the driver users will ﬁnd interesting.  Download data datasources YahooSearchStore.js  _searchUrl: "http:  search.yahooapis.com WebSearchService V1 webSearch",     A reference to the store is kept in every item in the _S attribute. That    way, we catch errors with items being passed to us from different stores. _storeRef: "_S",  getFeatures: function  {  return {  'dojo.data.api.Read': true  };  },   A YAHOO SEARCH DRIVER  282  },   ;     getAttributes: function item {     These are all the interesting properties coming back    from Yahoo return ["Url", "Title", "Summary"];  fetch is the heart of the driver and often is the most difﬁcult to write. But if you can get all the data store elements in one remote scripting call and store them in a JavaScript array, dojo.data provides a shortcut. The dojo.data.util.simpleFetch class implements a fetch that handles pag- ination, sorting, and simple events for you. You mix its methods into your own drivers like this:  Download data datasources YahooSearchStore.js     End of the dojo.declare for YahooSearchStore } ;  dojo.extend   dojobook.data.datasources.YahooSearchStore, dojo.data.util.simpleFetch  Note the dojo.extend statement comes after the entire dojo.declare state- ment. Then all you must do is implement a handler for simpleFetch’s _fetchItems extension point, which looks like this:  _fetchItems    * dojo.data.request *  request,  * function *  fetchHandler,  * function *  errorHandler  _fetchItems takes in a dojo.data request and assembles an array of items. But since most drivers act asynchronously and ours is no exception, you can’t just say return items;. Instead, simpleFetch passes in a handler through the fetchHandler parameter. Your code then calls fetchHandler when it’s done retrieving items. If you’ve used dojo.xhr* at all, this tech- nique should look familiar.  YahooSearchStore’s _fetchItems bears a striking resemblance to the Yahoo Search example earlier in Chapter 3, Connecting to Outside Services, on page 37. The actual processing of the list gets delegated to the private method _processSearchData.   A YAHOO SEARCH DRIVER  283  Download data datasources YahooSearchStore.js  _fetchItems: function request, fetchHandler, errorHandler {  if !request.query {  request.query={};  }  };    Build up the content to send the request for. var content = {  appid: "DEMO", query: this.searchTerms, output: "json"     self is pulled into handler by closures. var self = this;  var deferred = dojo.io.script.get {  url: this._searchUrl, content: content, callbackParamName: 'callback', handle: function data {     Process the items.    a function that simpleFetch passes here fetchHandler self._processSearchData data , request ;  fetchHandler is a reference to  }  } ;  } ;  },  deferred.addErrback function error {  errorHandler error, request ;     HTTP requests don't need closing close: function request { },  _processSearchData takes the array of items and adds an _S property to point to the outlying store:  Download data datasources YahooSearchStore.js  _processSearchData: function data {     Default to empty store var items = []; if data.ResultSet {     The ResultSet field comes back as an array of Result objects items = data.ResultSet.Result;   Add on the store ref so that isItem can work. var storeObject = this; dojo.forEach items, function item  {  item[storeObject._storeRef] = storeObject;  } ;  } return items;  },   A YAHOO SEARCH DRIVER  284  Checking an item for containment in our data store is fairly easy. A few auxiliary procedures, mandatory in dojo.data.Read, do the job:  Download data datasources YahooSearchStore.js  isItem: function item {  return item && item[this._storeRef] === this;     The following two functions are used for lazy-loading    data stores who fetch only the identifiers up front, then    fill in the rest as they're accessed.    lazy-load, so these are trivial.  YahooSearchStore does not  isItemLoaded: function item {  return this.isItem item ;     loadItem loadItem: function keywordArgs { },  The getValues may look strange—why pass back an array when clearly each property has one value? Hierarchical data stores, which we’ll meet in Chapter 13, Tree, on page 341, can have more than one value per property. We include it here for completeness:  Download data datasources YahooSearchStore.js  getValues: function item, attribute {     summary:     See dojo.data.api.Read.getValue    if !this.isItem item  {  throw new Error "YahooSearchStore: invalid item" ;  } if typeof attribute !== "string" {  throw new Error "YahooSearchStore: invalid attribute" ;  try {  }  }  } catch  e  {  return [];  return [ item[attribute] ];  getValue: function item, attribute {     Basic read out of the items array var values = this.getValues item, attribute ; return values.length == 0 ? undefined : values[0];  },  },  },  },   A YAHOO SEARCH DRIVER  285  hasAttribute: function item, attribute {     We simply look up the attribute return this.getValues item,attribute  > 0;  containsValue: function item, attribute, value { var values = this.getValues item,attribute ; return dojo.some values, function thisValue  {  return thisValue == value;  },  } ;  }                       With that, our driver is complete. Using it with widgets is no more dif- ﬁcult than using a bundled driver, as you can see in this demo:  Download data yahoo_search_store.html  <div dojoType="dojobook.data.datasources.YahooSearchStore"  jsId="searchStore" searchTerms="ben and jerry ice cream">  <table id="grid" dojoType="dojox.grid.Grid" store="searchStore"  clientSort="true" style="width: 35em; height: 15em;">   Title   Url    Summary   The driver could stand some extensions. It gets only the ﬁrst page of data. Since Yahoo Search itself contains start and count parame- ters, you can extend the YahooSearchStore to pass these parameters on. SimpleFetch, however, will not work in this case since you obtain results incrementally. You would need to write your own fetch method. But overall, this class is useful and provides a blueprint for other web service calls.  dojo.data drivers are to data processing what widgets are to UI pro- cessing: they package the details in neat, reusable boxes. You can plop these store deﬁnitions into any page with a couple of lines of markup and use it to feed dojo.data-enabled widgets.  Here we covered dojo.data and the data-enabled widgets FilteringSelect and ComboBox. In Part III, we’ll look at two very sophisticated and useful widgets: Tree and Grid, which do more sophisticated kinds of display.   Chapter 11  The Dojo Loader and Build System  One of the best ways to simplify a big, complex project is to divide it up into a bunch of small, simple projects. So when you’re implement- ing the next killer app, you’ll want to build a well-organized collection of smallish JavaScript source ﬁles rather than a few huge monoliths. Unfortunately, many small source ﬁles have a cost: if each of these resources required an independent, sequential round-trip to the server, the load times could be sluggish.  Together, the Dojo loader and build system let you modularize a large project into any number of independent source ﬁles  which controls complexity  yet package that same project into only a few, highly com- pressed ﬁles  which optimizes download times . Currently, Dojo is the only pure-JavaScript toolkit that has this capability.1 This chapter de- scribes how to use these systems.  Before we dive in, a caveat is in order: you are not required to use these systems for your own code. If your web app is small, then just throw your code in a JavaScript source ﬁle, reference it from a script element, and you’re done.  1. Some toolkits include processes that package the toolkit but not generic machinery that you can use to package your own code. There are also server-side tools and or client- side tools that require plug-ins that implement various kinds of packaging; naturally the footprint of these tools is much larger.   11.1 The Big Picture  THE BIG PICTURE  287  The Dojo loader and build system are both powerful and ﬂexible. Be- cause of this, covering every possible use case isn’t practical. However, the background provided in this section together with the examples in the remainder of the chapter will arm you with the knowledge and tools required to organize and deploy your own projects optimally.  How the Loader and Build System Play Together  In Chapter 4, we described how Dojo was divided into three source trees: dojo , dijit , and dojox . Each of these trees deﬁnes a hierarchy of modules. The function dojo.require maps a module name to a URL, downloads, and then evals that resource. The Dojo machinery that col- lectively implements dojo.require is termed the loader.  The idea of mapping a hierarchy of modules into URLs is termed the Dojo module system. The Dojo module system allows a large code base to be progressively divided into branches of independent functionality with manageable size. When you are building applications large enough to warrant this kind of organization, you can use the Dojo module sys- tem for your own code.  Once the application is ready to deploy, the Dojo build system ﬁxes latency problems that result from downloading many small ﬁles.2 The idea is to concatenate several source ﬁles together into one ﬁle. For example, if module x dojo.requires modules y and z, then a single ﬁle could be constructed by replacing the dojo.require statements in x.js  the source ﬁle that implements module x  with the contents of y.js and z.js  the source ﬁles that implement modules y and z . This single ﬁle is then mapped to a module name  either x or some new module name . When the new module is dojo.required, retrieving the single resource results in all three modules being loaded. The concept of combining several resources into a single resource is termed packaging.  Once the number of resources is controlled, the size of the resources becomes important to minimizing download times. Since typical Java- Script source ﬁles include lots of extra junk—comments, whitespace, descriptive variable names—that doesn’t affect how the interpreter exe- cutes the code, deleting and compacting this junk can result in dra- matic space savings; compression rates of 75% are common.  2. Latency is the overhead cost to make a round-trip to the server. Latency is often much more expensive than bandwidth for small resources.   THE BIG PICTURE  288  The Dojo build system packages and compresses sets of modules. Note that the build system must understand how the loader works so it can scan source ﬁles looking for dojo.require function calls and con- struct packages of code that behave as if those function calls already occurred—in the proper order.  The Cross-Domain Loader  Dojo includes two loaders:    The standard loader: Able to load resources from the same origin  as the main document—only3    The cross-domain loader: Able to load resources from any origin  The cross-domain loader can affect the way your code executes. Cod- ing and deployment mistakes can cause failures that are frustrating to diagnose. This need not be so. The cross-domain loader is easy to understand and, once understood, is powerful and easy to use. We’ll sketch out its operation so you can develop some intuition.  The standard loader retrieves resources by executing a synchronous XHR call. However, if any URL resolved by dojo.require references a dif- ferent origin other than the main document, then the cross-domain loader must be employed. The cross-domain loader also retrieves any resources with the same origin as the main document with a syn- chronous XHR. However, since XHR does not work when addressing a different origin than the main document, the cross-domain loader employs a dynamic script technique similar to JSONP  as we discussed in Section 8.3, Remote Scripting with script, on page 199  to solve this problem.  Using a dynamic script element to load a script has an important con- sequence: once dojo.require sets up the new script element, it returns— before the resource is loaded. Similarly, if the resource itself contains dojo.require function calls that load other JavaScript resources located at a different origin than the main document, these function calls will also return immediately. This breaks the promise that any dojo.required resource will be evaluated before dojo.require returns.  3. Two URLs reference the same origin when their scheme, host, and port are iden- tical. In http:  www.acmecorp.com index.htm, http is the scheme, www.acmecorp.com is the host, and since the port is not provided explicitly, port 80 is implied by the scheme http. Therefore, http:  www.acmecorp.com contact.htm references the same origin, but https:  www.acmecorp.com account does not.   THE BIG PICTURE  289  To address this problem, the build system and loader work together to guarantee that nested dojo.require calls are executed in order. When the build system is used to create a cross-domain build, it determines the dependencies for each JavaScript resource referenced in the build. Then it constructs a function call back into the cross-domain loader, passing dependency information together with the source code con- tained by the resource. This function call is written to the original resource name plus the sufﬁx .xd.js. For example, given a.js...  the build system would write something like the following to a.js.xd.js:4  Line 1  dojo.provide "acmecorp.a" ; dojo.require "acmecorp.b" ;  acmecorp.a.f= function   {    do something interesting...  }  Line 1  dojo._xdResourceLoaded {  depends: [  ["require", "acmecorp.b"] ["provide", "acmecorp.a"]  ], defineResource: function  {  acmecorp.a.f= function   {    do something interesting...  }  10  } } ;  -  -  -  5  -  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  The code calls back into the cross-domain loader  line 1 , passing an object that contains two properties. The ﬁrst property, depends  line 2 , is an array of pairs listing any module dependencies  in this case, acmecorp.b  and the module this resource implements  acmecorp.a . The second property, deﬁneResource  line 6 , deﬁnes a function that con- tains the source for the module. Executing the function yields the same result as evaluating the original source.  When the cross-domain loader loads a different-origin JavaScript re- source through a dynamic script element, it appends .xd.js to the src URL  for example,  acmeCorp lib a.js becomes  acmeCorp lib a.xd.js . Upon downloading the resource, the script will execute, causing the function written by the build system  line 1  to call the cross-domain loader with the dependency information and the resource source code. The cross-  4. This is not exactly what the build system would produce, but it’s similar enough to sketch out how the system works.   THE DOJO LOADER  290  domain loader loads any dependencies if they’re not already loaded before executing the source code, thereby guaranteeing any nested dojo. required resources are present before the script is executed.  Notice that there is nothing the cross-domain loader can do to ensure non-nested dojo.require calls that load different-origin resources com- plete before returning. Indeed, such calls will never complete before returning. This has some coding implications we will discuss in Sec- tion 11.2, Coding for the Cross-Domain Loader, on page 296.  You can employ the cross-domain loader by loading dojo.xd.js in place of dojo.js.5 This might seem a bit odd since the system could have been built to automatically switch from the standard loader to the cross- domain loader when if required. The design choice was made to min- imize the dojo.js download size. Since you will know whether a partic- ular web app references cross-domain resources, explicitly making the choice of which loader to employ is not a big burden.  The bottom line is this: if you are going to dojo.require scripts from a different origin than the main document, then    You must use the cross-domain loader.    You must prepare those scripts with the build system.    However, you don’t need to prepare scripts that reside at the same  origin as the main document, no matter which loader you use.  If you are serving Dojo and all dojo.required resources from the same origin as the main document, then you can ignore the cross-domain loader. We’ll work through complete examples in Section 11.3, Optimiz- ing Deployment with the Dojo Build System, on page 299.  That’s it for the big picture. The rest of the chapter explores the loader and the build system in detail; we’ll start with the loader.  11.2 The Dojo Loader  So far, we’ve used only dojo.require to load modules deﬁned by Dojo or Dijit. This section describes how to construct your own modules.  5. This is a slight exaggeration. Technically, you could switch from the standard loader to the cross-domain loader after dojo.js is loaded or, with more effort, back the other way. But the current implementation wasn’t designed to make this on-the-ﬂy loader switch, and any attempt to execute such a switch would depend upon loader internals that may change in future releases. Therefore, don’t do it!   THE DOJO LOADER  291  dojo.require  Although we’ve always used dojo.require with only one argument, it actu- ally accepts two:  moduleName  a string   Designates the module to be loaded. Module names map to URLs. For example, "dojo.a.b.c" maps to dojo-module-path a b c.js, where dojo-module-path gives the URL path that was used to load dojo.js. We’ll use the term implied resource to designate the URL implied by a module name. We’ll have more to say about this in a moment.  omitModuleCheck  optional, a boolean   If false or missing, dojo.require checks that the JavaScript object given by moduleName has been deﬁned after the implied resource has been loaded and throws an exception if not; if true, then this check is not executed.  dojo.require keeps track of the resources already loaded and ensures they aren’t loaded more than once—it simply returns immediately if the module already exists or if the implied resource has already been loaded. Typically, the second argument is omitted.  Sometimes it’s convenient to divide a particular module into several ﬁles where some of the ﬁles do not deﬁne a child module. For example, a largish module might rely on a couple of independent sets of utility functions. In this case, it is reasonable to divide these two sets into separate “utility” scripts, resulting in a structure like this:  myApp   myModule   myModule.js    other stuff...  utilsA.js utilsB.js    does NOT define a module   does NOT define a module  Assuming myApp.myModule depends upon the functions deﬁned in myApp.myModule.utilsA and myApp.myModule.utilsB, it will dojo.require these modules. However, since the utility modules do not deﬁne mod- ule objects, the second argument to dojo.require must be provided with a value of true to avoid the normal module check like this:    inside myApp.myModule.js... dojo.require "myApp.myModule.utilsA", true ; dojo.require "myApp.myModule.utilsB", true ;   THE DOJO LOADER  292  These two lines load the utility modules as usual but won’t insist that the variables myApp.myModule.utilsA and myApp.myModule.utilsB are de- ﬁned. Notice that most of the functionality of dojo.require is still there: the module name is converted to a URL, and a check is made before loading the URL to prevent loading the same URL more than once.  Module Paths  A module path is nothing more than a runtime conﬁgurable map from a module name to a relative or absolute URL.6 Module paths let you root different module “family trees” at different URLs. For example, you could place different versions of a module hierarchy at different URLs and then choose which version to load at runtime.  dojo.require maps a module name to a URL as follows:  1. The most speciﬁc parent module with a module path is replaced with that path  for example, myApp.myModule is more speciﬁc than myApp . If no module path is found, then the relative path ..  is prepended to the module name; this will have the net effect  after step 3  of causing the parent module to look like a sibling to the module dojo.  2. Any remaining dots are replaced by slashes.  3. .js is appended as a sufﬁx. If the URL is still relative, then the path given by dojo.baseUrl is prepended. If the URL  now guaran- teed to be absolute  references a different domain than the main document, then .xd.js is appended as a sufﬁx.  dojo.baseUrl is the URL path to the dojo module. It can be set by the conﬁguration option baseUrl  a string . As with all conﬁguration options, baseUrl can be speciﬁed with the djConﬁg attribute or the djConﬁg object. If baseUrl is not explicitly set, then it is automatically set to the absolute URL path from which dojo.js was loaded. Since every web page that uses Dojo includes a script element that looks something like this...  <script  type="text javascript" src=" dojoroot dojo dojo.js">   6. Warning: Currently, the cross-domain loader has a slightly odd behavior in that it won’t handle an absolute path for a same-origin resource correctly. In practice, this should never be an issue since a same-origin script should always have a relative path.   THE DOJO LOADER  293  dojo-module-path can be calculated when the script is loaded by search- ing the DOM tree for a script element with an href that ends in dojo.js. For example, assume that the previous script element is contained in a web page that resides here:  http:  www.acmecorp.com public apps email index.htm  Then, dojo-root would be as follows:  http:  www.acmecorp.com dojoroot dojo dojo.js  Unless you’ve renamed dojo.js, you should let Dojo autodetect baseUrl.  Setting Module Paths  The function dojo.registerModulePath adds module paths. It takes two arguments, moduleName and path  both strings , that give the map from a module name to an absolute or relative URL. As mentioned earlier, if a relative URL is provided, then the path is relative to dojo.baseUrl; if an absolute URL is given, then the path is relative to the root of the server that served the document; ﬁnally, a complete URL can be given by including the scheme and server. Here’s an example.  Assume you’ve created the following directory structure accessible from the root of the server http:  www.acmecorp.com:  public-libs   dojo   dojo   dojo.js ...  dijit   dijit.js ...  myApp  a.js b.js mySubsystem.js mySubsystem   c.js  lib   version-1   version-2   x.js  x.js  The only module path that is automatically registered by Dojo is dojo =>  public-libs dojo dojo. So, in order to load the resources a.js and b.js with dojo.require, the module path for myApp must be registered:  dojo.registerModulePath "myApp", ".. .. .. myApp" ;   THE DOJO LOADER  294  Now you can load the scripts as usual with dojo.require:  dojo.require "myApp.a" ;    loads  public-libs dojo dojo .. .. .. myApp a.js  dojo.require "myApp.b" ;    loads  public-libs dojo dojo .. .. .. myApp b.js  You could accomplish the same thing by giving an absolute path:  dojo.registerModulePath "myApp", " myApp" ;  The require statements look the same and end up loading the same resources, but the actual resolved URLs are slightly different:  dojo.require "myApp.a" ;   loads  myApp a.js dojo.require "myApp.b" ;   loads  myApp b.js  Using Module Paths to Control Version Publication  dojo.registerModulePath can be used to break the “direct” mapping from module name to ﬁlename for good purpose. For example, you can map the module name lib to the path  lib version-1:  dojo.registerModulePath "lib", ".. .. .. myApp lib version-1" ;  Now, in order to load  lib version-1 x.js, write the following:  dojo.require "lib.x" ;   loads lib version-1 x.js  When a new release of the library is ready for publication, the location of the library module—and all scripts that are children of this module— can be set to  lib version-2 by simply changing the dojo.registerModulePath call. Even better, the argument to dojo.registerModulePath could be set by some runtime function.  dojo.registerModulePath "lib", getLibVersion   ;  Module paths can also be set by the conﬁguration option modulePaths  a hash . For example, you could set the myApp module path through the djConﬁg attribute like this:  type="text javascript" src=".. .. dojo dojo.js" djConfig="modulePaths: {myApp: '.. .. .. myApp'}">  <script     dojo.provide  All objects deﬁned by a module are created as properties of the mod- ule object. The function dojo.provide takes a single argument, a module name  a string , and creates the module object given by that name.   THE DOJO LOADER  295  When dojo.provide creates a module object, any undeﬁned parent mod- ule objects are simply created as empty objects. For example, if the script  myApp mySubsystem c.js from the previous directory tree deﬁnes the module myApp.mySubsystem.c, then c.js should include a call to dojo. provide like this:  dojo.provide "myApp.mySubsystem.c" ;  And this causes the following to be evaluated:  Line 1    note: dojo.global references the global object space if  typeof dojo.global.myApp=="undefined"  {  dojo.global.myApp= {};  } if  typeof dojo.global.myApp.mySubsystem=="undefined"  {  dojo.global.myApp.mySubsystem= {};  } if  typeof dojo.global.myApp.mySubsystem.c=="undefined"  {  dojo.global.myApp.mySubsystem.c= {};  10  }    other stuff...  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  return dojo.global.myApp.mySubsystem.c;  Notice that dojo.provide simply guarantees that the required hierarchy of objects exists. It is up to the script that deﬁnes the module to popu- late the module object with interesting properties. In particular, notice that although dojo.provide "myApp.myModule.c"  may cause the objects myApp and myApp.myModule to be created, it does not load the modules myApp and myApp.myModule.  On the surface, it doesn’t look like dojo.provide does much, but it’s required to make the build system work correctly. So unless you’re doing something special, you should always dojo.provide a module name inside the script that deﬁnes the given module. Typically, this is done in the ﬁrst statement of a module.  The Module Pattern  dojo.require, dojo.provide, and the so-called module pattern are often used together when authoring modules. We will demonstrate this by showing the skeleton for the script c.js with the following attributes:    It depends on the myApp.a, myApp.b, and myApp.mySubsystem mod-  ules  lines 8, 9, and 10 .    It deﬁnes the module myApp.mySubsystem.c  line 5 .   THE DOJO LOADER  296    It deﬁnes the functions awesome and reallyAwesome, which are  members of the module myApp.mySubsystem.c  lines 22 and 26 .    It deﬁnes the helper functions helper and anotherHelper  lines 13 and 17 , which are used internally by the module but are not accessible outside the module  they are private to the module .  Here’s c.js:  Line 1    enclose all source in a function literal   to avoid polluting the global namespace...  function  {    define myApp.mySubsystem.c and take a reference... var thisModule= dojo.provide "myApp.mySubsystem.c" ;    all modules used by myApp.mySubsystem.c go here... dojo.require "myApp.a" ; dojo.require "myApp.b" ; dojo.require "myApp.mySubsystem" ;    private functions go here... function helper  {  function anotherHelper  {    public functions go here... thisModule.awesome= function   {    ...    ...    ...    ...  }  }  }  }  thisModule.reallyAwesome= function   {    execute the function literal... }   ;  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  15  20  25  30  By enclosing the entire contents of c.js in a function literal  line 3  that is immediately executed  line 31 , c.js can deﬁne local objects without polluting the global namespace.  Coding for the Cross-Domain Loader  The differences between the standard loader and the cross-domain loader arise from the fact that dojo.require returns immediately if the requested module exists at a different origin than the main document   THE DOJO LOADER  297   termed a cross-domain resource . We already discussed how the cross- domain loader ﬁxes this problem for nested dojo.require calls. However, when you dojo.require a cross-domain resource in code contained by a script element, it’s not nested, and there’s nothing dojo.require can do to help the situation—it returns immediately before the script has been downloaded and evaluated! If you invoke a function that is deﬁned in the dojo.required script before that script has been loaded, JavaScript will throw an exception. This point is bit subtle but critical, so let’s look at an example.  Suppose you have the module myApp.a that deﬁnes the single function sayHello:  dojo.provide "myApp.a" ;  myApp.a.sayHello= function   {  alert "hello, world" ;  }  Then you write some JavaScript within a script element that uses myApp. a.sayHello twice: ﬁrst in another function deﬁnition  line 5  and second by invoking it directly within the script  line 9 :  Line 1     dojo.require "myApp.a" ;  sayHelloAndGoodbye= function   {  myApp.a.sayHello  ; alert "goodbye" ;  }  myApp.a.sayHello  ;  10     If myApp.a references a cross-domain resource, then line 2 will return before myApp.a has been loaded. Since JavaScript does not require that all symbols be deﬁned when translating a deﬁnition, line 5 doesn’t cause a problem; however, myApp.a.sayHello must be deﬁned prior to its use in line 9. Since it’s not, line 9 will result in an error.  There are a couple of ways to solve this problem. First, you could wire the myApp.a.sayHello call to the onLoad event as follows:  Line 1     dojo.require "myApp.a" ;  sayHelloAndGoodbye= function   {  myApp.a.sayHello  ; alert "goodbye" ;  }  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  5  -  -  -  -  -  -   THE DOJO LOADER  298  dojo.addOnLoad function  {  myApp.a.sayHello  ;  10  -  -  -  } ;     Dojo ﬁres all functions registered with dojo.addOnLoad when all scripts that are “in ﬂight” have landed and been evaluated. So, the little func- tion literal passed to dojo.addOnLoad won’t be executed until myApp.a has been loaded.  The second way to solve the problem leverages the fact that the cross- domain loader guarantees that nested dojo.require function calls will be executed completely before they return. With this in mind, you can avoid the problem of attempting to reference an object before it has been deﬁned by following these two coding rules:  1. After loading dojo.js, load JavaScript source ﬁles exclusively via dojo.require; never use the src attribute of a script element to explic- itly load a module.7 Instead, divide all code out into separate mod- ules and load them with dojo.require.  2. Do not assume that anything other than dojo.js has been fully  loaded when writing code directly in a script element.  None of this is a burden since it’s a good practice anyway. So, we could ﬁx the example by copying all the code that’s contained in the script element into another module, say myApp.b:  Line 1  dojo.provide "myApp.b" ; dojo.require "myApp.a" ;  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  sayHelloAndGoodbye= function   {  myApp.a.sayHello  ; alert "goodbye" ;  }  myApp.a.sayHello  ;  Then, replace the contents of the script element with a single statement that dojo.requires "myApp.b":     dojo.require "myApp.b" ;     “Never” is a pretty obnoxious word. 7. dojo.addOnLoad technique discussed earlier.  If you can’t live with it,  then use the   OPTIMIZING DEPLOYMENT WITH THE DOJO BUILD SYSTEM  299  Alex Says. . .  More Dojo Debugging Options  When you load Dojo, there are a couple of djConﬁg properties that can help. First, setting the property isDebug  a boolean  to true causes Dojo to write more verbose warning and error messages to the debug console. On browsers that don’t have Firebug installed, turning isDebug on also causes Dojo to pull in Firebug Lite, which will give you a lightweight console in your page. It’s a good idea to develop with isDebug set to true; you’ll see this in many of the examples in the book.  Second, some debuggers have trouble working with JavaScript code that’s loaded by the eval function. Setting the property debugAtAllCosts  a boolean  to true forces Dojo to load all code by appending a script element to the head element. It’s impor- tant to realize that enabling debugAtAllCosts causes the loader to behave differently, more like the cross-domain loader than the regular synchronous system. As a result, any code using Dojo modules must be run from a function registered with dojo.addOnLoad. You should avoid using debugAtAllCosts unless your debugger is choking on an evaled script. Another option to debugAtAllCosts is to make a cross-domain build of your project and use the cross-domain loader, which can efﬁciently use script tag injection because the build step preprocesses the dependency graph.  If myApp.a is a cross-domain resource, then the cross-domain loader will guarantee that it has been loaded before line 9 is executed. This ﬁxes the problem.  11.3 Optimizing Deployment with the Dojo Build System  The Dojo build system includes two basic functions. First, it can pack- age several JavaScript resources into a single resource; this eliminates any penalty for modularizing an application! Second, the build system can compress JavaScript resources; this minimizes download times— even when developing advanced JavaScript applications that contain lots of code.  The build system includes a customized version of Rhino, Mozilla’s Java-based JavaScript interpreter. We’ll call the customized interpreter   OPTIMIZING DEPLOYMENT WITH THE DOJO BUILD SYSTEM  300  Dojo-Rhino; it is a full version of Rhino with a bit of extra functionality that compresses JavaScript code. Since Dojo-Rhino is a Java program, you will also need a Java runtime environment, version 1.4.2 or greater  available at http:  www.java.com . The build system also includes build, a JavaScript program that packages sets of JavaScript resources. build must be run inside Dojo-Rhino. Both of these tools are located in the util  tree of the source distribution of Dojo: Dojo-Rhino is located at util shrinksafe custom_rhino.jar, and build is located at util buildscripts  build.js.8  You have several options when preparing a web app for deployment. You can package and or compress the JavaScript resources. You can deploy using either the standard loader or the cross-domain loader. And, of course, you can do nothing at all.  Obviously, doing nothing is easiest. And, this may be perfectly reason- able. If a web app includes a small amount of JavaScript compared to other resources  for example, images , then squeezing every last ounce of download performance out of the JavaScript resources may result in no detectable difference in application performance. If this is the case, your time is better spent doing other things. The remainder of this sec- tion describes how to use the build system to prepare an application for deployment.  Packaging a Release with build  build includes several functions that automate publishing a release of a Dojo-based application:9    It creates a release directory where all output is written.   It copies a speciﬁed set of source trees to the release directory.   It combines sets of source ﬁles into single source ﬁles  recall that  this is termed packaging .    It prepares JavaScript source ﬁles for use with the cross-domain  loader.    It compresses JavaScript source ﬁles.  All but the ﬁrst two functions are optional, and each option has several tuning features. Since we’ve already covered the design of the system,  8. Some Dojo documentation refers to the usage of Dojo-Rhino for compression as shrinksafe. 9. Another name for a release is a build.   OPTIMIZING DEPLOYMENT WITH THE DOJO BUILD SYSTEM  301  let’s dive in and demonstrate how everything works by progressively optimizing an example.  Acmecorp’s Magi-Browse  We’ll demonstrate build by releasing Magi-Browse, Acmecorp’s revolu- tionary web-based data browser. The development directory for Magi- Browse is shown below. The basic structure should look familiar. It has a document root, public , which contains directories that hold CSS style sheets  css  , HTML documents  doc  , images  images  , and JavaScript scripts  js  . The js  directory contains subdirectories that hold code used by multiple Acmecorp applications  acmecorp  , code speciﬁc to Magi- Browse  magiBrowse  , and the Dojo source distribution  dojo  .10 Notice all directories under magi-browse public js  are valid JavaScript identi- ﬁers. This makes it easy to map from ﬁlename to module name. If this were not the case, then a module path would have to be set to map the directory name to a module name. Here’s the directory tree:  magi-browse  ---------------->magi-browse is a web app  dev-tools   build-scripts  ---------->we'll put dojo build scripts here  public  ------------------->document root for the web server  index.htm --------------->the entry page for magi-browse css  docs  image  js  --------------------->all JavaScript goes here  acmecorp  ------------->classes modules used by multiple apps  acmeDigit  ---------->acmecorp dijit-based widgets  Navitgator.js ----->the "acmeDigit.Navigator" widget  acmeLib  ------------>the acmecorp library  nav.js ------------>the "acmeDigit.nav" module  dojo  ----------------->the dojo source release  dojo  dijit  dojox  util   magiBrowse  ----------->classes and modules specific to magiBrowse  main.js ------------->the module magiBrowse.main MainController.js --->the class magiBrowse.MainController sessionData.js ------>the module magiBrowse.sessionData sessionView.js ------>the module magiBrowse.sessionView sessionView  -------->children of magiBrowse.sessionView go here  DijitContainer.js ->the class magiBrowse.sessionView.DijitContainer util.js ----------->the module magiBrowse.sessionView.util  10. Since acmecorp  and dojo  are used by several projects, these are likely symbolic links to a single directory tree that’s used by many projects.   OPTIMIZING DEPLOYMENT WITH THE DOJO BUILD SYSTEM  302  Figure 11.1: Magi-Browse module dependency tree  Magi-Browse deﬁnes the class magiBrowse.MainController as well as the modules magiBrowse.main, magiBrowse.sessionData, and magiBrowse. sessionView; magiBrowse.sessionView deﬁnes class magiBrowse. sessionView.DijitContainer and the module magiBrowse.sessionView.util. Also, Acmecorp has built the Dijit-based widget acmeDijit.Navigator and the utility library acmeLib.nav; both of these components are used in sev- eral of the company’s products  that’s why these components are under the  acmecorp tree . The dependency tree for all of these components is shown in Figure 11.1. Of course, a real application would likely contain tens of ﬁles. But this is enough to demonstrate how build works.  the  Step 1: Defaults for Everything  For the ﬁrst step, we will rely on defaults as much as possible. The build program is controlled by command-line arguments and a control ﬁle termed a proﬁle that speciﬁes the set of JavaScript source ﬁles to   OPTIMIZING DEPLOYMENT WITH THE DOJO BUILD SYSTEM  303  include in the release and how to package them. The command line looks like this:  java -jar .. shrinksafe custom_rhino.jar build.js command-line-options  Currently, this must be run from util buildscripts . build.bat  Windows  and build.sh  *nix , also located in util buildscripts , type everything before the command-line options for you.  To get build to do anything other than print a help message, an action command-line option must be speciﬁed. The possible values are release  build a release , clean  delete the contents of the release directory , clean,release  clean then release , and help  print the help message .  There are two ways to specify the proﬁle:    The command-line option proﬁle gives a proﬁle name that must exist in util buildscripts proﬁles . Proﬁles speciﬁed like this must in- clude the sufﬁx .proﬁle.js. For example, proﬁle=myApp implies the proﬁle is located at util buildscripts proﬁles myApp.proﬁle.js. Since it isn’t a good idea to edit the Dojo trees, we recommend against using this option.    The command-line option proﬁleFile gives the ﬁlename of the proﬁle.  If a relative name is given, it must be relative to util buildscripts .  Looking back at the Magi-Browse directory tree, proﬁles are stored at magi-browse dev-tools build-scripts . The ﬁrst proﬁle we’ll use is proﬁle-1.js. So, the command-line argument for the proﬁle should be proﬁleFile=.. ..  .. .. .. dev-tools build-scripts proﬁle1.js. We’ll describe what’s in this ﬁle in a moment.  When build writes a release, it creates a directory tree rooted at release- directory concatenated with project-name. By default, release-directory is set to dojo .. release , and project-name is set to dojo. This is almost certainly not what you want. The command-line options releaseDir and releaseName can be used to set release-directory and project-name. build just blindly concatenates these two options, so if you want project-name to be a subdirectory of release-directory  or not , make sure the release- directory ends with    or not . We will use the values releaseDir=.. .. ..  release  and releaseName=magi-browse to put the release at  magi-browse  public js release magiBrowse.   OPTIMIZING DEPLOYMENT WITH THE DOJO BUILD SYSTEM  304  That’s all we need for the command line; here it is:  java -jar  .. shrinksafe custom_rhino.jar build.js action=release proﬁleFile=.. .. ..   .. .. dev-tools build-scripts proﬁle1.js releaseDir = .. .. .. release  releaseName = "magiBrowse"  Next we need to construct a proﬁle. A proﬁle is simply a JavaScript script that deﬁnes the variable dependencies  an object  that describes how to package the release.11 dependencies.layers speciﬁes how to com- bine modules into packages; we’ll delay talking about layers until step 2. dependencies.preﬁxes is an array of pairs  given by a two-element array , with each pair giving a map from module name to module path— just like dojo.setModulePath. Path names are relative to dojo . Any direc- tory speciﬁed in the preﬁx array is assumed to be part of the release and is copied to the release directory; the build system automatically includes the pair ["dojo", "."]. So, for our ﬁrst attempt at a release, we’ll just get the development tree into a release directory. Here’s what that proﬁle looks like:  Download build_system magi-browse dev-tools build-scripts proﬁle1.js  Line 1  dependencies = {  prefixes: [  -  -  -  -  -  5  ]  }  ["acmeDijit", ".. .. acmecorp acmeDijit"], ["acmeLib", ".. .. acmecorp acmeLib"], ["magiBrowse", ".. .. magiBrowse"]  Before we execute the command line, there are four painful gotchas that are important to keep in mind. First, mistyping a command-line option  particularly character cases—command-line options are case- sensitive  will result in the option being silently ignored! Similarly, typos or outright mistakes in the proﬁle ﬁle are also often silently ignored. Incorrect paths are particularly common. build writes several progress messages to the console that can help track down mistakes. Third, build expects dojo  and util  to be siblings and have contents as released. Finally, relative paths for items on the command line are relative to util buildscripts , while relative paths for items in the proﬁle ﬁle are rela- tive to dojo .  11. build simply evaluates the proﬁle ﬁle with eval. So, you can deﬁne any number of variables and even write executable code in the ﬁle. Such advanced usages are beyond the scope of this book.   OPTIMIZING DEPLOYMENT WITH THE DOJO BUILD SYSTEM  305  So, after carefully typing the command line, you hit Return, and lots of messages go whizzing by. Hopefully, you’ll see something like “Build time: 12.203 seconds” for the last message. Success!  build published a release to magi-browse public js release magi-browse . Here’s what that directory tree looks like:  magi-browse public js release magiBrowse   acmeDijit  -->from magi-browse public js acmecorp acmeDijit acmeLib  dojo  magiBrowse  -->from magi-browse public js magiBrowse util   -->from magi-browse public js acmecorp acmeLib -->from magi-browse public js dojo dojo  -->create and filled by build  It includes directories acmeDigit , acmeLib , and magiBrowse , sourced from magi-browse public js acmecorp acmeDijit , magi-browse public js  acmecorp acmeLib , and magi-browse public js magiBrowse  as speciﬁed in the preﬁxes array of the proﬁle. build automatically copied the entire dojo tree to the dojo  directory and constructed both a compressed and an uncompressed packaged dojo.js just like the binary release of Dojo. Finally, build copied the Dojo Object Handler  doh  unit test framework to util doh   doh is beyond the scope of this book .  Notice that the directory trees were “ﬂattened”—the release directories are all at the same level, while the source directories are not. This causes several module paths to change. The development version has these module paths:  acmeDijit --> "js acmecorp acmeDijit", acmeLib magiBrowse --> "js magiBrowse" dojo  --> "js acmecorp acmeLib",  --> "js dojo dojo"  And the release version has these module paths:  acmeDijit --> "js acmeDijit", acmeLib magiBrowse --> "js magiBrowse" dojo  --> "js acmeLib",  --> "js dojo"  As you probably recall from Section 11.2, Module Paths, on page 292, the algorithm used by dojo.require to resolve a module name into a URL assumes root modules without speciﬁc module paths are siblings of the module dojo. So, this ﬂattened structure has the side effect of eliminat- ing the need for module paths  all root modules are siblings of dojo . In any event, unless a web app is developed with all root modules as siblings of dojo  not the case in our example , the module paths for the   OPTIMIZING DEPLOYMENT WITH THE DOJO BUILD SYSTEM  306  development directory tree and the release tree will be different. There are several ways to handle this problem:    Construct different versions of any static HTML ﬁles that load dojo and or set module paths. This works ﬁne for single-page web apps but quickly becomes unworkable when many pages are affected.    Add server-side functionality to generate the correct paths for dojo  and other modules for any dynamic HTML ﬁles.    Conﬁgure the web server to alias the paths differently depending upon the directory tree the server is publishing. This is likely the best option.  This completes step 1. You can copy the contents of magi-browse public  js release magi-browse  to magi-browse public js on the production server  or alias magi-browse public js on your development server , and you’ve just deployed your ﬁrst web app.  Step 2: Packaging  So far, we haven’t done any packaging—JavaScript resources are just as fragmented in the release as they are in the development environ- ment. To prove this, we can hijack dojo.require after loading dojo.js to log entering and exiting dojo.require to the Firebug console. Here’s what the hijack looks like:  Download build_system build-system.js  Line 1  <script  type="text javascript" djConfig="isDebug: true" src="js release magiBrowse dojo dojo.js" >      console.log "Finished script-include dojo.js" ;    hijack dojo.require to log message before and after it's called... var realDojoRequire= dojo.require; var id= 0; dojo.require= function moduleName  {  var thisId= ++id; console.log 'Start ' + thisId + '  dojo.require "' + moduleName + '" ' ; realDojoRequire.apply dojo, arguments ; console.log 'Finished ' + thisId + '  dojo.require "' + moduleName + '" ' ;  }  dojo.require "magiBrowse.main" ;  20     5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  15   OPTIMIZING DEPLOYMENT WITH THE DOJO BUILD SYSTEM  307  Line 1  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  15  20  25  30  The code takes a reference to dojo.require  line 10  and then replaces dojo.require  line 12  with a function that calls console.log before and after  lines 14 and 16  calling the original dojo.require  line 15 . After nav- igating to Magi-Browse’s top page  index.htm , the Firebug console shows that all the dojo.require calls contained in the various modules essen- tially trace the dependency tree shown in Figure 11.1, on page 302:  Finished script-include dojo.js Start 1  dojo.require "magiBrowse.main"  GET http:  localhost:8002 js release magiBrowse magiBrowse main.js evaluating magiBrowse.main Start 2  dojo.require "magiBrowse.MainController"  GET http:  localhost:8002 js release magiBrowse magiBrowse MainController.js evaluating magiBrowse.MainController Start 3  dojo.require "acmeLib.nav"  GET http:  localhost:8002 js release magiBrowse acmeLib nav.js evaluating acmelib.nav Finished 3  dojo.require "acmeLib.nav"  Finished 2  dojo.require "magiBrowse.MainController"  Start 4  dojo.require "magiBrowse.sessionData"  GET http:  localhost:8002 js release magiBrowse magiBrowse sessionData.js evaluating magiBrowse.sessionData Finished 4  dojo.require "magiBrowse.sessionData"  Start 5  dojo.require "magiBrowse.sessionView"  GET http:  localhost:8002 js release magiBrowse magiBrowse sessionView.js evaluating magiBrowse.sessionView Start 6  dojo.require "magiBrowse.sessionView.DynaDijitContainer"  GET http:  localhost:8002 js release magiBrowse magiBrowse sessionView... evaluating magiBrowse.sessionView.DynaDijitContainer Finished 6  dojo.require "magiBrowse.sessionView.DynaDijitContainer"  Start 7  dojo.require "magiBrowse.sessionView.utils"  GET http:  localhost:8002 js release magiBrowse magiBrowse sessionView... evaluating magiBrowse.sessionView.utils Finished 7  dojo.require "magiBrowse.sessionView.utils"  Start 8  dojo.require "acmeDijit.Navigator"  GET http:  localhost:8002 js release magiBrowse acmeDijit navigator.js evaluating acmeDijit.Navigator Finished 8  dojo.require "acmeDijit.Navigator"  Finished 5  dojo.require "magiBrowse.sessionView"  Finished 1  dojo.require "magiBrowse.main"   The call to dojo.require "magiBrowse.main"   line 2  doesn’t return until line 33; all the other calls are nested inside this call since magiBrowse.main is the root of the dependency tree. Notice that each call to dojo.require results in a separate transaction with the server. That’s bad because each round-trip incurs a latency cost, no matter how big or small the resource. Let’s ﬁx it.   OPTIMIZING DEPLOYMENT WITH THE DOJO BUILD SYSTEM  308  The dependencies variable in the proﬁle deﬁnes the property layers  an array of objects , with each object specifying how to combine several JavaScript resources into one resource. Each element in the layers array deﬁnes three properties:    name  a string  gives the ﬁlename of the packaged resource, rela-  tive to the dojo  directory.    dependencies  an array of strings  gives the module names to in-  clude in the packaged resource.    layerDependencies  an array of strings  gives the packages upon  which this layer depends.  The build system constructs a JavaScript resource for each layer object. The resource is written to name and includes all modules speciﬁed in the dependencies array, plus any modules that these modules directly or indirectly dojo.require, minus any modules contained in any other layers mentioned in the layerDependencies array.  The main page of the Magi-Browse web app dojo.requires the module magiBrowse.main. It turns out that the dependency tree of this module includes all other modules in the magiBrowse , acmeDijit , and acmeLib  trees. So, by building a layer that includes magiBrowse.main, the build system creates a package  a single JavaScript resource  that includes all these modules. Then, when magiBrowse.main is dojo.required, all of these modules will be loaded in a single server transaction. Here’s what the new proﬁle looks like:  Download build_system magi-browse dev-tools build-scripts proﬁle2.js  Line 1  dependencies = {  layers: [  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  {  }  ]  }  ], prefixes: [  name: ".. magiBrowse main.js", layerDependencies: [], dependencies: ["magiBrowse.main"]  ["acmeDijit", ".. .. acmecorp acmeDijit"], ["acmeLib", ".. .. acmecorp acmeLib"], ["magiBrowse", ".. .. magiBrowse"]  After running build with this proﬁle, the release looks the same, except that  public js release magiBrowse magiBrowse main.js now includes all the   OPTIMIZING DEPLOYMENT WITH THE DOJO BUILD SYSTEM  309  modules as given by the dependency tree of  public js magiBrowse main.js. If this dependency tree were, say, ﬁfty scripts, then the unpackaged version would require ﬁfty server round-trips, but the packaged version requires only one round-trip! That’s the whole point.  This brings the design full circle—the build system automatically re- assembles many small scripts  that were great for development  into a single script  that is great for deployment . After reloading Magi- Browse’s top page with the new release, the Firebug console looks like this:  Line 1  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  Finished script-include dojo.js Start 1  dojo.require "magiBrowse.main"  GET http:  localhost:8002 js release magiBrowse magiBrowse main.js evaluating acmelib.nav evaluating magiBrowse.MainController evaluating magiBrowse.sessionData evaluating magiBrowse.sessionView.DynaDijitContainer evaluating magiBrowse.sessionView.utils evaluating acmeDijit.Navigator evaluating magiBrowse.sessionView evaluating magiBrowse.main Finished 1  dojo.require "magiBrowse.main"   Since magiBrowse.main includes all the modules in its dependency tree, only one round-trip to the service is required.  By default, packages are written as compressed and uncompressed resources. The uncompressed resource has the sufﬁx .uncompressed.js. So, in the previous example, build wrote main.js  compressed  and main.js. uncompressed.js  uncompressed . As usual, the uncompressed version is useful for debugging packages.  Step 3: Layering Packages  It may be suboptimal to put all resources into a single package when releasing a large, real-world web app. For example, several pages may use the same subset of resources, or a single-page application may load resources as they are needed.  In these cases, it’s better to create several different packages. When you do this, one package will often depend upon another, and the web app will load one package “on top” of another  this is the origin of the property name layer . The layerDependencies property in a layer object is used to specify these dependencies.   OPTIMIZING DEPLOYMENT WITH THE DOJO BUILD SYSTEM  310  For example, Acmecorp may decide to package all its company-wide Dijit-based widgets and utility libraries into one package. Then every individual web app developed by Acmecorp could reference these re- sources identically. First, a new module must be created that holds the resources that are going to be packaged. That looks like this:  Download build_system magi-browse public js magiBrowse acmeBase.js  Line 1    for demonstration purposes... console.log "evaluating magiBrowse.acmeBase" ;  dojo.provide "magiBrowse.acmeBase" ; dojo.require "acmeDijit.Navigator" ; dojo.require "acmeLib.nav" ;  Next, create a proﬁle that deﬁnes the new package  line 3  and the dependency between magiBrowse.main and magiBrowse.acmeBase  line 9 :  Download build_system magi-browse dev-tools build-scripts proﬁle3.js  -  -  -  5  -  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  15  Line 1  dependencies = {  layers: [  },{  {  }  ], prefixes: [  ]  }  name: ".. magiBrowse acmeBase.js", layerDependencies: [], dependencies: ["magiBrowse.acmeBase"]  name: ".. magiBrowse main.js", layerDependencies: [".. magiBrowse acmeBase.js"], dependencies: ["magiBrowse.main"]  ["acmeDijit", ".. .. acmecorp acmeDijit"], ["acmeLib", ".. .. acmecorp acmeLib"], ["magiBrowse", ".. .. magiBrowse"]  Since this proﬁle says that the package magiBrowse.main depends on the package magiBrowse.acmeBase, magiBrowse.acmeBase must be dojo. required before and independently of magiBrowse.main  that is, you can- not dojo.require magiBrowse.acmeBase from within magiBrowse.main . This is a subtle point; let’s restate it: you cannot dojo.require a layer inside another layer that depends on the ﬁrst layer.  We’ll solve the problem by creating a new index2.htm that dojo.requires magiBrowse.acmeBase before magiBrowse.main.   OPTIMIZING DEPLOYMENT WITH THE DOJO BUILD SYSTEM  311  After running build with the new proﬁle and loading index2.htm, the Fire- bug console looks like this:  Line 1  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  15  Finished script-include dojo.js Start 1  dojo.require "magiBrowse.acmeBase"  GET http:  localhost:8002 js release magiBrowse magiBrowse acmeBase.js evaluating acmeDijit.Navigator evaluating acmelib.nav evaluating magiBrowse.acmeBase Finished 1  dojo.require "magiBrowse.acmeBase"  Start 2  dojo.require "magiBrowse.main"  GET http:  localhost:8002 js release magiBrowse magiBrowse main.js evaluating magiBrowse.MainController evaluating magiBrowse.sessionData evaluating magiBrowse.sessionView.DynaDijitContainer evaluating magiBrowse.sessionView.utils evaluating magiBrowse.sessionView evaluating magiBrowse.main Start 3  dojo.require "magiBrowse.acmeBase"  Finished 3  dojo.require "magiBrowse.acmeBase"  Finished 2  dojo.require "magiBrowse.main"   Two packages are loaded as expected  lines 3 and 9 .  Step 4: Using the Cross-Domain Loader  By default, build packages all resources for use with the standard loader and includes the standard loader in dojo.js. Preparing a release for use with the cross-domain loader is as simple as specifying the command- line option loader=xdomain. When this option is given, build compiles a release that includes both standard and cross-domain versions of all resources. For example, the standard version of the module mag- iBrowse.MainController is written to magiBrowse MainController.js, and the cross-domain version is written to magiBrowse MainController.xd.js. You can choose which loader to use by selecting either dojo.js  the standard loader  or dojo.xd.js  the cross-domain loader .  So if we reference dojo.xd.js inside a script element, we should see the cross-domain loader in action. After making that change to index2.htm and reloading, you’ll see the same Firebug output as before. Why didn’t it work?  Recall that the cross-domain loader will use XHR if the resource resides at the same origin as the main document. So, in order to see the cross- domain loader in action, the resources must be loaded from a different origin.   OPTIMIZING DEPLOYMENT WITH THE DOJO BUILD SYSTEM  312  We can trick the loader into thinking the resources are at a different origin by specifying module paths with schemes like this:  Line 1  djConfig= {}; djConfig.modulePaths = {  acmeDijit: "http:  localhost:8002 js release magiBrowse acmecorp acmeDijit", acmeLib: "http:  localhost:8002 js release magiBrowse acmecorp acmeLib", magiBrowse: "http:  localhost:8002 js release magiBrowse magiBrowse"  Loading index-xd.htm  a version of index2.htm script-including dojo.xd.js and includes these module paths  results in Firebug output that looks like this:  };  Line 1  -  -  -  5  -  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  Line 1  <script    <script     Finished script-include dojo.js Start 1  dojo.require "magiBrowse.acmeBase"  Finished 1  dojo.require "magiBrowse.acmeBase"  Start 2  dojo.require "magiBrowse.main"  Finished 2  dojo.require "magiBrowse.main"  evaluating acmeDijit.Navigator evaluating acmelib.nav evaluating magiBrowse.acmeBase evaluating magiBrowse.MainController evaluating magiBrowse.sessionData evaluating magiBrowse.sessionView.DynaDijitContainer evaluating magiBrowse.sessionView.utils evaluating magiBrowse.sessionView evaluating magiBrowse.main  Notice that there is not one single XHR transaction! If you inspect the document tree through the Firebug HTML tab, you will see that two scripts have been added:  type="text javascript" src="http:  localhost:8002 js release magiBrowse magiBrowse acmeBase.xd.js">  type="text javascript" src="http:  localhost:8002 js release magiBrowse magiBrowse main.xd.js">  These are the packaged modules magiBrowse.acmeBase and magiBrowse. main. They were inserted by the cross-domain loader and caused the cross-domain loader to effectively download and evaluate the modules, as we described earlier in Section 11.1, The Cross-Domain Loader, on page 288.  Notice also that the cross-domain loader loads a cross-domain module asynchronously. You can see this back in lines 2–5 in the earlier console output—dojo.require returns immediately, before the resource is actually   COMPRESSING JAVASCRIPT RESOURCES WITH DOJO-RHINO  313  loaded. On the other hand, when either loader loads a module that resides at the same origin as the main document, a synchronous XHR is employed. This means that the browser will “lock” for whatever period it takes to complete the XHR. Usually, this isn’t a problem. However, so long as you follow the advice about coding for the cross-domain loader, using the cross-domain loader can result in a better user experience.  Step 5: Compression  By default, build compresses any packaged resources and does not com- press any other resources. Both of these behaviors can be controlled by the command-line options layerOptimize  for packaged resources  and optimize  for all other resources . The possible values for these options are as follows:    "": Don’t compress.   shrinksafe: Use Dojo-Rhino to delete whitespace and comments and  shorten variable names.    shrinksafe.keeplines: Same as shrinksafe, but keep newlines.   packer: Use the Dean Edwards packer; see  http:  dean.edwards.  name packer  .  Whenever build compresses a resource, it writes both an uncompressed version to module-name.js.uncompressed.js and a compressed version to module-name.js.  Dojo-Rhino can also compress JavaScript resources independent of build. We’ll discuss compression in more detail in the next section.  11.4 Compressing JavaScript Resources with Dojo-Rhino  Dojo-Rhino walks a Rhino-generated parse tree and dumps compressed JavaScript code. The compression function can be called from the com- mand line to compress an individual ﬁle. This technique for compress- ing JavaScript is both powerful and safe. Since the routines that exe- cute the compression are working off the parse tree, the compression is based on semantic algorithms rather than pattern matching. Conse- quently, obscure transformation errors are unlikely; this is not always the case when the script is compressed by applying pattern matching algorithms.  The compression algorithms remove whitespace and comments and shorten variables names. This means that the output is still valid Java-   COMPRESSING JAVASCRIPT RESOURCES WITH DOJO-RHINO  314  Script source code; speciﬁcally, there is no decompressor required to unpack the source. The compression rate will vary greatly depending upon the input. If the input source is well-commented, well-formatted JavaScript with good, human-readable variable names, then compres- sion rates of 50% to 75% are common. On the other hand, if the code is already compressed by bad coding practices, then the compression rate may be less than 10%. Manually compressed code  so-called write- only code, because once it’s written, nobody can read it  is almost never smaller than well-written code submitted to the Dojo compressor. So, write good code and let the tool take care of compression.  Let’s run a ﬁle through the compressor. Here’s a JavaScript ﬁle with comments and nice formatting and variable names:  Download build_system uncompressed.js  Line 1   ** * Mastering Dojo - JavaScript and Ajax Tools for Great Web Experiences * * This is a sample module that shows off Dojo JavaScript compression. * *   function  {  dojo.provide "myApp.uncompressed" ;        someFunction: a private function to this module    function someFunction   parameter1,    type  this is the documentation for parameter1 parameter2,    type  this is the documentation for parameter2 parameter3    type  this is the documentation for parameter3   {  20  }  var aWellNamedVariable= parameter1 + parameter2; return aWellNamedVariable*parameter3;        publicFunction: a function published by this module    myApp.uncompressed.publicFunction= function   parameter1,    type  this is the documentation for parameter1 parameter2,    type  this is the documentation for parameter2 parameter3    type  this is the documentation for parameter3  30  return someFunction parameter1, parameter2, parameter3 ;   {  }  }   ;  5  10  15  25  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -   COMPRESSING JAVASCRIPT RESOURCES WITH DOJO-RHINO  315  Dojo-Rhino will compress a single JavaScript source ﬁle by issuing the command line:  java -jar custom_rhino.jar -c source-to-compress > destination-of-output 2>&1  custom_rhino.jar is Dojo-Rhino located at util shrinksafe ; if you’re running the command from another directory, you’ll need to include the com- plete path. source-to-compress and destination-of-output are the ﬁle- names of the uncompressed and compressed ﬁles. The cryptic 2>&1 redirects the error output stream to the standard output stream. This command line is fairly painful to use when you want to compress many ﬁles spread throughout a directory tree; it’s best to write a little shell script or Window’s batch ﬁle to make such tasks more palatable.  uncompressed.js is 1,014 bytes long; after compressing, the ﬁle is a mere 209 bytes long—a compression rate of 79%. Here is what the com- pressed ﬁle looks like:  Download build_system compressed.js  Line 1  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10   function  { dojo.provide "myApp.uncompressed" ; function someFunction _1,_2,_3 { var _4=_1+_2; return _4*_3; }; myApp.uncompressed.publicFunction=function _5,_6,_7 { return someFunction _5,_6,_7 ; }; }   ;  There are a few coding techniques that can squeeze a few more bytes out of the compression process without sacriﬁcing readability.  First, rather than deﬁne functions with the syntax function some- Function  * ... *  , use the syntax var someFunction= function  * ... *    call this rule 1 . This lets the compressor compress the function name. The same economy can be realized by deﬁning a locale variable to hold the module name. For example, rather than writing myApp.mySubsystem.f= for each property this- Module= dojo.provide "myApp.mySubsystem ; followed by thisModule.f= for each property  call this rule 2 . The compressor cannot compress the variable myApp.mySubsystem but can compress thisModule. Lastly, rather than writing this...  by myApp.mySubsystem,  instead write  deﬁned  Line 1  -  -  var myVariable1= expression; var myVariable2= expression;   COMPRESSING JAVASCRIPT RESOURCES WITH DOJO-RHINO  316  var myFunction1= function  *...*  {   *...*   }  var myFunction2= function  *...*  {   *...*   10  }  write this:  Line 1  var  myVariable1= expression,   note comma myVariable2= expression,   note comma  myFunction1= function  *...*  {   *...*   },   note comma  myFunction2= function  *...*  {  10   *...*   };   note semicolon  These are equivalent, yet with many deﬁnitions, the second form is more economical. Call this rule 3. Here is uncompress.js after applying the three rules; we’ve marked the edits with the rules used:  Download build_system uncompressed2.js  Line 1   ** * Mastering Dojo - JavaScript and Ajax Tools for Great Web Experiences * * This is a sample module that shows off Dojo JavaScript compression. * *   function  {  var   Rule 3; begin a list of definition  10  thisModule= dojo.provide "myApp.uncompressed" ,   Rule2, Rule3        someFunction: a private function to this module    someFunction= function    Rule1, Rule3  parameter1,    type  this is the documentation for parameter1 parameter2,    type  this is the documentation for parameter2 parameter3    type  this is the documentation for parameter3   {  }  var aWellNamedVariable= parameter1 + parameter2; return aWellNamedVariable*parameter3;  ;  Rule 3; end a list of definitions  -  5  -  -  -  -  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  15  20  25   COMPRESSING JAVASCRIPT RESOURCES WITH DOJO-RHINO  317        publicFunction: a function published by this module    thisModule.publicFunction= function    Rule 2  parameter1,    type  this is the documentation for parameter1 parameter2,    type  this is the documentation for parameter2 parameter3    type  this is the documentation for parameter3  return someFunction parameter1, parameter2, parameter3 ;   {  }  }   ;  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  30  35  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  After compression, compressed2.js looks like this:  Download build_system compressed2.js  Line 1   function  { var _1=dojo.provide "myApp.uncompressed" ,_2=function _3,_4,_5 { var _6=_3+_4; return _6*_5; }; _1.publicFunction=function _7,_8,_9 { return _2 _7,_8,_9 ; }; }   ;  The new version of uncompressed.js takes a mere 179 bytes after com- pression—an additional 10% better than the ﬁrst compressed ﬁle. Al- though these rules may look like squeezing blood from a turnip, they don’t cost anything, and the savings really do become noticeable in large applications.  Compression can save substantially on bandwidth  the number of bytes pushed down the pipe . If you have a few large JavaScript ﬁles that are slowing the load time of your application, then compression will likely improve performance signiﬁcantly. Also, don’t forget to set up your HTTP server to gzip resources. However, if you have many ﬁles, then latency  the overhead for each round-trip  is usually a much bigger factor; use build as previously discussed to solve that problem.   Part III  Advanced Dijit   Chapter 12  Scripting Widgets  In the past few chapters, we’ve seen how Dojo streamlines browser applications—from the click to the event to the server request and response to the DOM node restructuring. Now let’s relate this back to Dijit.  In Part I, we used Dijit components to build better forms. The Dijit com- ponents were very useful, but they just. . . well. . . sat there. Now we’re going to push them further. Using JavaScript, we will create Dijit wid- gets, move them, repopulate them, recolor them, and destroy them. From the code point of view, this involves locating widget objects, ini- tializing their properties, calling their methods, and adding little bits of custom behavior. We’ll tour all of these and pull them together into Ajax user interface patterns in the last section of this chapter.  12.1 What Exactly Is a Widget?  Dijit components are handy encapsulations of user interface function- ality. That’s what made Visual Basic’s component-based technology so appealing twenty years ago. You started with components on a palette, dragged them onto a canvas, and then wrote some code to manipulate them. We’ve lost this power in the Internet age. If you’ve been yearning for that easy, componentized development, you’ll ﬁnd this method of programming familiar and appealing.  Widgets are components in the abstract sense, but what are they from a coding standpoint?   WHAT EXACTLY IS A WIDGET?  320  So far we have a vague idea, at least for the declarative case, that a widget is a snippet of HTML with a dojoType, like this:  Download widgets declarative_vs_programmatic.html  <div dojoType="dijit.layout.ContentPane"  href="http:  localhost too many slashes.html" >   The story goes deeper than that. dijit.layout.ContentPane is really a Dojo class. Its methods dispatch Dojo API calls to handle communication with the browser, the DOM tree, and the server. And you can write JavaScript to call these methods.  For a solid foundation, let’s clarify the terms:  widget class  widget  attribute  A widget class is any class descended from dijit._Widget. It may be a direct subclass of dijit._Widget or a subclass of another widget.  A widget is a JavaScript object, an instance of a widget class. So if your page has twelve validation textboxes, it has twelve widgets, all of them instances of the widget class dijit.form.ValidationTextBox.  In Chapter 9, Deﬁning Classes with dojo.declare, on page 225, you saw how to create properties of classes using dojo.declare. An attribute is a just a property in the widget class. We call it an attribute in deference to HTML lingo.  An attribute is initialized at widget creation time but cannot be manipulated directly afterward. In other words, you cannot say myWidget.disabled = true; to disable a widget. Instead, you’d use a method call like myWidget.disable  .  extension point  An extension point is a method meant to be overridden by the programmer. For example, you can override the isValid extension point of dijit.form.ValidationTextBox with a function of your own. That function can apply to one widget, using techniques we’ll see in this chapter, or an entire widget class, as we’ll see in Chapter 17, Creating and Extending Widget Classes, on page 455.  As far as JavaScript is concerned, both methods and extension points are just widget class methods. The difference is seman- tic. Generally, methods have a full implementation, and extension point methods have a very skimpy or empty implementation.   WHAT EXACTLY IS A WIDGET?  321  Figure 12.1: Relationships between widget elements  Some extension points are named after events like onClick or onChange. These extension points pass more speciﬁc parameters than just a big DOM Level 2 event object, as a corresponding event would.  In Figure 12.1, you can see the widget region and its associated widget class in UML notation.  Declarative Widgets  So far in the book, all we have seen are declarative widgets—widgets created with HTML markup and a dojoType= attribute. We’ll go over programmatic widgets in a minute. But note that declarative and pro- grammatic widgets differ only in the way they are created. Once the setup is done, there’s no difference between the two. Every widget class can create widgets either declaratively or programmatically.  The Dojo parser turns declarative widgets into JavaScript objects. It does this by scanning the entire HTML source, picking up any tags with a dojoType= attribute, and creating a widget object with that type.  It’s tempting to call the HTML tag with a dojoType= attribute a widget. That’s not technically correct. Though there is a one-to-one correspon- dence between the tags and declarative widgets, the tag is a JavaScript DOM object. The DOM node has a style property, but the widget does not. Widgets have widget class methods like setLabel, but DOM nodes   FINDING AND MANIPULATING DECLARATIVE WIDGETS  322  do not. Fortunately, it’s easy to convert between the two, which we’ll see in a minute.  Programmatic Widgets  Fundamentally, programmatic widgets omit the parsing step used for declarative widgets. You create a widget programmatically by calling the new operator on a widget class and assigning the result to a variable. There’s no difference between doing this yourself or letting the Dojo parser do it, as it does for declarative widgets.  Programmatic widgets are best when you need an indeterminate num- ber of widgets or you don’t know their placement ahead of time. Also, programmatic widgets can use JavaScript expressions to initialize the attributes, where declarative widgets cannot. We’ll see how this works in Section 12.3, Creating Instances Programmatically, on page 327  12.2 Finding and Manipulating Declarative Widgets  Normally when you use JavaScript objects, it’s in the context of a pro- gram: you create an object with a constructor, put it in a variable, and then call methods on that variable. Simple enough. But in the case of declarative widgets, you didn’t create the widget objects—dojo.parser did that.  See the sidebar on page 24 for details.  So, on which variable do you invoke the method? Where do you ﬁnd the object?  There are a few ways to do so. To illustrate, we’ll write an application called Unusual Pet Store, or UPS. UPS’s job is to aggregate content from the Internet into an Accordion layout widget like Figure 12.2, on the following page. The web pages are loaded in the background, and you can slide the pane into view by clicking its title bar.  Because these portal pages are loaded by XHR, they are subject to the same-origin rule. Therefore, as we saw in Chapter 3, Connecting to Out- side Services, on page 37, we need to use a proxy server component. Here’s a PHP proxy script that does the job very minimally, not even parsing HTTP parameters. We do just a bit of parsing on the URL before allowing the request to go through.  A wide open proxy is a security haz- ard, since anyone can pass an arbitrary URL to it and wreak all kinds of havoc.    FINDING AND MANIPULATING DECLARATIVE WIDGETS  323  Figure 12.2: UPS  no relation   Download widgets services pure_proxy.php  <?php    To prevent this from being a security hazard  and because this is    just a demo , limit the URLs that can be served  $urlToServe = $_GET["url"]; if  preg_match ' ^entomology.unl.edu ',$urlToServe    preg_match ' ^animals.nationalgeographic.com ',$urlToServe   preg_match ' ^www.hermitcrabassociation.com ',$urlToServe   {     This proxy service doesn't do query strings, but it works    for static stuff readfile "http:  " . $_GET["url"] ;  } else { ?>     Access denied   FINDING AND MANIPULATING DECLARATIVE WIDGETS  324  The HTML ﬁle declarative_portal.html uses dijit.layout.AccordionPane to call this proxy service and grab content:  Download widgets declarative_portal.html  <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD HTML 4.01  EN"  "http:  www.w3.org TR html4 strict.dtd">       Unusual Pet Store Application      @import " dojoroot dijit themes tundra tundra.css"; @import " dojoroot dojo resources dojo.css"    <script type="text javascript" src=" dojoroot dojo dojo.js"  djConfig="parseOnLoad: true">     dojo.require "dojo.parser" ; dojo.require "dijit.layout.AccordionContainer" ;          <div dojoType="dijit.layout.AccordionContainer" id="ups"  style="width:500px;height:500px">  <div dojoType="dijit.layout.AccordionPane"  title="Madagascar Hissing Cockroach" href=  "services pure_proxy.php?url=\  entomology.unl.edu k12 Croach roachinfo roachpage.html"  >  <div dojoType="dijit.layout.AccordionPane" title="Wallaby"  "services pure_proxy.php?url=\  animals.nationalgeographic.com animals mammals wallaby.html"  >  <div dojoType="dijit.layout.AccordionPane" title="Hermit Crab"  href=  href=  "services pure_proxy.php?url=www.hermitcrabassociation.com phpBB index.php" >         In our ﬁrst crack at this program, we’re giving the user some default pets to review. On the slight chance that the user is not enamored with our defaults, we’ll give them the option to change the URL of the currently selected pane.   FINDING AND MANIPULATING DECLARATIVE WIDGETS  325  dojo.byId vs. dijit.byId  You might ask, “Why do I need to call dijit.byId id ? Can’t I just call dojo.byId id ?” It depends on what you want. dojo.byId returns a plain-vanilla DOM node, while dijit.byId returns a wid- get object. Since there’s exactly one DOM node with a dojo- Type, it’s easy to get them confused. The main difference is this: you can call standard JavaScript methods on DOM nodes, but to call widget methods you must use the widget object.  You can actually convert between the two easily. dijit. byId "id"  == dijit.byNode dojo.byId "id"  , and dojo.byId "id"  == dijit.byId "id" .domNode. We will see more of the domNode= attribute in Chapter 17, Creating and Extending Widget Classes, on page 455.  There are ﬁve main ways to get a widget reference:    You can set the jsId= attribute in the tag, which creates a global  JavaScript variable with that name.    You can use dijit.byId id . This is useful if you had set the id= attri-  bute on your widget.    You can use dijit.byNode nodeVariable  when you don’t have the id  attribute but you have the DOM node itself.  What? You don’t even have the DOM node? You can usually get it with dojo.query, detailed in Chapter 7, DOM Utilities, on page 140.    Similarly, dijit.getEnclosingWidget nodeVariable  will get the “nearest” widget surrounding it, if you have a DOM node inside the widget.    You can read an attribute or call a method on another object that returns a widget. For example, the attribute adjacent of dojo.layout. StackContainer gives you back a widget.  Now, back to the task of setting the AccordionPane URL. When turning your ideas into widget code, the Book of Dojo at http:  www.dojotoolkit. org is your road map. This book contains an entire reference catalog of all the Dijit widgets.  Using the catalog, we ﬁnd that dijit.layout.AccordionContainer’s read-only property selectedChildWidget gets the pane, a dijit.layout.AccordionPane   FINDING AND MANIPULATING DECLARATIVE WIDGETS  326  object. From the AccordionPane, the method setHref method changes the URL and reloads the content.  We’ll use those elements in the following code:  Download widgets DeclarativePortal.js  dojo.provide "dojobook.widgets.DeclarativePortal" ;  dojobook.widgets.DeclarativePortal.setUrl = function   {     returns back the div tag of the selected AccordionPane var paneList = dijit.byId "ups" ;     Get the selected dijit.layout.AccordionPane.    kept in selectedChildWidget var chosenPane = paneList.selectedChildWidget;  This is     Now, get the value from the textbox.    dojo.byId   here because the .value property is a property of Node var newUrl = dojo.byId "newUrl" .value;  Note we can use     Change the URL from which the content comes.    changes the content right away. chosenPane.setHref "services pure_proxy.php?url=" + newUrl ;  Using setHref  }  Now wire it into the button:  Download widgets declarative_portal_settable.html   New URL:        Set    dojobook.widgets.DeclarativePortal.setUrl  ;            You’ll recognize the type=dojo method from Chapter 3, Connecting to Outside Services, on page 37. We’ll explain the details in Section 12.4, Extension Points, on page 331.  Now the user can dynamically change UPS content without a page reload. And from the programmer’s side, it’s a mere ten lines of Java- Script, neatly tucked away in a module, ready to use for other projects.   CREATING INSTANCES PROGRAMMATICALLY  327  Soon, your UPS users want to go beyond three panes to four or ﬁve. Or they want to make like Thoreau and go down to one or two. Fortunately, by creating widgets with JavaScript, you can keep ahead of them.  12.3 Creating Instances Programmatically  When you need a small number of widgets created on page startup, declarative is the way to go. But if you need to create large numbers of widgets or you need to create them dynamically, programmatic wid- gets are better suited to the task. Now that you know how to create an AccordionPane declaratively, it’s a fairly short step to create this Accor- dionPane, or any other widget, programmatically with JavaScript. So, suppose you have this declarative widget:  Download widgets declarative_portal_settable.html  <div id="ups" dojoType="dijit.layout.AccordionContainer"  style="width:500px;height:500px">  <div dojoType="dijit.layout.AccordionPane"  title="Madagascar Hissing Cockroach" href=  "services pure_proxy.php?url=\  entomology.unl.edu k12 Croach roachinfo roachpage.html"  >   To create it programmatically, you do two things:  1. Use new to create an object with the same dojoType. Send the attributes as properties of a hash. If you already have a DOM node that will house the widget, you can pass it as the second parameter and skip the next step.  2. Insert the widget into the DOM tree with your favorite DOM func-  tion, dojo.place, or a Dijit container method.  So, to rewrite the previous declarative AccordionPane as a programmatic one, ﬁrst rip out the declaratives from the AccordionContainer:  Download widgets programmatic_portal.html  <div id="ups" dojoType="dijit.layout.AccordionContainer"  style="width:500px;height:500px">            CREATING INSTANCES PROGRAMMATICALLY  328  And insert the following code into the dojobook.widgets.ProgrammaticPor- talStatic module:  Download widgets ProgrammaticPortalStatic.js     This code is run when all the widgets have loaded. dojo.addOnLoad function   {  var accContainer = dijit.byId "ups" ; var pane1 = new dijit.layout.AccordionPane {  title: "Madagascar Hissing Cockroach", href: "services pure_proxy.php?url=entomology.unl.edu"  +" k12 Croach roachinfo roachpage.html"  } ;    AccordionContainer has removeChild method for easy    manipulation of subwidgets. accContainer.addChild pane1 ;  Note how the properties in the hash match the attributes in our declar- ative version.  Now let’s put the pedal to the metal. Because we can now declare Accor- dionPanes programmatically, there’s no reason to store the pane data in the page. To separate the data from the code, we’ll put it in its own JSON data ﬁle:  Download widgets portal_data.json  {  tiles: [ { "title": "Madagascar Hissing Cockroach",  "url": "entomology.unl.edu k12 Croach roachinfo roachpage.html"},  { "title": "Wallaby",  { "title": "Hermit Crab",  "url": "animals.nationalgeographic.com animals mammals wallaby.html" },  "url": "www.hermitcrabassociation.com phpBB index.php"}  ] }  This acts as a nice stub data source while we’re designing the rest of the app. Later, you can pass this data from a server-side program.  Given this data source, it’s easy to write a client-side component, which we’ll rename ProgrammaticPortalDynamic:  Download widgets ProgrammaticPortalDynamic.js  dojo.provide "dojobook.widgets.ProgrammaticPortalDynamic" ;  dojo.require "dijit.layout.AccordionContainer" ;  dojobook.widgets.ProgrammaticPortalDynamic.drawPortal = function   {  We can use it inside of the load       Save the node to attach to.    function via lexical scoping. var accContainer = dijit.byId "ups" ;   CREATING INSTANCES PROGRAMMATICALLY  329     Read the data from our JSON portal data file dojo.xhrGet {  url: "portal_data.json", timeout: 1000, handleAs: "json",    This is the callback used when data arrives load: function objResponse  {     Loop once for each array element in tiles, putting the object    in portalUrl dojo.forEach objResponse.tiles, function portalUrl  {     Construct the AccordionPane for that tile var ap = new dijit.layout.AccordionPane {  title: portalUrl.title, href: "services pure_proxy.php?url="+portalUrl.url  } ;    And put it in the AccordionContainer accContainer.addChild ap ;  } ;  }, error: function text  {     A Toaster will catch this error and display it dojo.publish "xhrError",  { message: text, type: "error", duration: 0 }   ; return text;  }  } ;  }  dojobook.widgets.ProgrammaticPortalDynamic.newPane = function   {     Get the value from the form var newUrl = dojo.byId "newUrl" .value; var newTitle = dojo.byId "newTitle" .value;     Set up the new AccordionPane and insert it at the end var ap = new dijit.layout.AccordionPane   title: newTitle, href: "services pure_proxy.php?url="+newUrl   ; dijit.byId "ups" .addChild ap ;  dojobook.widgets.ProgrammaticPortalDynamic.deletePane = function   {     First get the selected pane, just like we did in declarative example var accContainer = dijit.byId "ups" ; var chosenPane = accContainer.selectedChildWidget;     And remove it accContainer.removeChild chosenPane ;  {  }  }  }   CREATING INSTANCES PROGRAMMATICALLY  330  Most of the action happens in drawPortal, where an XHR request gets the portal data and the load method turns each row into an AccordionPane widget. Finally, the newPane and deletePane methods call the addChild and removeChild methods of AccordionContainer.  These functions are called from the HTML, now slimmed down to a svelte thirty-ﬁve lines:  Download widgets programmatic_portal.html  <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD HTML 4.01  EN"  "http:  www.w3.org TR html4 strict.dtd">       Portal Application      @import " dojoroot dijit themes tundra tundra.css"; @import " dojoroot dojo resources dojo.css"    <script type="text javascript" src=" dojoroot dojo dojo.js"  djConfig="parseOnLoad: true">      dojo.registerModulePath "dojobook",".. .. dojobook" ; dojo.require "dojo.parser" ; dojo.require "dijit.layout.AccordionContainer" ; dojo.require "dijit.layout.ContentPane" ; dojo.require "dojox.widget.Toaster" ; dojo.require "dojobook.widgets.ProgrammaticPortalDynamic" ; dojo.addOnLoad dojobook.widgets.ProgrammaticPortalDynamic.drawPortal ;          <div id="ups" dojoType="dijit.layout.AccordionContainer"  style="width:500px;height:500px">        New URL:     Title:     <button dojoType="dijit.form.Button"  onclick="dojobook.widgets.ProgrammaticPortalDynamic.newPane  ;"> Add   <button dojoType="dijit.form.Button"  onclick="dojobook.widgets.ProgrammaticPortalDynamic.deletePane  ;"> Remove Selected   <div dojoType="dojox.widget.Toaster" duration="0"  messageTopic="xhrError" positionDirection="tr-left"  >       EXTENSION POINTS  331  This illustrates yet again how Dojo and Dijit help partition your appli- cation cleanly. The HTML, the JavaScript, and the data are separated instead of being lumped together in a big multilanguage glob. When your programs get large, this becomes even more important.  One more thing. Just as any widget can be created programmatically, it can also be destroyed programmatically like so:  ap.destroy    destroy removes the DOM node, erases it from the screen, and then frees the underlying object. In UPS, removeChild calls destroy so we didn’t have to worry about it.  If you’re building a one-page app with lots of widgets, it’s a good habit to destroy widgets when you’re ﬁnished. When Dijit creates a widget, it places a reference to it in a global registry. Even if the DOM node is removed and the visual portion of the widget disappears, the global reg- istry entry remains. As long as it does, JavaScript can’t garbage collect the widget. Calling destroy takes care of the erasure and removing the object from the registry.  So, we’ve been through the entire widget cycle from creation to method calling to destruction. By calling methods, you can change widget attri- butes. Similarly, extension points allow you to attach widget code, as we’ll see next.  12.4 Extension Points  In good object-oriented frameworks, some built-in methods are meant for the programmer to call, and some are meant for the programmer to override. A good example of the latter is compare in Java. This method is deﬁned at the root of the class tree  Object  and overridden in most of the built-in classes. After all, comparing two strings, two numbers, two points on a plane, and so on, are all computationally different. Rather than trying to write Object.compare to handle all the types, this method is coded in each subclass. Then you can have one Array.sort method calling the appropriate compare for each pair of values.  Widget classes are like that. Dijit classes have extension points, which you can override in JavaScript. The function you write is called the handler. If you don’t provide a handler for the extension point, the Dijit class uses its own default.   EXTENSION POINTS  332  Client-Side vs. Server-Side Widget Creation  If you come from a server-side web programming en- vironment—JSP, ASP, PHP, or what have you—you might be tempted to script widget creation through it. If we were stor- ing the UPS page URLs in a database, you could loop through the values and create widgets like this:     <div dojoType="dijit.layout.AccordionPane"  url=' '>      Now say the user wants to add new panes, like with Ajax. So, you write some JavaScript to draw and add new Accordion- Panes.  There are two problems here. The ﬁrst is redundancy—you end up writing essentially the same code in the PHP and JavaScript. After all, both take as input a list of URLs, and both output an AccordionContainer of pages.  The second is performance. The more you rely on server code to output the widgets, the more HTML you send through the wire, which in turn makes the browser parser work harder.  You would be better off using the server to query the database and send the UPS data in JSON. This is a much smaller and easily parsed set of packets. Then your JavaScript code can transform the data into panes, and you can reuse this code to create new panes on the ﬂy. So, it’s more compact code-wise and data-wise. It’s hard to beat that!  That’s a bit abstract, so let’s add a handler to dijit.form.Button’s onClick extension point. To use an extension point, you ﬁrst need to know the signature—which is the name of the handler and its parameters. These are all listed in the Dijit catalog at http:  www.dojotoolkit.org.  We ﬁnd the signature for onClick in dijit.form.Button is as follows:  onClick  * dojo.Event *  evt    EXTENSION POINTS  333  When the user clicks the button, Dijit catches the event object and passes it to our handler. As we learned in Section 6.1, Programming DOM Events with Dojo, on page 101, dojo.Event events are standard DOM Level 2 events. We will make use of that fact in a second.  We stub out the click handler like so:           Code which can use clickEvent        event= denotes the name of the extension point, and here it’s onClick. But this extension point is not an event in the same way mouseover is. Rather, it’s a user event that we ﬁrst saw in Section 6.2, Hook- ing JavaScript Functions, on page 117. In particular, it’s the name of a widget class method, in this case dijit.form.Button.onClick. With exten- sion points, usually the method is empty—it’s present but doesn’t do anything.  There are two type= attributes you can use here:    dojo method replaces the widget class method with your own code. So in the previous case, our onClick handler runs, but dijit.form. Button.onClick does not.    dojo connect connects the widget class method with your own code. If we had changed the previous type to dojo connect, our onClick handler would run before or after the dijit.form.Button.onClick method. Recall that in user-deﬁned event connections, we don’t control the order of execution.  If the class method does nothing, dojo method and dojo connect act identically. So, which do you use? We tend to use dojo method unless we know the class method does something.  The args= attribute takes a list of JavaScript variable names and con- nects these with the signature parameters. You can consider them the formal parameters of our method. So when Dijit calls the handler code, it will put the event into the variable clickEvent, which you can then use in the body of the handler.   EXTENSION POINTS  334  Now let’s ﬁll in the stub:  Download widgets dojo_method.html           if  evt.shiftKey  {  console.debug "SHIFT-CLICK = Delete Permanently" ;  console.debug "CLICK = Send to Trash" ;  } else {  }       console.debug dijit.byId "deleteButton" .label + " button loaded" ;           Because Dijit passes the handler a full-ﬂedged Dojo event, you can use properties like shiftKey. That alone puts this handler miles ahead of the DOM 0 onclick= attribute.  What about that second dojo method without an event? Scripts deﬁned this way are executed when the widget is drawn. So, it’s a good place to tuck some initialization code.  Let’s leave the portal example and look at a pantry shelf display using Dijit.Tree. getIconClass is a handy extension point for the dijit.Tree com- ponent. We’ll cover trees in detail in Chapter 13, Tree, on page 341, but here’s a brief introduction. Trees often contain different kinds of items, and many GUI applications indicate this with different icons to the left. For example, Windows Explorer uses a tree to model folders and ﬁles, and it displays different icons for different ﬁle types. Our pantry application will arrange food by shelves, but each shelf can contain dif- ferent kinds of food items. Trees are built with data from a dojo.data data store, so we meet our old friend from Chapter 10, dojo.data, on page 260: the JSON-backed dojo.data.ItemFileReadStore. Here’s one with the pantry data:  Download widgets services pantry.json  {  identifier: 'id', label: 'name', items: [  children: [  { type: 'shelf', name: 'Top Right', id: "tr",  { type:'fooditem', id:'pnkbns', name:'Pink Beans',  foodType: 'Canned' },   EXTENSION POINTS  335  { type:'fooditem', id:'olvs', name:'Olives',  { type:'fooditem', id:'rstt', name:'Risotto',  foodType: 'Canned' },  foodType: 'Grain' }  ]  ]  }, { type: 'shelf', name: 'Bottom Right', id:"br",  children: [  { type:'fooditem', id:'ktchp', name:'Ketchup',  foodType: 'Condiment' },  { type:'fooditem', id:'sysac', name:'Soy Sauce',  foodType: 'Condiment' }  }, { type: 'shelf', name: 'Top Left', id:"tl",  children: [  { type:'fooditem', id:'mthrnlwstng',  name:'Mother in Laws Tongue', foodType: 'Grain'  }, { type:'fooditem', id:'xxxhthrsrdsh',  name:'XXX-Hot Horseradish', foodType: 'Condiment'  }, { type:'fooditem', id:'pckldoctps',  name:'Pickled Octopus', foodType: 'Canned'  }  ]  }  ]  }  In the left side of Figure 12.3, on the following page, you can see our ﬁrst cut at the tree. It’s OK, but the different food items are hard to dis- tinguish. We’d like to put a food type icon next to each: Grain, Condi- ment, or Canned Good.  Our goal is to provide a getIconClass handler. This code will be invoked on each item of the tree. If you provide no handler, Dijit does the default thing and displays no icon at all. The getIconClass extension point’s signature is String getIconClass  *dojo.data.Item i *  . So, already it’s a bit different from onClick—you must return a value as well. In this case, we return a CSS class containing the icon as a background image.  Inspired by Ruby on Rails, “convention over conﬁguration” will be our motto. Since each icon corresponds one-to-one to a food type, we’ll name our CSS classes the same as the foodType properties, sufﬁxing each with Icon.   EXTENSION POINTS  336  Figure 12.3: A sparse tree and a spruced-up tree using getIconClass  It looks like this:  Download widgets dojo_method_iconClass.html     .GrainIcon {  background-image: url grain.gif ; width: 45px; height: 45px;  } .CannedIcon {  background-image: url canned.jpg ; width: 45px; height: 45px;  } .CondimentIcon {  background-image: url condiment.jpeg ; width: 45px; height: 45px;  }     Then the getIconClass handler is straightforward. Using the techniques in Chapter 10, dojo.data, on page 260, we extract the foodType property from each item as it passes by, turning it into a CSS class name and passing it back.   EXTENSION POINTS  337  Download widgets dojo_method_iconClass.html  <div dojoType="dojo.data.ItemFileReadStore" jsId="pantryData"  url="services pantry.json"  >  <div dojoType="dijit.Tree" id="panTree" store="pantryData"  query="{type:'shelf'}" >        Returns Canned, Grain or Condiment, each of which    corresponds to a CSS class suffixed by "Icon".    that the root node is not an item, so we must test    for a valid item each time if  pantryData.isItem foodItem   {  Note  return pantryData.getValue foodItem, "foodType"  + 'Icon';  }        The result is the right side of Figure 12.3, on the preceding page. The icons deﬁnitely make it easier to ﬁnd things.  Our extension handler is easy, but you can make some pretty inter- esting and complex ones too. Say, for example, you have a tree of news feed items. You can display the tree and use getIconClass to ﬁll in read unread, new out-of-date, or category icons next to each item, loaded asynchronously so the user can browse the items before the icons load.  As you get more sophisticated with handlers, you’ll want to separate them more from your HTML. Dijit can handle that. You simply deﬁne your handlers in JavaScript and then link them into your widget. So, for our getIconClass example, you can write the handler like this:  Download widgets programmatic_iconClass.html  function getFoodIcon foodItem  {  if  pantryData.isItem foodItem   {  }  }  return pantryData.getValue foodItem, "foodType"  + 'Icon';  Of course, you may place this code in a module to keep it away from the HTML. Then you connect it into the widget declaratively like this:  Download widgets programmatic_iconClass.html  <div dojoType="dijit.Tree" id="panTree" store="pantryData"  query="{type:'shelf'}" >        This method runs after the widget is created this.getIconClass = getFoodIcon;         EXAMPLE: LIVE FORMS  338  Figure 12.4: Live form for code generation  Again, placing the code in a dojo method script without an event= makes the code run at initialization. We can also use dojo.connect here, which works the same as a dojo connect script. But it won’t work in this par- ticular case because getIconClass must return a value. Connected meth- ods can’t send a return value back through the call chain.  As you start extending the widgets, you will eventually ﬁnd a need to make the same extension over and over again. In that case, you will want to build or extend a widget class. You do this by combining some techniques here with dojo.declare, and that’s something we pick up with in Chapter 17, Creating and Extending Widget Classes, on page 455. But ﬁrst, given what we know now about widget creation, methods, and extension points, we can create some really useful Ajax-style behavior. Let’s take a moment to see how.  12.5 Example: Live Forms  Michael Mahemoff’s book Ajax Design Patterns [Mah06] describes cod- ing and functionality patterns for modern web applications. One pat- tern is called Live Form. A live form’s controls adjust to the choices made so far.  In Figure 12.4, you see an example live form for a code generation program. Each control potentially affects the other controls:    The choice of language determines whether the Include Debug Symbols checkbox is disabled—speciﬁcally, C is the only language with debug symbols.    The choice of ﬁle name can affect the programming language. If the ﬁle extension is .vb, .c, or .java, we can change the programming   EXAMPLE: LIVE FORMS  339  language based on that. This should, in turn, enable or disable the Include Debug Symbols box.  If you’ve built a live form using straight JavaScript, you’ve seen how it gets complex very quickly. Soon the controls start reading and writing the form’s other controls, and you have to control the order of execution and updates.  This is a perfect application for publish-subscribe events, which we saw in Chapter 6, Asynchronous Programming, on page 101. Instead of connecting code by hardwiring object calls, we use Dojo’s central dispatcher. Widgets whose values change announce to the dispatcher “My value has changed” with an event topic. Widgets that are interested in this topic subscribe to it. This creates a sort of enlightened self- interest: widgets need to specify only what they’re interested in. They do not need to change, or even know about, other controls that depend on them. They only need to keep the dispatcher informed.  Now for the design. First we create a topic roster:    The  formchange gencode language topic will be published when the language box changes. Naming the topic after the form and control name ensures uniqueness.    Likewise, the  formchange gencode ﬁlename topic will ﬁre on ﬁle-  name changes.  First, we’ll build the ﬁlename box:  Download widgets connected_buttons.html   File Name:       dojo.publish " formchange gencode filename",[newFile] ;        When the ﬁlename ﬁeld changes, the change is communicated through the appropriate topic. We also communicate the ﬁlename so that inter- ested widgets don’t need to query the box directly—an extra nicety. Note the array notation in dojo.publish’s second parameter. That’s necessary, even when passing one variable over the topic.   EXAMPLE: LIVE FORMS  340  Next, we build the debug symbols box:  Download widgets connected_buttons.html  <div dojoType="dijit.form.CheckBox" name="debugSymbols"  id="debugSymbols" value="Y">     dojo.subscribe " formchange gencode language",this,function language  { var debugSymAvailable = language=='c'  language=='java';  this.setDisabled !debugSymAvailable ;  } ;       Debug Symbols On?   Remember the dojo method handler with no event executes right after the widget is created. Here, it simply hooks in to the ﬁlename change topic and starts listening.  Finally, the language box uses both publishes and subscribes:  Download widgets connected_buttons.html      C   Java   Visual Basic      dojo.publish " formchange gencode language", [newLang] ;           Danger: heavy use of regular expressions!    favorite JavaScript reference for details dojo.subscribe " formchange gencode filename",this,function filename  {  Consult your     Change language based on extension, if c, vb, or java if   extension =  \. javacvb $ .exec filename   != null  {  this.setValue extension[1] ;  }  } ;        And now we have three independent, yet connected, widgets. Using publish-subscribe effectively encapsulates the widgets, turning them into black boxes. That makes debugging much easier.  Connecting JavaScript to widgets makes them richer, fuller, and more dynamic. This is going to be essential in using the Tree widget, which we met brieﬂy here and discuss fully in the next chapter.   Chapter 13  Tree  In Chapter 10, dojo.data, on page 260, we looked at ﬂat data stores where the items have only primitive attributes. But dojo.data can work with complex data too. For example, XML data sources may have nested elements, and JSON data stores may have nested arrays and hashes.  Humans seem to prefer the tree for visualizing hierarchical data. User interfaces in email programs and the ﬁle manipulation portion of an operating system use trees to show items within folders, in turn within other folders, and so forth. Dijit’s tree widget, dijit.Tree, makes this visual display simple. Its tight integration with dojo.data nested data sources ensures an accurate onscreen depiction at all times. By tapping into dijit.Tree’s many extension points and drag-and-drop functionality, you can create a powerful user experience.  13.1 A Simple Tree  We are going to build a web application for Return Material Autho- rizations  RMAs  to demonstrate the ﬂexibility of Trees. The contractee, Gag-ool, specializes in gag gifts and rarely gets returns, but it wants to make the return process speedy and painless. Gag-ool pays all ship- ping costs of the return using its preferred shipping supplier. This ship- per has a web service to arrange pickup and generate shipping labels. The shipper has certain restrictions, most notably a 15-pound limit on packages.  Gag-ool will handle the shipper integration; our job is to create the UI. A customer will log on to the site, see a list of their orders and serial numbers, and choose items to RMA.   A SIMPLE TREE  342  Figure 13.1: Cocktail napkin drawing of the return application  We’ll design this with two trees. The right tree, called the order tree, will contain recent orders, their items, and the serial numbers. The left tree, called the box tree, will contain boxes of serial numbers to return. The user drags items they want to return from the order tree to the box tree. The application should prevent the user from creating boxes heavier than 15 pounds. The user can create, update, and delete boxes as they move the product around to ﬁt their own packing list. In Figure 13.1, you can the cocktail napkin view.  It’s best to start simple, so ﬁrst we’ll model the main nodes of the order tree. The tree itself is a dijit.Tree widget requiring a dojo.data store to feed it.1 Each item in the data store becomes a node of the tree. The top- most node is called the root and has no corresponding item in the data store—instead, you provide the root label in the dijit.tree.ForestStoreModel tag.  You can also have a rootless tree by setting showRoot="false" in the dijit.Tree widget.   1. That’s not entirely true. You can embed static Tree nodes into a Tree with the dijit._TreeItem widget. But static Trees are comparatively rare, and you can create one with dojo.data and a static ﬁle anyway.   A SIMPLE TREE  343  Figure 13.2: A dijit.Tree widget  You can use any dojo.data driver to feed the Tree, but we’ll use the familiar ItemFileReadStore. As with other examples, a static ﬁle will pro- vide the sample data, later to be replaced by a dynamic service. Here is datasource order.json:  Download tree datasources order_header.json  {  identifier: 'id', label: 'description', items: [  { id: 987987, description:"Order 987987",  priority:"Next Day Air"  }, { id: 988855, description:"Order 988855",  priority:"2nd Day Air"  }, { id: 988900, description:"Order 988900",  priority:"2nd Day Air"  }  ]  }  Download tree simple_tree.html  jsId="ordJson">   jsId="ordModel">   With this data source, these ﬁve lines of code produce Figure 13.2:  <div dojoType="dojo.data.ItemFileReadStore" url="datasources order_header.json"  <div dojoType="dijit.tree.ForestStoreModel" rootLabel="Order" store="ordJson"       HIERARCHICAL DATA STORES  344  The data ﬂows from the data source to the Tree in three steps:  1. The dojo.data.ItemFileReadStore tag deﬁnes the data source, just  like we used in Chapter 10, dojo.data, on page 260.  2. A model acts like a pipe adapter between the data source and the tree. Its input comes from the jsId= of the data store and out- puts through its own jsId=. Here you can ﬁlter data through the familiar dojo.data query. Tree comes bundled with two adapters. dijit.tree.ForestStoreModel, the more popular of the two, takes a mul- tiitem store, makes the items children and adds an artiﬁcial root node. You specify the label of this root node in the attribute root- Label=. dijit.tree.TreeStoreModel takes the root from the store, and it expects the query dojo.data store to return one item, presumably with plenty of child items.  3. The dijit.Tree tag connects to the model’s jsId= through its model=  attribute.  13.2 Hierarchical Data Stores  Our ﬁrst example was a one-level tree. If the backing data store sup- ports hierarchical data, as ItemFileReadStore and XmlStore do, a Tree can go down any number of levels. This nesting lessens the number of trips to the server. An order, for example, has header information  containing orderNumber, customer  and zero to many lines  containing sku, quantity . Rather than fetching a header and the associated lines in two separate requests, you can include the lines within the header.  ItemFileReadStore and Trees  An ItemFileReadStore can nest JSON hashes within JSON hashes, a tech- nique we saw in Section 3.2, Literals and Hashes, on page 39.2 That structure translates directly to a tree—a nested hash will display as a “folder” node that you can expand.  2. This kind of nesting is called native nesting. ItemFileReadStore also supports reference nesting, allowing more complex relationships such as assigning multiple parents to a child. These relationships cannot be modeled with a Tree anyway, but if you’re interested, the Book of Dojo at http:  dojotoolkit.org has details.   For example, here is an ItemFileReadStore showing line nesting within an order:  HIERARCHICAL DATA STORES  345  Download tree datasources order_combined.json  {  identifier: 'id', label: 'description', items: [  { id: 987987, description:"Order 987987",  priority:"Next Day Air", line: [  { id: '987987-1', qty:1,  sku:11761, description: 'Yodeling Pickle'},  { id: '987987-2', qty:3,  sku:11798, description: 'Gummy Tapeworm'}  }, { id: 988855, description:"Order 988855",  priority:"2nd Day Air" , line: [  { id: '988855-1', qty:4,  sku:11753, description: 'Gummy Haggis'}  ]  ]  }, { id: 988900, description:"Order 988900",  priority:"2nd Day Air", line: [  { id: '988900-1', qty:15,  { id: '988900-2', qty:1,  sku:11824, description: 'Worlds Largest Inflatable Heart'},  sku:11548, description: 'Deluxe Librarian Action Figure'}  ]  }  ]  }  When fed into a Tree with this code...  Download tree tree.html  <div dojoType="dojo.data.ItemFileReadStore"  url="datasources order_combined.json" jsId="ordJson">   <div dojoType="dijit.tree.ForestStoreModel"  rootLabel="Order" store="ordJson" childrenAttrs="line" jsId="ordModel">   <div dojoType="dijit.Tree" id="ordTree"  model="ordModel">   the data store looks like Figure 13.3, on the next page.   HIERARCHICAL DATA STORES  346  Figure 13.3: A hierarchical Tree  Note the childrenAttr= property, a comma-separated list of data store properties. The previous code says all properties named line will hold nested elements. If you don’t specify childrenAttr=, Tree assumes the property children speciﬁes which properties hold nested elements. But for data store readability, it’s a good idea to explicitly state childrenAttr=. children is simply not descriptive enough—a property name like line tells what the nested items are. It’s also a good idea to name them differently at different levels, for example, line at the ﬁrst level and lineDetail at the second with childrenAttr="line,lineDetail".  ItemFileReadStore has a few caveats when used with Trees. Each item, whether parent or child or grandchild, must have a single identiﬁer attribute. In our example, id is the identiﬁer. Furthermore, identiﬁer values must be unique within the JSON document.  Accessing Complex Data from JavaScript  Tree’s extension points require access to your hierarchical data. But how does that work? Earlier, in Section 10.4, Calling Read Methods from JavaScript, on page 275, you saw how to get an item with fetch and extract values from it with getValue. The JSON data stores hand you back JavaScript primitives as values. dojox.data.XmlStore hands you back an XmlItem, which you can pass to toString to convert.  getValue can also return a nested item. In this case, you treat the return value as you would any other item—you use getValue to retrieve its values and so forth.  Data stores can also have multivalues. A multivalued property has zero- to-many values assigned to it. Most often these values are themselves   HIERARCHICAL DATA STORES  347  nested items, but they could be any kind of value. If you try to retrieve a multivalue with getValue, the data driver may throw an exception or may simply hand you the ﬁrst value  as ItemFileReadStore does . Neither option is very good. You really want all the values here, and to get them, you must use getValues.  getValues returns a JavaScript array of values for that property. These values may themselves by primitives, like a JavaScript primitive or an XmlItem, or nested items. Conveniently, getValues will work for any attribute. It may return a zero-element array if the attribute doesn’t exist or an array of one element or many elements.  How you write an multivalue in the data source depends on the data driver. In ItemFileReadStore, a JavaScript-like array bracketed with [. . . ] indicates a multivalue. In XMLStore, any two or more sibling elements with the same tag name become a multivalue. So in our previous exam- ples, the   tags and the   tags become multivalues.  All this machinery makes accessing complex data uniform across data drivers. An example shows how this all works together. Here’s our sam- ple order data again, but this time formatted in XML:  Download tree datasources order_combined.xml         987987   Order 987987   Next Day Air      987987-1   1   11761   Yodeling Pickle         987987-2   3   11798   Gummy Tapeworm              The following code extracts the description attribute from the ﬁrst line of the ﬁrst order in both JSON and XML data stores.   Here are the data store deﬁnitions, written the programmatic way:  HIERARCHICAL DATA STORES  348  Download tree using_heirarchies.html  dojo.require "dojo.data.ItemFileReadStore" ; var ordJson = new dojo.data.ItemFileReadStore  {  url: "datasources order_combined.json", childrenAttr: "line"  } ; dojo.require "dojox.data.XmlStore" ; var ordXml = new dojox.data.XmlStore  {  url: "datasources order_combined.xml", rootItem: "order", keyAttribute:"orderNumber", label:"description"  } ;  This is the ﬁrst XmlStore deﬁnition we’ve seen, but it’s pretty much like the ItemFileReadStore. The two properties keyAttribute and label are the analogues of ItemFileReadStore’s identiﬁer and label properties. The rootItem property gives the tag name of the main elements.  And here’s the extraction code:  Download tree using_heirarchies.html     Get the first order var firstOrder = items[0];  function commonComplete storeDescription, dataStore, items, request  {     Get array of each line from the lines list var lineList = dataStore.getValues firstOrder,"line" ;     Get description of the first item.    to the value, necessary for XmlStore console.debug   The +"" applies toString    storeDescription, dataStore.getValue lineList[0],"description" + ""   ;  }     Example 1: ItemFileReadStore and JSON ordJson.fetch {  query: { id: '*' }, onComplete: function items, request  {  }  } ;    Example 2: XmlStore ordXml.fetch {  query: { orderNumber: '*' },  commonComplete "JSON Native Nesting: ", ordJson, items,request ;   EXTENSION POINTS  349  onComplete: function items, request  {  commonComplete "XML: ", ordXml, items, request ;  }  } ;  Note that in both cases the extraction code is commonComplete, and the extracted values are identical. That’s dojo.data making things easy for you.  13.3 Extension Points  Like most widgets, Trees have extension points in which to hook your own code. Back in Chapter 12, Scripting Widgets, on page 319, we saw the getIconClass extension point in action. Another extension point, onClick, will be useful in the RMA app, as we’ll see in a second.  The Box Tree  The tree needs one box to start, and the user will add, remove, and rename boxes as needed. Trees are backed by data stores, but now Item- FileReadStore isn’t enough. We need a store implementing dojo.data.Write, and ItemFileWriteStore is the natural choice here, using the same format as ItemFileReadStore.  The initial data store, kept in datasources rma_boxes.json, deﬁnes one initial box with no items in it. It looks like this:  Download tree datasources rma_boxes.json  identifier: 'id', label: 'name', items: [  {  }  ]  { id: 1, name: "Box 1", type:"box", weight:0 }  This looks pretty trivial; does it need to be in a ﬁle? Not really. We could as easily put this initial store in a string and pass it to the data= property of the store tag. But by using a URL, we can easily convert the static ﬁle to a server-based process later.  Our app will look like a split screen, a simple thing to achieve with a dijit.layout.BorderContainer and two dijit.layout.ContentPanes. Later, in Chapter 16, Dijit Themes, Design, and Layout, on page 428, you’ll learn all the details of both, but for now here’s a brief explanation. The screen is split into two halves, each delineated by a ContentPane. The entire   EXTENSION POINTS  350  Figure 13.4: Laying out the box tree and the order tree  BorderContainer box is 400 by 600 pixels, and initially each tree takes up half as shown in Figure 13.4.  Laying out the page takes a few ContentPanes pushed into a BorderCon- tainer. Here’s the skeleton:  Download tree on_click.html  <div dojoType="dijit.layout.BorderContainer" style="width:600px; height:400px" >    Box Tree      Order Tree       The onClick Extension Point  The box tree’s Remove and Rename buttons will require the user to select a box ﬁrst. So, somehow the program needs to keep track of the last-selected box. dijit.Tree provides the extension point onClick that’ll work well in this case. Though onClick is also an event, Tree’s onClick   MANIPULATING THE TREE  351  extension point works a little differently. Tree passes the underlying data item to the handler rather than the DOM event object.  The onClick handler itself simply remembers the last item clicked. The extension point receives the entire item, not just the label, the identiﬁer, or the DOM node, making it easier to retrieve properties later.  Download tree on_click.html  <div dojoType="dijit.layout.ContentPane" region="leading"  splitter="true" style="width:200px"  >  <div dojoType="dojo.data.ItemFileWriteStore"  url="datasources rma_boxes.json" jsId="boxJson">   <div dojoType="dijit.tree.ForestStoreModel" store="boxJson"  jsId="boxModel" rootLabel="Boxes">            Given item, the backing dojo.data.Item backing this node,    save it for later deleting and or renaming lastBoxSelected = item;           With boxes now selectable, we’re ready to manipulate them.  13.4 Manipulating the Tree  The Dijit Tree design is a slice of Model-View-Controller heaven, with dojo.data providing the model and Tree providing the view and con- troller. To manipulate the tree, you don’t call methods on the Tree object. Instead, you simply change the model, and the onscreen Tree changes accordingly. The in-memory data store representation and the Tree dis- play are always in sync.  Adding, Removing, and Modifying Tree Nodes  So to change the Tree, you change the data store, and that means using the dojo.data.Write API. Write contains methods for creating, modifying, removing, and saving items. But instead of calling the Write methods directly, you call them on the Tree model. The Tree model then passes them back to the data store.   MANIPULATING THE TREE  352  You create items with newItem:  newItem Hash obj, [, Hash parentInfo]  → dojo.data.Item  newItem creates an item in the data store. The properties of obj will become properties in the new item. newItem is data-store-agnostic—obj is a plain ol’ JavaScript hash whether the store type is ItemFileWriteStore or XmlStore.  parentInfo is used to inject nested items into existing items. It’s a hash of the following form...  { parent: anItem, attribute: "attributeName" }  where anItem is the data store item that will become the parent and where attributeName is the attribute to place it. attributeName will be one of the childrenAttr attributes you’ve listed for the store.  The Add button calls newItem to add a box—very straightforward. A newItem call without parent information creates the new item under- neath the root, which is what we want:  Download tree writing_model.html     Add Box    highestBoxId++; boxJson.newItem {  id: highestBoxId, name: "Box "+highestBoxId, type: "box", weight:0  } ;        Remember, for Trees, you call the Write methods on the model, not the store itself. deleteItem does what you think:  deleteItem dojo.data.Item i   i must be an actual dojo.data.Item object, not just a plain ol’ JavaScript hash as in newItem. The same is true for setValue and setValues.  setValue dojo.data.Item i, String attributeName, Object value  setValues dojo.data.Item i, String attributeName, Object[] value[]   setValue s  is the ﬂip side of Read’s getValue s , writing an attribute to an item. It has an interesting side effect: using setValue on the designated store label changes the label on the Tree node. That’s exactly how to do the Rename button.   MANIPULATING THE TREE  353  So, onto the buttons. . . First set up the dojo.require statements and housekeeping variables. highestBoxId will keep track of the last-assigned box ID. Allocation is sparse; that is, if a box is deleted, there will be a “hole” in the IDs. That’s ﬁne.  Download tree writing_model.html  dojo.require "dijit.form.Button" ;     This is a dummy counter until the real one is in place. var highestBoxId = 1;  The Remove button passes lastSelectedItem to deleteItem, and the box disappears:  Download tree writing_model.html     Remove Box    if  !lastBoxSelected  !boxJson.isItem lastBoxSelected   {  alert 'You must select a box first' ; return;  } boxJson.deleteItem lastBoxSelected ;        Rename uses lastSelectedBox and the Write method setValue to set a label on the box:  Download tree writing_model.html     Rename Box    if  !lastBoxSelected  !boxJson.isItem lastBoxSelected   {  alert 'You must select a box first' ; return;  }    Low-tech solution. if  newName = prompt "What would you like to call it?"   {  Would be better as a Dijit Dialog  boxJson.setValue lastBoxSelected,"name",newName ;  }        Note in all three buttons, the code touches only the data store. The internal representation of the store is always up-to-date with the visual Tree. That’s nice, but it gets the data only halfway to its destination. How do you get it the rest of the way—to the server?   MANIPULATING THE TREE  354  Saving the Tree Back to the Server  In the traditional web world, you could save data only upon form sub- mission. In the Ajax world, you have more options. You can save one ﬁeld at a time as the user enters it. You can save a record as the user moves from one record to another. You can save at certain time inter- vals, like a word processor’s autosave feature, or you can save upon form submission. There are advantages to each strategy. For example, saving data more frequently avoids the “all-or-nothing” pitfall, while saving data less frequently is easier to script.  dojo.data allows these options and those in between—a continuum be- tween coarse granularity  saving more data less frequently  and ﬁne granularity  saving less data more frequently . And because changing Tree involves changing only the model, this goes on without the knowl- edge of Tree.  For ﬁne granularity, you plug your save routine  usually using XHR or JSONP  into the dojo.data.Notiﬁcation API. Notiﬁcation is like the mirror image of Write. When each Write method completes, it ﬁres the corre- sponding Notiﬁcation event: Write’s setValue ﬁres Notiﬁcaton’s onSet event, delete ﬁres onDelete, and newItem ﬁres onNew. Tree itself works by plug- ging handlers into these events. For instance, its onNew handler adds the new item as a Tree node. If you wanted to perform a save at that point, you plug your handler into onNewItem as well. Both handlers— from Tree and your own code—execute.  Dojo.data drivers implementing Notiﬁcation, such as ItemFileWriteStore, deﬁne the following extension points:  onNew dojo.data.Item i  onDelete dojo.data.Item i  onSet dojo.data.Item i, String attributeName, Object value, Object newValue   The signatures match their counterparts in dojo.data.Write with one exception: onSet adds the oldValue parameter. This is useful because if oldValue==newValue, it probably doesn’t need saving back to the server. Your handler must check for this condition.  Using this in our example, the onNew event runs our handler, sending the new box data back to the server through dojo.xhrPost:  Download tree writing_model_ﬁne_granularity.html  <div dojoType="dojo.data.ItemFileWriteStore"  url="datasources rma_boxes.json" jsId="boxJson">   MANIPULATING THE TREE  355     dojo.xhrPost {  url: "datasources rma_boxes.json", content: {  id: this.getValue newItem,"id" , description: this.getValue newItem,"name" , operation: "insert"  }, timeout: 1000, error: function   {  }, load: function   {  alert 'Uh oh.  The box wasn\'t saved.' ;  console.debug "new box saved" ;  }  } ;        Since we’re not dealing with server programs in this book, this example posts to a static URL. But you can watch the action in Firebug, as shown in Figure 13.5, on the following page. The server program can translate these packets into database operations.  Coarse-grained saving is similar. The dojo.data.Write API’s save routine serializes the store and posts it back to the URL, which is essentially fetch in reverse. The following code places a Save button next to the other buttons:  Download tree writing_model_coarse_granularity.html     Save       Turns JavaScript object into JSON.    respects dojo.data Type Maps var newFileContentString = boxJson._getNewFileContentString  ; dojo.xhrPost {  Like dojo.objectToJSON, but  url: "datasources rma_boxes.json",    The boxes parameter name is arbitrary content: {  boxes: newFileContentString  }, timeout: 1000, load: function   {  }, error: function   {  console.debug "all boxes saved" ;  alert 'Uh oh.  The boxes weren\'t saved.' ;  }  } ;         DRAG AND DROP  356  Figure 13.5: Clicking Add sends XHR packet  Again, the routine posts to a static URL, but you can watch the activity in Firebug.  You may be asking, “Why use the extension points? You could just as easily attach the code right to the button.” By using the extension points, you ensure the routines run no matter how the data gets in. For example, in the next section, the drag-and-drop controller will manip- ulate the data store.  When it does, it’ll use our onNew, onSet, and onDelete handlers. So, there’s no new code to write!  13.5 Drag and Drop  The last ingredient we need for the RMA app is drag-and-drop function- ality. Users will drag items from the order tree to the box tree, and the code must change the display and the data stores appropriately.  We will cover low-level drag and drop in Chapter 19, Adding Dynamic Content to an RIA, on page 505. dijit.Tree builds drag and drop right into its core, covering the low-level details and initialization so you don’t have to.  A Little Refactoring  Before continuing, notice how our app is getting a bit chunky. Some refactoring is in order. The box tree, which contains the bulk of the code, would ﬁt nicely in an object.   DRAG AND DROP  357  Since the box tree represents an RMA, we’ll name the object class dojo- book.tree.objects.rma. RMA methods would include adding, removing, and renaming a box; checking that an item can ﬁt in a box; and adding an item to a box.  Some skeleton code starts the object:  Download tree objects rma.js  dojo.provide "dojobook.tree.objects.rma" ;  dojo.require "dijit._tree.dndSelector" ; dojo.require "dojo.dnd.Manager" ;  dojo.declare "dojobook.tree.objects.rma", null, {     Data store associated with the return, will contain boxes    and serial numbers store: null,     Keep the dndSource controller for this tree. dndController: null,     Generator for unique box id's highestBoxId: 1,     For use in Delete and Rename lastBoxSelected: null,     Serial numbers already in the return allRMASerials: [ ],     Box weight limit, imposed by our shipper MAX_WEIGHT: 15,     Constructor constructor: function dataStore, inDndController  {  this.store = dataStore; this.dndController = inDndController;  },  Back in the HTML page, we declare an instance of this object:  Download tree rma.html     Object tree uses dojo.require "dojobook.tree.objects.rma" ; var rma = null;  We also create the actual object inside the tree widget.   It’s necessary to do it here because the constructor needs parameters that were created along with the tree:  DRAG AND DROP  358  Download tree rma.html  <div dojoType="dijit.Tree" id="boxes"  model="boxModel" dndController="dijit._tree.dndSource" onDndDrop="dndDrop" checkItemAcceptance="itemAccept" >       Executed when the widget is created rma = new dojobook.tree.objects.rma boxJson, this.dndController ;              rma.lastBoxSelected = item;  Then the button-backing code moves over to the object class:  Download tree objects rma.js  addBox: function   {  this.highestBoxId++; this.store.newItem {  id: this.highestBoxId, name: "Box "+this.highestBoxId, type: "box", weight:0  } ;  },  removeBox: function   {  if  !this.lastBoxSelected  !this.store.isItem this.lastBoxSelected   {  alert 'You must select a box first' ; return;  } this.store.deleteItem this.lastBoxSelected ;  renameBox: function   {  if  !this.lastBoxSelected  !this.store.isItem this.lastBoxSelected   {  alert 'You must select a box first' ; return;  } if  newName = prompt "What would you like to call it?"   {  this.store.setValue this.lastBoxSelected,"name",newName ;  },  }  }   DRAG AND DROP  359  And method calls are left in its place:  Download tree rma.html     Add Box    rma.addBox  ;           Remove Box    rma.removeBox  ;        rma.renameBox  ;           Rename Box    That’s much better. The more JavaScript code we can remove from the HTML, the clearer the user interface design will be.  _TreeNodes and Associated Objects  To operate on the tree, we need a little background on its contents. From the discussions on widgets, you’ll recall that each widget is really two objects: the widget object and the DOM node for the onscreen rep- resentation. The former responds to Dijit method calls, and the latter responds to DOM operations such as setting the style.  A Tree is a container widget, which means it’s meant to contain other widgets. In this case, the contained widgets are always of type dijit. _TreeNode. You don’t create these widgets—Tree does that for you—but you do need to access them. Because _TreeNodes are widgets, they have a backing widget instance and DOM node. But they also have a third representation: a dojo.data.Item. In MVC parlance, the dojo.data.Item is the model object, the DOM node is the view, and the _TreeNode is the controller.  The good news is there’s a one-to-one-to-one correspondence here. One _TreeNode always has exactly one associated DOM node and one asso- ciated Item. That never varies. The trouble is you may have only one of   DRAG AND DROP  360  these objects, and you need information from another object. For exam- ple, the getIconClass extension point gets the item, but not the widget or DOM node. So, conversion between these three objects is essential. Here’s a handy list of conversions:    Use treeObject._itemNodeMap[itemId] to convert from the item to the widget. _itemNodeMap maps identity values to _TreeNode objects.3    Use dijit.getEnclosingWidget to convert from the DOM node to the widget. We saw this in Chapter 12, Scripting Widgets, on page 319.    To convert from the widget to an item, use widget.item.  Combinations of these three conversions cover the other cases. For example, this method converts a DOM node to an item:  Download tree objects rma.js     Handy method for computing dojo.data item connected to a DOM node domToItem: function domNode  {  return dijit.getEnclosingWidget domNode .item;  },  Checking Drop Operations  Enabling a Tree with drag and drop requires just one property: dndcon- troller=. All of the tree items then become drag sources and drop targets. So ﬁrst, hook up the order tree:  Download tree rma.html  <div dojoType="dijit.Tree" id="ordTree"  model="ordModel" dndController="dijit._tree.dndSource" checkAcceptance="never">     In most drag-and-drop Tree cases, the bundled controller dijit._tree. dndSource works ﬁne. If you need extra functionality, you can always subclass dndSource or write your own controller.  Among other things, dndSource checks the legality of a drop. Or, more accurately, it calls our code that checks the legality of a drop. This code plugs into Tree’s checkAcceptance or checkItemAcceptance exten- sion point. The difference between the two is scope.  3. This is why identity values need to be unique in the data store, even at differing nesting levels—if they weren’t, you’d have collisions in the _itemNodeMap array.   DRAG AND DROP  361  checkAcceptance answers “Can you drop this item anywhere in this tree?” checkItemAcceptance answers “Can you drop this item on this particular tree node?” If you don’t provide a handler, the answer is assumed “yes.”  An example will clarify. The order tree should not accept any dragged objects, no matter which node the user attempts to drop it on. There- fore, we plug a function into checkAcceptance:  Download tree rma.html  <div dojoType="dijit.Tree" id="ordTree"  model="ordModel" dndController="dijit._tree.dndSource" checkAcceptance="never">     And in this case the function is trivial:  Download tree rma.html  function never   { return false; }  Nodes of the box tree, on the other hand, do accept dropped items, but not in all cases. The checkItemAcceptance extension point is more appropriate here. We need to check three rules. First, you can drop a serial number only on a box, not a root node or another serial number. Second, you cannot drop a serial number onto the box tree more than once. Third, each box must observe the 15-pound box limit.  The checkItemAcceptance extension point has the signature checkItem- Acceptance dojo.dnd.Target target, dojo.data.source[ ] sources . Tree passes over the drop target, and an array of drag sources—though our tree allows dragging only one source at a time, so we’ll need only the ﬁrst element. The Tree tag points to our checkItemAcceptance function  and the onDndDrop function, which we’ll cover in the next section :  Download tree rma.html  <div dojoType="dijit.Tree" id="boxes"  model="boxModel" dndController="dijit._tree.dndSource" onDndDrop="dndDrop" checkItemAcceptance="itemAccept" >  It would be nice if checkItemAcceptance could directly call a dojobook. tree.objects.rma method declaratively, but it’s not possible with Dojo 1.1.   DRAG AND DROP  362  So, instead, it calls a utility function in the HTML ﬁle:  Download tree rma.html     functions that actually call methods function itemAccept target, source  {  return rma.itemAccept target, source ;  function dndDrop source, nodes, copy  {  rma.boxDrop source, nodes, copy ;  }  };  And the utility function in turn calls the item acceptance method in the rma. class. This is where the rubber meets the road.  Download tree objects rma.js  itemAccept: function target, source  {     First make sure we're dropping on a box, not another serial  targetBoxItem = this.domToItem target ;     There is no item connected with the root if  ! targetBoxItem  {  return false;     Only boxes have a type attribute if  ! boxJson.hasAttribute targetBoxItem, "type"   {  return false;     Loop through all the dragged nodes.    for details on the .selection property var draggedSerials = source.selection; var draggedWeight = 0; for  thisSerial in draggedSerials  {  See the DnD chapter     If any serial number has already been moved, don't let it    be moved again. if  dojo.indexOf this.allRMASerials, thisSerial  > -1   return false;     Get the item weight, and add it to the dragged item weight var serialItem = this.domToItem draggedSerials[thisSerial] ; var thisSerialWeight = parseInt ordJson.getValue serialItem,"weight"  ; draggedWeight += thisSerialWeight;     Finally, add up all the weights and make sure they're OK if  parseInt this.store.getValue targetBoxItem,"weight"    + draggedWeight > this.MAX_WEIGHT  {  return false;  }  }  }  }   DRAG AND DROP  363     Everything is fine return true;  },  Checking the ﬁrst rule  drop only on a box  is straightforward. Even though the extension point passes a DOM node, the handy domToItem translator retrieves the data behind it. Only boxes have the type= prop- erty of that data item, so that check is quick. The second rule checks for “double dragging,” and to make this easy, a ﬂat list of all serials in the box tree resides in allRMASerials, which the drop operation manipu- lates as items are dropped. If the item has already been dropped, it’ll appear in here.  Weight checking needs to consult the order data source. The code loops through all dragged nodes, converting them to their dojo.data.Item coun- terparts. The item contains the weight, and we add that to a running total. Add this to the box weight, which is kept in the boxes’ weight property  also updated when items are dropped , and make sure it’s less than 15 pounds. If it is, the drop can proceed.  Dropping and Adding Items  The checkItemAcceptance method relies on some housekeeping oper- ations performed as items are dropped: it expects the box weight to be correct and the allRMASerials list to be up-to-date. These go into Tree’s onDndDrop extension point. The chain of events on a drop goes like this:  1. The user lets go of the mouse.  2. checkAcceptance and checkItemAcceptance are called. If they both  return true, the drop proceeds.  3. Tree updates the display and the data store.  4. Lastly, Tree calls the onDndDrop extension point. If no method is  connected there, the drop operation ends.  The signature for onDnDDrop is onDndDrop dojo.dnd.source source, dojo. dnd.source[ ] nodes, boolean copy . It’s like most other drag-and-drop ex- tension points, but it adds the copy parameter, which is set to true if the user holds down Shift while dragging.   DRAG AND DROP  364  This doesn’t matter in our app.  Download tree objects rma.js  boxDrop: function source, nodes, copy  {     The DnD controller contains the drop target  the box .    For convenience, convert this to an item var targetBoxItem = this.domToItem this.dndController.current ;     The weight is init'ed to zero and we add weight as items    are dropped into it. var currentBoxWeight = this.store.getValue targetBoxItem, "weight" ;     Handle more than 1 serial number, if needed for  var i=0;i<nodes.length;i++  {     Convert to an item var draggedItem = this.domToItem nodes[i] ;    Remember the serial number this.allRMASerials.push ordJson.getValue draggedItem,"id"  ;     Add the weight of this serial, obtaining the weight from    the order item var thisSerialWeight =  parseInt ordJson.getValue draggedItem,"weight"  ;  currentBoxWeight += thisSerialWeight;  } this.store.setValue targetBoxItem, "weight", currentBoxWeight ;     Store it back in the item store. if this.dndController.containerState == "Over" {     Stop dragging this.dndController.isDragging = false;     Create a new dropped item in the target var items = this.dndController.itemCreator   nodes, this.dndController.current   ;     Create a data store item for each dragged serial number    The tree then changes to match it. for var i = 0; i < items.length; i++ {  pInfo = {parent: targetBoxItem, attribute: "children"}; var newItem = this.store.newItem items[i], pInfo ;  }  }  },     Cancel all other event handlers this.dndController.onDndCancel  ;   DRAG AND DROP  365  Figure 13.6: The tragic return of gummy haggis  Similar to checkItemAcceptance, the drop operation loops through all dropped items, adds the weights to the current box total, and stores the serial numbers in allRMASerials. At this point, the drop operation ends, and the user can drag another item. All of these operations happen in a controlled, intuitive fashion, and to the user, it’s one ﬂuid motion. In Figure 13.6, you can see the action in progress.  Between the two source ﬁles, there are about 250 lines of source code including comments. That’s not too bad for an application with drag and drop, access to outside services, validation, and tree control!  Other JavaScript toolkits have tree widgets, but none has the clean MVC architecture of Dijit. Because dojo.data is ﬂexible and standard, reading writing hierarchical values is a breeze, no matter what the server data format is. And the tree display update is automatic. If you’ve ever tried writing data to the browser and then “screen-scraping” it back off to do calculations, you realize how important that integration is. It’s a real time-saver. In the next chapter, we’ll see another widget that inte- grates tightly with dojo.data: Grid.   Chapter 14  Grid  As we saw in Chapter 3, Connecting to Outside Services, on page 37, the Grid widget is a spreadsheet-like “supertable.” Grids are de rigueur in client-server application land, but web application land hasn’t adopted them very quickly. The technology to build them just wasn’t there: in a regular ﬁll-and-submit form, it’s impossible to make a grid that feels interactive.  But the big bang of JavaScript, Dynamic HTML, and XHR makes browser-based grids possible, and the Grid widget is the state-of-the- art. It gives client-server grids a run for their money in features, per- formance, and stability. Dojo’s Grid widget began life as TurboGrid, built independently on top of early Dojo releases by Scott Miles and Steve Orvell. In late 2007, their company, TurboAjax, was purchased by ActiveGrid, which in turn contributed TurboGrid technology to the Dojo Foundation.  Despite its inclusion in Dojox, Grid is more than just a Dojo extension. It’s a powerful display environment on its own, popular among Dojo users, and very feature-rich:    A Grid’s data elements can span multiple columns or multiple rows, just like an HTML table. And you can freeze particular col- umns while the rest of the Grid scrolls.    Rows can contain multiple subrows working together as a unit. Subrows can be selectively hidden on certain rows, making it use- ful for grouping and aggregation.    Even with thousands of rows, Grid performs well. Rows are lazy-  rendered as the user moves down the Grid.   GRID DISPLAY AND DESIGN  367  14.1 Grid Display and Design    Grid has a large assortment of extension points to hook in your own code. Many extension points act on standard DOM Level 2 events, adding Grid-speciﬁc properties to the standard event object. This makes for easier coding.    Grid supports rich data editors, some custom-made for Grid and  some based on existing Dijit form controls.    Grid works with all bundled dojo.data drivers. Data synchroniza- tion is built in: changing the data changes the display, and vice versa.  That’s a lot of functionality, and it’s accessible through the Dojo idioms you’ve come to know and love.  Let’s brieﬂy review what we learned in Chapter 3. A Grid is fed data through a model, which in all our examples will be a dojo.data data source.1 The Grid widget looks like a table with one row, and you use   tags to deﬁne columns, their widths, and the attributes that pro- vide them with data.  Data-wise, Grid is similar to its data-enabled brethren widgets Tree, Fil- teringSelect, and ComboBox. The store= attribute connects the Grid to its store. The query= and queryOptions= attributes deﬁne which items ini- tially feed the Grid. You can also specify an initial sort order, but unlike the other data-enabled widgets that use the sort= property, in Grid the property is sortFields=. The sort criteria format is the same.  Now, onward to bigger and better Grids. In this chapter, we’ll follow the evolution of a Grid-based ice cream rating system.  Life is too short to waste on mediocre ice cream!  The user will get a prepopulated Grid of ice cream ﬂavors, calorie and fat information, and ingredient sum- maries. They can then add their own ratings.  Every Grid begins with data. Our data store is in the familiar JSON format using the ItemFileReadStore data driver.  1. You can also use straight two-dimensional arrays as models. This was the only way to feed data to the Grid in the days before dojo.data. Its use has been deprecated, so these days data store and model are fairly synonymous. But a thin model class remains tied to Grid, and the term model lives on in Grid’s properties, attributes, and method names.   GRID DISPLAY AND DESIGN  368  The items, one per ice cream ﬂavor, look like this:  Download grid datastores ice_cream.json  {  identifier: "name", label: "name", items: [  { name: "banana split",baseFlavor:"banana",  mixins:"fudge, strawberries, cherries", calories:280,fat:16 ,source:1,rating:3 },  { name: "black raspberry chip",  baseFlavor:"black raspberry and vanilla", mixins:"chocolate chips", calories:280,fat:18 ,source:1,rating:3 },    Lots more...  It looks simple enough to put into a Grid:  Download grid grid_1_subrow.html  <span dojoType="dojo.data.ItemFileReadStore"  jsId="icStore" url="datastores ice_cream.json">     <table id="grid" dojoType="dojox.grid.Grid"  store="icStore" clientSort="true" style="width: 35em; height: 15em;">   Flavor   Base Flavor   Calories   Fat   Mixins                Note: One nice shortcut comes courtesy of Grid. Every data-enabled widget uses a dojo.data query to do the ﬁrst fetch. With FilteringSelect and Tree, you placed that query in the tag. You can with Grid too, but if you don’t specify the query, it uses the default: { name: ’*’ }. Since the identiﬁer in our data store is called name and we want Grid to list all items, the default is perfect, and we don’t need to specify our own query. Many Dojo programmers use this convention when designing data stores for Grid.  But the results are not quite what we wanted, as shown in Figure 14.1, on the next page. The word wrapping in the larger columns mixins and ﬂavor cause a lot of whitespace in the others. And when you try to ﬁx   GRID DISPLAY AND DESIGN  369  Figure 14.1: Columns are unbalanced  the column sizes, the results don’t look right. You’re trying to ﬁt too much text in one line.  Besides adding width to a Grid, you can give the data some breathing room using either subrows or views. Let’s take up subrows ﬁrst.  Subrows  A subrow is simply a horizontal subdivision of a row onto different physical lines. Each row is like a   tag. In fact, the declarative ver- sion of Grid uses   tags to group   tags into subrows. We’ve been using subrows all along, but only one of them per row.  Since the mixins column is the largest, we’ll put it on its own subrow like this:  Download grid grid_2_subrows.html   Flavor   Base Flavor   Calories   Fat               Mixins   Notice the   tags need no changes except the mixins ﬁeld’s colspan= attribute. Just like in HTML, colspan="4" means the ﬁeld will span the four columns deﬁned above it.   GRID DISPLAY AND DESIGN  370  Figure 14.2: Grid with rows split into two subrows  As you can see in Figure 14.2, the subrows stay together as a group. All of a row’s subrows share the same odd or even coloring. And when you click one data element, all the subrows are selected as a group.  Subrows are not only good for design but also for grouping and aggre- gating, which come up later in this chapter. But ﬁrst, an alternative to subrows called views can also give your data more breathing room.  Views  Looking vertically, subrows make up rows, and rows make up a Grid. Horizontally, columns make up views, and views make up a Grid. A view is a set of contiguous columns. One view can scroll independently of other views horizontally but will always scroll vertically in lockstep with other views. In other words, a row spans all the Grid views, and its subrows always stay together.  In Figure 14.3, on the next page, you can see our data with one subrow per row and two views. The left view holds just the ice cream ﬂavor name, while the right view holds the remaining ﬁelds. The scroll bar on the right view’s bottom border moves the columns left and right, while the other view stays ﬁxed.  You could have the left view scroll left and right too, but it’s not very interesting with one column.  This conveniently leaves the ice cream name in place while you browse the other view’s ﬁelds. The right scroll bar moves both views up and down in lockstep so that “banana split” is always on the same line as its mixins “fudge, strawberries, cherries.”  To split columns into views, you use the HTML-standard  though not very popular    tag. Its HTML use is to apply attributes to several contiguous columns. In Grid, each   deﬁnes one view.   GRID DISPLAY AND DESIGN  371  Figure 14.3: Multiple views  Through its span= attribute,   gets the number of columns to put in the view. Additionally, the Grid-speciﬁc noscroll= attribute removes the scroll bars on the bottom and right sides of the view. This code implements the Grid in Figure 14.3:  Download grid grid_2_views.html  <span dojoType="dojo.data.ItemFileReadStore"  jsId="icStore" url="datastores ice_cream.json">     <table id="grid" dojoType="dojox.grid.Grid"  store="icStore" clientSort="true" style="width: 35em; height: 15em;">             width="15em">Flavor   <th field="name" <th field="baseFlavor"  Calories   Fat   Mixins   width="10em">Base Flavor           If a   tag leaves out the span= attribute, it’s assumed span="1".   PROGRAMMATIC STRUCTURES  372  So in the example, the ﬁrst view gets the ﬁrst row and removes the scroll bar. The second view picks up the remaining four columns.  Remember, rows span views. And views do not change that each row is fed by one dojo.data item. In other words, you cannot feed one view from a data source and another view from a different one.  14.2 Programmatic Structures  Like all widgets, you can create a Grid programmatically. But you can also create just the structure of the Grid programmatically. A structure is the set of cell and view deﬁnitions making up a Grid. In other words, it’s the Grid minus the model. Although we don’t use the term struc- ture with declarative Grids, you can think of a structure as the set of  ,  , and   inside the   tag.  Grid Structure Deﬁnitions in JavaScript  As a structure gets more complex, it makes more sense to move it to JavaScript. For one thing, it keeps the HTML smaller and more manage- able. It allows you to reuse the Grid structure in many different pages. Most important, a programmatic structure has extension points where declarative tags don’t. Keeping the Grid tag declarative and moving the structure to JavaScript is a nice compromise between ease and ﬂexibil- ity. The general form of a Grid structure looks like this:  var s = [     A structure is an array of views  {    A view is an array of cells  cells: [  {  name: '«Column Display Name»', field: '«Field in Datastore»', «other properties»  }, «more cells»  ]  }, «more views»  ];  You then pass it to the Grid’s structure= property. The Grid no longer needs  ,  , or   tags, and the dojoType="dojox.grid.Grid" attribute can go in a   instead of a  .  To see this in action, we’ll go back to our basic ice cream–fueled Grid. We’ve seen how to use both subrows and views to get more space, but subrows seem to look better, so we’ll go that route.   PROGRAMMATIC STRUCTURES  373  So, here’s the result:  Download grid grid_deﬁnitions programmatic.js  Line 1  dojo.provide "dojobook.grid.grid_definitions.programmatic" ;  dojobook.grid.grid_definitions.programmatic.structure = [  {name: 'Flavor', field:"name", width:'10em'}, {name: 'Base Flavor', field:"baseFlavor"}, {name: 'Calories', field:"calories"}, {name: 'Fat', field:'fat'}  {name: 'Add-Ins', field:"mixins",  width:'15em', colSpan:4}  10  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  15  20   function   {  {  cells: [  [  ], [  ]  ]  }  ] }   ;  The indentation clariﬁes the element nesting. Reading from the inner- most to the outermost, the hash in line 8 deﬁnes a cell. Probably a more apt name for a cell is a column deﬁnition, since it deﬁnes one col- umn’s properties: the column heading, the associated ﬁeld, and so on. Spreadsheets use cell to mean an actual data element—the intersection of a row and a column. But here, we’ll follow Dojo Grid terminology.  The cell property names match the attribute names you use in  . The column name you’d normally put in  ’s body goes in the prop- erty name. Subrows in lines 7 and 13 are arrays of cells, just like a  . Subrows are kept in the cells array, which functions like  . View deﬁnitions normally kept in   are now hashes with the cells property, as in line 6. A structure, the outermost array, functions like a   tag. For the most part, a programmatic structure is the declarative structure with { ... } and [ ... ] substituted for tags.  Finally, you pass the structure into the Grid tag’s structure= attribute.  Download grid grid_programmatic_structure.html  <div id="grid" dojoType="dojox.grid.Grid"  jsId="icGrid" store="icStore" clientSort="true" style="width: 35em; height: 15em;" structure="dojobook.grid.grid_definitions.programmatic.structure">     PROGRAMMATIC STRUCTURES  374  The result is a modularized Grid, with more maintainable code. And now more options are open to us, like extension points and row bars.  Row Bars  Programmatic structures allow a special view called a row bar, used for row selection. You may already have noticed that clicking a data ele- ment highlights its entire row. This works in read-only data elements, as ours have been. But once you enable editing, as we will in Sec- tion 14.4, Cell Editing, on page 385, clicking will start up the cell editor. How does a user select rows under these conditions?  A row bar contains no data but lives only for users to click and select rows. You can see it on the left in Figure 14.4, on the following page.2 Clicking the row bar selects an entire row, and you can select multi- ple noncontiguous rows with Ctrl +click and multiple contiguous rows with Shift +click.  This deﬁnition adds the row bar, which is always of type dojox.grid. GridView. Note this view has no subrows and no cells. Its noscroll prop- erty prevents an unnecessary scroll bar on the right  row bars never have a bottom scroll bar .  Download grid grid_deﬁnitions rowbar.js  dojo.provide "dojobook.grid.grid_definitions.rowbar" ;   function   {  dojobook.grid.grid_definitions.rowbar.structure = [  type: dojox.grid.GridView, width:"20px", noscroll:true  {    View 1: rowbar  }, {    View 2: data  cells: [  [  {name: 'Flavor', width:'10em', field:"name"}, {name: 'Base Flavor', width:'7em',  field:"baseFlavor"},  {name: 'Calories', width:'5em',  field:"calories"},  {name: 'Fat', width:'5em', field:'fat'}  ]    Other subrow removed for this example only  ]  }  ];  }   ;  2. For some reason, the row bar appears on the right in Internet Explorer 6. This bug   EXTENSION POINTS  375  Figure 14.4: A row bar allows easier row selection.  14.3 Extension Points  As has been a constant theme throughout the book, extension points allow JavaScript-based handlers to add or change widget behavior. In a Grid, extension points exist at the cell, view, and Grid levels.  Cell-Level Extension Points: Derived Values with get  The cell provides a very useful extension point: get. You are already familiar with one way a cell gets data: from a dojo.data data store ﬁeld, speciﬁed in the ﬁeld property. There are two other ways:    The value= property, which populates a constant value to each cell  in a column  late the data element    The get= extension point, where you may plug a handler to calcu-  get= makes derived cells possible. Derived cells are so named because they derive their values from other data. You can add, subtract, and concatenate ﬁelds together to create a new value this way. And although it’s true you can do this on the server and send the results down, using get saves the bandwidth of doing so.  As an example, the handler on the next page calculates the total calo- ries per fat gram of a particular ice cream ﬂavor.  should be cleared up in a later release.   EXTENSION POINTS  376  Download grid grid_deﬁnitions derived.js  Line 1  dojo.provide "dojobook.grid.grid_definitions.derived" ;   function   {  var gd=dojobook.grid.grid_definitions.derived;  gd.getCaloriesPerFatGram = function inRowIndex  {     This is standard for many grid handlers if  !icGrid  { return; }  var currentRow = icGrid.model.getRow inRowIndex ; if  ! currentRow      Skip header rows  return;  return currentRow.calories   currentRow.fat;  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  15  }; }   ;  The code in line 8 will appear often in our examples, so it’s worth pick- ing it apart. In our main HTML, we will include the class like this:  Download grid grid_derived.html  dojo.registerModulePath "dojobook",".. .. dojobook" ; dojo.require "dojox.grid.Grid" ; dojo.require "dojo.data.ItemFileReadStore" ; dojo.require "dojobook.grid.grid_definitions.derived" ; icGrid = null;  Eventually the Grid widget will be placed in the icGrid, but we initialize it to null to prevent reference errors. The parser creates the Grid widget before it can be assigned to variable named in jsId. In our case, jsId is icGrid. But get is called while the widget is being created and icGrid has not been ﬁlled yet. Although there are clever tricks to get a Grid reference in its half-ﬁnished state, luckily you don’t have to resort to them. Grid makes a preliminary pass over the rows, then instantiates the object icGrid, and then makes another pass. With icGrid properly initialized, the second pass’s calls to get work ﬁne.  Line 10 is another common idiom. The goal is to get the data in the cur- rent row. You start from icGrid, the Grid widget. icGrid.model designates the entire Grid model, in other words, all the data. A model’s getRow function returns a hash whose properties match the data store item. Since getCaloriesPerFatGram is also called on the column header where there is no associated item, getRow returns null in this case, and the function returns without a value. Otherwise, it returns the calculation, which is then displayed.   EXTENSION POINTS  377  With the function written, you plug it into the get property:  Download grid grid_deﬁnitions derived.js  [  }  {name: 'Mixins', field:"mixins",colSpan:3}, {name: 'Cal   Fat g',  get: gd.getCaloriesPerFatGram  Everything is hunky-dory. With this technique, you can derive all kinds of formulas on the ﬂy. And as we see in the next section, that includes formulas running across multiple rows.  Aggregate Functions and the onBeforeRow Extension Point  An aggregate function is a derived value function calculated over a set of rows. Summing, averaging, or ﬁnding the maximum value are popular examples. The challenge with aggregates isn’t computing them prop- erly. The function itself is easy. Displaying the aggregates in the right places requires a few tricks.  Suppose you want to average the calorie count over base ﬂavors. Are chocolate-based ice creams more fattening than vanilla-based? Here’s your chance to ﬁnd out. Your ﬁrst thought might be, “Just sort the data by base ﬂavor, deﬁne another row type for subtotals, and stick those in between the regular rows.” The trouble is you can’t just invent row types and stick them in willy-nilly.  So, how do you pull it off? It turns out you can easily hide subrows at will. So if you deﬁne a subrow holding the cumulative totals for each row and then hide the subrows that are not on group boundaries, you end up with the grid you want.  Let’s take those tasks one at a time. First, you’ll insert the subrows with cumulative averages. A cumulative average means “What is the average calories for base ﬂavor X that we have seen so far?”  Grouping by base ﬂavor makes sense only when the rows are sorted by base ﬂavor. That’s easy in the Grid tag:  Download grid grid_subtotals.html  <div id="grid" dojoType="dojox.grid.Grid" jsId="icGrid"  store="icStore"  sortFields='[ {attribute: "baseFlavor"} ]'  clientSort="false" style="width: 35em; height: 15em;"  structure="dojobook.grid.grid_definitions.subtotals.structure" >      EXTENSION POINTS  378  Averages require a cumulative sum and an item count, and that’s where the view’s onBeforeRow extension point comes in. The handler you pro- vide is called once for each row before anything is drawn. The signature is as follows:  onBeforeRow Integer inRowIndex, Hash[] inSubrows    inRowIndex is the current row number, just like in get. The inSubrows array will be important in a bit. For now, we provide our own handler to do the averages. Note that the subtotaling row is the ﬁrst subrow. That’s necessary because you don’t know that whether you’ve hit a group boundary until the group changes. So if rows 6 and 7 contain cotton candy and row 8 contains custard, then:    Row 6’s ﬁrst subrow will average the group before cotton candy.    Row 7’s ﬁrst subrow will average the cotton candy group so far,  which is just one element in row 6.    Row 8’s ﬁrst subrow will again average the cotton candy group so  far: rows 6 and 7.  row 8.    Row 9’s ﬁrst subrow will begin averaging the custard group so far:  Having the plan spelled out, here’s the code:  Download grid grid_deﬁnitions subtotals.js  dojo.provide "dojobook.grid.grid_definitions.subtotals" ;   function   {  var gs=dojobook.grid.grid_definitions.subtotals;     Here are our running totals gs.baseFlavorAveraged = null; gs.currentBaseFlavor = null; gs.flavorTotalCal = 0; gs.flavorGroupCount = 1;  gs.runningAverage = function inDataIndex, inSubrows  {  if  !icGrid  { return; }  var currentRow = icGrid.model.getRow inDataIndex ; if  ! currentRow  {    Return on header row  return;  }     Calculate stats for the group to this point gs.flavorAvg = gs.flavorTotalCal   gs.flavorGroupCount; gs.baseFlavorAveraged = gs.currentBaseFlavor;   EXTENSION POINTS  379     If we're not on a new base flavor, increment the counts if  gs.flavorGroupCount==0       gs.currentBaseFlavor == currentRow.baseFlavor  {  gs.flavorGroupCount++; gs.flavorTotalCal += currentRow.calories;  } else {     Reset stats gs.flavorTotalCal = currentRow.calories; gs.flavorGroupCount = 1; gs.currentBaseFlavor = currentRow.baseFlavor;  }  };  cells: [  [  ], [  The ﬁrst few lines of runningAverage look just like a get handler. The last few do the actual averaging and resetting the totals.  onBeforeRow is a view extension point, so it belongs in the view deﬁni- tion. The cells deﬁne two get handlers that merely return the current running average and group name computed by runningAverage:  Download grid grid_deﬁnitions subtotals.js     View 2: The data {  onBeforeRow: gs.runningAverage,  { name: 'N A', width:'10em', value:' Avg for  '}, { name: 'N A', width:'7em',  get: function   { return gs.baseFlavorAveraged;  } },  { name: 'N A', width:'5em',  get: function   { return gs.flavorAvg;  } },  { name: 'N A', width:'5em', value:'' }  {name: 'Flavor', width:'10em', field:"name" },  Note that when doing subtotals like this, it’s best to specify all the col- umn widths outright. In Figure 14.5, on the next page, you can see the results so far, with averages printing on each subrow.  That’s looking good so far. Now we just need to hide the averages in between group boundaries. You can do this through the inSubRows array passed to the onBeforeRow handler. inSubRows closely mirrors the cell deﬁnitions for this view. So, inSubRows[0] will contain the averages sub- row, and inSubRows[1] contains the data subrow. Then you just set the subrow’s hidden to true to hide the subrow.   EXTENSION POINTS  380  Figure 14.5: Averaging calories per base ﬂavor, printed every row  So as we loop through rows, it’s a matter of setting inSubRows[0].hidden to false. Here’s the doctored-up runningAverage with the code inserted in lines 4 and 23:  Download grid grid_deﬁnitions subtotals.js  Line 1  gs.runningAverage = function inDataIndex, inSubrows  {  if  !icGrid  { return; }    Turn off the subrow initially, making rendering a bit faster. inSubrows[0].hidden = true;  5  10  15  25  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  var currentRow = icGrid.model.getRow inDataIndex ; if  ! currentRow  {    Return on header row  return;  }     Calculate stats for the group to this point gs.flavorAvg = gs.flavorTotalCal   gs.flavorGroupCount; gs.baseFlavorAveraged = gs.currentBaseFlavor;     If we're not on a new base flavor, increment the counts if  gs.flavorGroupCount==0      gs.currentBaseFlavor == currentRow.baseFlavor  {  gs.flavorGroupCount++; gs.flavorTotalCal += currentRow.calories;  20  } else {     Unhide the row, except for the very first one     which totals nothing  if  gs.currentBaseFlavor   inSubrows[0].hidden = false;     Reset stats gs.flavorTotalCal = currentRow.calories; gs.flavorGroupCount = 1; gs.currentBaseFlavor = currentRow.baseFlavor;  30  }  };   EXTENSION POINTS  381  Now the Grid, shown in Figure 14.6, on the following page, looks just right.  Grouping and aggregate computation is tremendously useful. Besides doing averages and such, onBeforeRow can selectively expand and col- lapse groups by setting the hidden property on or off accordingly. You can tie these expando buttons at each group boundary. This helps users scan a smaller list and then drill down into the groups they want.  Row Selection  Working our way up from cell-level extension points like get to view- level extension points like onBeforeRow, we arrive at Grid-level exten- sion points. Two of these, onSelect and onDeselect, act at the Grid level because a row may span multiple views. Recall that users can select rows one of two ways: by clicking a read-only cell or by clicking a row bar  provided you added one . onSelect helps implement the popular spreadsheet edit cycle: select your rows and then do something to them.  You will put onSelect to use in an ice cream calorie counter. The user selects their favorite ﬂavors, and a combined calorie count appears at the bottom of the screen.  The approach is to start the counter at zero, then add calories when a user selects a row, and subtract calories when a user deselects a row. Like our other extension points, onSelect and onDeselect get passed a rowIndex for the row selected or deselected. But unlike our other exten- sion points, the handlers will be placed on the HTML side where the Grid widget lives. In our case, we put as little code in the HTML as possible, delegating the addition task to a JavaScript method:  Download grid grid_actions.html  <div id="grid" dojoType="dojox.grid.Grid"  jsId="icGrid" store="icStore" clientSort="false" style="width: 35em; height: 15em;" structure="dojobook.grid.grid_definitions.actions.structure">    dojobook.grid.grid_definitions.actions.updateCalories inRowIndex, +1 ;       dojobook.grid.grid_definitions.actions.updateCalories inRowIndex, -1 ;         You have selected  no  calories so far.    EXTENSION POINTS  382  Figure 14.6: With subrow hiding, averages appear only where they should.  The addition function, then, is fairly straightforward:  Download grid grid_deﬁnitions actions.js  dojo.provide "dojobook.grid.grid_definitions.actions" ;   function   {  var ga=dojobook.grid.grid_definitions.actions;  ga.numberCalories = 0;  ga.updateCalories = function rowIndex, direction  {  var gridRow = icGrid.model.getRow rowIndex ; ga.numberCalories += direction * gridRow.calories; dojo.byId "numberCalories" .innerHTML = ga.numberCalories;  }; }   ;  The result is shown in Figure 14.7, on the next page. Note that unlike our other handlers, we don’t have to check for icGrid’s deﬁnition. Since these extension points are always called on user input, which can’t happen until everything has been initialized, icGrid is always populated.  Mouse and Keyboard Events  For ﬁner control, Grid deﬁnes extension points for many of the com- mon DOM mouse and keyboard events  Chapter 6, Asynchronous Pro- gramming, on page 101, gives the full scoop on Dojo events . They pass an event object to the handler, just like the general DOM extension points do.  So, why would you want to use them? First, they’re more granular. You can catch a MouseOver event at the cell level using the onCellMouseOver extension point, at the Row level with the onRowMouseOver extension point, or at the Grid level with the onMouseOver extension point. The   EXTENSION POINTS  383  Figure 14.7: Row selection and dynamic update  MouseOver event bubbles to the top, executing onCellMouseOver ﬁrst, then onRowMouseOver, and then onMouseOver. You can place your code at the level that makes most sense.  Second, Grid decorates the event object with Grid-speciﬁc information. So if you write the handler for onMouseOver evt , evt will have the fol- lowing properties besides the normal target, and so forth:    evt.grid is the underlying Grid.   evt.rowIndex is the row number in the Grid.   evt.cell is the cell information with ﬁeld name and styles.  That saves you from having to translate target’s coordinates into a usable location. evt.grid.model.getRow evt.rowIndex  gives you all the data used in that row, from which you can derive information to display or use.  Here are all the extension points available. There are ﬁve variations of each handler: plain  which applies to the entire Grid , Row, Header, Cell, or HeaderCell:  on [Header  HeaderCell  Cell  Row]MouseOver Event evt  on [Header  HeaderCell  Cell  Row]MouseDown Event evt  on [Header  HeaderCell  Cell  Row]MouseOut Event evt  on [Header  HeaderCell  Cell  Row]Click Event evt  on [Header  HeaderCell  Cell  Row]DoubleClick Event evt  on [Header  HeaderCell  Cell  Row]ContextMenu Event evt  on [Header  HeaderCell  Cell  Row]Focus Event evt   As a small example, here’s another space-saving alternative for the Grid. Instead of placing the Mixins ﬁeld on the Grid, have the user click the ﬂavor name. The mixins will pop up in a Toaster off to the left.   EXTENSION POINTS  384  First, place the Toaster widget and onCellClick extension point handler in the Grid:  Download grid grid_mouse_events.html  <div id="grid" dojoType="dojox.grid.Grid"  jsId="icGrid" store="icStore" clientSort="false" style="width: 35em; height: 15em;" structure="dojobook.grid.grid_definitions.mouse_events.structure">    dojobook.grid.grid_definitions.mouse_events.showMixins evt ;        <div dojoType="dojox.widget.Toaster" duration="1000"  messageTopic="toasterInfo" positionDirection="tr-left"  >  Then, the handler can interpret the location of the click, relative to the Grid. In order to make sure the user is in the right column, it checks evt.cell.name to make sure we’re in the correct column. Finally, you can use the Grid and rowIndex to look up the actual data in the customary fashion:  Download grid grid_deﬁnitions mouse_events.js  dojo.provide "dojobook.grid.grid_definitions.mouse_events" ;   function   {  var gme=dojobook.grid.grid_definitions.mouse_events;  gme.showMixins = function evt  {     Only display when clicking a flavor if  evt.cell.name != 'Flavor'   return;  var gridRow = icGrid.model.getRow evt.rowIndex ; dojo.publish "toasterInfo",["Contains "+gridRow.mixins] ;  };  In this section, we sampled the most popular extension points at all lev- els of the Grid. There are more listed in the API guide at http:  dojotoolkit. org. They permit almost limitless freedom in bending the Grid to match your needs.   14.4 Cell Editing  CELL EDITING  385  Just as trees allow you to add, edit, or remove nodes, Grid allows on- the-ﬂy data changes. Cell editing requires the data driver to imple- ment dojo.data.Write and dojo.data.Notiﬁcation. The edits come from two sources:  User-initiated edits By attaching an editor property to a cell, you make it user-editable. Users can double-click the cell;3 change its data; and then Tab , Enter , or click out of the cell to save changes. Pressing Esc cancels the edit. Grid writes the new value back to the data store and ﬁres a dojo.data.Notiﬁcation event.  JavaScript-initiated edits You can call the dojo.data.Write methods to add, remove, or edit data store rows. Grid picks up these changes via dojo.data.Notiﬁcation and writes them to the browser.  We won’t have much to say here about JavaScript-initiated edits since the dojo.data.Write was covered in Chapter 13, Tree, on page 341. But there’s much to say about user-initiated edits.  Using Cell Editors  Making a cell user-editable requires ﬁlling in its editor property with a Dojo class. You choose an editor based on the type of data and its ease of use for the data set. Some are simply Grid-compatible versions of Dijit form controls. The others were built especially for Grid and are called native cell editors. Grid bundles the following:    dojox.grid.editors.Input  Native : A garden-variety textbox. Its prop- erty keyFilter is a regular expression you can ﬁll in to disallow cer- tain key presses in the box.    dojox.grid.editors.Bool  Native : A garden-variety checkbox. Unlike all other cell editors, this one does not require double-clicking to invoke. You can click the checkbox on or off at any time.    dojox.grid.editors.Select  Native : A garden-variety  . This ac- cepts the properties options and values, two identically sized arrays holding the visible and passed-back values.    dojox.grid.editors.ComboBox  Dijit : Like Select, but ignores the values  array and can accept entries not in the options array.  3. Or you can single-click if the singleClickEdit= is set to true in the Grid tag.   CELL EDITING  386    dojox.grid.editors.DateTextBox  Dijit : Accepts dates with a drop-down  calendar.    dojox.grid.editors.Editor  Dijit : Rich text editor.    dojox.grid.editors.Dijit  Dijit : Uses the property editorClass to specify an arbitrary Dijit form control as an editor. If a constraint property is used  as in validation boxes , this is passed to the form control as a constraint.  Onscreen, you cannot tell the Dijit and native cell editors apart. But programmatically it’s important to know the difference.  Dijit cell editors accept any properties that the corresponding Dijit con- trol accepts. You place these properties in a hash and then place the hash in the editorProps cell property. We’ll cover the details more fully in Chapter 15, Form Controls, on page 394. On the other hand, native cell editors have their own properties, which you use directly by name in the cell properties.  First we’ll look at a Dijit cell editor. Ratings will be a number from 1 to 5, and we want to make sure only those legal values are used. Here’s the cell deﬁnition:  Download grid grid_deﬁnitions editors.js  { name: 'Rating', field:"rating",  editor: dojox.grid.editors.Dijit, editorClass: "dijit.form.NumberTextBox", constraint: {min:1, max:5}, editorProps: {required:true}  },  The editor property signals that the cell is editable. editorClass is set to the class of the form widget, in this case dijit.form.NumberTextBox, which ensures only numbers go in the box. We’ll learn about the details in Section 15.4, Numbers, on page 412, but for now the constraint prop- erty sets the upper and lower bounds. The required property is familiar. We saw it back in Section 2.5, Improved Form Controls, on page 31 to require an entry in a ﬁeld. By placing it in editorProps, it gets passed to the NumberTextBox as well.  Next, we’ll look at a native cell editor. dojox.grid.editors.Select requires options to be passed in one or two arrays: a required options array and an optional value array.   CELL EDITING  387  Download grid grid_deﬁnitions editors.js  { name: 'Source', field:'source',  editor: dojox.grid.editors.Select, options: ['Restaurant', 'Qwik-E Mart', 'Wegmans' ], values: [ 1, 2, 3 ], formatter: function inDatum  {  return this.options[inDatum - 1];  }  }  This code sets up the element  . The result looks like Fig- ure 14.8, on the next page.  Cell editing is an addictive feature. Once users get used to it, they don’t want to go back to the view-page edit-page view-page cycle of page refreshes. A spot change is quick and easy.  Cell Formatters: The format Extension Point  Hmmmmmm. What is that formatter property? It turns out Select needs a little help in displaying its data value. For example, if the source is 1, we want the value Restaurant displayed onscreen. Without some help, Grid will display 1. It will edit and save OK, though—the Select still shows the Restaurant choice, and if the user picks Wegmans, 3 is sent back to the data store. But now the display will say 3.  To ﬁx this, you provide a handler for formatter that translates the num- ber to a displayed value. This handler, unlike most other Grid extension points, receives only the raw data. No rowIndex- or Grid-speciﬁc context is sent.  In our case, we simply take the data value and use it as an index back into the options array  less 1, since the array is 0 based . For more sophisticated Selects, you may need to loop through all the value ele- ments and then pick the corresponding entry from options.  The formatter extension point isn’t just for Select. It’s also handy for formatting currency, displaying tooltips, or truncating long values to ﬁt in a column.  Data Synchronization  Cell editors all write changed values back to the data store. To prove this to yourself, you can hook into the onSet extension point provided by your driver’s dojo.data.Notiﬁcation feature.   CELL EDITING  388  Figure 14.8: Entering ratings outside the range yields an error.  Here’s a handler for our example:  Download grid grid_editors.html  <span dojoType="dojo.data.ItemFileWriteStore"  jsId="icStore" url="datastores ice_cream.json"> <script type="dojo connect" event="onSet"  args="item,attribute,oldValue,newValue">  console.debug attribute+" changed from "+oldValue+" to "+newValue ;        Now when you make an editing change, the console will display the corresponding item and the details.  Although editing changes are written to the in-memory copy of the data store, they are not automatically written back to the server. To do that, you need to write your own code for the onSet, onDelete, and onNew extension points. We covered this in Section 13.4, Saving the Tree Back to the Server, on page 354.  For convenience, Grid also deﬁnes the extension points. . .  onStartEdit Hash inCell, Integer inRowIndex  onApplyCellEdit Object inValue, Hash inCell, Integer inRowIndex  onCancelEdit Integer inRowIndex   which allow you to weave in custom code before the editing begins and after it ends. All of these are more Grid-centric than dojo.data-centric, passing the row index rather than an item. These are still good for doing display updates or UI work before the Notiﬁcation extension points ﬁre.   14.5 Grid Manipulation  GRID MANIPULATION  389  As grids get larger, they become harder to scan for information. Two ways for dealing with that are sorting and ﬁltering. Sorting comes built- in to Grid, but you can add some hints to make it more useful. Filtering needs to be built from scratch, but we’ll show you how to do it.  Sorting  Sorting happens automagically in Grid. The user clicks a Grid column, and the rows sort accordingly. If the ﬁeld contents are numbers, the sort is numerical, and if they are strings, it is alphabetical. Pretty straightforward.  There are two instances where you might need to change this behav- ior. The ﬁrst is multikey sorts. In our example, clicking the Base Fla- vor column sorts ﬁne, but the names within each group appear in no particular order. It’d be nice to sort each group by name as well. The second instance is where your sort criteria don’t appear in the selected column. For example, suppose you display employees in a company by ranking so that the CEO appears at the top. But the rankings are kept in another data store ﬁeld that is not displayed on the Grid. Since the default sort lists all employees in alpha order, you need some way to substitute the ranking as the sort column.  You can do either by replacing the Grid model’s sort method. It’s not as difﬁcult as it sounds. sort is passed a column index—that is, the index of the clicked cell within the model  ﬁelds are assigned numbers in the same order they appear in the ﬁrst record of your data source . Your sort routine will transform this into dojo.data sort criteria, as in [ {attribute:’baseFlavor’} ]; place it in the sortFields property; and redisplay the Grid. The dojo.data driver does the heavy lifting.  To change the baseFlavor column sorting behavior, you replace the sort routine like this:  Download grid grid_sorting.html  Line 1  <div id="grid" dojoType="dojox.grid.Grid"  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  jsId="icGrid" store="icStore" clientSort="true" style="width: 35em; height: 15em;" structure="dojobook.grid.grid_definitions.sorting.structure">    this.model.sort = function colIndex  {  var col = Math.abs colIndex  - 1;   GRID MANIPULATION  390  var colNameToSort = this.fields.values[col].name; var sortDescending =  colIndex > 0 ; if  colNameToSort == 'baseFlavor'  {  this.sortFields = [  {attribute: 'baseFlavor', descending: sortDescending}, {attribute: 'name', descending: sortDescending}  this.sortFields = [  {'attribute': colNameToSort, 'descending': sortDescending}  } else {  ];  ];  }  10  15  20  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  this.refresh  ;  }  25        Normally you replace methods by subclassing. In our case, it’s eas- ier just to replace the method for one JavaScript instance. In line 8, we replace the model’s sort routine wholesale. When you click a col- umn name, this sort routine will be called in lieu of the prototype. This method is sent a column index as a positive number if the sort is ascending and as a negative number if the sort is descending. Line 10 converts this to an attribute name. Then you simply replace the sort- Fields property with the right criteria. For base ﬂavor sorts, our routine substitutes the multikey criteria at line 13. All other sorts go through unchanged. Finally, line 23 refreshes the model data, causing a refetch with the new sort criteria.  Filtering  Like sorting, ﬁltering makes it easier to ﬁnd interesting data in a large Grid. Popular in spreadsheet programs, a ﬁlter is a drop-down with a particular column’s values in sorted order. Choosing an option ﬁlters the Grid down to just the rows whose value ﬁts the ﬁlter. Usually you have one ﬁlter for each “interesting” column—that is, every column that has more than a few values, but not too many.  The identiﬁer is not a good candidate for ﬁltering.   Grid does not have a native ﬁltering mechanism, but you can bolt one on. Our job here will be adding a base ﬂavor ﬁlter to our own grid. It’ll look something like Figure 14.9, on the next page when ﬁnished.   GRID MANIPULATION  391  Figure 14.9: Filtering a Grid by base ﬂavor  The Grid itself remains unchanged, but we add a placeholder for the   above the grid:  Download grid grid_ﬁlters.html  Show Only:   [No Filter]    <div id="grid" dojoType="dojox.grid.Grid"  store="icStore" clientSort="true" jsId="icGrid" structure="dojobook.grid.grid_definitions.filters.structure">   The most challenging part is ﬁlling the box with ﬁlter values. Here, you can take advantage of the data store that the Grid uses, since you are dipping from the same data pool.  loadFilter fetches all the items from the Grid’s data store.  For a refresher course on fetch, see Section 10.4, fetch and Pagination, on page 275.  This routine and the actual Grid may be fetching at the same time. dojo.data drivers are usually smart enough to consolidate these re- quests, thus eliminating an unnecessary trip to the server. As you read in values, you store them in a hash. This gets rid of duplicates. At the end, you simply read and sort the values, constructing an   tag for each.   GRID MANIPULATION  392  Download grid grid_deﬁnitions ﬁlters.js  dojobook.grid.grid_definitions.filters.loadFilter = function   {     Store our filter values in a sorted set to automatically take    care of duplicates var filterHash = {};    The store is already set, so do a fetch on it  icStore.fetch {  query: { name: "*" }, onItem: function theItem  {     Fires on each item.    to true on seeing a vanilla baseFlavor filterHash[theItem.baseFlavor[0]] = true;  Set filterHash["vanilla"]  }, onComplete: function   {     Fires at the end of all loading.    baseFlavors into an array var sortedFilters = []; for  baseFlavorName in filterHash  {  sortedFilters.push baseFlavorName ;  First push the  }  } ;     Sort them sortedFilters.sort  ;     And create an option for each one var filterBox = dojo.byId "filterContainer" .options; dojo.forEach sortedFilters, function bf  {  filterBox[filterBox.length]= new Option bf ;     And finally, connect it to a filtering event dojo.connect dojo.byId "filterContainer" , 'change',  dojobook.grid.grid_definitions.filters.applyFilter ;  }  } ;  };  dojo.addOnLoad dojobook.grid.grid_definitions.filters.loadFilter ;  At the end of the load process, you connect the onChange event to your ﬁlter handler. Doing the ﬁltering is the easy part. You simply tell the Grid model the new query and to refetch its contents. It’s very similar to our sort example.  A Grid is tremendously useful, and in most cases it’s no more difﬁcult than building a table. Yet it’s ﬂexible and handles large amounts of data with ease.   GRID MANIPULATION  393  Download grid grid_deﬁnitions ﬁlters.js  dojobook.grid.grid_definitions.filters.applyFilter = function    {  var currentValueBox = dojo.byId "filterContainer" ; var currentValue =  currentValueBox.options[currentValueBox.selectedIndex].text;  icGrid.model.query = { baseFlavor: currentValue  '*' }; icGrid.model.refresh  ;  }  Sometimes, however, you need a traditional form and lots of editing power. As you will see in the next chapter, Dijit has got you covered there too.   Chapter 15  Form Controls  We started our Dijit journey back in Chapter 2 with form controls. They were easy to pop in, and they did amazing things: enforcing ﬁeld requirements, trimming and capitalizing strings, and popping up a cal- endar for easy date entry. Now that we’ve added Ajax magic, event- driven scripting, and other Dojo tools to our toolbelt, it’s time to revisit form controls. When your application is a one-page Ajax-enabled form, the considerations are much different: you need to save space, make things more intuitive, and mirror the controls people use in word pro- cessors and spreadsheets. And since the world you can reach is much larger, you want controls that’ll reach people in different countries and different physical circumstances.  Dijit has you covered. In this chapter, we’ll ﬁll in some details, introduce new widgets, and show you some things to watch out for.  15.1 Form Control Features  Dijit contains form controls for numbers, dates, and various forms of text. But no matter what they look like, they are all designed to make data input easy and then validate it, provide feedback, and ship it back to the server. So ﬁrst we’ll look at their commonalities.  Dijit Form Controls and Their HTML Counterparts  Every HTML form control has a Dijit counterpart. A form can mix and match Dijit form controls and plain HTML form controls, but the plain HTML controls won’t follow the design theme and will look out of place. Also, using all-Dijit controls and boxing up your form in a dijit.form.Form tag, you can take advantage of form-wide validation.   FORM CONTROL FEATURES  395  Here are drop-in replacements for all the HTML controls:  HTML Control    Dijit Form Control           ...           ...          You can use the same HTML attributes in the Dijit replacement with no problems. Generally, the widget version is used in a   or   tag. They can be used in their native tag as well—so you can put a dojoType="dijit.form.ValidationTextBox" attribute in an   tag. This allows degradation, meaning a browser can still render the form if JavaScript is unavailable. The minus is you can’t deﬁne extension point handlers inside an   tag, since most browsers don’t accept a    pair.  Common Methods  Form controls in Dijit are descendents of the class dijit.form._FormWidget  itself a subclass of dijit._Widget . This bestows the following properties:    Given that formWidget is a form widget, formWidget.value is the cur- rent value. Even though form controls are often written in   tags, they act mostly like an   box in that respect. How- ever, you cannot set this property. Instead, you must use formWid- get.setValue to set it.    Every form widget responds to the following... formWidget.setAttribute "disabled", «Boolean»  formWidget.setAttribute "readOnly", «Boolean»  to disable the widget or set it to read-only mode. To the user they act the same, but disabled controls are not submitted with the form and read-only ones are.    Every form widget can include the attributes name=, alt=, value=, type=, and tabindex=, which act exactly like their HTML counter- parts.    formWidget.focus   sets the focus on that widget.   The extension point  formWidget.onChange exists universally. Unlike the DOM Level 0 onchange event, the onChange handler receives the new value as a parameter.   FORM CONTROL FEATURES  396    formWidget.undo restores the original value upon entering the ﬁeld   for example, the value at the last onChange event .  Form Submission  You can submit a Dijit form one of two ways: by a normal HTML form submit or by XHR. The former method is fairly straightforward. You simply add dojoType="dijit.form.Form" to the   tag, and all valida- tions will be checked when the user clicks the submit button. If you try to submit an invalid form, as in Figure 15.1, on the next page, the Form widget will highlight all the invalid ﬁelds and set the focus on the ﬁrst invalid control.  Using XHR requires a manual step. Before calling the dojo.xhr* method in an extension point like onChange or onClick, you need to make sure the form elements meet their validation criteria. To do this, simply call the form widget’s validate method like this:  Download form_controls isvalid.html       Got my Mojo workin' but it just don't work on <span dojoType="dijit.form.ValidationTextBox"  required="true" name="who">         Submit   if  dijit.byId "mojoform" .validate    {  dojo.xhrPost {  url: "controller.html", form: "mojoform", load: function   {  }, error: function   {  console.log "Form successfully submitted" ;  console.error "Error on submission" ;  }  } ;  }           A false return value means some ﬁelds are invalid. Like using a submit button, validate highlights all the invalid ﬁelds for you.   STREAMLINED EDITING  397  Figure 15.1: Calling isValid before submitting form  15.2 Streamlined Editing  In a traditional web application, the view and add edit modes usually have distinct pages. A view page can cram more information than an add edit form. Form controls take up more room than text.  In the Ajax world, where you typically stay on one page, you’ve got a space problem. If you turn all the changeable elements into HTML form elements, you crowd out all the useful view page information.  Dijit has two space-saving methods to help: dialog boxes and inline editing. The former overlays a form on top of the existing page, while the latter switches parts of the page from view mode to edit mode with a simple click.  Dialog and TooltipDialog  A dialog box acts like a web form on a sticky note. By overlaying the view page underneath it, the dialog box can use room for more form controls. Dijit has two kinds of dialog boxes:    dijit.Dialog is a modal, user-closable dialog box. It must be opened  through a JavaScript method call.    dijit.TooltipDialog connects to a DropDownButton  which we’ll look at in detail in Section 15.5, Action Buttons, Toolbars, and Menus, on page 418 . When the user clicks the button, the dialog box appears underneath. Unlike the modal dijit.Dialog, this dialog box cannot be opened or closed programmatically. The user may close it by clicking anywhere outside the dialog box.   STREAMLINED EDITING  398  Because dialog boxes often submit their own form data, most of them have   tags on the inside  hopefully using dojoType="dijit.form.Form" to take advantage of validation . It’s tempting to place the dialog box close to the control invoking it. But if the dialog box’s form is itself in a main page form, you’ll have problems submitting the main form. HTML form tags, as you probably know already, cannot be nested. For this reason, it’s best to place all dialog boxes toward the bottom of your HTML page.  In Figure 15.2, on the next page, you can see a modal dialog box, drawn from the following code:  Download form_controls dialog_box.html     Guess the Singer    dlg.show  ;            Singer:                   Date of Guess:         Go       Do a submit here dlg.hide  ;           Note that this dialog box can be moved by the title bar, as is common with dialog boxes in windowed operating systems. The background is shaded with an opaque gray—you can see the underlying data, but you cannot move the focus to it without dismissing the dialog box ﬁrst.  A dijit.TooltipDialog is a little less obtrusive. As soon as you click outside of it, the dialog box will disappear without action.   STREAMLINED EDITING  399  Figure 15.2: A dijit.DialogBox control  In Figure 15.3, on the following page, you can see a TooltipDialogin action. The code that draws it is a lot like a Dialog:  Download form_controls tooltip_dialog_box.html      Print          Copies:  <span dojoType="dijit.form.NumberSpinner"  id="copies" value="1">        Go             The dijit.form.NumberSpinner is a simple integer textbox. It’s frequently a good alternative to full-blown validating controls when the numbers are likely to be small.  There are two things to remember with TooltipDialog:    You must always use it inside a dijit.DropDownButton. It looks like a dijit.Button widget, but it requires the button text to be inside an HTML tag—usually a   tag.  We’ll cover this in detail in Section 15.5, Action Buttons, Toolbars, and Menus, on page 418.     You must use the line dojo.require "dijit.Dialog" ; to include it. This is one of those rare times that the control name does not match the module name.   STREAMLINED EDITING  400  Figure 15.3: A dijit.TooltipDialog control  Inline Editing  As we saw in Chapter 14, Grid, on page 366, dijit.Grid has a nice inline cell-editing system. You tell Grid which editor control to use in a par- ticular column, and Grid then allows the user to double-click the cell, edit it, and then save it back. The Grid-editing paradigm was so useful, it inspired a more general inline editing widget that works in any kind of form.  dijit.InlineEditBox is more of a container widget than a stand-alone widget. InlineEditBox hands most of the work off to a Dijit form control. You wrap a piece of text, a date, a number, or whatever with an InlineEditBox widget like this:  Download form_controls inline_number_edit.html     I've got  <span dojoType="dijit.InlineEditBox"  editor="dijit.form.NumberSpinner" width="100px"> 99    &nbsp; <span dojoType="dijit.InlineEditBox"      All I need is one more  When I get that one, pallie   Gonna let the other ones go      editor="dijit.form.FilteringSelect" editorParams="{store: genderStore, autocomplete: true}" width="150px" >women .   STREAMLINED EDITING  401  Figure 15.4: Using InlineEditBox to update an old blues tune  The two inline boxes are independently editable, as you can see in Fig- ure 15.4. A couple of things are worth nothing:    To change the width of the inline editor, you must use the width=  attribute. Width speciﬁed in a CSS style is ignored.    The editor= attribute speciﬁes the Dijit control class. You must  remember to dojo.require that control class in the page.    editorParams= speciﬁes attributes to send to the editor control. It is a hash, just like you would use in a programmatic widget con- structor call.  Text Editing  While we’re on the topic of inline editing, it’s also a good time to talk about multiline text editing. Dijit provides two widgets for this: dijit.form. SimpleTextarea, which emulates a ﬁxed-height ﬁxed-width textbox, and dijit.form.Textarea, which is a box that expands at the bottom as you ﬁll it with text. The latter widget is useful for saving screen real estate, since you use only the editing area you need to ﬁt the text.  dijit.form.SimpleTextarea and dijit.form.Textarea  SimpleTextarea takes the same standard HTML attributes as  . TextArea does too except for rows= and cols=. Since Textarea= expands at the bottom, the rows= attribute doesn’t make sense.  And because Dijit uses proportional fonts, the cols= attribute is mean- ingless as well. Instead, you should specify the width in the style or CSS class of the widget.   STREAMLINED EDITING  402  Figure 15.5: Turning displayed text to editable text  Finally, TextArea works very well in conjunction with an InlineEditBox, as you can see in Figure 15.5. You can rope off a section of text with an inline edit using dijit.form.Textarea as the editor and turn a paragraph of displayed text into an editable ﬁeld, as shown in this example:  Download form_controls textarea.html     <div dojoType="dijit.InlineEditBox"  editor="dijit.form.Textarea"> The woman I love took from my best friend  Some joker got lucky stole her back again  You better come on in my kitchen         Rich Text Editor  Like all inline edits, you can read the TextArea’s getValue property to send the contents back to the server when editing ends.  For more industrial-strength text editing, Dijit includes the rich text editor dijit.Editor. This widget offers HTML-backed editing with a handy toolbar and keyboard shortcuts. It’s like embedding a little word pro- cessor in a form ﬁeld, as you can see in Figure 15.6, on the next page.   STREAMLINED EDITING  403  Figure 15.6: Dijit’s rich text editor  There are two ways to embed the editor. The ﬁrst is with a ﬁxed width and height box:  Download form_controls ﬁxed_editor.html     <div dojoType="dijit.Editor" >   Love in Vain    When the train left the station  There were two lights on behind  Well the blue light was my baby  And the red light was my mind  All my love's in vain.        The second is a slight variant that marries the download-expanding dijit.form.Textarea widget with a rich text palette. This is achieved by adding the height="" attribute and then loading the dijit._editor.plugins. AlwaysShowToolbar plug-in  we’ll discuss plug-ins in a bit .   STREAMLINED EDITING  404  Download form_controls ﬁxed_editor.html  <div dojoType="dijit.Editor"  height="" extraPlugins="['dijit._editor.plugins.AlwaysShowToolbar']" >   Note the toolbar on top of Figure 15.6, on the preceding page. This has standard icons for  in order  undo and redo, cut, copy and paste, bold, italic, underline and strikethrough, numbering and bullets, left and right indentation, and left right center justiﬁcation. Since these are pretty familiar in modern GUI applications, users will recognize them right away.  Occasionally, though, you may want to customize the editing toolbar. For instance, you might want to limit the toolbar choices to Bold and Italic. You can use the attribute to specify exactly which plug-ins to load:     Here the pipe symbol    creates a separator bar between buttons. The complete set of toolbar buttons, as they need to appear in the plugins= attribute, are as follows:    undo and redo   cut, copy, and paste   bold, italic, underline, and strikethrough   insertOrderedList and insertUnorderedList   indent and outdent   justifyLeft, justifyRight, justifyCenter, and justifyFull  In addition, you can add the following optional plug-ins. Unlike the standard buttons mentioned earlier, these plug-ins need a dojo.require to make them work. Each plug-in has optional properties, so include them as hashes within your plugins= attribute like this:  plugins="['bold','italic','', {  name:'dijit._editor.plugins.FontChoice', command:'fontName', generic:true  }]"  dijit._editor.plugins.FontChoice  fontName: A drop-down box for choosing a font. If you set the generic property to true, the generic HTML font families  mono- space, serif, and so on  are listed. Otherwise, the common web font families  Arial, Times New Roman, and so on  are listed.   FEEDBACK  405  fontSize: A drop-down box for standard relative font sizes 1–7.  formatBlock: A drop-down box for standard paragraph-level styles   p, h1, h2, and so on .  dijit._editor.plugins.AlwaysShowToolbar  Use this plug-in when planning for potentially large textboxes. It keeps the toolbar at the top of the window no matter where the editor is. Without it, if the edit box expands to a height larger than the browser window, the toolbar will scroll offscreen, and you won’t be able to use it for sentences at the bottom of the box.  dijit._editor.plugins.EnterKeyHandling  Used primarily for Internet Explorer so each new line does not be- come a new paragraph. Its property blockNodeForEnter deﬁnes the HTML tag used when the user presses Enter . This defaults to br but can also be div or p.  dijit._editor.plugins.LinkDialog  createLink:  Inserts a hypertext link  insertImage: Adds an image tag  dijit._editor.plugins.TextColor  foreColor: Sets the foreground color  hiliteColor: Sets the background color  One last note: To enable cut, copy, and paste from other windows to Firefox, see http:  www.mozilla.org editor midasdemo securityprefs.html.  15.3 Feedback  Besides streamlining, one-page applications have another challenge. If the browser is doing something in the background, how do you signal this? And if something changes on the page, how do you indicate that it happened? In traditional apps, these are both communicated through a page change.  One technique for indicating change is the Yellow Fade Technique, which you saw on Section 7.5, Animating with dojo.animateProperty, on page 170. This technique indicates something has changed by turn- ing the changed element to a background yellow  like a highlighter  and fading the yellow down to white over a matter of seconds.   FEEDBACK  406  Sometimes for the user’s sake, you must be more speciﬁc about what’s happening. In those cases, you can use Dijit tooltips, progress bars, and toasters.  Tooltips  Tooltips and balloon help have become pervasive user interface ele- ments in web and client-server applications.  Dijit tooltips are like the title= attribute, but unlike title=, you can display large amounts of text with HTML inside. To make them more visible, you can place them in other places relative to the mouse pointer.  There are two kinds of tooltips. An anchored tooltip uses the widget class dijit.Tooltip. The anchor means you’re tying it to a particular ele- ment, and the tooltip is visible only when hovering over that element. The following code. . .  Download form_controls anchored_tooltip.html    What's that making your tongue flippy-flop? When you drink a  NuGrape  you don't know when to stop. I got your ice cold  NuGrape.    <span dojoType="dijit.Tooltip" connectId="def,def2"  style="display:none;">NuGrape is a  grape soda .  First bottled in 1921, its strange, barrelhouse- inspired jingle  I Got Your Ice Cold NuGrape  is a favorite among roots music snobs.     produces the tooltip shown in Figure 15.7, on the following page. Note that dijit.Tooltip widgets can appear anywhere in the page, but like dijit. Dialog tags, they are best placed at the bottom so as not to disrupt the document ﬂow. Setting the style to display:none keeps them invisible when drawing the page.  What anchors them to elements is the id= attribute of the anchors and the connectId= attribute of the Tooltip tag. In our case, connectId= con- nects to two anchors: the two instances of “NuGrape.”  Anchored tooltips cannot be turned on and off from JavaScript. A mas- ter tooltip solves this problem. As the name implies, there is one master   FEEDBACK  407  Figure 15.7: An anchored tooltip stays by its anchor.  tooltip per page, but the good news is you can move it anywhere at will. You create and hide the master tooltip through the JavaScript methods:  dijit.showTooltip String htmlContents, DOMNode aroundNode, [, String[] position]  dijit.hideTooltip DOMNode aroundNode   Here, the DOM node aroundNode functions as the anchor. The position parameter is interesting—it holds an array of positions to try for the tooltip. The possible values are above, below, after, and before.1 The positions are tried in order until the tooltip ﬁts within the page bound- aries. That ensures tooltips are never cut off. The default position is [’after’,’before’], meaning it will try after ﬁrst and then before.  There is one caveat: master tooltips are not a11y-compatible like Dijit widgets are. So, they should be used sparingly and always be accom- panied by some other accessible mechanism.  Progress  When long operations happen, the user needs to be informed at the beginning and at regular intervals. At the very least, they need to know there’s time for a cup of coffee. But they also need to be reassured the process is continuing and that the browser, server, and network are still working. In the traditional web model, long operations always happen between pages, so the browser’s spinning logo tells you things are happening.  1. After and before are more accurate terms since right-to-left languages like Arabic will put an after tooltip to the left.   FEEDBACK  408  Figure 15.8: A progress meter in ﬂight  In the Ajax world, operations happen without a page request, so you must provide your own feedback. Fortunately, Dijit has a widget for you! It’s called dijit.ProgressBar, and it looks like Figure 15.8.  You set up the bar like this:  Download form_controls progress_bar.html  <div dojoType="dijit.ProgressBar" style="width:300px"  jsId="jsProgress" id="downloadProgress">   <input type="button" value="Go!"  onclick="dojobook.form_controls.objects.progress_bar.download  ;"  >  <input type="button" value="Stop!"  onclick="clearInterval _timer ;_timer=null;"  >  Without any pushing, the progress bar will sit at 0% forever. You must communicate progress through a JavaScript method call, update { max- imum: numParts, progress:0 } ;. Since we’re being server agnostic, we will simulate a long operation through the standard JavaScript setInterval method and a random time interval between progress reports:  Download form_controls objects progress_bar.js  dojo.provide "dojobook.form_controls.objects.progress_bar" ;   function   {  dojobook.form_controls.objects.progress_bar.download = function  {     Split up bar into 7% segments numParts = Math.floor 100 7 ; jsProgress.update { maximum: numParts, progress:0 } ;  for  var i=0; i<=numParts; i++ {     This plays update {progress:0}  at 3nn milliseconds,    update {progress:1}  at 6nn milliseconds, etc. _timer = setTimeout   "jsProgress.update { progress: " + i + " } ",  i+1 *300 + Math.floor Math.random  *300    ;  }  } }   ;   DATES, NUMBERS, AND I18N  409  Often the biggest problem in Dojo progress metering is getting progress reports. Despite all the work we have done with Deferreds and asyn- chronous callbacks earlier in Chapter 6, Asynchronous Programming, on page 101, JavaScript is still single threaded. And often the things you want to monitor work in one statement. Say you need to pull down 100,000 records to the browser through an XHR request. If you issue dojo.xhr* for the entire set, the method seems to work asynchronously in the sense that you can scroll up and down the page, enter form elements, and so on. But you can’t ask “How many records have you downloaded so far?”  The most common way around this is to get data in chunks, updating the progress meter in the onLoad callback of dojo.xhr*. For dojo.data loads, using QueryReadStore helps partition the work so you can call the progress meter in stages.  Notiﬁcations with Toaster  Sometimes you don’t need all the detail of a progress meter. For exam- ple, suppose you just want to tell a user you’re saving a document in the back group. The widget dojox.widget.Toaster is good for that. You can set up a Toaster like this:  Download form_controls save_toaster.html  <div dojoType="dojox.widget.Toaster" duration="0" jsId="saveToaster"  messageTopic=" saving" positionDirection="tr-left">   Then invoke it in some background, possibly long-running process. We’ll simulate that here with some buttons:  Download form_controls save_toaster.html  <div dojoType="dojox.widget.Toaster" duration="0" jsId="saveToaster"  messageTopic=" saving" positionDirection="tr-left">   Setting the timer to 0 in the widget means “keep onscreen until it’s clicked.” You publish the topic at the beginning of your operation to set the Toaster in motion. Then at the end, you call _setTimer 1 , meaning keep the Toaster onscreen for 1ms longer and disappear. The user can also dismiss the Toaster manually by clicking it.  15.4 Dates, Numbers, and i18n  In Section 2.5, Improved Form Controls, on page 31, we learned about regular expression validation, which can handle your text validation   DATES, NUMBERS, AND I18N  410  needs. But numbers, currency, dates, and times need extra care. Valid examples are different depending on the country you’re in. In other words, you need to pay attention to internationalization, or i18n  which means “i and n with 18 letters in between” .  For example, if you’re asked for a date in the DateTextBox, you would be correct typing 1 31 2008 in the United States, but not in England.  England puts the month after the day, and there is no 31st month!  So, validating input depends on a locale, that is, the customs of a par- ticular country or language, and you must validate within that context. Locales greatly affect the formatting of four things in particular: num- bers, currency, date, and time.  The good news is Dijit takes care of many of the details invisibly, for the most part. Dojo reads the browser’s installed locale  the only i18n- speciﬁc information available to JavaScript  as part of its startup pro- cess and makes it available to all JavaScript code. Dijit in turn reads the locale and retrieves information about its formatting patterns and uses them to display and interpret things in the widgets. The Dojo source version bundles the entire Unicode CLDR localization database, and you can pick which locales to support as part of a custom build. The Dojo binary version contains a subset of the most common locales.  The following controls are i18n-enabled:    dijit.form.NumberTextBox   dijit.form.CurrencyTextBox   dijit.form.NumberSpinner   dijit.form.DateTextBox   dijit.form.TimeTextBox  Standard Form  Although Dojo knows your locale and can format dates based on it, if you get the following item in ItemFileReadStore...  [ "5 10 2003", "Frank", "Stokes", ... ]  how does Dojo know whether the 5 10 2003 is May 10 or November 5? Dojo could force you to send the server locale information with each response, but it seems bandwidth-wasteful to do so. So, Dojo requires specifying dates and numbers in a clear, well-deﬁned standard form.  For numbers, standard form is the same as JavaScript number literals. So, the number 92367.45 is in standard form because you can say var   DATES, NUMBERS, AND I18N  411  Figure 15.9: The standard form values 1983-05-18 and 10000.001 ren- dered in different locales  x=92367.45;. And 92.367,45 is not in standard form, even though it’s a legal number in locales where . is the digit group separator and , is the decimal point.  Dates are trickier. You can unambiguously create a Date object in JavaScript, and that’s good for programmatic widgets. But program- matic widgets need a text-based standard form. Dojo uses ISO 8601, whose form is as follows:  yyyy-mm-dd«Thh:mi:ss»  The string 2003-10-05T06:30:00 is November 5, 2003, at 6:30 a.m. The “T” and time can be left off if it’s not applicable. Dates sent in this format will always be translatable by the DateTextBox and TimeTextBox implementations.  In Figure 15.9, you see how the standard form date 1983-05-18 and the number 10000.001 are rendered using different locales and currency formats.  Constraints and Formatting  Although you could validate numbers, times, and dates with a Vali- dationTextBox and regular expressions, Dijit provides specialized sub- classes of ValidationTextBox that are much easier. Rather than specifying a regular expression, these controls use constraints that are specialized and easier to read. The constraint is used both to format a standard form number or date into a readable, localized form and to parse it from a localized form back to standard form.   DATES, NUMBERS, AND I18N  412  There are two forms of constraints: property-based and pattern-based. A property-based constraint speciﬁes the characteristics  number of places after the decimal point, and so on  in a JavaScript hash, while a pattern-based constraint encodes them in a string like .. Pattern- based constraints are sort of the printf in Dojo. You can write all con- straints in either form, so it’s your choice.  Numbers  Let’s examine constraints in number validation—property-based ﬁrst. The widget dijit.form.NumberTextBox deals with numeric input.  You place all constraints, whether property or pattern-based, in the constraint= attribute. For instance, this property-based constraint prints a number as a percent  that is, multiplied by 100  with two decimal digits, rounding all values with a third decimal digit from 0–5 downward and from 6–9 upward.  {type: 'percent', places: 2 }  The properties min, max, type  which is one of percent, currency, or dec- imal , and places  the number of digits after the decimal point  are all legal for number constraints.  The equivalent pattern-based constraint says it more succinctly:  {pattern: '.%' }  Pattern-based constraints for numbers are based on the standard Uni- code TR35 language. It is the same pattern language that Java uses for numbers. . . a nice beneﬁt. Rather than go through it in full here, we refer you to the speciﬁcation itself at http:  www.unicode.org reports  tr35 Number_Format_Patterns.  Here are a few common use cases with pattern-based and property- based constraints:  Download form_controls constraints.html  Displays 1.01 -->  <!-- <div dojoType="dijit.form.NumberTextBox" name="n1"  value='1.007' constraints="{ places: 2 }"  >   >   Displays 1.00 -->  <!-- <div dojoType="dijit.form.NumberTextBox" name="n2"  value='1.004' constraints="{ pattern: '.' }"   DATES, NUMBERS, AND I18N  413  <!--  Displays 110%, but reverts to 1 when the box gets focus, and expects you to input the % sign -->  <div dojoType="dijit.form.NumberTextBox" name="n3"  value='1.1' constraints="{ type: 'percent', places: 0 }"  >   >   Displays 1,005.0 -->  <!-- <div dojoType="dijit.form.NumberTextBox" name="n4"  value='1005' constraints="{ pattern: ',0.0' }"  So, constraints help you on the output side; now let’s look at the input side. If someone enters 1.116 in a box with two decimal places, Number- TextBox will reformat it as 1.12 when the box loses focus. Occasionally constraints can cause user confusion. A percent type box will always expect a % in the input. If you don’t provide the user a good prompt message, they won’t know they must enter the % sign, leading to frus- tration. That’s never a good thing.  Mapped Textboxes  The percentage constraint brings up a good question. Server programs don’t like input with commas and percent signs—they prefer numbers with only digits and a decimal point, in other words: standard form. But if the NumberTextBox forces the user to enter a percent sign, how do we make the server swallow it?  Dijit uses a neat trick called mapped textboxes to take care of this. Each NumberTextBox actually gets expanded into two   tags: one that’s displayed and one that isn’t. The displayed one contains the “user- friendly” version with the percent sign, and the hidden one contains the standard form. Only the standard form is submitted. So after entering 50% and leaving the ﬁeld, the hidden ﬁeld contains 0.5, and that’s what is submitted.  In Figure 15.10, on the next page, you can see what goes on. In Firebug, you can see how the widget becomes two input boxes. When the form submits, as shown at the bottom, only the n3 parameter is submitted.  Dijit’s four special validation widgets—NumberTextBox, CurrencyTextBox, DateTextBox, and TimeTextBox—are all mapped textboxes. Later we’ll see how to exploit mapped textboxes to submit other forms of numbers or dates besides standard form.   DATES, NUMBERS, AND I18N  414  Figure 15.10: A mapped textbox is really two textboxes.  Currency  Currency carries a bit more complexity than numbers. With numbers, you have only one locale to deal with—that of the browser—and a num- ber can be translated to any other locale by using standard form.  The dijit.form.CurrencyTextBox is like a NumberTextBox, but it throws in the local currency symbol for free. If you’re in the United States, for exam- ple, it pops in a dollar sign when the box loses focus. But if someone in Papua New Guinea uses that same page, they will enter a number and the kina symbol will appear. Because of the mapped tax boxes, only the number will be passed, so how does the server know the currency is in kinas?  One way is to decode the locale in your server program and format the currency accordingly. Another, which is much clearer and easier to pro- gram, is to embed the currency symbol in a constraint. The constraint looks like this:  Download form_controls constraints.html  Displays 1.01 -->  <!-- Amt to Charge  in Japanese Yen  <div dojoType="dijit.form.CurrencyTextBox" name="c1"  value='1.007' constraints="{ currency:'JPY' }"  >    DATES, NUMBERS, AND I18N  415  Here, currency is the standard ISO 4217:2001 three-character code. Then you set up one box for each currency you’ll accept. This makes things quite unambiguous.  The currency also carries some standards for fractions. For example, U.S. dollars  USD  go to two decimal places, while Japanese yen  JPY  use none. You can override this for a particular currency by specifying fractional as true or false. This is necessary for micropayments or per- unit costs for very small items.  Dates and Times  We’ve already used DateTextBox with its handy drop-down calendar. By default, this control always displays the date in the locale-speciﬁc for- mat. But because it’s a mapped textbox, only the standard form date is sent back to the server.  If the default onscreen format is not to your liking, you can use one of the following constraints:    formatLength can be set to short, medium, long, or full, which displays  the date in various degrees of terseness.    pattern speciﬁes a full date pattern string, conforming to the Uni- code TR-35 Date Pattern format speciﬁcation  http:  www.unicode. org reports tr35 Date_Format_Patterns . As with number patterns, this standard is the same standard Java uses for dates.  dijit.form.TimeTextBox does for times what DateTextBox does for dates. This control uses formatLength or pattern just like a DateTextBox. In addition, it adds the following constraints:    clickableIncrement speciﬁes the granularity of time that a user can select. This is speciﬁed in Dojo common format, as in "T00:10:00", which means a user can choose 1:10, 1:20, 1:30, and so on.    visibleIncrement speciﬁes when printed labels occur on the time  chart. For example, "T01:00:00" means list 1:00, 2:00, and so on.    visibleRange tells how much time is visible on the scale at any time.  The control, as shown in Figure 15.11, on the following page, uses the constraint {formatLength:’short’,clickableIncrement:’T00:15:00’, visibleIn- crement: ’T01:00:00’, visibleRange:’T02:00:00’}.   DATES, NUMBERS, AND I18N  416  Figure 15.11: A dijit.form.TimeTextBox  Bypassing Standard Form  Servers can be very stubborn about date formats. A DateTextBox accepts ISO 8601 dates, but it may be difﬁcult for the server to send them in that format. Making it worse, the server may have a hard time accepting ISO 8601 dates. Fortunately, you can get around this restriction by making your own DateTextBox, and you don’t have to do it from scratch.  By default, the Oracle database accepts and returns dates of the form dd-MMM-yyyy, as in 15-MAY-2008. Here we’ll write a subclass of Date- TextBox that will short-circuit the parsing and formatting process:  Download form_controls widgets OracleDateTextBox.js  dojo.provide "dojobook.form_controls.widgets.OracleDateTextBox" ; dojo.require "dijit.form.DateTextBox" ;  dojo.declare "dojobook.form_controls.widgets.OracleDateTextBox",  [dijit.form.DateTextBox], {  postMixInProperties: function   {  this.inherited arguments ; if this.srcNodeRef  {     If the widget was created declaratively     The postMixInProperties in superclasses have ISO parsing built    in. var unparsedValue = this.srcNodeRef.getAttribute 'value' ; if unparsedValue  {  So here we overwrite the parsed value.  var dateFromOracle = dojo.date.locale.parse   unparsedValue, {selector:'date', datePattern: 'dd-MMM-yyyy'}   ;   DATES, NUMBERS, AND I18N  417  this.value = dateFromOracle;  }  }  },    Returns date in dd-MMM-yyyy to the server serialize: function d, options  {  return dojo.date.locale.format   d, {selector:'date', datePattern:'dd-MMM-yyyy'}   ;  }  } ;  In a nutshell, postMixInProperties is the ﬁrst extension point run during widget construction. We delegate the duties to the superclass DateTime- TextBox ﬁrst. It parses the value from ISO 8601 format to a date. When control passes back to our own handler, we parse the original value according to Oracle specs, overwrite the value, and return.  The serialize extension point runs when the value changes. Here, we do the reverse step and format the date in Oracle format, which gets placed in the hidden text ﬁeld of a mapped textbox. When the form is submitted, the Oracle format gets sent. Meanwhile, onscreen, all you see is the date in locale-speciﬁc format. It’s like magic!  Then you can use the widget as a drop-in replacement for DateTextBox, like so:  Download form_controls form_OracleDateTextBox.html  <input dojoType="dojobook.form_controls.widgets.OracleDateTextBox"  name="mydate" value="04-MAR-2008" >  Subclassing widgets is such a useful technique that we’ll see much more of it later in Chapter 17, Creating and Extending Widget Classes, on page 455.  Feedback  When constraining the input, sometimes it’s not clear what you expect from the user. And sometimes, despite warnings, users make a mis- take and enter bad input. Dijit’s design philosophy is to give the user feedback early yet inobtrusively.  You give Dijit a boost by providing the text. The promptMessage= attri- bute text displays in a tooltip when the control gets focus, as in the following:  <div dojoType="dijit.form.ValidationTextBox"  promptMessage="Enter a date before 8 20 1974"   ACTION BUTTONS, TOOLBARS, AND MENUS  418  >  >  As you’ve seen in the examples in Chapter 3, the prompt appears as a tooltip after the control. You can change the position of this tooltip by using the position= attribute, with the same values as dijit.MasterTooltip.  The prompt appears when the focus arrives on that control and the control has no value. As soon as the user enters something, that some- thing is validated against the constraints. If the value is invalid, the attribute invalidMessage= is displayed:  <div dojoType="dijit.form.ValidationTextBox"  invalidMessage="The date must be before 8 20 1974"  This too is displayed as a tooltip and can be positioned with the position= attribute.  15.5 Action Buttons, Toolbars, and Menus  Over the past few chapters, dijit.Button has come in handy for all kinds of action initiation. It requires only a label, an iconClass= that points to a style with a icon, or both, and an onClick handler.  In a Rich Internet Application, you could presumably make one button for each command. But that would be a dreadful waste of real estate and would be confusing besides. So, Dijit provides two containers for compacting a set of buttons. dijit.Menu stacks its contents vertically. A menu doesn’t use buttons per se, but it uses dijit.MenuItems, which are essentially borderless buttons with menu-closing authority. The other container, dijit.Toolbar, displays its contents, which are always buttons, horizontally.  dijit.Menus and dijit.Toolbars can live in the following habitats:    dijit.form.DropDownButton is a button that, when clicked, displays the menu or toolbar inside. This button always has two children: a label, usually in a   tag, and a menu or toolbar.    dijit.form.ComboButton is like a combination Button and DropDown- Button. It has an arrow to the side, which when clicked displays the submenu. Clicking the ComboButton itself performs its own button-like action.   ACTION BUTTONS, TOOLBARS, AND MENUS  419    With no parent menus, the menu or toolbar displays onscreen all the time. In a Menu, you can also set the contextMenuForWindow= to true and make it a context  right-click  menu.  Note that dijit.form.Button includes both dijit.form.DropDownButton and dijit. form.ComboButton types, so you need to dojo.require that module only.  A menu can contain the following items:    dijit.MenuItem is a menu’s leaf node. All of your onClick handlers go    dijit.PopupMenu is like a MenuItem, but it always has two children: a label, usually in a   tag, and another menu. It does not have an onClick extension point because clicking always displays its subordinate menu.    dijit.MenuSeparator  is not selectable but draws a line between  here.  elements.  The module dijit.Menu includes all these widgets.  A toolbar is like a menu but contains Buttons that make it function like the traditional software toolbar. You can also add DropDownButtons and ComboButtons to make a menu bar. Lastly, there is a button separator, dijit.ToolbarSeparator.  To see how this all works, let’s start with a basic menu:  Download form_controls buttons.html      Disaster Menu         Natural      Boll Weevils   Flood            Emotional      Spouse Left You   Spouse Caught You Cheating     Spouse Caught You Cheating and Left     Spouse With Best Friend      ACTION BUTTONS, TOOLBARS, AND MENUS  420  Figure 15.12: A menu and a toolbar masquerading as a menu  console.log "Now that is REALLY bad!" ;                 Medical      TB   Rheum-y-tism            Normally, you’d have onClick handlers for each menu item, but this example includes just one for brevity. Placing this on its own in a page, this menu will display a vertical list of the items, as shown in Fig- ure 15.12  To make this a context menu, you simply add the attributes contextMen- uForWindow="true" and style="display:none" to the tag. You can also then hide the menu in a DropDownButton:      Disasters     ...        ACTION BUTTONS, TOOLBARS, AND MENUS  421  Or you can make it into the traditional menu bar by changing the Pop- upMenu elements to DropDownButtons and changing the outer widget to a toolbar.   A11Y  422  The result is as follows:  Download form_controls buttons.html         Natural      Boll Weevils   Flood            Emotional      Spouse Left You   Spouse Caught You Cheating     Spouse Caught You Cheating and Left     Spouse With Best Friend     console.log "Now that is REALLY bad!" ;                 Medical      TB   Rheum-y-tism   The result looks like the bottom half of Figure 15.12, on page 420.  Accessibility, often abbreviated a11y to mean “a plus 11 letters plus y,” refers to making pages accessible to everyone. From its beginning, Dijit has made accessibility a priority, and all bundled Dijit components are a11y compliant.  If you are unfamiliar with a11y and its relation to web browsing, http:   www.w3.org WAI  provides a good primer. But here is the 50,000-foot view. People with impaired vision or motor disabilities might have prob- lems using your web app. Those with impaired vision such as color           15.6 A11y   A11Y  423  blindness or fuzzy or cloudy vision may have trouble picking up cues communicated through color and shape. Those with no vision may rely on screen readers to communicate text and feedback. Finally, motor disabilities may prevent someone from using the mouse, instead rely- ing on keyboards, switches, or voice recognition to generate input.  With JavaScriptless ﬁll-and-submit web pages, you could rely on the browser and the OS to handle many of the a11y concerns. As long as you used   tags and alt= attributes on controls, the a11y APIs could pick them up. Screen readers could read the text and con- trol state information—for example, a checkbox could read “Vegetarian Meal checkbox checked.”  Ajax throws a wrench into things. All of sudden controls may be imple- mented with   tags, and their state may live in JavaScript vari- ables. How can the browser tell which   tags mark text and which mark controls? From Dojo’s point of view, there are three main acces- sibility issues to solve:  Images and color Dijit relies heavily on background images because they are portable, they are easily blendable into a theme, and they live in the style sheet where they’re easy to maintain. But if a person with low or no vision has images turned off, this is no longer a reliable way to communicate state or progress. We’ll talk about this along with general design in Chapter 16, Dijit Themes, Design, and Layout, on page 428.  Keyboard usage HTML controls automatically handle Tab navigation and selection. If Dijit controls do not at least emulate this, they risk making the page unable to be navigated. Furthermore, Dijit controls have many options that HTML controls don’t have, and the challenge is to make these work seamlessly for a keyboard user. Part of this can be solved with Dojo’s rich keyboard event system, described earlier in Section 6.1, Keyboard Event Objects, on page 105. We’ll see how to assign tab order to individual con- trols in the next section.  Conveying role and state While checkboxes are easy to present, sophisticated Dijit controls require some thought. Let’s say you’ve focused onto a tree node with label “Gummy Haggis, Order 23199” as its parent and with ﬁve serial numbers listed beneath. Pre- tend you are talking to someone at that same page in their own browser and where they need to be to match yours. You could   A11Y  424  communicate the role “Tree Node” and the state as “Parent label Order 23199, label Gummy Haggis, open, number of children: 5,” for example. Obviously, Dijit needs some help in this area, which we’ll talk about in the next section.  Tab Order  Intuitively, the Tab key should move to the next control on the form in some natural order. With Dijit form controls, you set tab order in the same manner as HTML—with the tabindex= attribute. The possible values are as follows:  tabindex= Meaning -1  0  The user cannot tab into this control. It can be focused only through a JavaScript widgetObject.focus   call. Visit this control in the order the controls appear in the markup. This is the default, and generally you make either all controls 0 or none of them 0.  1–32767 Order in which this control should be visited. To make form rearrangement easy, using increments of 10 is a good strategy.  Conveying Roles and States in Extension Points  So, now a widget has focus. How does the screen reader convey the information there? For regular old HTML controls, the problem is pretty straightforward. Each control has a role and a state for which to convey information. For example, in a checkbox like this...   My baby's gone     the screen reader would say: “My baby’s gone; pressed is true” or “My baby’s gone; pressed is untrue.”  And if your baby is gone, that mechan- ical voice won’t reassure you much.  That functionality is built into the accessibility feature of browsers. But what about this widget?   My baby's gone  <div dojoType="dijit.form.Checkbox"  id="gone" value="y"  >  First, browsers don’t know about dijit.form.Checkbox, so how do they know the state will be checked or unchecked? Second, as you know about declarative widgets, they almost never stay intact. The source   tag is replaced with a bunch of other tags by the Dojo parser. So, how will the browser and the screen reader know what type of control this is?   A11Y  425  This is where the Web Accessibility Initiative comes in. A standards body that looks at accessibility in web applications, WAI is developing the Accessible Rich Internet Application  ARIA  standard. ARIA deﬁnes information dimensions, which describe things happening on the page. These dimensions answer certain questions like “What is this object?”  the ARIA dimension called the role  and “What meaningful properties does this object have it this time?”  the state  and “What object am I working on?”  the focus . The focus is covered by the taborder= attribute, but the role and state need some explanation.  Let’s take the role ﬁrst. The role essentially answers the question “What does this control act like?” Typical values include row, gridcell, button, tooltip, directory, img, and so forth. The role usually affects what actions the user may take and what states are kept with the control. role= is an attribute of the XHTML 1.1 standard, and Firefox 1.5  and newer  recognizes it. So, you could identify the previous checkbox with the following:   My baby's gone  <div dojoType="dijit.form.Checkbox"  role="checkbox" id="gone" value="y"  >  At least you could do this if widgets carried over the role= attribute. But as we’ll see in Chapter 17, Creating and Extending Widget Classes, on page 455, attributes that the widget doesn’t explicitly use or pass on are quietly dropped. Instead, the widget class sets the role attribute.  A widget may actually have several controls with distinct roles. For example, a ComboButton combines an action button with a drop-down menu button. Each of these has the ARIA role button. In the drop-down menu itself, each menu item has an ARIA role option.  And that brings us to the state, which is settable through Dojo. State is important to get right when you’re adding extension point handlers, since your handler may actually be changing the state of the control. Or you may want to add extra state information to make navigation a little easier. To do this with a Dijit control, you follow these steps:  1. Locate the template for that Dijit control. These are usually in  dojoroot dijit templates or a templates directory underneath and are named after the Dijit class with the extension .html.  2. Find existing WAI roles, WAI states, and dojoAttachPoint attributes. 3. Construct a call to dijit.setWaiState.   A11Y  426  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  15  20  So, suppose you want to set a state called importance in ComboBox. You ﬁrst ﬁnd the template  dojoroot dijit form templates ComboBox.html. Here’s what it looks like:  Download form_controls ComboBox.html  Line 1  <div class="dijit dijitReset dijitInlineTable dijitLeft"  id="widget_${id}" dojoAttachEvent="onmouseenter:_onMouse,onmouseleave:_onMouse,\  onmousedown:_onMouse"  dojoAttachPoint="comboNode" waiRole="combobox" tabIndex="-1" ><div style="overflow:hidden;"  ><div  class='dijitReset dijitRight dijitButtonNode dijitArrowButton\  dijitDownArrowButton'  dojoAttachPoint="downArrowNode" waiRole="presentation" > &thinsp;< div > &9660;< div  >< div >  < div > &Chi;< div ><div class="dijitReset dijitInputField" ><input type="text" autocomplete="off" name="${name}" class='dijitReset' dojoAttachEvent="onkeypress:_onKeyPress, onfocus:_update, compositionend" dojoAttachPoint="textbox,focusNode" waiRole="textbox" waiState="haspopup-true,autocomplete-list"  >< div  >< div  >   Don’t worry about understanding all this—we’ll cover the Dijit template language in Section 17.1, Widget Classes Using dijit.Declaration, on page 456. The important thing is ﬁnding the WAI attributes and the dojoAttachPoint= attributes.  You notice there are three waiRole= attributes in the tags here: com- bobox, presentation, and textbox. presentation is a special role that says “This node does not hold any state information.” These nodes are for design purposes only. The one we really want is textbox. For sighted users, this box will be colored green, orange, or red depending on the importance level, but we’ll set a WAI state for screen readers to pick up.  The textbox node has a dojoAttachPoint="textbox,focusNode" attribute. You need this as a location to set the state—in this case you can use either textbox or focusNode in your method call:  dijit.setWaiState: function widget.textbox, 'importance', 'very important' ;  Now when the browser focuses on that element, the screen reader will speak the importance information we also have encoded as a textbox   A11Y  427  color.  Once you have the process down, it’s fairly straightforward to take the few extra steps to make your controls a11y compliant. Dijit is far beyond other JavaScript toolkits in this area, and as browser manu- facturers add more ARIA-compliant features, you can be sure Dijit will evolve accordingly.   Chapter 16  Dijit Themes, Design, and Layout  A cramped, poorly colored, or inconsistent page can kill user enthu- siasm as much as poor functionality. So like it or not, you must pay attention to the visual details. That takes a good eye  which you may not have  and lots of time  which you deﬁnitely don’t have .  Dijit provides themes and layout widgets to help you. Themes apply color, icons, and font choices to your page’s widgets. Out of the box the themes bundled with Dijit provide balanced color, readability, and ele- gance. But if you need to add or change the design, Dijit’s well-thought- out structure makes it easy to change everything from individual ele- ments to whole widget classes. A good understanding of theme struc- ture, which we’ll cover in the ﬁrst part of the chapter, will make the change process straightforward.  Layout widgets separate, group, and align elements. If themes are Dijit’s paint box, layout widgets are its X-acto knife and rubber cement. Lay- outs are made of panes, which function like pastable elements. Their content can come from the same page or different pages. You lay panes beside each other in a dijit.layout.BorderContainer, which acts like a paste board. Or you can lay panes on top of one another with stack contain- ers, which act like ﬂip charts pasted on the top with one pane showing at a time. The second part of the chapter will cover all of these elements.  16.1 Theme Structure  OK, suppose you’ve placed a nice green widget on your page, only to ﬁnd it displays as blue. Where did the widget gets its blue color? And how do you change it? To answer those questions, you must know where to   THEME STRUCTURE  429  Figure 16.1: Bundled Themes: Nihilo, Soria, Tundra, and Tundra in A11y Mode  look in the Dijit theme style sheets. So, let’s talk about what makes a theme and how it’s organized.  Up until now we’ve been using the bundled Tundra theme, and that’s a good choice for applications you build from scratch. In all, Dijit comes with three prepackaged themes:    Nihilo   dojoroot dijit themes nihilo nihilo.css : Greenish tint with very    Soria   dojoroot dijit themes soria soria.css : Dark blue tabs with    Tundra   dojoroot dijit themes tundra tundra.css : Very inobtrusive  bright buttons  lighter buttons  light gray and blue  In Figure 16.1, you can see these together for comparison.  If this is the printed book, the differences are less noticeable.   They not only look good, but Dijit themes are also easy to apply. You just include the appropriate style sheet and add a class to the   tag, as we saw in Section 2.3, Adding Dojo and Dijit to a Page, on page 22. This comes courtesy of a Dijit theme’s meticulous structure, which uses Cascading Style Sheets  CSS  principles to the hilt.  Each theme can also display in a11y mode. When people with low vision or no vision use the application, particular design element choices may mean a lot. By detecting whether the computer’s high-contrast setting is on  wherever that is in the operating system , Dijit in effect adjusts the theme for the high-contrast colors.   THEME STRUCTURE  430  Most look-and-feel decisions are coded in the theme. You may want to review or override those decisions in these cases:    A Dijit element doesn’t look quite right, and you want to see the styles used in creating it. For example, you may need to change a widget’s z-order to properly position your nonwidget elements.    You want to change the look of an individual widget or an entire Dijit class. For example, you may be placing your logo next to an element whose colors clash.    You are creating your own Dijit class, and you need to add styles  for it.    An element looks correct in one browser, say Internet Explorer, and not in another, such as Firefox, and you need to analyze why. As we’ll see, Dijit has facilities for applying different styles to dif- ferent browser types.  So ﬁrst, we’ll go over the styles and CSS elements that make up a Dijit theme. Then we’ll see how to change theme styles at the HTML element or style sheet level. Finally, we’ll look at the a11y theme, how it helps users with low vision, and how you can tap into its functionality. An understanding of the rules and extensions will make you an uber widget developer, loved and respected by one and all!  Files That Make Up a Theme  A theme, code-wise, is simply CSS and some matching background images. Like good object-oriented design, good CSS design uses pat- terns to prevent redundancy and improve readability.1 Fortunately, learning to navigate those patterns will go a long way toward making themes work the way you want.  All themes load the “super style sheet” dojoroot dijit themes dijit.css. This ﬁle deﬁnes very few visual elements but instead factors out common elements among all style sheets. In addition, the a11y theme is deﬁned here so developers don’t need to include it on every page  the a11y theme is autoselected, as we’ll see in Section 16.3, A11y and Themes, on page 440 .  The tundra directory includes tundra.css and a directory of images used for rendering the components. You may wonder why Dijit components  1. For some background on good CSS design, I recommend Eric Meyer’s CSS: The Deﬁni- tive Guide [Mey06] and Jeffrey Zeldman’s Designing with Web Standards [Zel06].   THEME STRUCTURE  431  use images for arrows, colored backgrounds, and other things. Why not use plain HTML styles or wingdings? First, it allows you to better match the graphic with the theme. Second, images look consistent across plat- forms. With regular controls, the width of a   box, for example, could cause wrapping on a Mac but not on Windows. Third, you can include images as part of the background elements. That way you can keep your design variations segregated to the style sheet.  Style Namespaces  Tundra.css has more than 300 styles. That requires some enterprise- level organization. At the very least, you want to prevent CSS name collisions since these cause hard-to-ﬁnd style problems with no error messages. For example, you may want a tag with class="SaveButtonSmall" to look different in a big dialog box than in a small one. Many JavaScript toolkits try to distinguish the two by cramming on preﬁxes. So, in a toolkit called EnRoute with a dialog box component BigDialogBox, you might see a class name EnRouteBigDialogBoxSaveButtonSmall. Now that’s a typing accident waiting to happen. What’s worse is that in a BigDialogBox you end up typing the preﬁx EnRouteBigDialogBox in all your classes—a lot of useless repetition.  Other languages solve this problem with namespaces. For example, Java classes form a namespace where com.pragprog.foo.Bar is a dif- ferent class than com.pragprog.open.Bar. Through Java’s import state- ment, you can say “whenever you see Bar in this class, assume it’s com.pragprog.open.Bar.” That’s much easier on your typing hand. And because Java namespaces are guaranteed unique by the ﬁle system, you can mix classes from different vendors freely, even if they use the same class names.  Although CSS does not have a native namespace feature, Dijit simu- lates one with compound selectors. A compound selector is just a string of selectors that match a hierarchy of tags. For example, here’s a selec- tor used for the dijit.TitlePane widget:  .tundra .dijitTitlePaneTitle .dijitOpenCloseArrowOuter {  margin-right:5px;  }  This says “match any tag with class dijitOpenCloseArrowOuter that sits inside a tag with class dijitTitlePaneTitle, which in turns sits inside a tag with class tundra.” So in Figure 16.2, on the next page, you can see how CSS matches each part of the selector. That selector does look longish.   THEME STRUCTURE  432  Figure 16.2: Matching compound selectors to HTML classes  But now the widget needs to place only class="dijitOpenCloseArrowOuter" in the tag and rely on parent nodes to match the rest. Hence, the class names are shorter, and you save bytes in your HTML. Furthermore, other widgets can reuse class="dijitOpenCloseArrowOuter" without acciden- tally applying TitlePane’s margin-right:5px;.  What does that mean for you? Suppose you want to know “why is this arrow green and not blue?” Firebug’s inspect mode tells you the arrow has class="dijitOpenCloseArrowOuter". If tundra.css has two selectors that end with .dijitOpenCloseArrowOuter, you just follow the parent tags up. If you ﬁnd a class="dijitTitlePaneTitle", then you match our earlier selector. Note also that the selector does not use .titlePane. If it did, an open close arrow inside a TitlePane’s button would also match that selector, which we don’t want to happen.  “Hey!” you might say, “My code uses dijit.TitlePane, but I never used a dijit- TitlePaneTitle class in it.” Good point. It’s not there in original HTML or in the View Source window. Instead, a   with that class was created after the page was loaded by dojo.parser.  See the sidebar on page 24 for details.  This is yet another case where Firebug is indispensable. As you can see in Figure 16.3, on the next page, Firebug shows the HTML as it exists on the screen now, that is, after dojo.parser had ﬁnished with it. View Source shows only the untouched, pristine downloaded copy of the HTML.   THEME STRUCTURE  433  Figure 16.3: Firebug DOM window shows element inserted by Dijit  The descendents need not be direct descendents to match, which is a good thing. Often you ﬁnd yourself wrapping your widgets in   tags or HTML tables or in other structures. For example, you might introduce a tag between the tables or in other structures; speciﬁcally, you might introduce a tag between the tag with class="tundra" and the tag with class="dijitTitlePaneTitle". But the selector .tundra .dijitTitlePaneTitle will still match. This bit of magic allows you to have one class="tundra" in your entire document.  Style Inheritance  That covers matching rules to nodes. A totally separate issue, style inheritance, also beneﬁts from this namespace-like structure. Because .one is contained in .tundra, then .one inherits the styles of .tundra and may override them for themselves and their children.  Word processors often do this in their own style sheets. You may have a Normal style that deﬁnes text as Times 11 pt, 7" lines, and so on. A quote style, then, may be deﬁned as Normal + 5" lines indented 1" on the left. If you want to change the entire paper to Helvetica, you need to change only the Normal style. This is a simple object-oriented inheritance applied to a nonprogramming language.  Let’s take an example from Dijit. The following rule...  .tundra .dijitTitlePaneTitle .dijitOpenCloseArrowOuter {  margin-right:5px;  }  }  has a parent rule:  .tundra .dijitTitlePaneTitle {  background: cccccc; background:fafafa url "titleBarBg.gif"  repeat-x bottom left; border:1px solid bfbfbf; padding:4px 4px 2px 4px; cursor: pointer;   THEME STRUCTURE  434  Figure 16.4: Firebug CSS window  Because .tundra .dijitTitlePaneTitle .dijitOpenCloseArrowOuter has no cursor attribute, it inherits the one in .tundra .dijitTitlePaneTitle, in this case, a pointer.  Firebug also shows you the inheritance rules at work, as you can see in Figure 16.4. In this right window, the most speciﬁc rules appear on top and go down to least speciﬁc at the bottom. If a more speciﬁc rule overrides a style of a less speciﬁc one, Firebug crosses out the overridden style. That’s very helpful in debugging.  Browser-Speciﬁc Styles  Styles do not always render the same in Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari. This is an annoying problem, but Dijit themes make life easier. Certain styles are applied only in a speciﬁc browser, and ﬁnding these styles can help you debug design inconsistencies. They can also help you with your own theme extensions. In most cases, design incompat- ibilities can be solved by a small change to the style. For example, a style that renders ﬁne in Mozilla may require a position:absolute to work in Internet Explorer.  In tundra.css, a few styles break the “all selectors begin with the theme name” rule. Here are some examples:  .dj_ie6 .tundra .dijitInputField,  The module dijit._base.Sniff is part of Dijit Base  meaning it’s automati- cally included anytime you load a widget; you don’t need to dojo.require   CHANGING LOOK AND FEEL  435  it . Sniff detects the user’s browser and adds one or more of the following classes to the outermost   element:    dj_ie: Any version of Internet Explorer  note: only 6 and 7 are sup-  ported by Dojo     dj_ie6: Internet Explorer 6.x   dj_ie7: Internet Explorer 7.x   dj_iequirks: Internet Explorer in quirks mode   dj_safari: Safari   dj_gecko: Mozilla, Firefox, Netscape  For example, an Internet Explorer 6 browser running in quirks mode will have its   element changed to the following:     Now any selectors in tundra.css beginning with .dj_ie6 will apply. The Dijit designers use these selectors to ﬁx any browser “mistakes” with styles. For example, if Internet Explorer 6 needs a style foo: bar but this style makes Firefox render incorrectly, then they write the rule .dj_ie6 { foo: bar }. This guarantees the rule will be applied only in Internet Explorer 6. It’s seamless and much cleaner than using CSS hacks—styles that deliberately break CSS processing in certain browsers.  But what about the .tundra .dijitInputField selectors? Will they ﬁre too? Fortunately, no. Under the rules of CSS, if there is more than one matching selector, the most speciﬁc will apply. Since .dj_ie6 .tundra .dijitIn- putField is more speciﬁc than .tundra .dijitInputField, it alone will be applied in Internet Explorer 6.  Dijit uses compound selectors and inheritance to improve the service- ability of a style. Now that you understand the structure, you can debug a style with ease.  16.2 Changing Look and Feel  Now that you’ve found the offending style, what does it take to change it? By “change it,” you can either do it statically, meaning that when the page renders the look and feel is ﬁxed, or do it dynamically through JavaScript events or user actions. Well, if you’re like us, you will be tempted to do the following:    Hack the theme style sheet  static changes .   CHANGING LOOK AND FEEL  436    Change the style properties directly through JavaScript like this: ’red’;  document.getElementById "errorMsg" .style.backgroundColor  dynamic changes .  =  Don’t do it! Hacking theme style sheets is bad because the next Dojo upgrade will overwrite your changes. And don’t delude yourself into thinking “I’ll remember to keep my copy of that ﬁle.” You won’t. Trust me. And changing the styles directly from JavaScript violates the sep- aration of concerns: keep the content in the HTML, the code in Java- Script modules, and the design in CSS. After all, CSS was invented to convey style and design decisions. JavaScript was not.  But no worries here. There are nice, safe ways to change the look and feel of elements. We’ll see how to make static changes to individual elements and whole classes of elements. We’ll cover a little about how to design your own theme. Lastly, we’ll see how to change elements dynamically by manipulating classes.  Individual Elements  You can override the design settings of a theme by ﬁlling in the style= attribute of a tag. For example, you could change a button tag directly like this:    ... <input type="button" dojoType="dijit.Button"  style="background-color:red"  >  But then it will always be red, no matter what the Soria theme states. In keeping with our theme of putting elements in their proper ﬁles, it’s preferable to write this in the button:    ...    and in your application style sheet:  soreThumb { background-color: red; }  Element Classes  If you wanted to make all the Soria theme buttons red, you wouldn’t want to change each and every button. To change a theme style over all pages, there are two methods.   You could simply add a style with the same selector as the theme style. So if soria.css has this...  CHANGING LOOK AND FEEL  437  then you would place this in your application style sheet:  .soria .dijitButton {  height:30px; padding:0px; border-width:0px; background-color:transparent; background-repeat:no-repeat; margin:5px;  .soria .dijitButton {  height:30px; padding:0px; border-width:0px; background-color:red; background-repeat:no-repeat; margin:5px;  There are two issues here:    You must make very sure to load your style sheet after soria.css,  since the last style with the same selector wins.    If soria.css changes, you may have to make corresponding changes  to your application style sheet.  If you can guarantee the browser is Firefox, Safari, or Internet Explorer 7 and newer, there’s a more “dijit-friendly” method: introduce your own outer class. For example, you can make a mySoria selector and place it in the   element:     Then your application style sheet elements will be as follows:  .mySoria.soria .dijitButton {  height:30px; padding:0px; border-width:0px; background-color:red; background-repeat:no-repeat; margin:5px;  Notice how .mySoria and .soria are smooshed together, meaning these two classes must be applied to the same tag. This technique doesn’t suffer from the earlier ﬁrst problem and requires only a little extra HTML. The  }  }  }   CHANGING LOOK AND FEEL  438  downside is versions of Internet Explorer 6 and older do not handle these multiple-class selectors properly.  Sections  Perhaps you need even more radical surgery. Say you need Soria’s form elements but Tundra’s text style. No problem!  Simply surround any section with   tags, and give them the theme you want as a class. For example:    Lorum ipsum dolor...     <input type="button" dojoType="dijit.Button"     >  The bottom line is that as long as the theme class is outside the dijit components, they can go in any HTML tag. They don’t need to go into body. But if you use this method, make sure your theme sections don’t overlap; a section with two overlapping themes will pick the last-loaded theme. Such effects can be difﬁcult to diagnose.  Themes from Scratch  For the mother of all modiﬁcations, you can write your own theme. Although we don’t normally recommend copy and paste, in this case it makes good sense to copy an established Dijit theme to one of your own and then modify it. After all, there are 300 styles to change.  Here are a few tips to make this process easier:    Place design decisions as far up the tree as you can. If you ﬁnd yourself repeating the same style decision in peer classes with the same ancestor, push the style up to the ancestor.    If you have an existing style sheet, use it as a rough guide for coding styles in your theme. You may want to place your theme styles directly in the existing style sheet and use inheritance there.  Dynamic Changes  After the previous three sections, the following rule shouldn’t be sur- prising: you change an element’s look by changing its class. This is the way that Dijit changes the look of its own elements. Replacing a class in JavaScript is straightforward: domElememnt.className = ’newStyle”. And don’t forget about the Dojo functions addClass, removeClass, hasClass,   CHANGING LOOK AND FEEL  439  and toggleClass discussed in Section 7.1, Core Dojo DOM Utility Func- tions, on page 140. For example,  dojroot dijit Menu.js has this...  dojo.addClass this.arrow, "dijitMenuRightArrowEnabled" ;  which, when combined with the style  this one from tundra.css , effec- tively makes arrowRight.png magically appear:  .tundra .dijitMenuRightArrowEnabled {  margin-top:4px; background:url 'images arrowRight.png'  no-repeat bottom center; display:inline;  CSS classes work really well for recording state. Say you have an elec- trical switch whose icons are switchon.png and switchoff.png. Rather than using a Boolean variable to keep track of the on off state, we can use classes dijitOn and dijitOff to keep track. First place these icons in the styles:  .tundra .dijitLightSwitch {     The light switch cover is brown, no matter what the state  background-color: brown;  } .tundra .dijitLightSwitch.dijitOn {  url "images switchon.png" ;  } .tundra .dijitLightSwitch.dijitOff {  url "images switchoff.png" ;  }  }  Notice how .dijitOn is crammed up next to .dijitLightSwitch in the selector. That means both classes must appear in the same element, though they could be listed in either order.  You could then change the className attribute to either dijitOn or dijitOff. Note also that the .tundra .dijitLightSwitch selector matches in either case, so the background of the image  which will show through any trans- parent colors  will always be brown. Dojo helper functions help change the state of these icons without disturbing other classes:  dojo.toggleClass "livingRoomSwitch", "dijitOff" ; dojo.toggleClass "livingRoomSwitch", "dijitOn" ;  Using a class name for the control state ensures that the data and the visual state are always in sync. Yet again, we have followed the DRY  Don’t Repeat Yourself  rule, and our agility is assured.  To sum up, changing the look and feel of elements can be accomplished cleanly and without redundancy. You can change the look of individual   A11Y AND THEMES  440  elements with an overriding  . You can change the look of an entire element by overriding the theme style in your own CSS. You can start with a new theme altogether. And you can change the look of elements programmatically by adding, subtracting, and querying the classes attached to an element.  16.3 A11y and Themes  In Chapter 15, Form Controls, on page 394, we introduced a11y as an integral part of Dijit. Its keyboard alternatives make navigating wid- gets possible for users with low mobility or users with screen-reading programs. Now we’ll look at using Dijit a11y for users with impaired vision. At ﬁrst you might think, “Why would someone with low vision care about colors and fonts?” At the level of choosing between Lucida Sans and Verdana, they probably wouldn’t. But the difference between orange and black could be the difference between reading everything and nothing.  Low-vision users correct for this by using high-contrast color schemes bundled with Windows, Gnome, KDE, or Mac OS. These schemes map foreground colors to white and background colors to black, or vice versa. Modern browsers detect this and adjust their default style sheets to match this setup. However, most web sites don’t use the default— they use their own style sheets. If that style sheet is not a11y-friendly, the user can turn it off altogether in the browser and substitute their own. The trouble here, especially for Dijit users, is the styles contain layout and size information critical to proper display.  Background images are also ineffective for low-vision users, so many opt to turn images off altogether. For a11y design, this rule is key: never convey information in background images and colors only. For exam- ple, simply turning a textbox red is not a11y-friendly. Adding a tooltip to display the error message, as Dijit’s ValidatingTextBoxes do, makes it acceptable to both audiences.  The trouble is while a11y discourages the use of background images, Dijit’s CSS-based design philosophy encourages the use of background images. That’s because you specify background images as part of a CSS style. A11y design traditionally uses HTML foreground images with a title= attribute like this:      A11Y AND THEMES  441  Figure 16.5: Progress bar in Tundra  The title “Go up” is read out loud by a screen reader. Unfortunately, CSS has no provision for a title attached to a background image. We can partially get around this with keyboard handling and Web Accessi- bility Initiative  WAI  rules. This, however, limits low-vision users to the keyboard.  Dijit solves this knotty problem in a clever way. Whenever you load the base Dijit classes, which happens anytime you use dojo.require to load a Dijit component, Dijit performs a small test:  1. It constructs a small red and green bordered box outside of the browser limits. Because of its coordinates, the user will never actually see it.  2. Dijit then tests to see whether the actual colors of the box borders are green and red. If they’re not, Dijit takes that to mean its own style sheet is off.  3. Then, exactly like setting the dj_ie and dj_gecko styles, it tags the  document with a dijit_a11y class.  4. Whenever a component needs an a11y alternate, the Dijit style sheet, dijit.css, has overriding rules with selectors beginning with dijit_a11y.  One widget that capitalizes on this is ProgressBar, which we’ll learn about in Chapter 15, Form Controls, on page 394. Tundra shades the com- pleted portion differently than the uncompleted portion, as shown in Figure 16.5. The dijit_a11y class shifts the style rules to make it look like Figure 16.6, on the next page. Now the bar border conveys the progress information clearly.  So, what does this mean to you as a theme designer? Actually, not a lot. The whole point of a11y mode is to prevent you from having to code style sheets in two versions. However, just as you test your design changes in various browsers, so you should test them in a11y mode. It’s   PANES: CONTENTPANE AND TITLEPANE  442  Figure 16.6: Progress bar in a11y mode  easy to do this without changing your color scheme to high contrast. Simply add this...  dojo.addClass dojo.body  , "dijit_a11y" ;  to your header code. This activates the dijit_a11y mode artiﬁcially.  In summary, the Dijit theme system brings order to the chaos of look and feel. By grouping rules into a CSS style sheet with hierarchical structure, you apply the DRY rule to color, shape, and layout. Making sweeping changes is as easy as changing a style close to the hierar- chical top. Yet it’s ﬂexible enough to allow overriding at any level for exceptional cases.  Dijit themes also help you make sense of different browser needs, by allowing browser-speciﬁc styles to accommodate different interpreta- tions of the CSS standards. And a11y styles accommodate the needs of those with low vision or no vision.  Though design decisions in these instances may require thought, hav- ing the places to plug in those changes gives you a sizable head start. The Dijit themes provided are well commented and structured, so you can use them as guidelines for your own work. This is a far cry from the days of black backgrounds with purple, blinking text!  16.4 Panes: ContentPane and TitlePane  For the next three sections, we’ll take a look at the layout widgets. If themes manage the color in your application, you could say layout widgets manage the whitespace. They align elements, stack elements on each other, or pull content from other sources, among other tasks.   PANES: CONTENTPANE AND TITLEPANE  443  You can group layout elements into three classes:    Panes, which deﬁne blocks of content    Alignment containers, which place panes beside one another    Stack containers, which stack panes and alignment containers on  each other, revealing one pane at a time  So ﬁrst we’ll look at the pane widgets dijit.layout.ContentPane and dijit. TitlePane,2 which are like Dijit layout “atoms.” ContentPane is a general- purpose blank pane, while TitlePane adds an expando button to show or hide the content.  The easiest form of ContentPane simply renders the content between the tags. This code displays a slot machine:  Download themes_and_design content_panes.html  <div dojoType="dijit.layout.ContentPane"  style="width:100px;height:200px;float:left" id="slot1">     cherry        cherry        bar       <div dojoType="dijit.layout.ContentPane"  style="width:100px;height:200px;float:left" id="slot2">     <div dojoType="dijit.layout.ContentPane"  style="width:100px;height:200px;float:left" id="slot3">     It’s not very exciting so far. . . this does little more than a plain   tag. It gets more interesting, though, when you programmatically mod- ify content.  2. Note this is the only layout widget not in dijit.layout.   PANES: CONTENTPANE AND TITLEPANE  444  The click of a button pulls the slot machine arm to get a new triple:  Download themes_and_design content_panes.html     Pull Arm    var slotValues=["cherry", "lemon", "orange", "bar", "seven"]; function randomSlotButton   {  var thisSlot = slotValues[Math.floor Math.random  *5 ]; return " " + thisSlot + " ";  } dijit.byId "slot1" .setContent randomSlotButton   ; dijit.byId "slot2" .setContent randomSlotButton   ; dijit.byId "slot3" .setContent randomSlotButton   ;        ContentPane’s setContent method takes care of the widget parsing auto- matically. Remember that Dojo’s parser turns tags with dojoType into real HTML tags. Just setting an innerHTML property on a DOM node is not enough.  setContent has one caveat, however—code in   tags will not run. In particular, that means you can’t use dojo.require in the content tag; you must make sure to do it in the main HTML ﬁle. If you absolutely need to run script tags, we do have a solution for that in a little bit.  Where ContentPane gets really interesting is in loading external content. You can simply call setHref, give it a URL, and you’re done. So, put the following code in spinner_try1.html:   document.write slotValues[Math.floor Math.random  *5 ] ;   Download themes_and_design spinner-try1.html        Then you can load it in with setHref:  Download themes_and_design content_panes.html     Pull Arm Remotely      var includeUrl="spinner-try1.html";    This one works: var includeUrl="spinner-try2.html"; dijit.byId "slot1" .setHref includeUrl ; dijit.byId "slot2" .setHref includeUrl ; dijit.byId "slot3" .setHref includeUrl ;         PANES: CONTENTPANE AND TITLEPANE  445  Uh-oh. If you actually ran this content, you’d see three blank buttons. That’s because as with setContent, setHref does not run the   tags. Fortunately, there’s an easy workaround—simply use dojo method scripts, as we did in Section 12.4, Extension Points, on page 331. Recall that code in a dojo method script nested in a widget and having no event property executes when the widget is created. So, this simple rewrite does the job:3  Download themes_and_design spinner-try2.html        alert "hello!" ; var slotValues=["cherry", "lemon", "orange", "bar", "seven"]; this.setLabel slotValues[Math.floor Math.random  *5 ] ;        This trick works well if you control the code. But if you must use plain   tags, dojox.layout.ContentPane  note the dojox  overcomes those limitation, if somewhat imperfectly. Dojox’s ContentPane applies liberal rewriting to the incoming content, so the URLs are executed relative to the including HTML. That rewriting can cause hard-to-diagnose prob- lems. Nevertheless, the option is available if you need it.  A couple more tips are in order. First, the included content must form legal HTML when plopped into the page. This point also holds true for setContent, but you must especially watch out for it in external content because it’s easy to include peripheral tags like   if you’re not careful.  Finally, because setHref uses XHR to load content, it’s subject to the same-domain rule. If you want to aggregate off-site content, you can always use the proxy technique shown in Section 12.2, Finding and Manipulating Declarative Widgets, on page 322.  If you’re used to server-side programming in ASP, JSP, PHP, and so on, you probably recognize ContentPane as a modularization technique. Absolutely! If your HTML documents share a common snippet of code, you can factor that out into its own ﬁle and use ContentPane to include it in multiple pages. It’s good for cutting long HTML pages into manage- able pieces, even if the pieces are not reused.  3. This trick, unfortunately, does not seem to work in Internet Explorer 6 as of Dojo 1.1.   PANES: CONTENTPANE AND TITLEPANE  446  Increasing Perceived Performance  In addition to separating content and making replacement easy, Con- tentPanes can also “look” fast. Imagine a content-laden page. It sounds like rendering everything instantly would be a big advantage, but it’s not. Humans can take in only so much information, and it’s just as good to render the parts they want ﬁrst and ﬁll in the other details later. ContentPane can help you increase this perceived performance in three ways:    Simultaneous loading maximizes throughput by loading separate  pieces with separate, simultaneous server requests.    Lazy loading defers loading long-running web requests until the  user asks for it.    Pane reloading refreshes only the parts of the screen that need  refreshing, rather than refreshing the entire page.  To use simultaneous loading, you place the major web page pieces into ContentPanes, each loaded from a different URL. Modern browsers make many HTTP connections at once, each of which communicates with the web server. Usually there’s one grabbing the HTML itself, while others grab images, causing the page to shift and rerender as images ﬁll in. ContentPane allows this with any content. Of course, there is a risk that certain pieces don’t render, and you are left with an 80% complete page. But this risk usually is small.  Lazy loading involves tying a setHref to a user event like onClick. For example, if one of your page sections takes a long time to run, you can simply leave that as a blank ContentPane and use setHref when the user requests the information.  A common mistake developers make in lazy loading is to set the href property of ContentPane in the tag and then set the style to display:none:  Download themes_and_design title_panes.html  <div dojoType="dijit.layout.ContentPane" style="width:200px;height:200px"  style="display:none" id="contentPane" href="spinner-try2.html">     This still executes the content load, and in fact ContentPane ignores the display:none altogether. So unless you need the content right away, you should leave the href property blank.   THE ALIGNMENT CONTAINER: BORDERCONTAINER  447  Lazy loading is such a popular paradigm that Dijit offers a variant of ContentPane named TitlePane. TitlePane adds a border, a title bar on the top, and an expando button on the top-right corner. Clicking the expando toggles between hiding and showing the content.  TitlePane uses the same options as ContentPane and adds two more: title, which speciﬁes the title on the top bar, and open, which you can set to false to initially hide the content, leaving only the title bar and expando button visible. In a TitlePane, you can set the href in the properties to some content. It will not be loaded until the user clicks the expando button. To illustrate this, the following example uses TitlePane to show a bar:  Download themes_and_design title_panes.html  <div dojoType="dijit.TitlePane" style="width:200px;height:200px"  title="Open to see the spinner" id="titlePane" href="spinner-try2.html" open="false">     Even with href=, the open="false" tells Dijit not to load the URL contents until the user opens the pane. This works great for portals, where each portlet can use its own TitlePane and slow ones can be initially closed.  Finally, you can refresh a section of the page with pane reloading. Here you set a ContentPane to a URL and then reload content as it changes. The URL must be a server-side program whose contents could change with the data environment. There’s one caveat. Let’s say you ask for personlist.php and then issue a setHref to load it again. Dojo caches pages and will hand back the same content without calling the server. You disable this with preventCache="true" in the ContentPane. preventCache= also adds a random hash mark to the URL, which effectively disables server-side caching.  16.5 The Alignment Container: BorderContainer  If panes are the one-dimensional points of layout, then an alignment container is a two-dimensional plane of layout. Dijit has one align- ment container named dijit.layout.BorderContainer whose sole purpose is to keep panes next to each other.4 It’s a more readable alternative to CSS’s positioning and ﬂoating attributes.  In releases 0.9 and 1.0, Dijit provided two alignment containers: dijit.layout. 4. LayoutContainer with ﬁxed boundaries and dijit.layout.SplitContainer with user-movable boundaries. In 1.1, their functionality has been merged into dijit.layout.BorderContainer.   THE ALIGNMENT CONTAINER: BORDERCONTAINER  448  top  top  leading  center  trailing  leading  center  trailing  bottom  sidebar  bottom  headline  Figure 16.7: BorderContainer designs: headline and sidebar  A BorderContainer looks like this:  <div dojoType="dijit.layout.BorderContainer" style="width:«width»; height:«height»">  <div dojoType="dijit.layout.ContentPane" region="center"  style="height:«region height»">  Center content Pane content    <div dojoType="dijit.layout.ContentPane" region="top"  style="height:«region height»">  Top content Pane content  ... panes for leading, trailing and bottom regions        A BorderContainer consists of ﬁve regions: top, bottom, leading, trailing, and center, as shown in Figure 16.7. leading and trailing are synonyms for left and right in left-to-right languages like English, and vice versa for right-to-left languages.  Each region’s content is in a ContentPane with a region= attribute on each. BorderContainer requires only one region—the center one—and all others are optional and may be speciﬁed in any order.  Width and height are very important in a BorderContainer and its Con- tentPanes. The BorderContainer itself requires a ﬁxed width and height. The regions top and bottom must have a height, which may be either a ﬁxed size or a percentage. Similarly, the leading and trailing regions must have a width, either a ﬁxed size or a percentage. The center region must not have dimensions, however. The center region area is what’s leftover from the other regions.   THE ALIGNMENT CONTAINER: BORDERCONTAINER  449  minSize  maxSize  Figure 16.8: A splitter allows user-resizable regions.  BorderContainers come in two designs—headline and sidebar—speciﬁed in the design= attribute. The difference between them is which regions get priority. In the headline design, shown on the left of Figure 16.7, on the previous page, the top and bottom regions have top priority and get all the space between the left and right borders. It looks like a news- paper with a headline in the top region. The sidebar design gives more weight to the leading and trailing regions, and they grab all the space from top to bottom.  What if the user disagrees with your region sizing choices? You can put the sizing power in their hands with splitters. A splitter is a draggable border between two panes, and you add one to a ContentPane with the splitter="true" attribute. This makes the center-facing border draggable. If you want to keep the user in reasonable bounds, you can specify minSize= and or maxSize= attributes on the ContentPane, as shown in Figure 16.8. These sizes constrain the area of that particular region and default to 0px and Inﬁnity, respectively, to mean “no constraints.”  The following example places the programmer questionnaire of Chap- ter 7 in a tidy layout with a headline and help on the side  although the Help will probably not help anybody here . The result is shown in Figure 16.9, on the next page.   THE ALIGNMENT CONTAINER: BORDERCONTAINER  450  Figure 16.9: A BorderContainer in action  Download themes_and_design border_container.html  <div dojoType="dijit.layout.BorderContainer" design="headline"  style="width:600px; height:400px" liveSizing="true">  <div dojoType="dijit.layout.ContentPane" region="top"  style="height:75px">  Programmer Survey      <div dojoType="dijit.layout.ContentPane" region="leading"  splitter="true" style="width:200px">  <div dojoType="dojobook.creating_widgets.widgets.GreekingWidget"  paragraphs="1" tag="blockquote">              <div dojoType="dijit.layout.ContentPane" region="center"  href=".. dom questions4.htm">  The liveSizing= attribute of BorderContainer controls whether panes are redrawn during dragging. Setting it to true helps the user by giving visual feedback on how the resizing will look. But it can be slow if your ContentPanes have a great deal of HTML in them.  Finally, like dijit.Tree, BorderContainer can save the state of the sliders in a browser cookie. Just set persist= to true, and everything is done automagically. Users will love not having to tinker with the borders every time they use your app.  Now we’ve covered the ﬁrst and second dimensions of layout, so natu- rally stack containers are next.   STACK CONTAINERS  451  Figure 16.10: Stack containers  top to bottom : TabContainer, Accordion- Container, StackContainer  16.6 Stack Containers  Stack containers extend layouts into the third dimension. They contain an ordered series of panes stacked on top of one another like equally sized pieces of paper. Only one pane is visible at a time. Stack contain- ers are useful when you need to ﬁt a lot of information into a little space and you can naturally divide that information into groups. It’s also nice for presenting ordered series of questions, as in a wizard.  Dijit has three stack containers. dijit.layout.StackContainer is the most generic and requires you to provide navigation and control code. The other two, dijit.layout.AccordionContainer and dijit.layout.TabContainer, pro- vide their own navigation controls. AccordionContainer buttons appear inline with the panes, while TabContainer buttons ﬁt along the top, as shown in Figure 16.10.  Because pane widgets are nested right inside the stack container, they are called children or child panes. StackContainer and TabContainer allow   STACK CONTAINERS  452  s: StackContainer  s: StackContainer  s.removeChild pane3 ;  pane1  pane2  pane3  pane1  pane2  pane3  s.addChild pane4,1 ;  pane4  s.back  ;  s.forward  ;  s.selectChild pane2 ;  Figure 16.11: Stack container modiﬁcation and navigation APIs  ContentPanes as their child pages, while AccordionContainers allow only AccordionPanes. Attributes are the same in both ContentPane and Accor- dionPane, but in an AccordionPane, the title= attribute accepts widgets, while ContentPanes do not.  We already saw an example of TabContainer in Chapter 2, Powerful Web Forms Made Easy, on page 20 and an example of AccordionCon- tainer in Section 12.2, Finding and Manipulating Declarative Widgets, on page 322. The StackContainer is especially useful in wizards, where there’s a well-deﬁned sequence of viewing the pages.  Dijit has a common stack container API. All StackContainer objects re- spond to these calls, and you use them to add or remove panes from the stack or navigate in between stack pages. On the left side of Fig- ure 16.11, you can see the stack modiﬁcation methods addChild and removeChild. All panes in a stack are numbered from 0 to numberOfPanes - 1, and you can use addChild’s second parameter to insert a pane in a particular spot. All panes from that point move up one in the sequence. Consequently, removeChild removes a particular pane from the list and pushes elements down one to ﬁll the gap.  When the user views a stackContainer, there is always one pane on top and fully viewable. You can move to a particular pane with selectChild, as shown on the right side of Figure 16.11. Or you can move forward or backward one pane with forward and back. These methods are essential for building wizards and other StackContainer widgets, and you usually wire them to the onClick extension point of a button.   STACK CONTAINERS  453  Here’s a wizard with multiple navigation paths based on user input:  Download themes_and_design wizard.html  Line 1  <div dojoType="dijit.layout.StackContainer" jsId="sc"  style="width:300px;height:300px">      Did you eat your meat?

This Pink Floyd–inspired wizard has four panes in its StackContainer. Each has a jsId= attribute to create a JavaScript variable pointing to the widget. That makes them easily accessible by selectChild, which is helpful for leaping around to various panes according to the input.  The ﬁrst pane starts at line 4 and displays a radio button. When the user clicks the Next button, the code at line 14 ﬁres, branching to either the pudding or noPudding pane according to the radio button. The other three panes follow the same pattern, using selectChild for most pane switching except for a back in line 34 and a forward in line 60.  Note that the entire wizard acts as a form, not just the visible pane. That makes it very nice for gathering a large amount of input and submitting it in one shot.  You’re probably thinking, “That’s a lot of code. I think I’ll build a wiz- ard widget to handle all that button stuff automagically.” You’re such an overachiever! An easier way is to use the dojox.widget.Wizard widget, which wires up Next, Previous, Done, and Cancel buttons for you and is more style-aware than our example.  Using Dijit is like getting your own open source art studio. From adding dots of color to creating page-sized layouts, Dijit provides scalable and easy-to-use tools for your creative side.   Chapter 17  Creating and Extending Widget Classes  Up until now, we’ve been pretty content using the bundled Dijit com- ponents. They’re pretty ﬂexible in themselves: you can change the look and behavior of individual widgets easily. But what about changing an entire class of widgets? On the look-and-feel side, you can override a widget-level style with style= or a widget class-level style through CSS, as we saw in Chapter 16, Dijit Themes, Design, and Layout, on page 428. It’d be nice to have the same ﬂexibility on the code side.  Recall  from Section 12.1, What Exactly Is a Widget?, on page 319  that a Dijit class is an object class whose methods call Dojo and native JavaScript libraries. You already know how to create a Dojo-based object class—you use dojo.Declare, as we saw in Chapter 9, Deﬁning Classes with dojo.declare, on page 225. Dijit classes are no different. You can use dojo.declare to deﬁne new widget classes, or you can sub- class existing widget classes to create new ones with different behavior. The whole power of object orientation is there to use.  You have more options in deﬁning widget classes than regular classes. In addition to using dojo.declare, you can deﬁne them declaratively through dijit.Declaration. The way you declare widget classes and the way you use them do not have to match: you can declare a widget class programmatically and create instances of it declaratively, or vice versa. Which method should you use? The trade-off is pretty much the same as for widgets themselves: the declarative way is easier, and the pro- grammatic way is more ﬂexible.   WIDGET CLASSES USING DIJIT.DECLARATION  456  Naturally, we’ll survey the easy way ﬁrst: dijit.Decaration. At the same time, we’ll cover the Dijit template language, used in both methods. Templates are the basis for most of the bundled Dijit components. Then we’ll contrast the programmatic method. Next we’ll cover the life cycle of a Dijit component, in which you can hook your own behavior. We’ll ﬁnish with the notes on extending classes and building a fairly sophis- ticated widget class.  17.1 Widget Classes Using dijit.Declaration  So, here’s the widget story so far. A programmer adds a dojoType= attribute to a tag. Upon starting the page, the Dojo parser picks up this tag and calls the widget constructor on it. That’s the declara- tive method. Alternatively, the programmer calls the widget construc- tor directly from JavaScript—the programmatic method. Either way the widget begins life as a single DOM node. Then the constructor expands this DOM node into a larger snippet of HTML. Most of the time this snippet comes from a template, and that’s where our journey begins.  Templates are nothing new. The venerable C language has macros, and even Microsoft Word’s mail merge facilities are just a template mecha- nism. Whatever the case, the idea is to provide some constant text and some placeholders so the template interpreter can ﬁll in the dynamic things later.  We’ve already used a “lite” version of templates, dojo.string.substitute, in Section 3.2, Function Literals, on page 43. Dijit uses the same ${} syntax and extends it. Dijit classes are not required to use templates—they may generate HTML from string or DOM functions. But templates are so useful that most widgets use them.  Dijit provides placeholders for straight text or for whole snippets of HTML:  ${arbitraryName}  Is replaced with a property from the widget class. Note this can be any property in the widget class or any superclass. A special case of this, ${id} is a property assigned to every widget—you can specify it yourself or let Dijit generate a unique one for you.     Is replaced with the body of the widget. Nested widgets are allowed.   WIDGET CLASSES USING DIJIT.DECLARATION  457     Is replaced with nothing. Instead, arbitraryName becomes a prop- erty of your widget class, holding the DOM node for the div tag. That way you can write things like this.arbitraryName.addChild  aContainedNode  and this.arbitraryName.className = ’enabledClass’. Note there is an implied attach point called domNode that holds the root DOM node—for example, the node with the dojoType in it.     Is also replaced with nothing but does a dojo.connect from this node, event evt1, to handler name handler1, which is expected to exist as a widget method. Connecting events this way saves you from having to retrieve the node later for a manual dojo.connect.  A special event called ondijitclick is a nice shortcut. It is ﬁred on a click, the downstroke of Enter , or the upstroke of the spacebar. By combining all the standard browser control activation events into one, you write just one handler and one event connection. That’s it!  Say, for example, you’re typing up your Christmas card list:  Download creating_widgets pre_dijit_declaration.html    td {  }                  border: 1pt solid black    Donald Trump  590 Trump Tower  New York, NY 55555     Open immediately!

So, we’ll build a simple widget that encapsulates it. To do this declaratively, you use a dojoType="dijit.Declaration" attribute. Our label will look like this:  Download creating_widgets dijit_declaration.html  Line 1    td {  border: 1pt solid black  }   <div dojoType="dijit.Declaration" widgetClass="CardLabel"  defaults="{name: 'Nobody', address: 'Nowhere', csz: 'Nowhere'}">       ${name}  ${address}  ${csz}        <div dojoType="CardLabel" name="Donald Trump" address="590 Trump Tower"  20  csz="New York, NY 55555">   Open immediately!     <div dojoType="CardLabel" name="Martha Stewart" address="Club Fed"  csz="Attica, NY 11111">   25     In line 6, we open the declaration and name the new widget class Card- Label. You must deﬁne the widget before any uses of it—think of it as a variable declaration of sorts.  Line 7 deﬁnes the attributes of the new class. Note the JavaScript hash literal here—each property of this hash essentially becomes an attribute of each widget. Because the object is called defaults, you might think you can omit properties that don’t have a default. Not true. You must specify every property here; otherwise, it will not be replaced properly in the template.  Now for the template elements. In line 10, ${name} is substituted with the name=property. In line 14, the body of the tag will be substituted verbatim.   WIDGET CLASSES USING DIJIT.DECLARATION  459  Figure 17.1: The Yellow Fade Technique in action  The Donald Trump label at line 20 will have “Open Immediately” here, while the Martha Stewart one, which has no body, will quietly ignore it.  The space savings are not obvious in our two-address example, but the more addresses you add, the more bandwidth you save. More impor- tant, the widget makes a clearer separation between data and design.  CardLabel is an application-speciﬁc widget class, one that’s not very useful beyond its page. Now we’ll use templates to create a more general widget class.  Example: The Yellow Fade Technique  People are not accustomed to dynamically changing web pages. There- fore, if small bits change on the screen, the user may easily overlook them. The book Ajax Design Patterns describes a pattern named One- Second Spotlight, where the changing portion of the screen is high- lighted for a second or two. Figure 17.1 illustrates the method. This visual indicator is intuitive and helpful yet unintrusive since the high- light disappears after a bit.  An alert box saying “Look! You have new info!”—that’s intrusive.   We’re going to implement a kind of one-second spotlight called the Yel- low Fade Technique. Pioneered by 37signals, the YFT has become a widespread Ajax user interface idiom. The idea is to color the back- ground pane yellow and fade it gently back to the original color over a few seconds. This gives the effect of running a highlighter pen over that pane. Our YFT widget, Changebox, will be a container widget. That means it’s there only to hold other widgets in a group, much like dijit.layout.ContentPane. Changebox will use dijit.Declaration and tem- plates, and in particular, the template’s containerNode attach point to render all the widgets inside.   WIDGET CLASSES USING DIJIT.DECLARATION  460  Download creating_widgets yft.html      Supply Chain      Tomato Price: $0.735 per pound   Onions: $0.466 per pound       Major Accounts      McDonald's: +3.11%    Burger King: -1.29%   Wendy's: unchanged       Competitor Stock      Heinz: $5.99 per share   Hunt Wesson: $8.12 per share   Wal Mart: $10.51 per share                           <div dojoType="dijit.form.Button" id="toolbar1.supply"  onClick="dojo.publish ' changebox supply' ;">Supply Change   <div dojoType="dijit.form.Button" id="toolbar1.majoracct"  onClick="dojo.publish ' changebox majoracct' ;">Major Acct Change   <div dojoType="dijit.form.Button" id="toolbar1.stock"  onClick="dojo.publish ' changebox stock' ;">Stock Change   Like the widgets in Section 12.5, Example: Live Forms, on page 338, the publish-subscribe event system comes in handy here. Generally, you will publish events from an asynchronous process like the load callback of dojo.getXhr. But here, a toolbar button click will ﬁre the topic—that’s a good technique for unit testing the widget.  dijit.Declaration deﬁnes a template, writes a heading, and places the inner HTML in the containerNode attach point:  Download creating_widgets yft.html  <div dojoType="dijit.Declaration" widgetClass="Changebox"  defaults="{boxId: 'None'}">  Changebox for ${boxId}   WIDGET CLASSES USING DOJO.DECLARE  461           Define YFT animation.    each widget, so we define a different animation fn for each.  The domNode is different for  this.animationFn = dojo.animateProperty {  node: this.domNode, duration: 2000, properties: {  }  } ;  backgroundColor: { start: "FFFF00", end: "FFFFFF" }     Fire it whenever the event  changebox boxId is published dojo.subscribe " changebox "+this.boxId, this, function   {  this.animationFn.play  ;  } ;        The interesting thing here is the load extension point. You will recall from Section 12.4, Extension Points, on page 331 that an extension point is a method the widget allows you to override. Like extension points ﬁlled in for a particular widget  cf. Section 12.4, Extension Points, on page 331 , extension points here are ﬁlled in with   tags of type dojo method. And they apply to each widget created by this class.  Although the code is shared among instances, the properties are not. Each instance of YFT needs a different animation function since the root nodes are different. That is perfectly ﬁne, and assigning this. animationFn separately for each instance ensures this is true.  Now you can use this widget anywhere, right?  Well, er. . . as long as you stay in the same HTML page, you’re ﬁne. But copying the dijit.Declaration from ﬁle to ﬁle isn’t such a good idea. And even if you do it smartly, such as through server-side includes, it’s simpler and cleaner just to use a programmatically deﬁned widget class. That’s what we’ll cover next.  17.2 Widget Classes Using dojo.declare  So, the Yellow Fade Technique was easy to deﬁne with dijit.Declaration. Declaring it programmatically is quite similar. Because every widget class is a Dojo object class, we use dojo.declare to deﬁne it. The result will be functionally equivalent to the dijit.Declaration version.   WIDGET CLASSES USING DOJO.DECLARE  462  Download creating_widgets yft_prog.html  Line 1  dojo.declare "Changebox",  [dijit._Widget, dijit._Templated], {    Holds the id attribute of the box on which to use YFT boxId: 'None',     Template templateString: " Changebox for ${boxId}"+  "   ",     Holds subscription handle changeboxSub: null,     postCreate is called after the widget has been constructed. postCreate: function   {  this.animationFn = dojo.animateProperty {  node: this.domNode, duration: 2000, properties: { backgroundColor: {  start: "FFFF00", end: "FFFFFF"  } }  } ;  }   ;  },  changeboxSub = dojo.subscribe   " changebox "+this.boxId, this, function   {  this.animationFn.play  ;  destroy: function   {     Unsubscribe from the event dojo.unsubscribe changeboxSub ; this.inherited arguments ;  }  } ;  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  15  20  25  30  35  Every programmatically deﬁned widget class uses dojo.declare, as in line 1. By the very deﬁnition of a Dijit class, we must subclass from dijit._Widget, as in line 2. Either dijit._Widget or a subclass of dijit._Widget must always be listed ﬁrst. Templated widgets must also mix in the class dijit._Templated.  Unlike declaratively deﬁned widget classes, you don’t need to specify a defaults attribute. Instead, you just deﬁne the properties right in the class. So, line 5 deﬁnes the boxId= attribute.   WIDGET CLASSES USING DOJO.DECLARE  463  The template can be embedded in the templateString property, as we’ve done here in line 9. There are actually three ways to deﬁne a template:  templateString  templatePath  The template is speciﬁed directly in the string. This requires you to escape certain characters, as you must do with all JavaScript string literals. This can make the code a little awkward.  The template is read from templatePath. Since the template needs to be legal HTML only, not a JavaScript string, escaped characters are unnecessary. During execution, it requires an extra XHR fetch to get the template. If this is too much of a performance drag, the build system described in Chapter 11, The Dojo Loader and Build System, on page 286 can turn these into embedded templateStrings for you.  templateNode  The template is in a DOM node and its descendents. Note tem- plateNode must be a DOM node, not an ID—in other words, you should pass dojo.byId "n"  and not "n". This creates a “template island” in your document, similar to data islands in Internet Ex- plorer. Remember to hide it with a display:none style.  Our initialization code goes into the postCreate property at line 15. postCreate= is one of the essential extension points of all widgets, which we’ll cover later in this chapter. To be nice, we unsubscribe to the topic in the destroy= extension point handler at line 34. Don’t wanna leave anyone hanging on the line, right?  So, the template language is essentially the same as dijit.Declaration, but there are two subtle differences:    The template must have only one outer node; for example, a tem- plate like The  end  is not legal, but  The  end    is ﬁne.    The template itself may have widgets, but only if you set the prop- erty widgetsInTemplate to true. This property is always true for dijit. Declaration-deﬁned widget classes.  Example: Greeking Widget  Another example will illustrate creating widget classes without a tem- plate. We’ll call this widget class GreekingWidget, and its purpose in life will be to generate meaningless sentences. That in itself may sound   WIDGET CLASSES USING DOJO.DECLARE  464  meaningless, but “Greek” text is good for the design stage of appli- cation building. It’ll generate arbitrary amounts of sentences for you, rather than trying to think of some yourself. And since the text will be different each time, you can rerun the app a few times to make sure arbitrary text ﬂows properly.

We’ll look at the properties and the purpose of postCreate in a moment, but for now just concentrate on postCreate’s body. Because we allow the user so many customizations, including the surrounding tag name, it makes little sense to use a template. Instead, the standard DOM creation functions build the pieces for us. So now when you need some random paragraphs, you just drop in this widget like so:  Download creating_widgets GreekingWidgetDemo.html  <div dojoType="dojobook.creating_widgets.widgets.GreekingWidget"  paragraphs="1" sentencesPer="1" loremIpsum="true" style="width:200px" >    THE WIDGET LIFE CYCLE  466  Figure 17.2: We can’t resist saying. . . it’s all Greek to us  You can see a sample run of the demo in Figure 17.2. It shows the beautifully random text.  Your mileage may vary—after all, it’s random.   Now that we have a widget with lots of properties, it’s a good time to revisit dojo.parser. We’ve used it for declarative widgets throughout the book, but how does it actually work?  17.3 The Widget Life Cycle  In the Greeking widget class, the action happens in postCreate. But how does Dijit know which method to call, and when? This is part of the widget life cycle—all widgets have speciﬁcally named methods called in a speciﬁc order by their base class dijit._Widget. So, a good understand- ing of that cycle will tell you where to place your code and how to debug it later.  Dojo.parser and Widgets  When programmatically creating widgets, as we saw in Section 12.3, Creating Instances Programmatically, on page 327, the birth process is pretty straightforward. You call the new keyword, and the parameters are assigned to attributes of the widget. But in declaratively created widgets, the birth is handled by dojo.parser.  One of the main jobs of dojo.parser is to set properties in a widget instance. Let’s see how this works in GreekingWidget. dojo.parser acti- vates when the entire page is ﬁnished downloading. It searches the entire DOM tree for dojoType= attributes. When it ﬁnds one, it instan- tiates an object with that type and then maps the other attributes on whatever properties it ﬁnds in the class.   THE WIDGET LIFE CYCLE  467  <div dojotype=”dojobook.      creating_widgets.widgets.      GreekingWidget”    paragraphs=”1"    sentencesPer=”1"    loremIpsum=”true”    onclick=”alert ‘HELP’ ;”    style=”width:200px”    >   AttributeMap: {style, id...        GreekingWidget  -paragraphs -sentencesPer -loremIpsum -addClass : String = "" -tag : String = "p"  postCreate   writes content  Figure 17.3: dojo.Parser copies attributes to properties.  So, for our GreekingWidget:  created.  1. A new dojobook.creating_widgets.widgets.GreekingWidget object is  2. dojo.parser places the attribute paragraphs into the widget property  paragraphs. It does the same for sentencesPer and loremIpsum.  3. The widget properties addClass and tag are left with their default  values since there are no matching attributes.  This copying process is shown in Figure 17.3. It doesn’t seem so magi- cal anymore, does it?  The Attribute Map  What happens to attributes in the tag without analogous properties in the class? We need to consider this for our declarative widget attributes style= and onclick= earlier. But it also could happen with programmati- cally created instances, for example:  Download creating_widgets GreekingWidgetDemo.html  var greek = new dojobook.creating_widgets.widgets.GreekingWidget {  paragraphs: 1, sentencesPer: 1, loremIpsum: true, style: 'width:200px'  }, dijit.byId "whereGreekShouldGo"    ;   THE WIDGET LIFE CYCLE  468  Well, some attributes are dropped, and some are not. Recall from Sec- tion 12.2, Finding and Manipulating Declarative Widgets, on page 322 that all widgets have a root node property called domNode. All the markup the widget creates, whether from a template or not, lives inside this node. And that’s where these extra attributes will be copied.  The attributes id=, dir=, lang=, class=, style=, and title= are copied in all widget instances. You can deﬁne more attributes in the attributeMap property of your own widget class. In short, all the widget attributes and attributeMap attributes are kept, and all other attributes are quietly dropped. So in our previous example, the onclick= attribute is not copied over. That’s not so bad, really. Adding a handler to the widget’s onClick extension point does the same thing, and it’s much more ﬂexible.  Rendering the Widget  The widget rendering job is handled through extension points, which we learned about in Section 12.4, Extension Points, on page 331. You provide the handlers, and dijit._Widget calls them in order.  1. postMixInProperties is called after the properties have been initial- ized. You can override default values here, as we’ll see in Sec- tion 17.4, Extending Widgets, on the next page.  2. buildRendering gets the template  if present  and ﬁlls in the details. Generally, you will not override this unless you know what you’re doing—like you’ve built a new templating system.  3. postCreate usually contains the interesting work. At this point your widget has been turned into HTML and inserted into the page, and you can access properties like this.domNode. However, none of the child widgets has been taken care of yet.  4. startup is the last extension point called, after all of the child wid-  gets have been drawn.  The widget rendering process is illustrated in Figure 17.4, on the fol- lowing page. Here, notice that YourWidget has a nested widget inside the template. That means the YourWidget class should set the widgetsInTem- plate property to true.  Knowing this process helps you plug your code into the right places. For example, suppose you’re building a container widget and need to know the combined size of its contained widgets. Since the widgets aren’t built until startup, you’ll put your code in the startup handler.   EXTENDING WIDGETS  469  <div dojoType=”yourWidget”      style=”width:200px”>                   yourWidget constructor  mixin parameters  anonymous : yourWidget  id : String = yourWidget-1  postMixinProperties    Dijit._Templated  assign id, if not provided  buildRendering          …         copy attribute map  postCreate    Expand child widgets  startup          …                                      Figure 17.4: Birth of a widget: a soul-stirring sight indeed  That covers the beginning of the widget life. You then manipulate and destroy widgets using techniques in Chapter 12, Scripting Widgets, on page 319.  17.4 Extending Widgets  As we’ve said, widgets are objects. We know how to override the behav- ior of a widget instance through extension points. But what if you want to override the behavior of an entire widget class? It should be obvious that you don’t change widget behavior by changing the source code, although it’s tempting. So, how do you make changes safely?  You do it by using the object-oriented tricks you saw in Section 9.6, Resolving Property Name Clashes, on page 252. Here’s a trivial example involving properties. Dijit.TitlePane components open and close by push- ing an arrow button at the top-left corner. They are open by default. Suppose your application uses many dijit.TitlePane components, but in this case each must start in a closed state to save screen space. After adding the attribute open=”false” over and over, you realize it’d be much easier if open= defaulted to false.   EXAMPLE: A YAHOO ANSWERS WIDGET  470  You can create a subclass of dijit.TitlePane to do just that. We’ll call the component dojobook.creating_widgets.widgets.ClosedTitlePane. The corre- sponding ﬁle dojoroot dojobook widgets ClosedTitlePane.js looks like this:  Download creating_widgets widgets ClosedTitlePane.js  dojo.provide "dojobook.creating_widgets.widgets.ClosedTitlePane" ;  dojo.require "dijit.TitlePane" ;  dojo.declare  "dojobook.creating_widgets.widgets.ClosedTitlePane", [dijit.TitlePane], {  open: false  }  ;  Here’s the trick. If you deﬁne a subclass property with the same name as a superclass property, the subclass property takes precedence. That is good for us. We merely deﬁne open= with a different default. Even though we don’t use that property in the class, every time dijit.TitlePane reads or writes open=, it uses the ClosedTitlePane copy.  As you might expect, the same thing goes for methods. After all, this is JavaScript, and all methods are just data of type Function. You can deﬁne a subclass and then specify the extension points and methods to override.  Having learned how to create and extend a widget and all the things that happen afterward, we’ll end with a useful example.  17.5 Example: A Yahoo Answers Widget  The pleasantly addictive Yahoo Answers site is Web 2.0 at its ﬁnest: someone asks a question about any subject, and others contribute answers. The answers themselves are rated by others. After a ﬁxed amount of time, the question closes, and the question asker selects the “best” answer, which may or may not reﬂect the given ratings. And that question and answer are kept for posterity. Being a question answerer is like trolling around a cocktail party, eavesdropping on conversations, and leaping into ones that interest you. And everything is recorded!  This collaborative ﬁltering aspect makes it a nifty search engine. If the term relativity appears in your text, hopping on Yahoo Answers and typing “relativity” will yield the most popular questions about relativity.   EXAMPLE: A YAHOO ANSWERS WIDGET  471  Figure 17.5: Click a word to look at some Yahoo questions.  That’s a good place to start your research. Fortunately, Yahoo Answers is also available through a web service. It would be nice to do a quick lookup on Yahoo Answers for certain terms that we think may cause the user to stumble. By calling the web service, we can actually get some Yahoo Questions without leaving the page. Figure 17.5 shows what we want the user to see.  The “bubble” is easily done with a Dijit master tooltip. Recall from Sec- tion 15.3, Tooltips, on page 406 that only one master tooltip can be displayed at a time, and it does not go away when you leave the under- lying area. That makes it easy to create the Yahoo Answers as links. If one of the questions looks relevant, the user just clicks it.  We want this widget class to be easy to use. The widget “consumer” need only wrap a possibly difﬁcult term with the Ask widget deﬁnition.   EXAMPLE: A YAHOO ANSWERS WIDGET  472  It’s done like this.  Download creating_widgets yahoo-answer-demo.html   Gilligan's Planet:     The first mate and his  woeful  gang finally get off the island--- but wind up on a distant planet after boarding the Professor's  rocket  in this animated spin-off of    Gilligans Island   . Almost all of the cast members from the live-action series reprised their roles, with the exception of Tina Louise  Dawn Wells voiced  Ginger  along with her original role of  Mary Ann  .  Where do you start? The user interface is pretty straightforward, so let’s get an early win. A little CSS takes care of the formatting for the terms:  Download creating_widgets css ask.css  .ask {  text-decoration: underline; cursor: pointer;  } .questionableParagraph {     }  width: 200px;  * Next two effectively center the paragraph in the browser *  margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  The template, kept in templates Ask.html, references this style and adds some wiring:  Download creating_widgets templates Ask.html  <span class="ask"  dojoAttachEvent="ondijitclick:_getQuestions">        Recall that Dijit ﬁlls containerNode with the tag contents. In this case, we want to repeat the term the user wrapped. Also, the ondijitclick event   EXAMPLE: A YAHOO ANSWERS WIDGET  473  will ﬁre whenever the user clicks, presses Enter , or presses the space- bar on that term. The _getQuestions method will ﬁre in this case, and we provide its implementation in the widget. The preﬁx _ implies a pri- vate method, which is nice for our case because we make assumptions about the input the ordinary users might not.  Now for the widget class itself. Because we’ll be using this on many pages, it’s best to create it programmatically. The interesting thing here is we don’t need any extension points like postCreate. We give an empty postCreate body here just so future viewers of our code don’t say “Where is postCreate?”  Download creating_widgets widgets Ask.js  dojo.provide "dojobook.creating_widgets.widgets.Ask" ;  dojo.require "dijit._Widget" ; dojo.require "dijit._Templated" ; dojo.require "dojo.io.script" ; dojo.require "dijit.Tooltip" ;  dojo.declare  "dojobook.creating_widgets.widgets.Ask", [dijit._Widget, dijit._Templated], {  templatePath: dojo.moduleUrl "dojobook",  "creating_widgets templates Ask.html" ,  postCreate: function  {  },     Don't do anything because all the magic happens in _getQuestions  The bulk of the good stuff is in _getQuestions. Here you’ll notice the variable hookedTo carries the widget object into the body of _getQuestions through a closure. You can also use dojo.hitch to do this—it’s largely a matter of taste.  Download creating_widgets widgets Ask.js  _getQuestions: function   {     Through JavaScript closures, this variable allows us to reference the    surrounding object from within the get ...  methods. var hookedTo = this;     Go to Yahoo Answers for relevant questions dojo.io.script.get {     URL for Yahoo Relevant Questions url: "http:  answers.yahooapis.com AnswersService V1 questionSearch",   EXAMPLE: A YAHOO ANSWERS WIDGET  474     Send search term parameters.    chapter 3's example. content: {  The appid is the one you obtained for  appid: "DEMO",  * The search term we're sending is the body of the tag *  query: hookedTo.containerNode.innerHTML, output: "json", results: 3,  * Look only in the questions for the term, not the answers *  search_in: "question"  },     If the response takes longer than 10000ms  = 10 seconds , error out timeout: 10000,     Yahoo API requires you to send the callback function name in the    parameter "callback" callbackParamName: "callback",     Function run when Yahoo returns with the answer load: function results  {     Build the tooltip text var questionTooltipHtml = " "; dojo.forEach results.all.questions, function question  {  questionTooltipHtml +=  dojo.string.substitute   "  ${Subject} "+ " ${Content} ", question   ;  } ;     Create a tooltip questionTooltipHtml += " "; dijit.showTooltip   questionTooltipHtml, hookedTo.domNode   ;  },     And this is the callback used when a web service communication    error or timeout occurs. Note that errors returned from Yahoo    in the response are still handled with load   error: function text  {  alert "An error has occurred." ; return text;  }  } ;    End of _getQuestions  }   EXAMPLE: A YAHOO ANSWERS WIDGET  475  The Yahoo Answers service, like the Yahoo Search service we saw in Section 3.4, Researching Cigars Using JSONP, on page 56, uses JSONP. We attach to it through dojo.io.script. From there, we retrieve the input and format it into a list. dojo.showTooltip displays this in a tooltip bubble. And that’s pretty much it.  Through our four examples, you can see how Dijit provides a solid structure for reusing visual components. You can both use and deﬁne the classes through HTML markup or through JavaScript. Templates and CSS provide an easy way to change the visual layout without touch- ing the code and are reusable across many different pages. Finally, you can extend components through the same ways you extend regular classes. There are many JavaScript toolkits out there, but none of them has this amount of ﬂexibility and power.   Part IV  Rich Internet Applications   Chapter 18  Building a Rich Internet Application  In Figure 18.1, on the following page, you can see a Rich Internet Appli- cation  RIA  being hosted in Firefox. The application includes a menu, a resizable multiple-pane workspace, and a status bar—just like so many native applications. Unlike typical web pages, the menu is anchored at the top, and the status bar is at the bottom. Also, there is no URL nav- igation; it is a “single-page” application. If you hate markup, you’ll love this app since it includes a grand total of ﬁfty lines of HTML.  Instead of crafting many pages of massive markup, we’re going to lever- age Dojo to build a browser-based application framework and then use that framework to sketch the application shown. Along the way, we’ll touch on just about every aspect of Dojo we’ve discussed elsewhere. Even if you’re never going to build an RIA, you’ll use most of the Dojo described in this chapter during the normal course of building modern web pages. And, if you fancy yourself a “real” programmer who doesn’t “do” JavaScript or HTML, then this chapter is for you. You’re going to see just how powerful Dojo and JavaScript really are.  18.1 The Big Picture  Before we start, let’s discuss why building an RIA is a good idea. We’ll also look at the high-level design of the framework and application we’re going to build.   THE BIG PICTURE  478  Figure 18.1: The browse single-page application  The Browser Is the UI Platform  Broadly speaking, there are two classes of browser-based applications. First, traditional web pages follow the browser application paradigm that’s been dominant since the beginning of the Web. These pages are constructed in HTML  statically or dynamically  and are served to the user’s browser from an off-host HTTP server. They include hyper- links to other pages and may collect information through HTML form controls. All of the cool Ajax stuff that has been discussed here and elsewhere makes these pages more dynamic and functional, but the basic use paradigm is unchanged: get a page, do a little something, get another page.  The second class of browser-based application takes form as the so- called single-page application: the user navigates to a URL that then presents a complete application—akin to a native desktop application— without ever leaving the page. The document managed by the browser is really a complete GUI program. At a minimum, such a program will display the GUI through HTML and CSS and implement logic through JavaScript. The program may also communicate with some off-host HTTP server, but this is not a requirement.   THE BIG PICTURE  479  Indeed, such a program could just as easily communicate with the local host through Java applets, Google Gears, or any number of other tech- nologies. The browser becomes the UI platform.1  The idea of the browser as a UI platform is quite powerful. First, the browser is ubiquitous. All desktop environments include a browser. Increasingly, other devices such as phones also include browsers. In cases where the RIA is backed by off-host HTTP servers, the applica- tion will have zero installation footprint. This is truly a case of “write once, run anywhere.”  The second reason the idea has power is that it can be used to enforce a clear separation of concerns. The browser-side application is concerned only with implementing the GUI—the machinery required to present information to the user and gather input from the user. All other com- putational activity  that is, the machinery that actually makes the pro- gram do something useful  takes place somewhere else. Contrast this architecture to most web app frameworks that dynamically generate presentation and handle several other UI tasks at the server. No mat- ter how careful you are, computational logic and presentational logic inevitably leak into each other. And these dependencies increase com- plexity, which makes the whole thing harder to get right.  In the design presented here, all presentation logic is handled in the browser. This logic is delivered to the browser in a set of static scripts and static presentation data. The server returns raw data  often JSON, but sometimes scripts with executable code  and is strictly forbidden from executing any presentation logic. Of course, the data presented by the UI may be dynamic.  The Browser Application Framework  We’re going to build two things:    A browser application framework    A sample application that uses the framework  1. Rich browser application describes the architecture more accurately, but we’ll stick with RIA because this moniker is so pervasive.   THE BIG PICTURE  480  An Important Caveat  The RIA design and framework sketched in this and the next chapter is opinionated. It assumes a certain view of the world in which it lives. For example, it assumes the user is going to spend a lot of time within the application without navigating away to another web page—much like a native application such as a word processor or spreadsheet. Also, it makes the value judg- ment that all of the UI should be implemented in the browser. These and other assumptions and judgments may not be opti- mal for some kinds of applications. This is but one way to solve one class of problems. We are not claiming it’s the only way; and we’re certainly not claiming that there is only one class of RIA problem. While Dojo works beautifully in this example, it’s just as powerful in any other design that leverages client-side JavaScript.  The framework is named Browser Application  BAF .2 Since this is a book about Dojo and not about designing frameworks, we’re not going to spend time discussing the design trade-offs encountered when build- ing an application framework. Sufﬁce it to say that there are alterna- tives to the design presented, each with different strengths and weak- nesses. And we’re not going to describe every last gory detail of a par- ticular framework. We’ll show enough to get the idea across but leave some details incomplete. But, before we can start building, we need some design. So, without further ado...  The Workspace Object Abstraction  The core abstraction used by the application is a container for widgets termed a workspace object  WSO . A WSO is the thing that the user interacts with to get information and provide input. Often it will look like a form, as shown in Figure 18.1, on page 478, but WSOs come in all shapes and sizes. Here are some examples:    A word processor  a WSO that contains a single rich text editor  widget   2. This example is loosely based on the framework being developed at Vista Informa- tion Technologies  see http:  www.vistainfotech.com . Wavemaker, built by Dojo core con- tributors Scott Miles and Steve Orvell, is another popular Dojo-based framework  see http:  www.wavemaker.com  .   THE BIG PICTURE  481    A control panel that requests a report   A static or dynamic report or dashboard   A form that presents and collects data for a standard create-read-  update-delete  CRUD  database application  The point of these is examples is that the WSO abstraction is not just another form-based framework, but rather a general abstraction for just about anything you can build in a GUI. The widgets may be ini- tialized with data from the server and or collect input to send to the server. But the key idea is this: the deﬁnition of a particular WSO type is given by a set of widget types together with their layout and behav- ior properties, and this deﬁnition is static  the deﬁnition is completely independent of the data ultimately presented by the WSO .  For example, let’s say a particular WSO displays a list of contacts in a grid. The WSO deﬁnition would include the name of the particular JavaScript class that implements the grid widget together with layout and behavior properties that describe how an instance of the grid wid- get should work in the WSO. When the user demands an instance of the WSO, the application requests the WSO deﬁnition and queries the server for the list of contacts. Then the application instantiates a grid instance as directed by the WSO deﬁnition, ﬁlls it with the data, and displays the WSO instance to the user. Contrast this to the way a more- traditional web app works where the server takes the contact list data and dynamically constructs HTML that presents the list and then sends the whole monolithic mess to the browser.  Implementing the WSO concept is the job of the framework. It’s a class that takes a WSO deﬁnition and some data and returns an object that’s convenient to display inside the rest of the UI framework.  A WSO deﬁnition is provided by a JSON object that lists all the widgets and their properties. Since this deﬁnition is static, there is no need to keep asking the server for the same deﬁnition. Instead, the framework provides a manager that caches WSO deﬁnitions.  The data interface can range from simple to complex. At the simple end, the server could return a set of  name, value  pairs as JSON, and the WSO deﬁnition could include properties that describe how to map these pairs to widgets; writing new changed data back to the server could be implemented by returning the JSON object, updated with changed values. This design falls down when the application includes the ability to have several WSO instances open at the same time. For example, if   THE BIG PICTURE  482  the user had the contact list open as well as a particular contact on that list and then edited and saved the contact name, care should be taken to ensure the contact list is refreshed with the changed name. This can be implemented by binding widgets to dojo.data data stores and then implementing a data store manager in the framework. The manager ensures that data requests that reference the same data are connected to the same data store.  So, at this point, our framework should be capable of something like this:  Line 1  function getWsoInstance   wsoDefId,   identifier for the type of WSO to return dataQuery   the data to fill the WSO  var wsoDef= WsoDefinitionManager.get wsoDefId ; var data= DataManager.get dataQuery ; return new WSO wsoDef, data ;  5  -  -  -  -  -  -   {  }  The Command System  Most applications have a system where a user can issue a command  for example, “open a ﬁle” or “save the current object” . The UI for issuing the command almost always comes in the form of a menu or context menu, a toolbar, or an accelerator key.  Although the idea of a menu is often considered independent of a tool- bar, they are really the same concept. A set of items is presented to the user that he can select. When an item is selected, a command is issued. In the case of a menu item that displays a submenu, the command can be thought of as “display submenu.” With this in mind, the framework implements the menu in terms of a dijit.Toolbar instance and submenus in terms of dijit.Menu. Although the example doesn’t implement context menus, they could be implemented using the same techniques we’ll use when implementing the menu.  As you saw in Chapter 15, Form Controls, on page 394, toolbars menus and submenus can be implemented in markup. BAF takes a different approach by providing machinery to dynamically build toolbar menus and submenus from data. This has a couple of beneﬁts:    The content of the toolbar menus and submenus can be easily  changed based on current user and or current context.    The presentation  language, icons, layout, and the rest  of individ-  ual items can be easily changed, independent of content.   THE BIG PICTURE  483  The framework deﬁnes two abstractions:  Command items  The text, accelerator, icon, tooltip, and other attributes of a par- ticular command. Here’s a few examples:  Line 1  var fileCommandItem= {  id: "file", type: baf.commandType.submenu, order: 100, group: baf.commandGroup.top, text: "File"};  var saveCommandItem= {  id: "save", type: baf.commandType.command, order: 160, group: baf.commandGroup.save, text: "Save"};  15  var saveAsCommandItem= {  id: "saveAs", type: baf.commandType.command, order: 170, group: baf.commandGroup.save, text: "Save As..."};  Command menus  Line 1  var menu= {  file: {  save: 0, saveAs: 0, saveAll: 0, close: 0, closeAll: 0, logoff: 0, switchUser: 0,  }, edit: 0,   etc...  };  10  20  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  Actual command items have a few more properties. Notice the order and group properties; they can be used to automatically orga- nize a submenu and insert menu separator bars.  A hierarchy of command items that make up a menu. For example:  Note how this structure cleanly captures the hierarchy of a menu; this compares quite favorably to markup. It’s also very easy to edit   THE BIG PICTURE  484  both statically  that is, in a ﬁle  and dynamically while the program is running.  The framework includes the class baf.dijit.Menuband that manages a dojo.toolbar, a command menu object, and a set of command items.  When a user issues a command through any means  menu, toolbar, accelerator , the command subsystem simply broadcasts the command through dojo.publish. Any other subsystem that’s interested in the com- mand can receive this message by connecting with dojo.subscribe. One of the cool side effects of this design is that subscribers can easily change the way menu items and submenus are presented. For example, before a submenu is presented by the manager, it broadcasts that a submenu was “commanded.” A client can add or subtract items from the sub- menu before it’s displayed. And with the simple command menu data structure shown earlier, this is quite easy to do.  Accelerator keys could be implemented by catching keyboard events, then dojo.publishing a command when an accelerator key is detected.  The Status Bar  Putting a stylized div at the bottom of a page with a few children that display status items isn’t rocket science. The key idea is to abstract the status bar to its true functional purpose: deﬁne a set of panes and allow client components to send content to those panes. The framework includes the class baf.dijit.Statusbar that implements this functionality.  Data-on-Demand Data Stores  Tree-based navigation is almost as common as the browser. However, when the number of items in the tree is large—thousands or even millions—it is clearly not practical to download all this data in one chunk. Fortunately, dijit.Tree was designed to demand tree items only when needed; unfortunately, Dojo 1.1 doesn’t include a data store that provides this functionality. So, BAF includes a data store that requests items only as demanded. The actual conﬁguration of the tree navigation widget is left to the application.  Mock Services  Since the server’s only responsibility is to return data  remember, there is no need to generate dynamic markup , it’s easy to build a mock ser- vice in JavaScript. The idea is to construct an object that is initialized with a set of response objects. The mock service provides an interface   THE BIG PICTURE  485  that mimics whatever real interface would be used to communicate with a real service  for example, like the dojo.xhr* interface . When a request is given, the mock service sets a timer that fakes the time required to hit a real server; when the timer expires, the response object is returned.  The framework includes mock services that return navigation items and WSO deﬁnitions. These mocks can be initialized with various sets of data required to execute different tests. This is fairly powerful in the real world. The team responsible for the UI component can be provided with a working  but fake  service on day one—long before the real server is available. Heck, sales teams could be provided with demo products that work off the mock servers, greatly increasing the probability they’ll give a good demo! This is yet another example of the power behind the RIA architecture.  The Browse Application  So much for the framework. Let’s spec out an application. We’re going to build an application that retrieves and displays WSOs as provided by some service. We’ll name the application OBE, which stands for object browser and editor.  As shown in Figure 18.1, on page 478, OBE contains a main menu bar at the top, a status bar at the bottom, and a workspace that occupies all the remaining space available in the browser window. The workspace is further divided by a splitter bar into two panes—a navigation pane on the left and an object pane on the right; the splitter bar can be used to resize the two panes. The navigation pane presents the hierarchy of objects. The object pane displays the object currently selected in the navigation pane.  The application is built on top of the BAF framework described earlier. It includes a top-level object that instantiates the main menu, navi- gator pane, status bar, WSO deﬁnition manager, and workspace man- ager. The navigator pane includes a dijit.Tree instance that’s backed by an on-demand navigation data store provided by the framework. The workspace manager catches a demand for a new workspace object and coordinates the construction of a new WSO instance and the destruc- tion of the existing instance  if any . Finally, all the visual components are arranged in a dijit.layout.BorderContainer that’s created and managed by the application.  We’ll build this application in steps. Let’s get started.   18.2 Step 1: Create the Application Skeleton  STEP 1: CREATE THE APPLICATION SKELETON  486  The goal of the ﬁrst step is to get organized and get something minimally running.  Organization  The work is divided into two projects: BAF  the browser application framework  and OBE  the object browser and editor application . Each of these projects deﬁnes a top-level module. Since we hate typing capital letters, these top-level modules are named baf and obe.  The BAF project implements several subsystems that are deﬁned as child modules of baf:  baf.command  baf.data  This is the command subsystem. It deﬁnes a class that manages command items, baf.command.ItemManager.  This is the data subsystem. It deﬁnes customized dojo.data drivers and other machinery to handle sending receiving caching data with a service including the following:    baf.data.LazyTreeStore: A dojo.data driver retrieving tree items  on demand from some service    baf.data.WsoDeﬁnitionsManager: Machinery that retrieves and  caches WSO deﬁnitions from some service  baf.dijit  Custom Dijit-based components, including:    baf.dijit.LazyTreeModel: A subclass of dijit.tree.TreeStoreModel that  interfaces with baf.data.LazyTreeStore    baf.dijit.MenuBand: Dijit-based component that manages a    baf.dijit.Statusbar: Dijit-based component that implements a    baf.dijit.StaticText: Dijit-based widget that displays a stylized  menu  status bar  block of static text    baf.dijit.Pair: Dijit-based widget that positions and displays a related pair of widgets; intended to be used to display  label, value  pairs    baf.dijit.Wso: Dijit-based widget that contains a hierarchy of  other widgets   STEP 1: CREATE THE APPLICATION SKELETON  487  baf.test  This is the machinery to help test applications; all mock services are included here:    test.mocks.services.Base: A base class for mock services that  includes the basic functionality to simulate a dojo.xhr* call    test.mocks.services.WsoDef: A mock service that delivers a WSO    test.mocks.services.Navigator: A mock service that delivers navi-  deﬁnition  gator tree items  Since most of the implementation details are factored out into the BAF framework, OBE is quite simple. Test data is located in the obe.test module tree, but there are no subsystems.  Here’s what the directory tree looks like:       baf   command  data  dijit  test   mocks   services   wso   obe   test  This organization factors the project into a set of small, tightly deﬁned, largely independent classes and modules that helps control complexity. Different parts of the project can be worked on by different people, independently. And with the Dojo build system, all of these tiny scripts can be aggregated and compressed to optimize download performance when it’s time to release the application to production.  Building the Main Program  The goal of step 1 is to load and execute a function that initializes the application and draws the UI with menu, navigator, workspace, and status panes. The navigator and workspace panes should be resizable along their widths with a draggable resize bar separating the two panes.  The HTML document that hosts OBE is trivial. The head element loads the style sheets, dojo.js, and the top-level module that starts the appli- cation. The body element simply displays “loading.”   STEP 1: CREATE THE APPLICATION SKELETON  488  Here’s the complete ﬁle:  Download baf step1 obe main.htm        Line 1  <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD HTML 4.01  EN"  "http:  www.w3.org TR html4 strict.dtd">  5   Mastering Dojo - Object Browser and Editor      @import " dojoroot dojo resources dojo.css"; @import " dojoroot dijit themes tundra tundra.css"; @import " obe obe.css";             dojo.require "obe.main" ; dojo.addOnLoad function  {    e.g., given: location.search == ?test=run001    var testId= location.search.match   \?test\=  \w+   ; if  testId  {  then: dojo.require obe.test.tests.run001   dojo.require "obe.test.tests." + testId[2] ;  } else {  obe.main.startup  ;  } } ;              Loading         35     -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  15  20  25  30  Notice that dojo.js is loaded from  dojoroot dojo dojo.js, which causes dojo-module-path to be calculated as  dojoroot dojo. Since no other mod- ule paths are set, top-level modules will be loaded as siblings to  dojo- root dojo. For example, the loader will try to load  dojoroot obe main.js when the module obe.man is dojo.required. We solved the problem on our development box by aliasing the path  dojo obe to  obe in the devel- opment directory tree on the local HTTP server   dojo baf must also be aliased to  baf . This technique eliminates the need for module paths as well as different development and release versions of main.htm.   STEP 1: CREATE THE APPLICATION SKELETON  489  In the future, the div.bafLoading element  line 31  could be replaced with a simple logon form that collects a user identiﬁer and password. Then, if the cross-domain loader was employed, the application could be downloading scripts while the user is typing his logon information. This would give an illusion of extra speed.  In a moment we’ll see that the application begins executing by calling the function obe.main.startup; if the URL contains the query parame- ter "?test=testModule", then the module obe.test.tests.testModule is loaded and expected to start the application. This technique provides a conve- nient way to control how the program is started during development; we’ll use it later. That’s it for the one-and-only HTML document used in the application; next let’s look at the JavaScript that makes things happen.  The module obe.main holds the “main program”; the function obe.main. startup is the entry point for the program. OBE utilizes dijit.layout. BorderContainer to handle the top-level layout. At this point, no real functionality is going into the panes, so each pane is stuffed with a dijit.layout.ContentPane that holds a single p element that names the pane. Here’s the code:  Download baf step1 obe main.js  Line 1  dojo.provide "obe.main" ; dojo.require "dijit.layout.BorderContainer" ; dojo.require "dijit.layout.ContentPane" ;  function  {    define the main program functions... var main= obe.main; main.startup= function   {    create a fake menu... main.menu= new dijit.layout.ContentPane {  id: "menu", region: "top",    height must be given for top bottom panes...  style: "height: 2em;"  } ; main.menu.setContent 'menu' ;    create a fake navigator... main.navigator= new dijit.layout.ContentPane {  id: "navigator", region: "left",    width must be given for left right panes...  style: "width: 20%; overflow: auto", splitter: true  25  } ;  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  15  20   STEP 1: CREATE THE APPLICATION SKELETON  490  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  30  35  40  45  55  60  65  main.navigator.setContent 'navigator' ;    create a fake workspace... main.workspace= new dijit.layout.ContentPane {  id: "workspace", region: "center"   note, no sizing!  } ; main.workspace.setContent 'workspace' ;    create a fake status bar... main.status= new dijit.layout.ContentPane {  id: "status", region: "bottom",    height must be given for top bottom panes...  style: "height: 2em;"  } ; main.status.setContent 'status' ;    create the main application container.... var appContainer= main.appContainer= new dijit.layout.BorderContainer {    fill up the viewport... style: "width: 100%; height: 100%", design: "headline"  50  } ;    finally, destroy the loading message and show it all... dojo._destroyElement dojo.byId "bafLoading"  ; dojo.place appContainer.domNode, dojo.body  , "first" ; appContainer.addChild main.menu ; appContainer.addChild main.status ; appContainer.addChild main.navigator ; appContainer.addChild main.workspace ;    tell the container to recalculate its layout... appContainer.layout  ;  window.onresize= function  {  appContainer.layout  ;  };  };  }   ;   function  {  We’ve seen this before in markup in Section 16.5, The Alignment Con- tainer: BorderContainer, on page 447. Once again, the code is trivial. Notice the call to lay out the display after it’s ﬁrst initialized  line 61  and after each viewport size change  line 63 .   STEP 2: THE MAIN MENU AND COMMAND SYSTEM  491  Lastly, we need a little style sheet magic. The html and body elements should be set to 100% height and width; this forces the top-level dijit. layout.BorderContainer to use the entire browser viewport. The style sheet also includes some coloring and borders to help test the panes for cor- rect sizing and positioning:  Download baf step1 obe obe.css  html, body {  height: 100%; width: 100%;  }  }  }  }  }  menu {  border: 1px solid black; background-color: D00000;  navigator {  border: 1px solid black; background-color: 00D000;  workspace {  border: 1px solid black; background-color: A0A0D0;  status {  border: 1px solid black; background-color: yellow;  That is it for step 1. Start your localhost HTTP server and navigate to obe.htm. You should see something like Figure 18.2, on the next page. When the browser window is resized, the panes should adjust correctly, and the drag bar between the navigator and workspace panes should cause these panes to resize correctly.  18.3 Step 2: The Main Menu and Command System  The goal of the this step is to create the main menu and supporting command item manager. We’ll also demonstrate starting the application with test data.   STEP 2: THE MAIN MENU AND COMMAND SYSTEM  492  Figure 18.2: Basic application layout  The Command Item Store  Recall from the design discussion that menus, toolbars, and context menus are ﬁlled with command items. Command items hold the display properties of a command. So before we can implement a menu, we need a local cache of command items. Hmmm, sounds like a dojo.data data store might do the trick. If command items are delivered to the program as JSON data, then dojo.data.ItemFileReadStore will work.  Unfortunately, there are a couple of potential problems. Menus, sub- menus, and context menus are going to be built dynamically. For exam- ple, the File submenu is not ﬁlled with items until the user clicks the File submenu button. We’ll see in a moment that this design is quite powerful. But, it has the drawback that the menu machinery can’t wait around for an asynchronous fetch of command item data. Instead, when a menu demands a command item, it needs something— immediately. Since dojo.data.ItemFileReadStore.fetch operates asynchro- nously, a little modiﬁcation is required.  The other problem is the dojo.data getValue interface is fairly verbose. For example, say item is a command item. To get its order property,   STEP 2: THE MAIN MENU AND COMMAND SYSTEM  493  we have to write something like commandItemStore.getItem item, "order" . Certainly, item.order would be much more convenient.  Both of these problems can be solved simply by deriving from dojo.data. ItemFileReadStore and adding a function that guarantees to immediately return an item  solves the ﬁrst problem  and further converts the item to a hash before returning it  solves the second problem . Here’s the code:  Download baf step2 baf command ItemManager.js  Line 1  dojo.declare "baf.command.ItemManager", dojo.data.ItemFileReadStore, {  Returns a command item as a hash; guaranteed to return immediately  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  getItem: function id  {     summary:     var theItem; function onItem item  {  theItem= item;  10  }  this.fetchItemByIdentity {  identity: id, onItem: onItem  15  } ;  }  } return result;  25  } else {  }  }  30  } ;  if  theItem  {  var result= {}; for  var p in defaultCommandItem  {  20  if  defaultCommandItem.hasOwnProperty p   {  result[p] = this.getValue theItem, p, defaultCommandItem[p] ;  return dojo.mixin {}, defaultCommandItem, {text: id} ;  If the demanded item is in the store, then theItem will always be ﬁlled with a value  line 9  before fetch returns  line 16 ; otherwise, the func- tion just creates a default command item with minimal information. Before the item is returned, it’s converted to a hash  line 19 .  The store can be ﬁlled as usual. We’ll provide some test JSON data.   STEP 2: THE MAIN MENU AND COMMAND SYSTEM  494  Line 1  obe.test.data.command.set001.commandItems= {  Here’s a sample:  Download baf demo.js  identifier: "id", label: "text", items: [{  id: "file", type: baf.commandType.submenu, text: "File", order: 1000  },{  id: "save", type: baf.commandType.command, text: "Save", order: 1520, group: "save"  }   et cetera.... ]  };  Since a single command item store is used by all menus  regular and context  and toolbars in a program, it should be a property of obe.main. Typically, it would be ﬁlled during program startup with all the items needed for the lifetime of the application. This is accomplished by pass- ing in some startup data to obe.main.startup and then passing the data on to the command item store. Here’s how the modiﬁed obe.main.startup looks so far:  Download baf step2 obe main.js  Line 1  main.startup= function args  {  main.commandItemStore= new baf.command.ItemManager {  data: args.commandItems  } ;  Now we can leverage the machinery we have put in main.htm to call obe.main.startup with some test data. First, we need a startup script that calls obe.main.startup with the test data. Here’s an example:  Download baf step2 obe test tests run001.js  Line 1  dojo.provide "obe.test.tests.run001" ; dojo.require "obe.test.data.command.set001" ; dojo.addOnLoad function  {  var startupArgs= {  commandItems: obe.test.data.command.set001.commandItems, menu: obe.test.data.command.set001.mainMenu  }; obe.main.startup startupArgs ;  } ;  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  15  -  -  -  5  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -   STEP 2: THE MAIN MENU AND COMMAND SYSTEM  495  The actual data is brought in from another module  line 2 ; it’s just plain ol’ JSON objects. We’ll need the menu  line 6  in the next section.  Now, pointing the browser to . main.htm?test=run001 causes obe.test.tests. run001 to be dojo.required, which calls obe.main.startup with the appropri- ate test data. Pretty cool! Next, let’s build the menu.  The Main Menu  Part of the design said that the contents of  sub menus is speciﬁed by nested hashes of command item identiﬁers; we’ll call these hashes menu objects. This makes menus very easy to conﬁgure. Here’s an example menu object:  Line 1  obe.test.data.command.set001.mainMenu= {  Download baf demo.js  file: {  save: 0, saveAll: 0, saveAll: 0, close:0, closeAll: 0, send: {  sendToContact: 0, sendToList: 0  }, logoff: 0, switchUser: 0  }, edit: {    et cetera....  }   et cetera....  };  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  15  -  -  -  5  -  The top-level menu is simply a dijit.Toolbar that’s populated by the top- level command items of a menu object. So, we’ll derive the BAF menu class baf.dijit.MenuBand from dijit.Toolbar. A menu needs both a menu object and access to a command item store; these are expected in the constructor arguments:  Download baf step2 baf dijit MenuBand.js  Line 1  dojo.declare "baf.dijit.MenuBand", dijit.Toolbar, {  constructor: function args  {  this.commandItemStore= args.commandItemStore; this.menu= args.menu; this.sort= args.sort  function lhs, rhs {return lhs.order-rhs.order;};  },   STEP 2: THE MAIN MENU AND COMMAND SYSTEM  496  The top-level objects are sorted and grouped before they are inserted into the toolbar; separators are automatically inserted between groups. Here’s how that looks:  Download baf step2 baf dijit MenuBand.js  Line 1  _prepareList: function menu {  var contents= []; for  var p in menu  if  menu.hasOwnProperty p   {  contents.push this.commandItemStore.getItem p  ;  } contents.sort this.sort ;  var result= []; if  contents.length  {  result= [contents[0]]; var group= contents[0].group; for  var i= 1; i<contents.length; i++  {  if  contents[i].group!=group  {  result.push {id:"separator", type: baf.commandType.separator} ; group= contents[i].group;  } result.push contents[i] ;  }  } return result;  },  Next, we need to insert the objects returned by _prepareList into the tool- bar. These objects will be commands, separators, or submenus. Sub- menus require a little more attention since part of the design said that submenus could be conﬁgured dynamically before they are displayed. The idea is to broadcast  via dojo.publish  that a submenu is being dis- played and let other program objects add subtract manipulate the submenu as required by program semantics. So, the submenu is pop- ulated just before it is displayed. This is easy to do by subclassing dijit.Menu and overriding the onOpen function to call a function that builds the submenu. Here’s what that looks like:  Download baf step2 baf dijit MenuBand.js  Line 1  dojo.declare "baf.Submenu", dijit.Menu, {  onOpen: function  {  this.onOpenSubmenu  ; this.inherited arguments ;  }, onClose: function  {  this.inherited arguments ; dojo.forEach this.getChildren  , function child {  this.removeChild child ;  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  15  20  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -   STEP 2: THE MAIN MENU AND COMMAND SYSTEM  497  child.destroy  ;  }, this ;  } } ;  As long as any instance of baf.Submenu.onOpenSubmenu is hooked up to a function that populates the menu, the menu will be populated before it is opened. dijit.Menu.onClose is also overridden to remove and destroy all the children; that way when a submenu is repeatedly opened and closed, duplicates don’t appear. With this in place, we can write the function baf.dijit.MenuBand._build, which initializes a new instance:  Download baf step2 baf dijit MenuBand.js  Line 1  _build: function   {  var contents= this._prepareList this.menu ; this._publish ["beforeDisplay", this, contents] ; dojo.forEach contents, function commandItem {  this._publish ["beforeDisplayItem", this, commandItem] ; var item= null; switch  commandItem.type {  case baf.commandType.command:  item= new dijit.form.Button {  label: commandItem.text, onClick: dojo.hitch this, "_exec", commandItem   10  -  -  -  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  15  20  25  30  35  } ;  break;  break;  case baf.commandType.separator:  item= new dijit.ToolbarSeparator  ;  case baf.commandType.submenu: case baf.commandType.menu:  var popup= new baf.Submenu  ; popup.onOpenSubmenu= dojo.hitch   this, this._onOpenDropDown, this.menu[commandItem.id], popup ;  item= new dijit.form.DropDownButton {  label: commandItem.text, dropDown: popup  } ;  break;  default: break;  } if  item  {  this.addChild item ;  }  }, this ;  },   STEP 2: THE MAIN MENU AND COMMAND SYSTEM  498  First, the function constructs the menu items using _prepareList  line 2 . Then any interested code can inspect and optionally edit the menu items  line 3 . Next, each item is added to the toolbar. Notice that sub- menus instances hook their onOpenSubmenu property  a function  to this._onOpenDropDown  line 22 . When a submenu is opened, _onOpen- DropDown is called upon to populate that submenu. _onOpenDropDown looks much like _build except that command items are dijit.MenuItems rather than dijit.form.Buttons:  Download baf step2 baf dijit MenuBand.js  Line 1  _onOpenDropDown: function menuObject, menu {  var contents= this._prepareList menuObject ; dojo.publish ["beforeDisplaySubmenu", this, contents] ; dojo.forEach contents, function commandItem {  dojo.publish ["beforeDisplayItem", this, commandItem] ; var item= null; switch  commandItem.type {  case baf.commandType.command:  item= new dijit.MenuItem { label: commandItem.text, onClick: dojo.hitch this, "_exec", commandItem   5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  15  20  25  30  35  } ;  break;  break;  case baf.commandType.separator:  item= new dijit.MenuSeparator  ;  case baf.commandType.submenu: case baf.commandType.menu:  var popup= new baf.Submenu  ; popup.onOpenSubmenu= dojo.hitch   this, this._onOpenDropDown, menuObject[commandItem.id], popup ;  item= new dijit.PopupMenuItem {  label: commandItem.text, popup: popup  } ;  break;  default: break;  } if  item  {  menu.addChild item ;  }  }, this ;  },   STEP 3: A CUSTOM STATUSBAR WIDGET  499  Figure 18.3: Application with a menu  That completes the BAF menu. Next, obe.main.startup needs to be mod- iﬁed to use the new menu:  Download baf step2 obe main.js  Line 1  main.menu= new baf.dijit.MenuBand args ;  The startup data shown at the end of the previous section already had a menu item. That’s it for step 2.  Start the HTTP server, navigate over to . main.htm?test=run001, and you should see something like Figure 18.3. As the menu is navigated, it publishes "beforeDisplay", "beforeDisplayItem", and "execute" events to "baf.dijit.MenuBand". Other program machinery can choose to subscribe and then react to these events.  18.4 Step 3: A Custom Statusbar Widget  BAF includes the Dijit-based component baf.dijit.Statusbar, which pro- vides status bar functionality. The idea is to create a widget class that manages its own layout, can be inserted in other container widgets  for   STEP 3: A CUSTOM STATUSBAR WIDGET  500  example, dijit.layout.BorderContainer , and includes a super-simple inter- face for adding deleting updating status panes:  createTextPane paneId, args   Inserts a pane that holds text at the end of the status bar. The pane is associated with the identiﬁer paneId  a string or a number . args  a hash  controls the appearance of the pane by providing a value for the property class  the HTML class attribute of the pane  and or a value for the property style  HTML styles to apply to the pane .  deleteTextPane paneId   Deletes the pane identiﬁed by paneId and previously created with createPane.  setTextPane paneId, text   Sets the contents of the pane identiﬁed by paneId and previously created with createPane.  baf.dijit.Statusbar can be used inside obe.main.startup like this:  Download baf step3 obe main.js  Line 1  -  -  -  5  -  main.statusbar= new baf.dijit.Statusbar  ; main.statusbar.createTextPane "message" ; main.statusbar.createTextPane "userName", {style: "width: 20em"} ; main.statusbar.createTextPane   "role", {"class": "statusPaneRed", style: "width: 10em"} ;  After a status bar is created  line 1 , panes are added  lines 2–6 . Typ- ically, all panes except the leftmost pane  the ﬁrst pane added  will include a width style as in the previous example. When the status bar layout is calculated, the panes are placed next to each other, right- to-left, and any leftover space is given to the ﬁrst pane. The pane’s rendering is usually controlled by including an HTML class value and associating that value with a style in the style sheet. Panes automat- ically include the class bafDijitStatusStaticPane. An example of providing an additional class is shown on line 6.  Implementing baf.dijit.Statusbar is quite straightforward—particularly be- cause it’s built on top of Dijit’s layout widget framework. A great exam- ple of this is dijit.layout.BorderContainer. This widget can contain up to ﬁve other widgets, and its sole purpose is to size and position the contained widgets. A status bar does exactly the same thing.   STEP 3: A CUSTOM STATUSBAR WIDGET  501  baf.dijit.Statusbar is derived from dijit.layout._LayoutWidget, which is in turn derived from dijit._Widget with dijit._Container and dijit._Contained mixed in. dijit._Contained gives children the ability to traverse their siblings and report their parent; dijit._Container gives containers the ability to insert, remove, and traverse their children. The widgets that baf.dijit.Statusbar contains are the status bar panes. Usually a status bar contains just text panes; the class dijit._widget has all the functionality needed. With this much information, we can start implementing baf.dijit.Statusbar:  Download baf step3 baf dijit Statusbar.js  Line 1  dojo.declare "baf.dijit.Statusbar", [dijit.layout._LayoutWidget], {  postCreate: function  {  this.inherited arguments ; dojo.addClass this.domNode, "bafDijitStatus" ;  createTextPane: function paneId, args {  args= args  {}; this[paneId]= new dijit._Widget args ; dojo.addClass this[paneId].domNode, "bafDijitStatusStaticPane" ; this.addChild this[paneId] ;  5  10  20  25  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  },  },  }  },  }  },  15  deleteTextPane: function paneId {  var pane= this[paneId]; if  pane  {  removeChild pane ; pane.destroy  ;  setTextPane: function paneId, text {  var pane= this[paneId]; if  pane  {  pane.domNode.innerHTML= text;  30    more to follow...  The only thing baf.dijit.Statusbar does special during the construction process is add the HTML class bafDijitStatus to the root DOM node  line 5 ; any processing that needs the DOM node must be done in postCreate after the base class postCreate has been called  line 4  since the node won’t exist prior to this point. createTextPane creates a widget and adds it to the set of children widgets the baf.dijit.Statusbar instance contains  line 8 ; deleteTextPane removes a previously added child  line 15 . Both   STEP 3: A CUSTOM STATUSBAR WIDGET  502  of these routines leverage the addChild removeChild methods provided by the mixin dijit._Container  lines 12 and 18 . Finally, setTextPane simply sets the innerHTML on the div node that _widget created.  Layout is accomplished by ensuring all of the children have the value of absolute for the style position and then setting the margin boxes of each child. dijit._Container.addChild is overridden to set the style each time a child is added:  Download baf step3 baf dijit Statusbar.js  Line 1  addChild: function  *Widget*  child {  this.inherited arguments ; this._setupChild child ; if this._started {  this._layoutChildren  ;  Download baf step3 baf dijit Statusbar.js  Line 1  _setupChild: function  *Widget* child {  var node= child.domNode; if  node  {  node.style.position = "absolute";  }  },  }  },  The function _layoutChildren sets the margin boxes of the children. It ﬁnds the right content edge of the status bar DOM node and then lays one child next to the other, right to left:  Download baf step3 baf dijit Statusbar.js  Line 1  _layoutChildren: function  {  var  thisDomNode= this.domNode, children= this.getChildren  , totalWidth= 0, e1= dojo._getPadBorderExtents thisDomNode , e2= dojo._getMarginExtents thisDomNode , rightEdge= dojo.marginBox thisDomNode .w -  e1.w - e1.l  -  e2.w - e2.l ;  10  for  var i= children.length-1; i>0; i-- {  var node= children[i].domNode; rightEdge-= dojo.marginBox node .w; dojo.marginBox node, {l:rightEdge} ;  } var l= e1.l + e2.l; dojo.marginBox children[0].domNode, {l: l, w: rightEdge - l} ;  15  }  -  -  -  -  -  5  -  -  -  5  -  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -   STEP 3: A CUSTOM STATUSBAR WIDGET  503  The private function _layoutChildren is called anytime a child is added or removed as well as when the public function layout is called.  Lastly, baf.dijit.Statusbar includes a function to set its own height. This function is typically called before a baf.dijit.Statusbar is laid out as a child within another container. Here is setHeight:  dojo.forEach this.getChildren  , function child {  height= Math.max dojo.marginBox child.domNode .h, height ;  Download baf step3 baf dijit Statusbar.js  Line 1  setHeight: function  {  height= 0, thisNode= this.domNode;  var  } ;  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  height=  height + dojo._getPadBorderExtents thisNode .h;  dojo.marginBox thisNode, {h: height} ;  15  },  Assuming a baf.dijit.Statusbar was incorporated into obe.main.startup as shown at the beginning of this section, the bar can be used anywhere in the program like this:  Download baf step3 obe test tests run001.js  obe.main.statusbar.setTextPane "message", "Ready..." ; obe.main.statusbar.setTextPane "userName", "Rawld C. Gill" ; obe.main.statusbar.setTextPane "role", "Administrator" ;  In Figure 18.4, on the next page, you can see the new status bar in the application.  At this point, the application is beginning to look like a native appli- cation. It ﬁlls up the viewport. It has a menu and status bar that stay anchored at the top and bottom of the viewport. And it has two workspaces that are resizable with a splitter bar. We’ll ﬁnish the appli- cation in the next chapter when we add some content to the workspace.   STEP 3: A CUSTOM STATUSBAR WIDGET  504  Figure 18.4: Application with a menu and status bar   Chapter 19  Adding Dynamic Content to an RIA  So far the application looks like just about any ordinary native desktop application—which is exactly the point. We’ll pick up the application development where we left it and add an object navigator in the left pane and a workspace object in the right pane.  19.1 Step 4: The Navigator Pane and On-Demand Data Store  This step ﬁlls the left workspace with a tree widget that is used to nav- igate a hierarchy of items. The items are delivered by a mock service that provides data on-demand as branches are opened.  Retrieving Tree Data On Demand  None of the stock dojo.data drivers is specialized to handle hierarchical data on demand. This is an important case for a tree-based navigation paradigm because the contents of the tree may be too large to trans- mit in one bundle and or simply be unavailable. Typically, this type of interface retrieves the children for a node only when that node is opened. Indeed, dijit.Tree adds a small abstraction layer termed a model on top of the data store connected to a tree, and the model demands data from the data store precisely in this mode.  So, the task at hand is to implement a dojo.data driver that returns the children of an item on demand and use this driver to implement a dijit.Tree model. With this in place, the obe.main.startup function can   STEP 4: THE NAVIGATOR PANE AND ON-DEMAND DATA STORE  506  create an instance of the driver, the model, and a dijit.Tree widget; con- nect them all together; and place the tree widget in the navigator pane. When it’s all done, the service behind the tree is hit only when a node is opened and then only the given node’s children are returned.  Currently, the Dijit tree machinery includes two models: on the one hand, dijit.tree.TreeStoreModel models a single-root tree, while dijit.tree. ForestStoreModel models a multiroot tree. BAF includes the class baf.dijit. LazyTreeModel that’s derived from dijit.tree.TreeStoreModel. The BAF class overrides the methods mayHaveChildren and getChildren.  mayHaveChildren takes an item from the underlying data store and re- turns true if the item might possibly have children; it returns false if the item deﬁnitely has no children.  getChildren takes an item from the underlying data store as well as onComplete and onError functions. It fetches the children of the item and calls the onComplete function; naturally error conditions call onError. If the children are already present in the store, then the onComplete func- tion is called immediately. Otherwise, it sets up a fetch that retrieves the children and then calls the onComplete onError functions upon com- pletion of the fetch.  Assuming the underlying data store includes certain capabilities, im- plementing dijit.tree.TreeStoreModel is super-easy:  Download baf step4 baf dijit LazyTreeModel.js  Line 1  dojo.provide "baf.dijit.LazyTreeModel" ; dojo.require "dijit.Tree" ;  function  {  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  15  20  5  dojo.declare "baf.dijit.LazyTreeModel", dijit.tree.TreeStoreModel, {     summary:        An optimization of dijit.tree.TreeStoreModel; requires baf.data.LazyTreeStore.  10  mayHaveChildren: function item {  return this.store.hasChildren item ;  },  getChildren: function parentItem, onComplete, onError {     Calls onComplete   with array of child items    of given parent item, all loaded. var store = this.store; if  !this.mayHaveChildren parentItem   {    no children... onComplete [] ;   STEP 4: THE NAVIGATOR PANE AND ON-DEMAND DATA STORE  507  } else if  store.childrenLoaded parentItem   {    children already loaded... onComplete store.getValues parentItem, "children"  ;  } else {    need to load the children... store.fetch {  id: parentItem.id, getChildren: true, onComplete: onComplete, onError: onError  25  30  35  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  } ;  }  },  },  } } ;  45  }   ;   function  {    No write functionality... newItem: function  {  throw new Error 'baf.dijit.LazyTreeModel: not implemented.' ;  40  pasteItem: function  {  throw new Error 'baf.dijit.LazyTreeModel: not implemented.' ;  The model depends on the underlying store including the method has- Children  line 11 , and that fetch retrieves the children of an item when the fetch parameter getChildren is true  line 28 . The BAF class baf.data. LazyTreeStore includes this functionality.  Implementing a Lazy Tree Data Driver  baf.data.LazyTreeStore is a complete implementation of dojo.data.api. Identity. It makes a few assumptions about the data that’s delivered by the service, which simpliﬁes the implementation:    The service returns items as JSON. Each item has the property id that uniquely identiﬁes the item within the entire hierarchy of items. Further, each item returned also includes the property chil- drenState  an integer  where a childrenState value of childrenNever  ==0  indicates that the item does not and will never have children and where a value of childrenMaybe  ==1  indicates the item may or may not have children.    The service returns either a single item  if the query parameter getChildren is false or missing  or the children of an item  if the query parameter getChildren is true . Note that if getChildren is true,   STEP 4: THE NAVIGATOR PANE AND ON-DEMAND DATA STORE  508  only the children of the item are returned; the item itself is not returned, because the store already has the item.    The root item is retrieved by requesting a single item with an id value of 0. All subsequent requests  for either single items or children of an item  must specify an id received from a previous request. id values don’t persist between different instances of a particular store.  The store keeps a map from item id to item. The map is updated as items and children are returned by the service. When a set of children is returned, the map is used to look up the parent, the children are added to that parent, and the parent’s childrenState value is set to chil- drenLoaded  ==-1 , indicating the children have been loaded.  With this design, determining whether an item has children simply requires inspecting the childrenState property:  Download baf step4 baf data LazyTreeStore.js  Line 1  hasChildren: function item {  return    item.childrenState==childrenMaybe    item.childrenState==childrenLoaded && item.children.length  ;  },  fetch makes service requests. The service defaults to dojo.xhrGet; how- ever, any function that implements the dojo.xhrGet API can be speciﬁed for the service by setting the service property of the store  we’ll use this feature later and provide a mock service . Here’s fetch:  Download baf step4 baf data LazyTreeStore.js  Line 1  fetch:function  * Object? *  request { var result= dojo.mixin {}, request ; if  typeof result.id == "undefined"  {    default to get the root... result.id= 0;  } result.theDeferred= this.service {  url: this.url, handleAs: "json-comment-optional", content: this.requestParams result , load: dojo.hitch this, this.onLoad, result , error: dojo.hitch this, this.onError, result   } ; result.abort= function  {  15  result.theDeferred.abort.apply result.theDeferred, arguments ;  }; return result;  },  -  -  -  5  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10   STEP 4: THE NAVIGATOR PANE AND ON-DEMAND DATA STORE  509  Finally, when the service calls back the load routine speciﬁed by fetch, the new items are processed, and any callbacks speciﬁed by the fetch parameters are executed as required by the dojo.data.api.Read read API:  Download baf step4 baf data LazyTreeStore.js  Line 1  onLoad: function request, data {  var abort= false; request.abort= function   {  abort= true;  5  };    data is either a single item or an array of children if  !dojo.isArray data   {    returned a single item; therefore turn it into an array... data= [data];  } else if  this.sort  { data.sort this.sort ;    set the children of the parent if  data.length  {  this._idToItem[data[0].parentId].childrenState= childrenLoaded; this._idToItem[data[0].parentId].children= data;    set the _idToItem for each item dojo.forEach data, function item {  this._idToItem[item.id]= item;  }, this ;  var scope= request.scope  dojo.global;  if request.onBegin {  request.onBegin.call scope, data.length, request ;  30  }  if  request.onItem && !abort  {  dojo.forEach data, function item {  if  !abort  {  35  request.onItem.call scope, item, request ;  10  15  20  25  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  }  }  } } ;  }  }  },  40  if  request.onComplete && !abort  {  request.onComplete.call scope,  request.onItem ? null : data , request ;  The implementation of the remaining store methods is trivial.   STEP 4: THE NAVIGATOR PANE AND ON-DEMAND DATA STORE  510  Implementing a Mock Service  This is the point where you usually stop working on the client and open a whole new can of worms on the server. We don’t want to do that. Let’s ﬁnish the client! The idea is to create some machinery that reacts like a real server but isn’t. Ideally, it should be rock-solid and easy to conﬁgure with different response patterns. It must be much easier to implement than a real server; otherwise, it would be foolish to waste time with it. With JavaScript and Dojo, all of this is easy to achieve.  The idea is to initialize the mock server machinery with a bunch of preprogrammed responses. Typically, some kind of JSON map is pro- vided that maps a set of server requests to a set of responses. But other designs are possible, including collecting a response directly from the user. To make the mock server behave like a real server, it should sim- ulate asynchrony. If the mock server were to immediately return the response, then the unpredictability of an asynchronous return would be lost, and the mock server would cause the client program to take quite different execution paths than a real server. Asynchrony is easily simulated with a timer. Let’s put this all together an implement a mock server that returns tree items.  The BAF class baf.test.mocks.services.Base implements the asynchronous simulation with a timer. It includes the method call that implements the callback API just like dojo.xhr*:  Download baf step4 baf test mocks services Base.js  Line 1  dojo.provide "baf.test.mocks.services.Base" ;  function  {  dojo.declare "baf.test.mocks.services.Base", null, {  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  constructor: function args {  this.delay= args.delay  100;  },  getService: function   {  return dojo.hitch this, "call" ;  10  },  call: function args {  var result= new dojo.Deferred  ; if  args.load  {  15  result.addCallback args.load ;  } if  args.error  {  result.addErrback args.load ;  }   STEP 4: THE NAVIGATOR PANE AND ON-DEMAND DATA STORE  511  20  if  args.handle  {  result.addBoth args.handle ;  } setTimeout dojo.hitch this, "handler", result, args , this.delay ; return result;  25  },  handler: function theDeferred, args {  throw new Error 'baf.test.mocks.services.Base: handler not specified' ;  30  } ;  dojo.declare "baf.test.mocks.services.Base", null, {  }  }   ;   function  {  call creates a new dojo.Deferred instance just like dojo.xhr*; inserts any load, error, or handle functions into the callback queue; and then con- nects a timer to the handle method. The default implementation of han- dle throws an exception; subclasses implement handle to simulate a server response, as we’ll see in a moment. The length of the timer is controlled by the property delay  line 23 . It can be initialized in con- struction  line 5  and changed at any time.  The BAF class baf.test.mocks.services.Navigator simulates a service suit- able for use with baf.data.LazyTreeStore. The mock server is initialized with an entire tree hierarchy at construction. Then handler simply re- turns an item or an item’s children:  Download baf step4 baf test mocks services Navigator.js  Line 1  dojo.declare   "baf.test.mocks.services.Navigator", baf.test.mocks.services.Base, { constructor: function args {  this._delay= 200; this._data= args.data;  var idToItem= this._idToItem= []; function walk item  {  idToItem[item.id]= item; dojo.forEach item.children, walk ;  } walk args.data ;  },  handler: function theDeferred, args {  function getItemToReturn item {  var result= dojo.mixin {}, item ; result.childrenState=  item.children  ?  baf.data.LazyTreeStore.childrenMaybe : baf.data.LazyTreeStore.childrenNever;  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  15  20   STEP 4: THE NAVIGATOR PANE AND ON-DEMAND DATA STORE  512  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  30  35  40  45  delete result.children; return result;  25  }  if  !args.content.getChildren  {  var item= this._idToItem[args.content.id]; if  item  {  theDeferred.callback getItemToReturn item  ;  theDeferred.callback {} ;  } else {  }  } else {  var parent= this._idToItem[args.content.id]; if  parent && parent.children  {  var result= []; dojo.forEach parent.children, function child {  result.push getItemToReturn child  ;  } ; theDeferred.callback result ;  } else {  theDeferred.callback [] ;  }  }  }  During construction, the tree is walked to build a map from item id to item. This simpliﬁes the handle implementation. When handle looks up the item, if the requested item is not found, then an empty object  line 32  or an empty array  line 43  is returned depending upon whether a single item or an item’s children were requested. If the item is found, then the function getItemToReturn creates a copy of the item, sets the childrenState property, and deletes the children. The children are deleted because the contract with the server says the only way to get children is to request them directly. Notice that top-level properties are copied to a new object by the expression dojo.mixin {}. item . It wouldn’t work to return a reference to the item in the mock service’s data since deleting the children would result in deleting the mock service’s data.  All that’s left is to construct a JSON object that gives the value of some hierarchy to be simulated. This code is fairly uninteresting so we don’t show it.  Connecting All the Parts  Now we have all the parts: a dijit.Tree connects to a baf.dijit.LazyTreeModel, which connects to a baf.data.LazyTreeStore, which connects to a baf.test. mocks.services.Navigator. You can see how you might want to mix and   STEP 4: THE NAVIGATOR PANE AND ON-DEMAND DATA STORE  513  match different implementations of any of these items. For example, maybe some trees can connect to a different model that also writes data. Or, maybe other trees with small amounts of read-only data ignore the model completely and connect to a dojo.data.ItemFileReadStore. With these possibilities in mind, the class obe.Navigator accepts a hash that describes which tree widget, optional model, dojo.data driver, and ser- vice to connect:  Download baf step4 obe Navigator.js  Line 1  dojo.provide "obe.Navigator" ;  function  {  dojo.declare "obe.Navigator", null, {  5  constructor: function   args   startup parameters passed to main   {  }  }  if  args.navigator.store  {  this.store = new args.navigator.store args.navigator.storeArgs ; args.navigator.modelArgs.store= this.store; args.navigator.widgetArgs.store= this.store;  } if  args.navigator.model  {  this.model= new args.navigator.model args.navigator.modelArgs ; args.navigator.widgetArgs.model= this.model;  this.widget= new args.navigator.widget args.navigator.widgetArgs ;  20  } ;  ;dojo.declare "obe.Navigator", null, {  }   ;   function  {  Notice how args not only says how to initialize new class instances via the args.navigator.storeArgs, args.navigator.modelArgs, and args.navigator. widgetArgs properties but also which classes to instantiate via the args. navigator.stores, args.navigator.model, and args.navigator.widget properties. obe.main sets defaults for these:  Download baf step4 obe main.js  Line 1  var defaults= {  navigator: {  store: baf.data.LazyTreeStore, storeArgs: {  service: dojo.xhr},  model: baf.dijit.LazyTreeModel, modelArgs: {}, widget: dijit.Tree,  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  15  5  -  -  -  -  -  -   STEP 4: THE NAVIGATOR PANE AND ON-DEMAND DATA STORE  514  widgetArgs: {  persist: false, region: "left", style: "width: 20%; overflow: auto", splitter: true, id: "navigator", showRoot: false}  }  };  obe.main.startup= function args  {    mixin defaults to args... args= baf.util.setDefaults args, defaults ;  baf.util.setDefaults  line 21  takes care of mixing nested objects.  The obe.test.tests.run002 startup module overrides some of these. In par- ticular, the mock service is given:  Download baf step4 obe test tests run001.js  Line 1  dojo.provide "obe.test.tests.run001" ; dojo.require "obe.test.data.navigator.set001" ; dojo.require "obe.test.data.command.set001" ; dojo.require "baf.test.mocks.services.Navigator" ;  function  {  var navData= obe.test.data.navigator.set001; var navigatorService= new baf.test.mocks.services.Navigator {  data: navData  } ;  var startupArgs= {  commandItems: obe.test.data.command.set001.commandItems, menu: obe.test.data.command.set001.mainMenu, navigator: {  storeArgs: {  service: navigatorService.getService  , root: navData  }, modelArgs: {  root: navData  }  }  }; obe.main.startup startupArgs ;    fake it for now... obe.main.statusbar.setTextPane "message", "Ready..." ; obe.main.statusbar.setTextPane "userName", "Rawld C. Gill" ; obe.main.statusbar.setTextPane "role", "Administrator" ;  }   ;  10  15  20  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  5  10  15  20  25  30   STEP 5: WORKSPACE OBJECTS  515  Figure 19.1: Application with a tree-based navigator  With that, we’re done with step 4. Figure 19.1 shows the navigator in all its glory. We hope you agree that Dojo’s tree machinery gives you tremendous power while being quite simple to work with.  19.2 Step 5: Workspace Objects  We’re down to the last step—loading and displaying a WSO. Of all the steps, the machinery that’s shown in this one is the most powerful; it’s also quite simple.  Recall that a WSO is simply a container of widgets. Such a container could hold anything representable in a browser, assuming the neces- sary components existed. Several design possibilities exist here. One example is a container that prepackages some components and behav- ior, forming a kind of template in which to put more components. Another example is a design-time container where a WSO deﬁnition could be constructed in a WYSIWYG environment. Also, there is no reason the components must be Dijit components. They could be com- ponents from other widget systems and or nonvisual computational components. We mention these possibilities to highlight the extensive   STEP 5: WORKSPACE OBJECTS  516  capabilities of a WSO. A WSO, and by extension a browser-based UI, can be used to implement nearly anything—a word processor, a CRUD database form, a spreadsheet—your imagination is the limit.  Implementing a WSO Widget  BAF includes the class baf.dijit.Wso that implements a Dijit-based widget that holds a hierarchy of Dijit components. Let’s assume that the data returned by the navigator service includes a type-identiﬁer  TID  and object-identiﬁer  OID  for each item. Further assume that two other services are available that return a WSO deﬁnition given a TID and data given a OID. When the user clicks a navigator tree node, the two services are queried resulting in two dojo.Deferred objects being imme- diately returned. Then a new instance of baf.dijit.Wso is instantiated with the Deferred objects passed as constructor arguments. We’ll call an instance of baf.dijit.Wso simply a WSO for the remainder of this chapter.  When a WSO is ﬁrst created, the Deferreds that get the WSO deﬁnition and data may or may not have completed. So, the WSO displays a mes- sage saying that it’s loading and then hooks up continuation functions to the callback queues that continue processing when both Deferreds complete. This should sound familiar—it’s the same algorithm we used in Section 6.4, Managing Callbacks with dojo.Deferred, on page 123. The continuation functions instantiate the hierarchy of Dijit compo- nents given by the deﬁnition, initialize them with data, and display the result to the user.  baf.dijit.Wso is derived from dijit.form.Form; this provides a few conve- nience features such as form validation. Since the key abstraction of baf.dijit.Wso is a container of widgets, dijit._Container is mixed in. This also helps with duties such as calling the startup method on contained widgets. Here are baf.dijit.Wso’s declaration and construction routines:  Download baf step5 baf dijit Wso.js  dojo.provide "baf.dijit.Wso" ; dojo.require "dijit.form.Form" ; dojo.require "dijit._Container" ;  function  {  dataResult: null, wsoDefResult: null,  postscript: function  {  this.inherited arguments ;  Line 1  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  dojo.declare "baf.dijit.Wso", [dijit.form.Form, dijit._Container], {   STEP 5: WORKSPACE OBJECTS  517    connect the callbacks... this.data.addCallback this, "_continueWithData" ; this.data.addErrback this, "_abortLoad" ; this.wsoDef.addCallback this, "_continueWithWsoDef" ; this.wsoDef.addErrback this, "_abortLoad" ;  },  },  buildRendering: function  {  this.inherited arguments ;   TODO: make this better... this._loading= document.createElement "p" ; var node= this._loading; dojo.addClass node, "bafDijitwsoLoading" ; node.innerHTML= "Loading..."; dojo.place node, this.domNode, "last" ;   END-TODO  All arguments passed to the constructor get mixed into the new WSO instance by the superclass’s postscript method called at line 10. As men- tioned earlier, the two Deferreds that return the WSO deﬁnition and data are passed to the constructor, so, for example, this.wsoDef holds the Deferred object that’s retrieving the WSO deﬁnition. postCreate hooks up the Deferreds’ callbacks starting at line 13. buildRendering adds a single p element that displays the message “loading”; a real application would probably put a little animation up to entertain the user. _continueWith- Data, __continueWithWsoDef, and _abortLoad are unsurprising:  Download baf step5 baf dijit Wso.js  Line 1  _continueWithData: function data  {  this.dataResult= data; if  this.wsoDefResult  {  this._finishLoad  ;  _continueWithWsoDef: function wsoDef  {  this.wsoDefResult= wsoDef; if  this.dataResult  {  10  this._finishLoad  ;  }  },  }  },  15  _abortLoad: function   {  if  !this.data  {  return;  }  15  20  25  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -   STEP 5: WORKSPACE OBJECTS  518  20  var  data= this.data, wsoDef= this.wsoDef;  this.data= null; this.wsoDef= null;  data.cancel  ; wsoDef.cancel  ;  25  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  30  this._loading.innerHTML= "FAILED!!";  },  _continueWithData and _continueWithWsoDef both store their results  lines 2 and 9 ; when both routines have completed  line 3 or 10 , _ﬁnishLoad is called to load the WSO with widgets and data. _abortLoad marks that an error has occurred by nulling both Deferreds and then notiﬁes the user; nulling the Deferreds gives a way to prevent _abortLoad from being executed more than once.  Before we can discuss _ﬁnishLoad, we need to understand what a WSO deﬁnition looks like. Broadly speaking, there are two possibilities. First, it could just be a chunk—probably a rather large chunk—of HTML. In this case, the innerHTML property of the root DOM node of the form could be set to the chunk and then the dojo.parser.parse called to parse the subtree. You’ve seen this time and again in all the declarative widget examples throughout the book.1 The second possibility is for a WSO deﬁnition to be delivered as data, typically a JavaScript object. Then a processor traverses the data and constructs the widgets explicitly.  There are advantages and disadvantages to each method; neither is right or wrong. The second method is convenient for constructing higher levels of abstraction, less verbose deﬁnitions, and very fast pro- cessors, particularly when matched with a tool  for example, a WYSI- WYG editor  for contructing the WSO deﬁnition.  baf.dijit.Wso includes a processor that constructs the WSO from data. The processor expects a JSON object that gives a few top-level proper- ties followed by a hierarchy of children objects.  1. dojo.parser.parse has been called automatically when the document was loaded by Dojo as a result of setting the djConﬁg option parseOnLoad to true.   STEP 5: WORKSPACE OBJECTS  519  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  15  20  25  Here’s an example:  Line 1  {  tid: 1, size: ["51em", "25em"], "class": "crf", requires: [  "baf.dijit.StaticText"],    begin a singe WSO definition   the type identifier   the w x h of this WSO   the HTML class of this WSO   the classes this WSO uses  children: {  title: [    the contained widgets   each child is an object in the hash  "baf.dijit.StaticText",   [0] => the class {   [1] => ctor args  "class": "crfTitle", posit: {  t: "1em", h: "5em", l: "1em", w: "10em"  }, q: "tl", text: "Demographics"  }, {  }    et cetera...    [2] => children of this child   therefore, forming a hierarchy!  ],   end the child named 'title' someOtherChild: [    et cetera...  ]   end the child named 'someOtherChild'  }  }  The top-level properties include the TID  property tid, line 2 , the layout size of the WSO  property size, line 3 , HTML attributes to add to the root DOM node for the WSO  line 4 shows the property class, but others such as style could also be included , and an array of modules that the WSO deﬁnition needs  property requires, line 5 . Lastly, the contained widgets are given in the property children, an object, where each property of the children object names a widget. Widgets are speciﬁed by giving an array of two or three elements. The ﬁrst element gives the widget class, the second gives the constructor arguments to use when creating the particular widget instance, and the optional third element gives the list of children  if any  contained by the widget. Since widgets can contain other widgets, the structure forms a hierarchy.  Given this structure, two steps are required to populate the container with the children. First, the require array must be traversed to ensure that all required modules are loaded.   STEP 5: WORKSPACE OBJECTS  520  Download baf step5 baf dijit Wso.js  Line 1  _finishLoad: function   {  dojo.forEach this.wsoDefResult.require, function module {  dojo["require"] module ;  } ; dojo.addOnLoad dojo.hitch this, "_buildForm"  ;  -  -  -  5  -  },  Notice here how we wrote dojo["require"] module  instead of the usual dojo.require module . This causes the build system to ignore this dojo. require statement, which is what we want  "module" is not a module; the value of module is a module, and this value isn’t knowable at build time . Since the code may be deployed with the cross-domain loader, the require statements will return immediately—before the module is loaded. The dojo.addOnLoad call causes the process to wait until all the requested modules have loaded before continuing with _buildForm. This is a useful pattern for advanced designs.  _buildForm implements the processor that reads the WSO deﬁnition and builds the WSO; it’s exceedingly simple. After setting the size of the top-level DOM node, it walks the tree, instantiating widgets along the way:  Download baf step5 baf dijit Wso.js  Line 1  _buildForm: function  {  dojo._destroyElement this._loading ; delete this._loading;  var wsoDef= this.wsoDefResult; dojo.style this.domNode, {  position: "absolute", width: wsoDef.size[0], height: wsoDef.size[1]  10  } ;  function walkChildren children, parentWidget {  for  var p in children  { var child= children[p]; var ctor= dojo.getObject child[0] ; var widget= new ctor child[1] ; parentWidget.addChild widget ; if  child[2]  {  walkChildren child[2], widget ;  }  }  }  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  15  20   STEP 5: WORKSPACE OBJECTS  521  if  wsoDef.children  {  walkChildren wsoDef.children, this ;  25  -  -  -  -  }  } this.startup  ;  As it stands, the processor is quite powerful: it can generate any hierar- chy of classes. The only requirement is that a component that contains children must deﬁne the method addChild. Although the design shown  WSO deﬁnition + processor  doesn’t include the ability to deﬁne and hook up event handlers, this could be easily added.  Looking back at Figure 18.1, on page 478, notice that the header is comprised of several blocks of static text. The Dijit-based class baf.dijit. StaticText controls a block of static text. Similarly, the Dijit-based class baf.dijit.Pair implements a pair of children widgets arranged side by side or stacked. These two widget classes make deﬁning form decorations a snap. Let’s implement baf.dijit.StaticText.  Implementing a Static Text Widget  baf.dijit.StaticText has three key capabilities:  1. It displays a block of text at an absolute position within its con- tainer. The block and text can be styled directly through the HTML style attribute or indirectly through the class attribute associated with a style sheet style.  2. The text can be put in any of the nine locations within the box by specifying the property q  quadrant . q is given by vertical-location x horizontal-location, where vertical-location is one of {’t’, ’c’, ’b’} and horizontal-location is one of {’l’, ’c’, ’r’}. For example, "bc" means put the text at the bottom-center of the box.  3. It can contain other children widgets and be contained by other  widget containers.  4. It’s a full Dijit-based widget component.  Does this sound complicated? It actually takes fewer than 100 lines to implement!  Requirements [3] and [4] come nearly free by deriving from dijit._Widget and mixing in dijit._Container and dijit._Contained.   STEP 5: WORKSPACE OBJECTS  522  Here’s the dojo.declare statement:  Download baf step5 baf dijit StaticText.js  Line 1  dojo.declare "baf.dijit.StaticText",  -  [dijit._Widget, dijit._Container, dijit._Contained],  Next we need to build the DOM tree for the element. It’s just a div element that contains a p element. The bafDijitStaticText class is added to the element to help with building style sheets. Since this component isn’t intended to be used with markup and is very simple, the DOM tree is built directly in buildRendering:  Download baf step5 baf dijit StaticText.js  Line 1  buildRendering: function  {  var node; node= this.domNode= document.createElement "div" ; dojo.addClass node, "bafDijitStaticText" ; node= this._textNode= document.createElement "p" ; dojo.style node, {top:0, left:0, position:"absolute"} ; node.innerHTML= this.text; dojo.place node, this.domNode, "last" ;  },  baf.dijit.StaticText understands the property posit, which deﬁnes the prop- erties l, r, t, b, h, and w for left, right, top, bottom, height, and width. The posit property is converted to a style object like this:  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  15  20  Download baf step5 baf dijit StaticText.js  Line 1  function positToStyle posit {  var result= {position: "absolute"}; if  posit.l  {  result.left= posit.l;  10  result.width= posit.w;  result.right= posit.r;  } if  posit.r  {  } if  posit.w  {  } if  posit.t  {  } if  posit.b  {  } if  posit.h  {  } return result;  }  result.top= posit.t;  result.bottom= posit.b;  result.height= posit.h;   STEP 5: WORKSPACE OBJECTS  523  The style object is then used to set the style of the div in postCreate:  Download baf step5 baf dijit StaticText.js  Line 1  postCreate: function   {  dojo.style this.domNode, positToStyle this.posit  ;  -  -  },  Lastly, the p element needs to be wrestled into the correct position. If any of the corners are speciﬁed, then the left right and top bottom styles can be set to zero, and you’re done. But to center the text, the div’s content box and p’s margin box must be calculated. These metrics are not reliable until the elements reside in the displayable document— something that doesn’t happen until after construction is complete. This is precisely the point where the startup method comes in handy; it is called after the widget has been displayed. The function getContentPosit calculates the proper position given a q property value and the div and p elements:  Line 1  function getContentPosit quadrant, parent, contentNode {  Download baf step5 baf dijit StaticText.js  var q= quadrant.toLowerCase  ; return dojo.mixin   getContentPosit.calculators[0][q.charAt 0 ] parent, contentNode , getContentPosit.calculators[1][q.charAt 1 ] parent, contentNode   } getContentPosit.calculators= [{  t: function  {  10  return {top: 0};  c: function parent, contentNode {  return {top:    dojo.contentBox parent .h - dojo.marginBox contentNode .h    2 +"px"};  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  15  20  25  30   ;  },  },  },  },  b: function  {  return {bottom: 0};  } },{  l: function  {  return {left: 0};  c: function parent, contentNode {  return {left:    dojo.contentBox parent .w - dojo.marginBox contentNode .w    2 +"px"};   STEP 5: WORKSPACE OBJECTS  524  r: function parent, contentNode {  return {right: 0};  -  -  -  -  } }];  Note that the function includes the property calculators that dispatches the required calculation based on the value of q. No if statements, no case statement—this is a nice example of how expressive, parsimo- nious, and powerful JavaScript can be.  baf.dijit.StaticText.startup clears any positions already placed on the p ele- ment and then forces it to the correct position:  Download baf step5 baf dijit StaticText.js  Line 1  startup: function  {  if !this._started  {  this._started= true;  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  15  } } ;  }  },  var style= dojo.mixin   {top: "", left: "", bottom: "", right: ""}, getContentPosit this.q, this.domNode, this._textNode    ; dojo.style this._textNode, style ;  dojo.forEach this.getChildren  , function child {  if  child.startup  {  child.startup  ;  That’s it for baf.dijit.StaticText. baf.dijit.Pair is very similar; it’s included with the code bundled with the book. Let’s get back and ﬁnish up displaying a WSO.  Wiring the WSO to the Framework  OBE can be used to test the baf.dijit.StaticText class. We’ll create a few WSO deﬁnitions that exercise baf.dijit.StaticText, and then we’ll put items in the tree that reference these deﬁnitions. When the user clicks a tree item, a WSO should be created that shows the instantiated baf.dijit. StaticText widgets. Since there is no data involved, we create a mock data service that returns an empty object.  The ﬁrst deﬁnition includes nine baf.dijit.StaticText widgets that show each of the nine text positions inside a container with a border, the sec-   STEP 5: WORKSPACE OBJECTS  525  ond deﬁnition eliminates the border but gives a colorized background, and the third and fourth deﬁnitions do the same thing except with an HTML class associated with a style sheet style. Here’s part of the ﬁrst deﬁnition:  Line 1  obe.test.data.metadata.set002.metadata= [ {  tid: 1, size: ["51em", "25em"], "class": "crf", requires: [baf.dijit.StaticText], children: {  tl: [  "baf.dijit.StaticText", {   ctor args for baf.dijit.StaticText style: "background-color: D0D0D0;", posit: {t:"1em", h:"5em", l:"1em", w:"10em"}, q: "tl", text: "top-left"  }  ], tc: [  }  ],  "baf.dijit.StaticText", {   ctor args for baf.dijit.StaticText style: "background-color: D0D0D0;", posit: {  t: "1em", h: "5em", l: "12em", w: "10em"  }, q: "tc", text: "top-center"  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  15  20  25  30  Next, we need a service to deliver WSO deﬁnitions. Step 5 includes baf.test.mocks.services.WsoDeﬁnitions, a mock server that works just like baf.test.mocks.services.Navigator. The service is created during startup exactly as we did with the navigator mock service. Step 5 also includes a WSO deﬁnition manager  baf.data.WsoDeﬁnitionsManager  that retrieves and caches deﬁnitions from a service. obe.main.startup instantiates one of these objects, connecting it to the service provided in the startup arguments.  Similarly, a data manager is provided  baf.data.DataManager . This is truly trivial; it just immediately returns an empty object.   STEP 5: WORKSPACE OBJECTS  526  Download baf step5 baf data DataManager.js  Line 1  dojo.provide "baf.data.DataManager" ;  function  {  dojo.declare "baf.data.DataManager", null, {  get: function oid {  var result= new dojo.Deferred  ; result.callback {} ; return result;  }  } ;  dojo.declare "baf.data.DataManager", null, {  }   ;   function  {  obe.main.startup instantiates a baf.data.DataManager and stores a ref- erence to the new object in obe.main.dataManager. At this point, OBE has everything in place necessary to start creating WSOs: a global WSO deﬁnitions manager and data manager available through obe.main. wsoDeﬁnitionsManager and obe.main.dataManager.  WSO creation is handled by a little manager class that removes any existing WSO that’s displayed, issues the WSO deﬁnition and data requests, creates a new WSO instance, and places the instance in the workspace pane. It subscribes to the focusNavNode event that the nav- igator tree publishes. When it receives a notiﬁcation that a new tree item has the focus, it loads the WSO given by the tree item:  Download baf step5 obe WorkspaceManager.js  Line 1  dojo.provide "obe.WorkspaceManager" ; dojo.require "obe.main" ; dojo.require "baf.dijit.Wso" ;  function  {  5  var nullObjectValue= {type: 0, oid: 0, form: null};  dojo.declare "obe.WorkspaceManager", null, {  constructor: function   {  this.currentObject= nullObjectValue; dojo.subscribe "focusNavNode", this, "_showObject" ;  },  var  _showObject: function store, item  {  type= store.getValue item, "type" ,   the wsoDefinition type oid= store.getValue item, "oid" , nid= store.getValue item, "id" , currentObject= this.currentObject;    the object id   the navigator id  if  currentObject.type==type && currentObject.oid==oid  {    already the current object return;  }  5  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  10  15  20   STEP 5: WORKSPACE OBJECTS  527    TODO: search for non-current, but loaded object    load the new current object var  data= obe.main.dataManager.get oid , wsoDef= obe.main.wsoDefinitionsManager.get type , theNewObject= new baf.dijit.Wso {data: data, wsoDef: wsoDef} ;    destroy the old current object... this.destroy  ;    display the new current object... obe.main.appContainer.addChild dojo.mixin theNewObject, {  region: "center", id: nid+"_wso"   "wso" => "workspace object"  }  ; obe.main.appContainer.layout  ;    record the current state... currentObject.type= type; currentObject.oid= oid; currentObject.nid= nid; currentObject.form= theNewObject;  50  destroy: function   {  var currentObject= this.currentObject; if  currentObject.form  {  obe.main.appContainer.removeChild currentObject.form ; currentObject.form.destroyRecursive  ;  } currentObject= nullObjectValue;  25  30  35  40  45  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  55  60  },  }  } ;  }   ;   function  {  The event is subscribed at line 10. The new WSO is created at line 31, any existing WSO is destroyed at line 34, and the new WSO is placed in the application’s workspace pane at line 37.  In Figure 19.2, on the next page, you can see the application running with the test module obe.test.tests.run002 included in step 5.  We’re not going to hook up data because there’s not much more browser UI insight to be gained by that exercise. Typically, you’ll use one or more dojo.data data stores to manage the data. Widgets that can connect directly to the stores may do so; baf.dijit.WSO could also be extended to pull data from stores and push it into controls, and visa versa, for widgets that don’t have this capability.   STEP 5: WORKSPACE OBJECTS  528  Figure 19.2: OBE testing baf.dijit.StaticText  As you can see, the possibilities are limitless. The WSO abstraction could be extended to build nearly any kind of UI. The OBE frame- work  menu, navigator, workspace, status bar  could be rearranged in countless ways. And of course there’s nothing about the BAF frame- work that’s required to build Dojo-based RIAs. Although it’s a proven design for certain classes of applications, it is but one example of many design options.  If nothing else, we hope this chapter and the previous one have stimu- lated your imagination for what can be done in the browser today with Dojo. Although we’ve covered the most important parts of Dojo exten- sively, there’s a lot more out there, particularly in Dojox. In particular, the graphics framework shows great promise. And Dojo doesn’t stop with Dojo. It has been carefully built to play well with others, opening up possible implementation options even further. We look forward to using the great applications you will no doubt create!   Chapter 20  Going Forward  The health of an open source project can be measured by how many contributions its fosters. By this measure, Dojo is very healthy indeed. There are constant additions of new components, widgets, and pro- gramming aids to Dojo, especially in the Dojox area.  Unfortunately, all these features won’t ﬁt in a reasonably sized book. So for this last chapter, we’ll give you an overview of the ones we ﬁnd interesting and useful and leave the research to you. Think of it as a rough map to new worlds in Dojo. You have your compass handy, so happy trails!  20.1 Foundations  First, we’ll cover some modules to make the programming life easier. They extend DOM utility, widget class creation, and agile design tools already in Dojo.  dojo.behavior: Assigning code to queries  Behaviors have been part of Internet Explorer since version 4, and now Dojo provides a cross-browser version. Behaviors are an extension of the CSS model, where nodes that ﬁt a certain crite- ria  the selector  are automatically assigned colors, size, and so on. Behaviors automatically assign code to nodes that ﬁt a cer- tain CSS selector. They can dojo.connect a node event with an event handler, for example. Or they can run an arbitrary bit of JavaScript code on the newly created node. It’s a little like doing a dojo.query with a forEach.   FOUNDATIONS  530  All this is done by adding rules to the dojo.behavior rule book. It’s like a CSS ﬁle, except you add rules through JavaScript. One catch is you must call dojo.behavior.apply to apply the rules, where in regular CSS the rules are applied automatically. But even that’s not a big problem. For one thing, it allows you to batch node updates and execute them in one shot. For another, apply is smart enough to make only incremental changes to the nodes. It doesn’t go through the whole DOM tree to match rules but instead applies only rules to nodes added since the last apply.  dojox.analytics: Client logging and analysis  One advantage of the ﬁll-and-submit web model is you can easily track client progress throughout the site. If a particular feature is being used heavily, or not at all, you can detect it. Ajax appli- cations are much tougher to track. Although you can watch data requests on your web server log, they are often short and uninfor- mative. So, dojox.analytics offers a library to hook JavaScript events to data gathering. Its plug-ins work to track speciﬁc events in the system: mouse clicks, log messages, and so forth. You can then have the client send these logs back to your web server at regular intervals.  dojox.dtl: Django template language for Dojo  The Dijit templating language, described in Section 17.1, Widget Classes Using dijit.Declaration, on page 456, provides the mini- mum language needed for building widgets. Templates, however, are very monolithic. Making a small change to a widget’s template requires subclassing the widget and replacing the entire template. Templates have many other uses too, as in dojo.string.substitute. A template language with branching, loops, and more sophisticated expressions would be widely useful.  Django  http:  www.djangoproject.com  , a Python framework, has a template language that is so useful that it has been ported to Dojox and called DTL. Django templates have very nice reusability features, so templates feel more object-oriented. Over the next few releases, DTL will gradually replace the older template system in the bundled Dijit components.  dojox.wire: Wire protocol  So, Dojo has a ﬂexible data gatherer in dojo.data and fantastic form controls in Dijit. But how do you ship data from one to the   GRAPHICS  531  other? With what you know now, it’s a fairly manual process. But with dojox.wire, you can bind data to controls declaratively. When a change occurs in the form control data, it can be wired to write back to the data store, and vice versa.  This sounds vaguely familiar. Both Grid and Tree have data bind- ing built-in, and in fact, Grid’s binding is fairly sophsticated. You can think of dojox.wire as an abstraction to this, providing linkage between any Dijit form controls and data.  DOH: JavaScript unit tester  Earlier Dojo releases used various JavaScript unit testing pack- ages. But for the pivotal 0.9 release, the committers decided to build the unit testing system they really wanted. DOH  think what Homer Simpson would say upon ﬁnding a bug  is that package. Like most unit testing frameworks, DOH includes assertions, set- up and teardown facilities, and convenient test grouping. And since all Dojo, Dijit, and Dojox unit tests are written with DOH, you have lots of examples to consult!  Dojo has always had an active graphic design subcommunity, mak- ing early use of Scalable Vector Graphics  SVG  and other new stan- dards. These modules are fairly well established, and additions have been made through Google’s Summer of Code programs in the past few years.  dojox.fx: Animations  The dojox.fx packages adds more animations such as cross-fading, highlighting, and drop shadowing to the standard Dojo Core set. It also adds the popular easing functions, which add pizzazz to the standard transitions.  dojox.gfx and dojox.gfx3d: Low-level graphics  If you’re obsessed with graphics—arcs, curves, gradient ﬁlls, poly- gons, and all those other good things—then these packages are for you. The output can be rendered in several formats including SVG and Microsoft Silverlight, depending on what the client has installed. The 3D graph package, in the experimental stage right now, adds the third dimension and lighting.  20.2 Graphics   DOJO DATA AND STORAGE  532  20.3 Dojo Data and Storage  dojox.charting: Graphs and charts  A clear application of the drawing tools, dojox.charting provides tools for drawing 2D and 3D charts. You can plug either dojo.data or simple JavaScript data into one end. Then you can get line graphs, bar graphs, pie charts, and many others with customiz- able scales and axes.  dojox.image: Image widgets  The dojox.image module houses widgets for image collections: a thumbnail picker, some assorted slide show and gallery compo- nents, and an image magniﬁer.  It seems like we never run out of new sources for data. Dojo has been keeping up with this area, keeping it in the forefront of enterprise JavaScript applications.  dojox.off: Dojo Ofﬂine  With increased client functionality, you can have less dependence on an always-on Internet connection. Dojo Ofﬂine is a project that takes advantage of this, providing synchronization services between client and server data stores. A demo application, Moxie, lets you edit web pages ofﬂine and then synchronize them with a Java server-side component when you reconnect.  dojox.storage: Link to Google Gears client-side storage  Dojo Ofﬂine uses Google Gears, a client-side mini-relational data- base that understands SQL. This storage module serves as the intermediary between the two, but you can use it on its own. It’s perfect for storing user preferences and caching oft-used data, saving bandwidth, and increasing performance.  New dojo.data drivers  Dojo 1.0 introduced dojo.data drivers for the web services Flickr, Picasa, and SnapLogic.  Yes, there are photography buffs in the Dojo community!  It also included a specialized XML format called OPML, which has a ﬁxed set of tags and the Identity feature, so it’s good for using in Dijit components. Dojo 1.1 added an Atom XML format driver, a key-value pair driver  like an INI or Java-style property ﬁles , and a driver based on JSONPath.

I find that the book contains mostly beginner and intermediate information. Not enough advanced topics or talking about creation the programmatic way. The layout of the book is a bit odd (Drag and Drop is only talked about for a few pages within the context of working with the Tree widget). For more advanced developers looking for more of a reference book, consider looking elsewhere.
