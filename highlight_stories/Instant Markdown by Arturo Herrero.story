This book has been especially created to provide  you with all the information you need to set up Markdown. Markdown is a simple  way to add headings, links, and rich formatting to plain text documents and  convert them to perfect HTML files. You will learn the syntax of Markdown,   get started with writing and doing some cool things, and discover some tips   and tricks for using Markdown. This document contains the following sections: So what is Markdown? helps you find out what Markdown actually is, what you   can do with it, and why it's so great. Installation will help you learn how to download and install Markdown with  minimum fuss and then set it up so that you can use it as soon as possible. Quick start – Creating your first Markdown document will show you how to get  started with Markdown. Top 8 features you need to know about will help you learn how to perform eight  tasks with the most important features of Markdown. By the end of this section,  you will be able to do the following with Markdown:   Ê Participating in forums and discussions: Use Markdown on different websites  Ê Writing e-mails: Write e-mails with Markdown quickly and easily  Ê Sharing documents: Share a single Markdown document with others  Ê Blogging: Create a blog using Markdown  Ê To-Do lists: Create To-Do lists with Markdown  Ê Presentations: Create beautiful, simple, and interactive presentations  Ê Converting files to other formats: Convert a document to other formats    such as PDF   Ê Using Markdown extensions: Use extensions to get more advanced features  People and places you should get to know provides you with many useful links  to the project page and forums as well as a number of helpful articles, tutorials,  blogs, and Twitter feeds of Markdown's super contributors.    So, what is Markdown? Markdown is a lightweight markup language that simplifies the workflow of web writers. It was  created in 2004 by John Gruber with contributions and feedback from Aaron Swartz.  Markdown was described by John Gruber as:  "A text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an  easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML   or HTML ."  Markdown is two different things:   Ê A simple syntax to create documents in plain text  Ê A software tool written in Perl that converts the plain text formatting to HTML  Markdown's formatting syntax was designed with simplicity and readability as a design goal. We  add rich formatting to plain text without considering that we are writing using a markup language.  The main features of Markdown Markdown is:   Ê Easy to use: Markdown has an extremely simple syntax that you can learn quickly  Ê Fast: Writing is much faster than with HTML, we can dramatically reduce the time we    Ê Clean: We can clearly read and write documents that are always translated into HTML    Ê Flexible: It is suitable for many things such as writing on the Internet, e-mails, creating   spend crafting HTML tags  without mistakes or errors  presentations   Ê Portable: Documents are just plain text; we can edit Markdown with any basic text   editor in any operating system   Ê Made for writers: Writers can focus on distraction-free writing   Here, we can see a quick comparison of the same document between HTML and Markdown.   This is the final result that we achieve in both cases:  The following code is written in HTML:   Markdown    This a  simple  example of Markdown.    Check the <a href="http:  daringfireball.net     projects markdown ">official website .   The following code is an equivalent document written in Markdown:  This a **simple** example of Markdown.   Features:        Simple     Fast     Portable      Markdown   Features: - Simple - Fast - Portable  4   Check the [official website].  [official website]: http:  daringfireball.net projects markdown   Installation Markdown is commonly used in different websites, text editors, and applications, so most of the  time we don't need to install a specific converter to use it because it is integrated into the tool  that we are already using. However, in order to directly transform any Markdown document,   we can use a Markdown converter.  In 5 easy steps, we can install Markdown and get it set up on your system.  Step 1 – Prerequisites The official Markdown converter is a script written in Perl. This is the converter that we are   going to use.  Before we use Markdown, we will need to check that we have all of the required elements   listed here:   Ê Perl 5.6.0 or later  Ê The Markdown script  Step 2 – Downloading and installing Perl Perl is a general-purpose programming language, originally developed for text manipulation   and now used for a wide range of tasks.  It is installed by default in OS X and many different Linux distributions, so you don't need to  install it if you are using any of these operating systems. But you need to download and install   it if you are a Microsoft Windows user.  MS Windows The official Perl website provides references to several Perl distributions for MS Windows   at http:  www.perl.org get.htmlwin32.  In this example, we choose Strawberry Perl, which is a Perl environment for MS Windows   and contains all you need to run and develop Perl applications. It can be found at   http:  strawberryperl.com .  5   We suggest that you download the most current and stable build of Strawberry Perl. After  downloading the Windows installer file, just follow the onscreen instructions to set it up on   your system:  Mac OS X Mac OS X already has Perl installed. Check the latest version on the official website at   http:  www.perl.org get.htmlosx.  Linux distributions You probably already have Perl installed. Check the latest version on the official website   http:  www.perl.org get.htmlunix_like.  Step 3 – Verifying that Perl is working In order to be sure that Perl is working properly, we can find out which version is installed   on our system. Open the command-line interface on your system and type perl -v.  6   Step 4 – Downloading Markdown The Markdown converter is a script only 18 KB in size, and it has been on Version 1.0.1 since  December 17, 2004.  We can download it from the official website, http:  daringfireball.net projects  downloads Markdown_1.0.1.zip.  Step 5 – Running Markdown The Perl script is not too complicated to use. Again, in our command-line interface, we run   Perl that takes two arguments: the path of the Markdown script that we just downloaded   and the path of the Markdown file that we want convert.  perl Markdown.pl markdown-file.md  Markdown will process the Markdown file; the resulting output after running the script is the  HTML code shown in the terminal.  To save this output, we redirect the standard output to an HTML file:  perl Markdown.pl markdown-file.md > output-file.html  And that's it!! By this point, we should have a working installation of Markdown and are free to play around  and discover more about it.  7   Quick start – Creating your first Markdown  document The syntax of Markdown is incredibly simple and intuitive. At the end of this section, we will  have learned all the syntax we need to write anything with Markdown.  Markdown documents are created as plain text files, and it's not a requirement to create these  files with concrete file extensions to use them. However, in order for editors or applications   to make sure that the file they are using is Markdown-formatted, we could use some of the   most common file extensions, such as .md, .mkdn, or .markdown.  Step 1 – Inserting paragraph and line breaks A paragraph of text is one or more consecutive lines:  A paragraph, divided into two lines.  The preceding code will produce:   A paragraph, divided into two lines.   Paragraphs separated by one or more blank lines create new paragraphs:  A paragraph  Another paragraph, separated by a new line.  The preceding code will produce:   A paragraph   Another paragraph, separated by a new line.   Two or more spaces at the end of the line create a line break:  A sentence,   with a line break.  The preceding code will produce:   A sentence,   with a line break   8   Step 2 – Inserting headers There are two styles for declaring headers in Markdown: setext and atx.  Setext style For the two top-level headers  the   and   tags , there is a special syntax that can   be used:  The number of equal-to signs  =  or hyphens  -  doesn't  matter; you can get away with just one.  Atx style Begin a paragraph with a hash   , and that paragraph becomes a header. The number of   hashes signifies the heading level number  h1 – h6 :  Header 1 ========  Header 2 --------  The preceding code will produce:   Header 1   Header 2    Header 1  Header 2  Header 3  Header 4  Header 5  Header 6  Optionally, we may close atx hash headers:   Header 1   Header 2   Header 3   Header 4   Header 5   Header 6   The number of closing hashes doesn't matter.  9   Step 3 – Inserting emphasis Markdown treats asterisks  *  and underscores  _  as indicators of emphasis. A single symbol is  used for italics and a double symbol for bold:  The preceding code will produce:   Header 1   Header 2   Header 3   Header 4   Header 5   Header 6   *single asterisks* _single underscores_ **double asterisks** __double underscores__  The preceding code will produce:   single asterisks   single underscores   double asterisks   double underscores   Step 4 – Inserting lists Markdown supports ordered  numbered  and unordered  bulleted  lists.  Ordered lists Ordered lists use numbers as list markers:  1. One 2. Two 6. Six  The actual numbers you use to mark the list have no effect.  This will produce:       One     Two     Six     10   Unordered lists Unordered lists use asterisks  * , plus signs  + , and hyphens  -  as list markers:  * A list. * Second element. + A new entry. - Another entry in a list. - And the list goes on.  Asterisks, plus signs, and hyphens are interchangeable.  The preceding code will produce:       A list.     Second element.     A new entry.     Another entry in a list.     And the list goes on.     Nested lists List can be nested as follows:  - First level     - Second level         - Third level     - Second level again  The preceding code will produce:       First level     Second level         Third level           Second level again       11   Step 5 – Inserting links Markdown supports two styles of links: inline and reference. In both styles, the link text is  delimited by square brackets  [ and ]  and the title attribute is optional.  Inline An example is shown as follows:  The preceding code will produce:  An example of [inline link] http:  example.com "Example" . [This link] http:  example.net   has no title attribute.   An example of <a href="http:  example.com"    title="Example">inline link .    This link  has no title    attribute.   Reference  This is [an example][id] reference-style link. This is [an example] [id] reference-style link.  We can use one space to separate the sets of brackets.  Then, anywhere in the document, add:  [id]: http:  example.com   "Optional Title Here" [id]: http:  example.com   'Optional Title Here' [id]: http:  example.com    Optional Title Here   We can enclose the title attribute in double quotes  " ,  single quotes  ' , or parentheses    and   .  This will produce:   This is <a href="http:  example.com " title="Optional Title    Here">an example  reference-style link.   Another way to declare a reference link is by using the link text directly:  This is [another example] reference-style link.  Again, we need the link label somewhere in the document:  [another example]: http:  example.com   12   Step 6 – Inserting automatic links Creating automatic links is possible by wrapping the text with angle brackets      The automatic URL as follows:     This will produce:  An encoded mailto as follows:     This will produce:    http:  example.com           address@example.com    Step 7 – Inserting blockquotes The syntax for blockquotes is similar to that of e-mail blockquotes—it uses right-angle brackets  > :  > A blockquote. > Another line of blockquote.  Optionally, we may only put one bracket before the first line of a paragraph:  > A blockquote. Another line of blockquote.  The preceding code will produce:       A blockquote.   Another line of blockquote.     Blockquotes can be nested:  > First level of the quote. >> Nested blockquote.  The preceding code will produce:       First level of the quote.           Nested blockquote.         13   Step 8 – Inserting code blocks The embedding of pre-formatted code blocks is possible by indenting every line of the block  with four spaces or one tab:      echo 'Hello World'  The preceding code will produce:    echo 'Hello World'    Step 9 – Inserting code spans To insert inline code, we wrap it with backticks  `and` :  Type `echo 'Hello World'` in your terminal  The preceding code will produce:   Type  echo 'Hello World'  in your terminal   Step 10 – Inserting images Markdown uses syntax similar to that of the links to insert images in a document, allowing   two styles: inline and reference.  Inline  ![Alt text]  path to img.jpg "Optional title"   The preceding code will produce:   <img src=" path to img.jpg" alt="Alt text" title=    "Optional title"  >   Reference  ![Alt text][id]  Then, add the following line anywhere in the document:  [id]: url to image "Optional title attribute"  This will produce:   <img src="url to image" alt="Alt text" title=    "Optional title attribute"  >   14   Step 11 – Inserting horizontal rules To insert a horizontal separator, put three or more hyphens  - , asterisks  * , or underscores  _   on a line:  We can use spaces between asterisks, hyphens, or underscores.  Step 12 – Inserting backslash escapes Markdown uses many symbols to specify its syntax. If we want to write any of them without  being interpreted, Markdown provides backslash escapes  \  for the following characters:  --- *** ***** * * * ___  Any of these will produce:     \   backslash `   backtick *   asterisk _   underscore {}  curly braces []  square brackets     parentheses    hash mark +   plus sign -   minus sign  hyphen  .   dot !   exclamation mark  Escape asterisks in text as shown in the following code:  \*this text is surrounded by literal asterisks\*  This will produce:   *this text is surrounded by literal asterisks*   15   Step 13 – Inserting HTML Finally, Markdown allows you to include raw HTML. You may write HTML code anywhere in   a document. Consider the following example:  This is a paragraph.            Row         This is another paragraph.  The preceding code will produce:   This is a paragraph.              Row         This is another paragraph.   16   Top 8 features you'll want to know about As you start to use Markdown, you will realize that there is a wide variety of things that you can  do with it. This section will teach you all about the most commonly performed tasks and most  commonly used features in Markdown.  There are many services that use Markdown. In general, these services are websites that exploit  the full potential of Markdown to do a particular task. Here we will explore some of them.  1 – Forum and discussion Markdown has become very popular, thanks to the different websites and forums that facilitate  discussions among users. Users write Markdown inside web forms; the website does the Markdown  conversion on the server and then displays the text in HTML.  Sites such as GitHub, BitBucket, Reddit, StackOverflow, SourceForge, Trello, and Disqus use  Markdown with great success. Some of these have created their own flavors of Markdown to  add new interesting features to the language. Two of the most famous sites are GitHub and  StackOverflow:   Ê GitHub: Read about it at https:  help.github.com articles github-flavored-  markdown   Ê StackOverflow: Read about it at http:  stackoverflow.com editing-help  17   GitHub Flavored Markdown GitHub uses GitHub Flavored Markdown  GFM , which differs from standard Markdown in a few  significant ways and adds some additional functionality.  Newlines The first difference is in handling line breaks. GFM treats newlines in paragraphs as real line  breaks such as:  A paragraph A new paragraph  Multiple underscores in words GFM ignores multiple underscores in words such as:  ignore_multiple_underscores  URL autolinking GFM creates automatic links for standard URLs.  Fenced code blocks GFM supports fenced code blocks. Just wrap your code blocks in ``` and you won't need to  indent manually as shown in the following lines of code:  Syntax highlighting Code blocks can have syntax highlighting if you request it. In your fenced block, add an optional  language identifier:  ``` function test {   echo "Hello world!" } ```  ```shell function test {   echo "Hello world!" } ```  18  2 – Writing e-mails We use Markdown in websites and that is really nice, but how about in e-mail? Writing e-mails is  one of the things that takes up a lot of our time in the day.   We can write e-mails with Markdown using Markdown Here: http:  markdown-here.com .  Markdown Here is an extension for the most common web browsers  Google Chrome, Firefox,  Safari, and Thunderbird  that lets you write e-mails in Markdown and render it before sending.  Just write e-mails using the Markdown syntax as shown in the following screenshot:  After writing the e-mail, we use the context menu and click on Markdown Toggle to get the final  result before sending the e-mail.  3 – Sharing a single document Creating and sharing a document with someone can be achieved very easily with different web  services. Here we present two of them that work in exactly the same way:   Ê Hashify: Read about it at http:  hashify.me   Ê Socrates: Read about it at http:  socrates.io   19   Every time we go to one of these two sites  Hashify or Socrates , it creates a unique URL to  share with others. We type our document in Markdown on the left-hand side, and automatically  preview the text on the right-hand side as shown in the following screenshot:  4 – Blogging Writing a blog using Markdown is possible in different ways.  Some blog platforms, such as Tumblr, have an editor that supports writing in Markdown.  Other platforms, such as WordPress, have plugins that we can install to compose content   in Markdown. In this case, we need to install WP-Markdown, which allows Markdown to be  enabled in posts, comments, and bbPress forums. For further information on WP-Markdown,   go to http:  wordpress.org plugins wp-markdown .  Another option is to use static site generators such as Jekyll, Octopress, or nanoc. This way we  can transform plain text files into static web pages and blogs.  However, the option that we describe here combines Markdown and Dropbox. Dropbox is a  free service to store files, and we can use this service to save our Markdown plain text files and  publish them using the Web.  Some of the Dropbox Markdown blogging platforms we can use are:   Ê Calepin.co: Read about it at http:  calepin.co   Ê Scriptogr.am: Read about it at http:  scriptogr.am   20   Scriptogr.am Getting started with Scriptogr.am consists of the following three steps:   Step one First we connect Scriptogr.am with our Dropbox account.  Step two We configure our Scriptogr.am account.  After connecting our Dropbox account to Scriptogr.am, some necessary files and folders are  added to our Dropbox account at Apps scriptogram.  21   Step three Just write new posts using Markdown and save the new files in the posts folder. The new blog  entries will automatically be synchronized and published on the blog.  5 – To-do lists We can use Markdown for personal organization. To-do lists are prioritized lists of tasks that we  need to do.  The service that we are going to use is Cheddar, which can be found at https:  cheddarapp.com .  Cheddar uses Markdown to format italics, bold, links, or code when defining tasks. The following  screenshot appears after signing in:  6 – Presentations Creating beautiful, interactive, and simple presentations is possible with some of the presentation  frameworks based on JavaScript and Markdown.  Two such frameworks that support a Markdown extension are reveal.js and deck.js.   Ê reveal.js: Check this out at http:  lab.hakim.se reveal-js   Ê deck.js: Check this out at http:  imakewebthings.com deck.js   22   In reveal.js, each section represents one slide, so we can write slides in plain text   using Markdown:                   Page title          A paragraph with some text and a [link] http:  hakim.se .                           New slide          Presentations made **easy**          7 – Converting files to other formats If we need to convert files from Markdown format into another format, pandoc is the tool that  we need, and it can be found at http:  johnmacfarlane.net pandoc .  Pandoc is able to convert documents from Markdown to many different formats, such as:   Ê HTML formats  XHTML, HTML5, HTML   Ê Word processor formats  Microsoft Word docx, OpenOffice LibreOffice odt,   OpenDocument XML    Ê Ebooks  ePub Versions 2 or Version 3, FictionBook2   Ê Documentation formats  DocBook   Ê TeX formats  LaTeX   Ê PDF  Ê Lightweight markup formats  reStructuredText, Textile   Installing Pandoc is really easy. On the official website, we can find the package installers for   MS Windows and Mac OS X, and an installer is also available in the repositories of different   Linux distributions.  Pandoc is a command-line tool, so we need to open a command-line interface to use it. For  example, to convert a Markdown file to PDF, simply type the following command:  pandoc document.md -s -o document.pdf  23   8 – Markdown extensions There are Markdown extensions implementing multiple syntax features currently not available  with the Markdown syntax. These extensions are similar to Markdown flavors but add to or  modify the syntax in a more advanced way.  MultiMarkdown is a popular superset of the Markdown syntax and can be found at   http:  fletcherpenney.net multimarkdown . Some of the features it adds to Markdown are:   Ê Footnotes  Ê Tables  Ê Citations and bibliography  Ê Math support  Ê Smart typography with support for multiple languages  Footnotes Here is an example of a footnote:  Here is some text containing a footnote[^somefootnote]. More text  [^somefootnote]: Here is the text of the footnote itself.  Tables The format of a table is shown as follows:   First Header  Second Header   :----------:  :-----------:   First row          Data       Second row       **Cell**       [simple_table]  Citations Here is an example of a citation:  Let's cite a book.[p. 42][book]  Math Here is a math support example:  \\[ {e}^{i\pi }+1=0 \\]  24   People and places you should get to know If you need help with Markdown, here are some people and places that will prove invaluable.
