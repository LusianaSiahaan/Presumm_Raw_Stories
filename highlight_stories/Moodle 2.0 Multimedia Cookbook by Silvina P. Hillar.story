We are going  to learn how to design them using a combination of technologies, free and open source  software, as well as services available on the Web.  This chapter explains how to create rich activities for Moodle courses. We will work with  graphics to create engaging activities for our students. Images tend to be an important   asset to bear in mind when designing an activity.  The aim of this chapter is to insert in our Moodle course the available applications in Web 2.0  in order to enrich our activities. We will use Hot Potatoes, JClic, and Quandary 2, which are  visually rich, free software available on the Web. You can design activities using interactive  websites as well.   Creating Interactive User eXperiences  This book will cover the topics of general knowledge. Therefore, in each chapter, we will cover  a different topic. This chapter deals with Nobel Prize winners and people of achievement.  Creating a cloze with pictures In this activity, we are going to create a cloze activity with images. We will deal with a Nobel  Prize winner and write the biography using some images. Students write the correct name  for those images and afterwards they name the person. The idea is that the images are to be  relevant to both the biography and the work carried out by this Nobel Prize winner. By the way,  you are not going to be given the name of the person until the end of this activity!  Getting ready In this activity, we will use Hot Potatoes to create an activity using JCloze. You can download  Hot Potatoes software from its website: http:  hotpot.uvic.ca downloads.  Hot Potatoes is a freeware, whose suite includes six applications  enabling you to create interactive multiple-choice, short-answer,  jumbled-sentence, crossword, matching ordering, and gap-fill  exercises for the World Wide Web.  How to do it... First of all, choose the person that you want to write about. You can choose a Nobel  Prize winner from the following website: http:  nobelprize.org . Then, read the  biography  you can find a more detailed biography at the following website: http:  www. famouspeoplebiographyguide.com  and design the gap-filling exercise.  We design the activity in such a way that students are to be given the clue in the form of a  picture placed near a textbox, where they have to write the correct word. Therefore, we have  to find pictures in order to design the activity. Look for the free clipart at the Office Online Clip  Art & Media at the following website: http:  office.microsoft.com en-us images ;  another interesting and suitable website is http:  www.openclipart.org . Follow these  steps in order to create a folder and find images for the activity:  1.  Create a new folder in Windows Explorer, for example C:\Images_Nobelprize. 2.  Open your web browser to search for an appropriate image. 3.  Write the word BABY in the textbox and click on the search button, as shown in the   following screenshot:  6   4.  Double-click on the desired clipart or picture. The picture will appear in another   5.  Right-click on the image and click on Save Picture As..., as shown in the   bigger window.  following screenshot:  Chapter 1  7   Creating Interactive User eXperiences  6.  Save the picture in the folder that was created in step 1. Choose the JPEG extension,   as shown in the following screenshot:  9.  Repeat steps 2 – 6 in order to look for more images relevant to the biography of the   person chosen.  How it works... Run the Hot Potatoes software and click on JCloze  the blue potato . Follow these steps in  order to design the activity:  1.  Complete the Title block. 2.  Write the biography of the person. Highlight the word where you want to create a gap. 3.  Click on Gap when you want to add one, as shown in the following screenshot:  8   Chapter 1  4.  The circled underlined word is the one that is to be missing in the activity. 5.  You can add clues if you want or any alternative words. Then click on OK. 6.  Click on File  Save and save the file in the folder that was created to save   7.   the images. Insert the image to give a visual clue to the gap. Position the cursor where you want  to insert the image. Click on Insert  Picture  Picture from Local File, as shown in  the following screenshot:  8.  Choose the picture that you want to insert, click on Open, and then click OK. You will   not see the image, but you will see HTML code in the textbox.  9.  Click on File  Create Web Page  Standard Format. Click on Save. Click on   View the exercise in my browser. You will see the activity, as shown in the  following screenshot:  This is just a part of the cloze. Add more images giving more clues about the correct Nobel  Prize winner.  9   Creating Interactive User eXperiences  There's more Now upload the previous activity designed in Hot Potatoes in our Moodle course. Open your  Moodle course and choose the weekly outline section where the activity needs to be inserted.  Before uploading the activity in Moodle, install the Hot Potatoes module in Moodle 2. So, if  you do not have it installed, you need to talk to the administrator to do so. By the way, do you  know who the Nobel Prize winner is?  Uploading the activity in Moodle To upload both the activity and the images used in Hot Potatoes to our Moodle course, follow  these steps:  1.  Click on Add an activity  HotPot. 2.  Click on the downwards arrow in the Name block and choose Get from source file. 3.

In the Display block, click on the downwards arrow in Navigation and choose  Embedded web page.  6.  Click on Save and display. The activity looks as shown in the following screenshot:  10   Chapter 1  Designing a True or False quiz In this activity, we are going to design a True or False quiz. It is not an ordinary one though.  We create a guessing activity in which students decide whether the answers are either True  or False, and in that way they try to guess the name of the Nobel Prize winner once again! So,  let's get ready.  Getting ready Choose the Nobel Prize winner that we want our students to guess. Then, design the activity  using Moodle and insert images into our course, which is to be the multimedia asset in   this recipe. We are also going to design the same activity using Hot Potatoes JQuiz    the yellow potato .  How to do it... Bear in mind what type of information we want our students to guess. We are going to   insert images in the questions. So, in this case, use free clipart from the following website:  http:  www.free-clipart-pictures.net.  Choose the weekly outline section where we want to insert our activity and follow these steps:  1.  Click on Add an activity  Quiz. 2.  Complete the Name and the Introduction block. 3.

Click on Insert. 17.  Complete the Feedback for the response 'True' and Feedback for the response   'False' blocks. You can add the correct images instead of writing. For example, if the  person is not a woman, insert the image of a girl and a cross; if the person is a man,  insert the image of the boy with a tick.  18.  Click on Save changes.  14   19.  Click on Add a question...  True or False  Next, as shown in the following screenshot:  Chapter 1  20. Complete the blocks with information about the Nobel Prize winner. 21.

Students are going to attempt the True or False quiz and after getting the results of the clues,  they have to guess the name of the Nobel Prize winner. You may supply the name of the  person in the last question of the activity. By the way, in this case, the Nobel Prize winner   is John F. Nash Jr.  You can also save the images in a folder, as we have done in the previous recipe.  15   Creating Interactive User eXperiences  There's more...

Developing a quandary maze activity   with images In this activity, we are going to create a quandary maze using Quandary 2, which is a free  and open source software. The only disadvantage is that it is only available for Windows. You  can download it from the following website: http:  www.halfbakedsoftware.com  quandary.php.  The quandary maze is about two people of achievement and a special animal. The three of  them share a common characteristic. Students should guess their names by the clues given,  and at the end of the maze they are going to figure out who they are. The idea is that they do  not know who they are until the end of the maze in order to keep the mystery.  Getting ready First of all, download and install Quandary 2. Then, think of the two people of achievement and  the animal who share a common characteristic. Therefore, some information can be shared in  the quandary maze, and in some instances, share the decision points or go back to them.  We will upload images in this activity, so create a new folder in your default web browser, for  example, C:\Images_PeopleofAchievement. Save all the images here that we choose  to design our activity.  How to do it... Open Quandary 2. The title of the activity is: People of Achievement and a Special Animal.  Students choose different decision points, and they will have to guess whose biography they  are reading. They are provided with different clues, both by text and images.  18   Chapter 1  Go to http:  commons.wikimedia.org, wherein there are many free clipart to work with.  Search for images that we want to insert in the activity and save them in the folder that we  have already created.  Open Quandary 2 and follow these steps in order to develop this activity:  1.  Create a folder to save both the file and the images to work with. 2.  Click on File and select New. 3.  Click on File  Save as. Save the file in the folder that was just created. 4.  Complete the Exercise Title block. 5.  Complete the Decision Point title block. 6.  Complete the Decision Point contents block. 7.  Click on New Link, and click on the drop-down box in the pop-out window and select   Create a new decision point.  8.  Complete the new block. Click on OK. 9.  Place the cursor in the Link text block and click on the Insert a picture icon. Click on   Picture from local file, as shown in the following screenshot:  19   Creating Interactive User eXperiences  Open  OK  OK.  to create more decision points.  10.

Click on the right arrow on the left-hand side of the margin Decision Point number   and the number changes to number 2. Go over the same process for making the  maze, while guiding the students as to who they are.  13.  When you finish, click on File  Save File. 14.  Click on File and select Export to XHTML.  How it works... It is time to upload the quandary activity into Moodle. Upload the activity as if it were a Hot  Potatoes activity, so we need to have the HotPot module for this activity as well. Select the  weekly outline section where you want to place the activity and follow these steps:  1.  Click on Add an activity  HotPot. 2.  Click on the downwards arrow in the Name block and choose Get from source file. 3.  Click on Add  Upload a file  Browse  look for the file that you want to upload and   click on it and on Open  Upload this file.  4.

Click on Save and display; the activity looks as shown in the following screenshot:  20   Chapter 1  By the way, their names are Valentina Vladimirovna Tereshkova, Yuri Alekseyevich Gagarin,  and Laika, the first dog in space.  Carrying out and embedding an interactive  flowchart In this recipe, we are going to work with the following website: http:  classtools.net.  There is a new item within its incredible variation of interactive activities and games that we  can develop for free—Telescopic Topic allows us to carry out an interactive flowchart that  can be opened as far as we want to expand our reading. The idea is to choose a Nobel Prize  winner and write his biography; students can expand it, depending on how much they want   to read.  You could give the name of the Nobel Prize winner at the beginning of the activity or you could  play another type of guessing game, and after they read the biography of the said person, they  have to find out who the person is.  Getting ready First of all, think about the person to write about. After that, go to the aforementioned website  and choose Telescopic Topic generator.  I would like to point out that this website offers an upgrade version with more facilities to work  with. This is optional, and the recipe that we are going to work with is available for free.  How to do it... You should think of the main items that will expand in the biography and add additional data  to it.   We can either design this in any type of writing processor, that is to say Microsoft Word or  Open Office, copy-and-paste it in the Telescopic Topic generator, or write it directly in the  website. In this case, the activity is carried out directly in the website.   21   Creating Interactive User eXperiences  Follow these steps in order to develop the activity:  1.  Write the bullets for the biography of the person, as shown in the following screenshot:  2.  After writing the main bullets, click on the Indent icon, as shown in the previous   screenshot, to add data on those items.  3.  Go on and complete the flowchart, indent the information towards the right. If you   want to go back, choose the arrow towards the left.  4.  Make a link to a famous speech by this person. Highlight the words that you want   students to click on, in the link. Click on the Insert edit a link icon.  5.  Complete the Insert edit a link block, which will appear in a pop-up window, as   shown in the following screenshot:  22   Chapter 1  6.  Click on Insert. 7.  Click on Preview. 8.  Click on Save. 9.  Enter a password and click on Submit. 10.  Click on embed, on the top left-hand margin and copy the code. You will use it   afterwards to insert it in our Moodle course.  How it works... We will carry out this activity in Online text so that students can say who the person is and  why using the speech that we have made links to, they have a special clue. Follow these steps  so that you can design the activity:  1.  Click on Add an activity  Online text  within Assignments . 2.  Complete the Assignment name block. 3.  Complete the Description block. 4.  Click on the HTML Source Editor icon and copy the code that is copied from   the website.  5.  Click on Update. 6.  Click on Save and return to course. 7.  The activity looks as shown in the following screenshot:  By the way, the name of the Nobel Prize winner is Martin Luther King Jr.  23   Creating Interactive User eXperiences  Designing matching activities with images In this activity, we would be working with another application available on the Web. It is a free,  open source software called JClic author 0.2.0.5. So, the first thing that we have to do is to  install it. We will create a matching activity with images. You can also carry out this activity  using either Moodle or JMatch within Hot Potatoes.  Choose 16 people of achievement and their main characteristic will be labeled by an icon  image. So, the students have to match each person with the achievement that they are  famous for. Can you think of so many talented persons! Let's get ready!  Getting ready We are going to work with JClic author, but in case that you do not happen to have it installed,  you can download it from the following website: http:  clic.xtec.cat en jclic  download.htm. You have to click on the JClic author icon and download the software  following the steps.  After the installation, we are going to work with images from the following website:   http:  commons.wikimedia.org. Create a folder  as we have already done in the  previous activities , in which we save all the icon images that we have chosen that   represent these special people.  How to do it... These are the steps that you have to follow to design the activity:  1.  Open the JClic author. Select File  New Project and complete the pop-up window,   as shown in the following screenshot:  2.  Save the activity in the folder that you have created and saved the images in. Then   3.  Click on Project and complete the Title and the Description blocks, writing what   students have to do in this activity.  click OK.  24   4.  Click on Activities and select Insert  New activity. Select Complex association, as   shown in the following screenshot:  Chapter 1  5.  Write the name of the activity, as shown in the previous screenshot. Then click on OK. 6.  Complete the blocks related to Options, as you want to display the activity. 7.  Then click on Window. You are also going to customize it yourself or keep it as it is.   There are many options to work with.  8.  You can also choose to design the messages by clicking on Messages. 9.  Click on Panel. Grid A is the grid on the left, and write the names of the people of   achievement. Grid B is the grid on the right used to insert the icon images.  25   Creating Interactive User eXperiences  10.  Click on Grid A and complete the options, as shown in the following screenshot.  Therefore, you can insert 16 names by clicking in each cell and completing the   pop-out window that appears for each of them. Only enter text on this grid:  11.  Click on Grid B. Click on a cell, and then click on the big rectangle next to Image, as   shown circled in the previous screenshot.  12. A new pop-out window will appear. Click on New media object.... Choose the image   that you want to upload. Click on Open  OK  OK. The image will appear inside  the cell.  13.  Repeat the same process 15 more times, because we have inserted 16 people of   achievement! Another option is to choose less items to connect.  14.  Select File  Save to save the changes made. 15.  Choose View  Preview activity. You can work out the activity, can't you?  How it works... Now that we have designed the activity in JClic author, insert the previously created activity  in our Moodle course. There is not a module or block available in Moodle 2 to insert JClic  activities, and this is the reason why we have to make a link to the said file. Follow these   steps to prepare the activity in order to upload it to Moodle afterwards:  26   1.  Click on Tools  Create web page, as shown in the following screenshot:  Chapter 1  2.  A pop-up window appears. Click on OK  Save  Yes. 3.  The activity is ready to work with. It is time to upload it to the Moodle course.  Add this matching activity as a resource in the course. It can be the warm up activity to the  introduction of any topic to deal with. Therefore, choose the weekly outline section where   you want to place the activity and follow these steps:  1.  Click on Add a resource  File. 2.  Complete the Name and Description blocks. 3.  Click on Add  Upload a file  Browse and look for the file to upload in Moodle. Look   for the .htm file that was previously created.  4.  Click on Open  Upload this file. 5.  Repeat steps 3 and 4 to upload the .jclic.zip file as well, as shown in the   following screenshot:  6.  Click on Save and display. The JClic activity is ready to work with within Moodle!  27   Creating Interactive User eXperiences  There's more We can add another activity after this one. Use this matching activity as a lead to a writing  one, for example, or as a warm up for a special assignment. We can add an Online text  activity so that students give their reasons on who the most amazing person is and why;   for instance.  Creating a writing activity Create a writing activity using the previous one designed in JClic author as a pre-writing one.  Thus, follow these steps to insert this new one in our Moodle course:  1.  Click on Add an activity  Upload a single file. 2.  Complete the Assignment name and Description blocks. 3.  Click on Save and return to course.  Ordering paragraphs with related scenes We can design this type of activity using several external software or tools available in Web  2.0. You can use JMatch within Hot Potatoes or a matching activity within the JClic author.  However, we are not going to use those because we have already used them in the earlier  recipes. Therefore, design an interactive timeline using the following website: http:   www.readwritethink.org classroom-resources student-interactives  timeline-30007.html or you can also design it using Microsoft Word or Open Office  with images in it.  Getting ready Enter the aforementioned website and click on Timeline Tool so that we can design the  timeline of a Nobel Prize winner. By the way, can you guess who we are going to work with?   How to do it... Another screen will appear displaying the type of timeline that we are going to develop. So,  these are the steps to follow:  1.  Click on Get Started. 2.  Another pop-up window will appear in which you have to complete the Title block as   well as the author of the timeline in the By block. 3.  Click on Choose  Event within Unit of Measure. 4.  Click on Next Entry on the top-right margin. 5.  Complete the Event, Title, and Description blocks.  28   Chapter 1  6.  Click on Next Entry on the top-right margin as many times as the number of events   you want to add.  7.  When you finish the timeline, click on the Print Screen key and then paste the image   in the Paint software or something similar.  8.  Click on the Select icon and cut the timeline. Copy-and-paste it in a new document   and save it as a .png file so that we can upload it in our Moodle course. The timeline  looks as shown in the following screenshot:  How it works... We have already designed a timeline using the website. We have done it using the names of  the events relevant to what this famous person has achieved throughout life. Thus, students  are to be given several paragraphs and they have to put them in order using the information   in this timeline.  Design this activity using Upload a single file because the main object is that they write the  paragraphs in order of adding as much information as possible. Therefore, these are the steps  that you have to follow to design this activity:  1.  Click on Add an activity  Upload a single file. 2.  Complete the Assignment name and Description blocks.  29   Creating Interactive User eXperiences  3.  Click on the Insert   edit an Image icon  Find or upload an image Upload a file    on the left-hand margin  Browse.  4.  When you find the image, click on Open  Upload this file  Insert  OK. 5.  Click on Save and return to course.  By the way, the name of the Nobel Prize winner is Mother Teresa.  Linking external 2D interactive activities In this activity, we will write a brief introduction of the mathematician who worked out a  theorem of triangles. Afterwards, we will make a link to an interactive blog that allows  students to open a file and complete a chart about different 2D shapes. Thus, let's get ready.  Getting ready This recipe is different from the others because, in this case, we will work with the results of  people of achievement. Students read about him and they do an activity.  Look for some information about an old mathematician who worked out the theorem of  triangles. Make a link to an interactive website that explains this theorem in an attractive  way and then work with 2D shapes. We can design the activity in two parts. The first part is a  passive activity because we have to give students some information about 2D shapes. Thus,  add a resource, a page, and the second part is the activity.  Design the activity in Upload a single file, because the website that we choose to work with  has a file that students have to complete. Therefore, when they complete it, they can submit   it to the course!  How to do it... The activity has already been explained before. Choose the weekly outline section where we  want to place the resource. Then, follow these steps in order to carry it out:  1.  Click on Add a resource  Page. 2.  Complete the Name block. 3.  Complete the Description block. 4.  Complete the Page content block and make a link to the following websites:   http:  www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk Biographies Pythagoras.html  and http:  www.mathsisfun.com pythagoras.html, as shown in  the following screenshot:  30   Chapter 1  31  5.  Click on Save and return to course.  How it works... We have already added some passive material in our course and now we add the activity in  our Moodle course, just after the resource. So, follow these steps to design the activity:  1.  Click on Add an activity  Upload a single file, within Assignments. 2.  Complete the Assignment name block. 3.  Complete the Description block and make a link to the following blog: http:  www.  bgfl.org bgfl custom resources_ftp client_ftp ks2 maths 3d  index.htm.   Creating Interactive User eXperiences  4.  Click on Save and return to course.  5.  The activity looks as shown in the following screenshot:  Linking external 3D interactive activities In this activity, we are going to write a brief introduction of the mathematician who is known  to be the Father of Geometry. Afterwards, we make a link to the previous interactive blog that  allows students to open a file and complete a chart about different 3D shapes.  Getting ready This recipe is similar to the previous one. Look for some information about an old  mathematician who is considered the Father of Sacred Geometry. The first part is a   passive activity because we give students some information about Euclid of Alexandria.  Design the activity in Upload a single file, because the website that we choose to work with  has a file that students have to complete. Therefore, when they complete it, they can submit   it to the Moodle course!  How to do it... The activity has already been explained before. Choose the weekly outline section where you  want to place the resource. Then, follow these steps in order to carry it out:  1.  Click on Add a resource  Page. 2.  Complete the Name block.  32   Chapter 1  3.  Complete the Description block. 4.

Complete the Description block and make a link to the following blog: http:  www.  bgfl.org bgfl custom resources_ftp client_ftp ks2 maths 3d  index.htm.  4.  Click on Save and return to course.  5.  The activity looks as shown in the following screenshot:  There's more... We have added a mathematical activity, but we can also add a link to the following  website in which students can design a plane by dragging and dropping different 3D shapes:  http:  airplaneassembly.webs.com . They can learn about aeroplane parts and  recognize the geometric shapes used in making them.  33    2  Working with 2D and   3D Maps  In this chapter, we will cover:   f Creating maps with sceneries  f Drawing regions within a map  f Labeling a map with pins  f Drawing 3D maps using Bing Maps  f Drawing 3D maps using 3DVIA Shape for Maps  f Using Google maps to locate European bridges  f Displaying interactive information about the solar system  f Working with constellation maps  f Embedding a map of Mars  f Labeling the moon  f Watching the universe  Introduction This chapter explains how to create and embed different types of either 2D or 3D interactive  maps in our Moodle courses. The creation of these maps will be done using resources  available in the Web 2.0 as well as the free and open source software. Thanks to these  amazing tools, we can design and display interactive maps in our Moodle courses.   Working with 2D and 3D Maps  Whenever you think of a map, you may either think of the traditional planisphere or the  terrestrial globe. There are several types of maps apart from those previously mentioned. We  can work with maps of the moon, Mars, constellations, and even the universe! Thus, we are  not only going to focus on our planet, but we are going to travel even further!  Taking into account that this book covers the topic of general knowledge, the topic of this  chapter is going to deal with Traveling Around the World and Watching the Universe. After  reading this chapter, you can focus on your next holiday!  We explain how to work with different types of maps. We are going to be as creative as  possible. We should try to work with maps in an unconventional way. That is to say, the idea  is to use a map for a Geography class, but we can use maps as a resource for any type of  activity. Thus, we can work with the Geography teacher and he she could work on another  geographical feature of the place that we are working with. Therefore, in that way, we are  adding more information to the place we are exploring.  Maps are very attractive and they may become quite appealing to our students as long as we  find a way to develop a rich activity using them. We should encourage the use of maps and the  available resources that we have on the Web so that they can insert them in their homework  by themselves as well. Thus, we can develop the activities in such a way that we can either  provide the map or ask them to design a map.  We can also work with maps in the case of Literature. We can ask students to draw a map of  a place that has never existed in the real world, though it did in a story. Thus, another bit of  homework that could prove helpful would be for students to design and carry out the map of  such a place using the tools that we are going to explore in the following recipes. An example  of this could be to draw the map of the country Ruritania and locate the cities of Zenda and  Strealsau. These places do not exist in the real world, but they exist in the book The Prisoner  of Zenda by Anthony Hope. So, many things can be done with maps.  Creating maps with sceneries In this activity, we are going to create a map with sceneries. Therefore, we could either browse  our files for pictures from our trips or holidays, or we can search for sceneries on the Web.  After selecting the pictures, we create a new folder in Windows Explorer, for example   C:\Images_Traveling. In this folder, we save all the pictures so as to organize our work.  We will use the following well-known website: http:  earth.google.com  to design a  map using the pictures we have saved in the folder that we have just created. Let's get ready!  36   Getting ready In this activity, we will work with the previously mentioned website. Therefore, we need to open  the web browser and enter it. Click on Download Google Earth 6. Read the Google Maps  Earth Terms of Service and if you agree, click on Agree and Download. The icon of Google  Earth will appear on your desktop, as shown in the following screenshot:  Chapter 2  How to do it... We have already carried out the first steps for this activity. Now, we have to design the maps  with the pictures that we want to add. There are also some pictures that are available in the  maps; you can also work with them, though the aim of this activity is to upload images in the  map. Follow these steps in order to create a folder and find images for the activity:  1.  Click on the icon on your desktop and open Google Earth. 2.  Bring the Earth closer with the icons on the right. Locate a remote city in the southern   hemisphere, as shown in the following screenshot:  37   Working with 2D and 3D Maps  3.   In the Fly to block, write "Mar del Plata", or any other remote city. Then press Enter or  click on the magnifying glass next to the block.  4.  You will travel virtually to the desired city. Bring the map forward and locate the place   where the picture to be uploaded was taken.  5.  Click on Add  Photo. 6.  Complete the Name block. 7.  Click on Browse. Search for the picture that you want to upload and click on it. 8.  Complete the other blocks: Description  View  Photo. 9.  Click on OK. 10.  The picture will appear, as shown in the following screenshot:  11.  You can repeat the same process as many times as the number of pictures you want   12. After uploading all the pictures, click on File  Save  Save Image, as shown in the   to upload.  following screenshot:  13.  Complete the File name block and click on Save.  38   Chapter 2  How it works... After uploading the desired pictures to the map, we can create an activity. We could start this  course with a little social interaction. We ask our students to think about what element they  shouldn't forget if they happen to go to this place. They may not know this city, for sure, unless  they live nearby. This is the most interesting part of inserting a remote city that they may want  to know more about it! Therefore, a Chat is a good idea to have where all the students will be  invited in order to discuss the city.  We upload the map that we have created with the images to our activity within the Moodle  course. Choose the weekly outline section where you want to insert this activity and follow  these steps:  1.  Click on Add an activity  Chat. 2.  Complete the Name of this chat room and Introduction text blocks. 3.  Click on the Insert edit image icon  Find or upload an image  Browse and look   for the image that we have just saved.  4.  Click on Upload this file. 5.  Complete the Image description block and click on Insert. 6.  Click on Save and return to course. The activity looks as shown in the   following screenshot:  Drawing regions within a map In this activity, we are going to use an interactive website in which we choose a map to work  with. It is a very simple one, but we could enhance it by adding interesting ingredients to the  recipe. We will use a software for drawing a region on the map, and highlight a region for our  students to work with. As it was pointed out before, we are not going to focus on geographical  features, though you can add this ingredient yourself when designing the activity.  39   Working with 2D and 3D Maps  Getting ready We open our default web browser and work with the following website: http:  www. fusioncharts.com maps Default.asp. We click on Map Gallery and choose a map  to work with. In this case, we choose a map of the world and highlight five regions, one for  each continent. You can modify it and work with different regions within a continent or a  country too.  How to do it... We look for the desired map. We can find different types of maps to work with. Everything  depends on what type of activity we have in mind. In this case, as the topic of this chapter has  to do with traveling, we circle five regions and ask our students to choose where they would  like to go. First of all, we have to find the map and save it as an image so that we can draw   the regions and upload it to our Moodle course. Therefore, follow these steps:  1.  Click on click here  World Map with countries on the aforementioned site. 2.  Another pop-up window appears, displaying a map of the world with the countries.   There appears a Map Configuration block where you can customize some features,  as shown in the next screenshot.  3.  Click on Save Map as Image, as shown in the following screenshot:  4.  Another pop-up window will appear. Click on Save. 5.  Complete the File name block.  40   Chapter 2  6.  Click on Save. 7.  Click on Open. 8.  A pop-up window displaying the map will appear. Click on File Copy. 9.  Paste the map in Paint or Inkscape. Click on Edit  Paste from and browse for the   name of the file.  10.  Select the file and click on Open. 11.  Use the resources available to draw the regions that you want students to work with,   as shown in the following screenshot:  12. Click on File  Save as and write a name for the file. 13.  Click on Save.  How it works... We have already drawn the regions that we want our students to work with. We have chosen  one country from every continent; you can choose another or design it in a different way. We  can add a writing activity in which students choose where they would like to travel using the  previous map.  Select the weekly outline section where you want to add the activity and follow these steps:  1.  Click on Add an activity  Upload a single file within Assignments. 2.  Complete the Assignment name and Description blocks.  41   Working with 2D and 3D Maps  3.  Click on the Insert edit image icon  Find or upload an image  Browse. 4.  When you find the image that you want to upload, click on Open  Upload this file. 5.  Complete the Image description block. 6.  Click on Insert. 7.  Click on Save and return to course. The activity is ready! 8.  When students click on the activity, it looks as shown in the following screenshot:  Labeling a map with pins In this recipe, we will learn how to insert a map in our Moodle course labeled with pins,  because we pin all the cities that we are going to work with. Therefore, we insert the map as  a resource. After that, we design activities for our students to use the interactive map that  we have just added. It is another way to use a resource, making our Moodle course more  appealing to the eyes of our students.     42   Chapter 2  Getting ready We are going to work with Google Earth, as we did in the first recipe, so we have already  installed it. We should think of the cities to insert in our course because we need to pin   them all!  How to do it... Click on the Google Earth icon that you have on your desktop. This is a way to enrich our  traveling course by enhancing its appearance. So, these are the steps that you have to follow:  1.  Complete the Fly to block with the place that you want to pin. 2.

The map will look as shown in the following screenshot:  46   Chapter 2  47  Drawing 3D maps using Bing Maps In this recipe, we will work with the following website: http:  www.bing.com maps . We  are going to add social activity to our Moodle course because we are designing a Wiki activity.  We ask our students to imagine that they are architects and that they have to travel to San  Sebastian, Spain to build a shopping center there. Therefore, we locate the said city in the  map using the aforementioned website; you can also use Google Earth, as we did in the   other recipes.  Getting ready We open your default web browser and look for the aforementioned website. We look for San  Sebastian, Spain and we select an area in which our students have to locate the shopping  center. So, if you do not happen to know the place, there will appear some information on the  left-hand side of the margin giving data as well as images of the places that are there.   Working with 2D and 3D Maps  How to do it... Follow these steps in order to select an area of the map and embed it to our Moodle course,  and also to develop the activity:  1.  Click on the star that appears at the bottom on the left-hand margin. 2.  Another pop-up window will appear in which you can find several options to carry out.   Click on My Places  New list in order to save the area of the map. Complete the  blocks within the Properties section: Title, Notes, and Tags blocks.  3.  Click on Save. 4.

You can choose   to embed either a Static map or a Draggable map.  9.  After you customize your options, click on Generate code  Copy code to paste this   code in the Moodle course.  48   How it works... We have just finished designing the map, the part of the world that we want our students to  travel in order to build a shopping center. We enter and choose the weekly outline section  where we want to design the activity. We are going to carry out this activity in Wiki so that  students can interact among themselves:  Chapter 2  1.  Click on Add an activity  Wiki. 2.  Complete the Wiki name and Wiki description blocks. 3.  Click on the HTML icon and paste the code. Click on Update. 4.  Click on Save and return to course. 5.  The activity looks as shown in the following screenshot:  49   Working with 2D and 3D Maps  Drawing 3D maps using 3DVIA Shape   for Maps This activity is very appealing because we can draw in a map. We select a city and we can  either design a task for our students to draw in the map or we can draw in the map and ask  our students for their opinion. In this case, we do the latter. We need a live account in order   to publish the model that we create afterwards. Unfortunately, this activity is limited   to Windows users.  Getting ready Open the following website: http:  www.3dvia.com products 3dvia-shape-for- maps . Then click on Free download. You can build models such as the one shown in the  following screenshot:  How to do it... After downloading it, an icon on our desktop will appear. In this activity, we are going to ask  our students to travel to Cape Town, South Africa. We design a house and ask them what  changes they would make to the house if they happened to go there and live for a school year.   50   We open 3DVIA Shape for Maps, and the following are the steps that you have to follow in  order to design the activity:  1.  Type the location that you want to see in the map in the block that says Type your   location here…, as shown in the following screenshot:  Chapter 2  2.  Click on the magnifying glass icon. Click on Road and bring the map forward. 3.  Click on Start modeling…. The map will appear as a background image. You are   going to start modeling your house.  4.  Click on the Grid icon to check the orientation of the rectangle. 5.  Click on the Rectangle  R  icon and draw a rectangle; you have to click to start and   click to finish, as shown in the following screenshot:  51   Working with 2D and 3D Maps  6.

Complete the following pop-up window:  52   15.  Another pop-up window will appear. You have to give a name for the model. Then click   16.  Click on Display on map. The house will appear in Bing Maps. It will be as shown in   on Publish.  the following screenshot:  Chapter 2  17.  In order to embed the map with the image in our Moodle course, see the previous   recipe in order to get the embedding code.  How it works... We have just created the multimedia part of the activity. Now we have to embed it in our  Moodle course. We are going to create a Database in which we ask our students to give their  opinions about the house. Another option would be to create a Forum activity where students  can debate about this creation. We can work together with the Geography teacher, who can  add data about the climate of a said place and add any other changes to the house. These  are the steps that you have to follow:  1.  Click on Add an activity  Database. 2.  Complete the Name and Introduction blocks. 3.  Click on the HTML icon. Paste the code in order to embed the map. Click on Update. 4.  Click on Save and display. 5.  Click on the downwards arrow in Create a new field and choose Text.  53   Working with 2D and 3D Maps  6.  Complete the Field name with questions. Click on Add. Write as many questions as  necessary to guide students to think of possible changes to the house, as shown in  the following screenshot:  7.  Click on Save  Continue and go back to the course. The activity is ready to   work with!  Using Google maps to locate European  bridges In this recipe, we have the possibility to travel to France, and visit the River Seine. There are a  lot of bridges along this river, therefore we ask our students to go along this river by boat. They  have to find all the bridges along it and mark them in the map. Another possibility is for us to  do this task the other way round and ask them to find some information.  Getting ready We look for a website giving information about the bridges in the Seine River, such as  http:  www.pariswater.com ponts . In this website, you can find the bridges on the  left. As you click on each of them, a bigger picture is displayed in the middle of the page.  There is information about the bridge both in English and French. Therefore, we could also  work with the French teacher as well as the Geography one!  54   Chapter 2  How to do it... We work with maps because we have to travel through this beautiful river by boat. Our  students will have to locate all the bridges along the Seine River. Therefore, we will work with  http:  maps.google.com . We visit this website and look for this river. Follow these steps  in order to link the map in our Moodle course:  1.  After you find the desired location, click on Link, as shown in the   following screenshot:  2.  Copy the URL because you are going to paste it in the Moodle course.  How it works... We have the map and the website with the information about the bridges. So, now we can  design the activity in Advanced uploading of files, in case they need to upload more than  one file. Here are the steps that you have to follow:  1.  Click on Add an activity  Advanced uploading of files. 2.  Complete the Assignment name and Description blocks. 3.  Mark a link to the website describing the bridges: http:  www.pariswater.com   ponts .  4.  Mark a link to the website of the map: http:  goo.gl maps 2R83.  55   Working with 2D and 3D Maps  5.  Click on Save and return to course. The activity looks as shown in the   following screenshot:  Displaying interactive information about the  solar system The title of the recipe is telling us that we are traveling far away from planet Earth, which  means we are no longer traveling by boat or by plane. We have decided to travel as Dennis  Tito did on Saturday 28th April, 2001. Yes, we travel in a spaceship and into space. We are  going to see the solar system from the window of our rocket.  This is a very simple and appealing recipe because we work with a quite amusing as well as  entertaining website. It offers a free astronomy resource designed to teach children about the  exciting world of outer space, as stated on the website.  Getting ready Visit the following website: http:  www.kidsastronomy.com index.htm. We click on  Solar System, as shown in the following screenshot:  56   Chapter 2  57  Image credit: http:  www.kidsastronomy.com index.htm.  How to do it... We are going to insert a passive activity in our Moodle course; that is to say we add a  resource. We choose the weekly outline section where we want to place it. Then, follow these  steps in order to carry it out:  1.  Click on Add a resource  URL. 2.  Complete the Name and Description blocks.   Working with 2D and 3D Maps  3.  Complete the Content block and copy the following URL: http:  www.  kidsastronomy.com solar_system.htm, as shown in the following screenshot:  4.  Click on Save and return to course.  How it works... As stated before, it is a simple recipe. We can just work with this amazing website. Students  click on the planets and information is displayed about them. Thus, you can make any other  links or add any other activities, including games. Therefore, the resource looks as shown in  the following screenshot:  58   Chapter 2  59  Image credit: http:  www.kidsastronomy.com solar_system.htm.  Working with constellation maps We continue our trip into the space. As you have realized, we started within the Earth  and from the previous recipe onwards, we continue in our spaceship. In this recipe, we   visit the constellations.  Another accurate trip to work with constellations is to travel back in time and tell our students  how sailors used to guide themselves with stars. However, we are not going to use that kind of  trip or going back in time; it's just a tip for you to take into account!   Working with 2D and 3D Maps  Getting ready We are going to work with space; therefore, we may use Google Earth.  We click on the planet icon and choose Sky, as shown circled in the following screenshot:  Another option is to use the following website: http:  www.astroviewer.com index. php, which is better because we can embed the map of the constellations. Click on For your  website and click on interactive night sky map. Copy the HTML code so as to embed the  map in our Moodle course afterwards.  How to do it... We have just found what to use to work with constellation maps. It is time to design the  activity in our trip. We are traveling, and from the window of our spaceship we can see many  stars; as you know, these stars together seen from Earth form different constellations.  We work with this map because students can travel in space and see the constellations in 3D.  After they explore the universe, they complete a glossary in our Moodle course with the names  of the constellations. They add the necessary information about them. Another option would  be to design a Database activity instead of a Glossary.  Then, they can play a game in which they have to name the constellation. We can add this  game as a final task of our project because they already have the necessary information to  recognize the constellations in the sky. Thus, we choose the weekly outline section where   we want to place the activity and follow these steps in order to carry out the activity in our  Moodle course:  1.  Click on Add an activity Glossary. 2.  Complete the Name and Description blocks. 3.  Click on the HTML icon. Paste the HTML code that you have copied from the website   in order to embed the sky map of constellations.  60   4.  Click on Update. 5.  Click on Save and return to course. The activity looks as shown in the   following screenshot:  Chapter 2  Image credit of the Mini - AstroViewer icon embedded in Moodle course:  http:  www.astroviewer.com. Copyright by Dirk Matussek.  How it works... After so much work, students deserve to play. Therefore, we make a link to a website in which  students can play the constellations game. Follow these steps in order to add the resource:  1.  Click on Add a resource  URL. 2.  Complete the Name and Description blocks. 3.  Complete the External URL block within the Content box. Copy the following URL:  http:  www.kidsastronomy.com astroskymap constellation_hunt. htm.  61   Working with 2D and 3D Maps  4.  Click on Save and return to course. The activity looks as shown in the   following screenshot:  Image credit: http:  www.kidsastronomy.com astroskymap constellation_ hunt.htm.   Whenever you click on See The Constellations, they are seen with the lines in the sky, as  shown in the previous picture.  Embedding a map of Mars In this recipe, we focus on the Red Planet—Mars. We work with a website that will allow us  to embed a map of Mars. Therefore, visit: http:  hubblesite.org gallery album  pr1999027f . Apart from embedding the map, we also have the possibility of saving the  image of the said map so that we can upload it to our Moodle course.  Getting ready We can also add more information about this planet. Therefore, we can look for data for  educators in the following website: http:  tinyurl.com 49agtvy. According to the type  of activity that we are going to develop, we can choose an appropriate link.   62   Chapter 2  Now, it's time to Moodle it!  How to do it... We design the following activity in two parts. The first part is a resource and the second part  consists of the production of our students  the result of the trip . Thus, we ask our students   to travel to the Red Planet, but before doing so we have to give them information about the  place to visit. Follow these steps in order to add the resource in our Moodle course:  1.  Click on Add a resource  URL. 2.  Complete the Name and Description blocks. 3.  Complete the External URL block within the Content box. Copy the following URL:   http:  tinyurl.com 4lvm2jy.  4.  Click on Save and return to course. The activity looks as shown in the   following screenshot:  How it works... We are going to embed the map of Mars because we do not want our students to get lost.  After that, we ask them to write down their experience in their virtual journey, including as  much information as possible. We can also direct the assignment by guiding them on how   to produce their report.  We design the activity in Upload a single file. Therefore, follow these steps in order to add the  assignment to our Moodle course:  1.  Click on Add an activity Upload a single file within Assignments. 2.  Complete the Assignment name and the Description blocks. 3.  Enter the following website: http:  hubblesite.org gallery album   pr1999027f . Click on EMBED and copy the HTML code that appears.  4.

Therefore, we work with Google Earth again. We label the  parts of the moon that we want our students to explore. We can also embed related videos  from http:  www.youtube.com, which are available in Google Earth.   Getting ready Open Google Earth, click on the planet, and choose Moon, as shown in the following screenshot:  How to do it... We choose a section of the moon that we want our students to explore. We can choose  one of the Apollo Missions on the left-hand margin in Google Earth within Layers in the  Earth Gallery. We choose Apollo 17, because there is also an interesting video available on  YouTube that we can embed in order to strengthen our activity. You can search on the said  website by just typing "Apollo 17", and several videos appear.  64   Chapter 2  We follow these steps in order to capture a photo labeling the Moon in the part that we want  our students to explore. Follow these steps:  1.  Click on Apollo 17. A pop-up window will appear displaying information about the   different resources available.  2.  Click on Zoom in at the bottom of the window in order to explore the landing site. 3.  Click on the Add placemark icon on top. Complete the pop-up window, as shown in   the following screenshot:  4.

Paste the HTML code from YouTube. 11.  Click on Update. 12. Click on Save and return to course. You have created a rich activity!  Watching the universe In this recipe, we design a very simple activity. We are going to go on traveling into space and  watch the universe. We will explore the other planets. Therefore, let's get ready for our last stop.  Getting ready We are going to add an offline activity. This time we ask our students to choose a planet to  explore. We have already worked with many websites that allow us to work with maps, either  to embed them, take a picture of the desired location, or make a link to them. So, you are   free to choose.  66   Chapter 2  How to do it... We are going to choose a website to work with, so that our students are provided with some  material to work with. One option is to divide the activity in two parts, adding a resource and  afterwards the activity. Another option is to make a link to the website that we are going to  work with within the activity. After deciding the website, we design the offline activity. Let's   see how it works!  How it works... We choose the weekly outline section where we want to place our activity. These are the steps  that you have to follow:  1.  Click on Add an activity  Offline activity within Assignments. 2.  Complete the Assignment name and Description blocks. 3.  Make a link to the website that you are going to work with, if you did not include a   4.  Click on Save and return to course. The activity looks as shown in the   resource in the activity.  following screenshot:  See also   f Creating maps with sceneries.  67    3  Working with  Different Types of  Interactive Charts  In this chapter, we will cover:   f Inserting column charts  f Embedding a line chart  f Designing an interactive pie chart with labels  f Creating bar charts with hyperlinks  f Working with area charts  f Inserting an X Y  Scatter  chart  f Working with stock charts  f Creating a poll and designing a surface chart  f Drawing a donut interactive chart  f Inserting different types of radar charts  Introduction This chapter explains how to create and embed 2D and 3D charts. They can also be  interactive or static ones and we will insert them in our Moodle courses. Though we are going  to work mainly with Open Office Spreadsheet, we will include diverse tools and techniques  that are also present. The main idea is to display data in charts and provide students with the  necessary information for their activities.   Working with Different Types of Interactive Charts  We also work with a variety of charts, and deal with statistics as a baseline topic in this chapter.  We can either develop a chart or work with ready-to-use data. We could avoid the math section.  However, you could design this in your Moodle course together with a math teacher.  When thinking of statistics, we generally have the picture of a chart in mind and some  percentages representing the reading of the said chart. We can change that paradigm and  create a different way to draw and read statistics in our Moodle course. We design charts   with drawings, links to websites, and other interesting items.  We can also redesign the charts with numbers with different assets because we want to  enrich and strengthen the diversity of the material for our Moodle course. Thus, some  students are not keen on numbers and dislike activities with them. So, let's give another  chance to statistics!  There are different types of graphics to show statistics. Therefore, we show a variety of tools  available to display different results. No matter what our subject is, we can include this type   of graphics in our Moodle course.   You can use these graphics to help your students give weight to their arguments and   express themselves using key points clearly. We teach students, within our subject, to include  graphics and read them using them as a tool of communication. Reading charts will broaden  their minds.  We can also work with puzzles. That is to say we can invent a graph and give tips or clues to  our students so that they can sort out which are the percentages belonging to the chart. In  other words, we can create a listening comprehension activity, a reading comprehension one,  or a math problem. We just upload or embed the chart, create an appealing activity, and give  clues to our students so that they can think of the items belonging to the chart.  Inserting column charts In this activity, we work with the following website: http:  www.eddataexpress.ed.gov  index.cfm. We work with statistics about the U.S. government. We will change the format  of the chart. We are only going to use the data in order to stick to the figures. We choose a  state to work with—New York. We look for the statistics about the population. After reading   the content information, we confirm the usage of the data.  Getting ready Now, we can work with the statistics about New York Students Demographics. There are   five percentages in the chart and we take into account those figures in order to design a  column chart:   f 0.5 percent of American Indian and Alaskan Native Students: 2008-2009  f 7.7 percent of Asian and Pacific Islander Students: 2008-2009  70   Chapter 3   f 19.2 percent of Afro-American Students: 2008-2009  f 21.3 percent of Hispanic Students: 2008-2009  f 51.0 percent of Anglo-Saxon Students: 2008-2009  f 0.3 percent Unknown  the data is not available   How to do it... We have already found the statistics that we are going to work with. Then, we have to add  those figures in a chart. We are going to use OpenOffice.org. We can download it from the  following website: http:  download.openoffice.org index.html.  After installing OpenOffice, we work with Spreadsheet. Thus, we click on the said icon. Follow  these steps in order to draw the chart:  1.  Click on the icon of Number Format: Percent, with the % symbol. Then, type the first   percentage in A1.  2.  Enter the demographic information in B1. 3.  Repeat steps 1 and 2, and then enter the data in A2, B2, and so on. 4.   In A7, click on the Sum icon. Highlight A1 up to A6; the total percentage  will appear there.  5.  Highlight A1 up to A6 again. Click on Insert  Chart, as shown in the   following screenshot:  71   Working with Different Types of Interactive Charts  6.  Choose Column. You can add 3D effects if you click on the 3D Look block. There   are also different types of columns within the Shape block, as shown in the  following screenshot:  7.  Click on Next or Data Range. 8.  The range is the information that you use to display in the chart. You have already   highlighted the range; as a result, you have verified that it is correct.  9.  Choose whether to show the data in rows or in columns. Click on the radio button   Data series in columns.  10.  Click on Next or Data Series. 11.  Add the information of the percentages. Complete the Range for Name block with   the absolute directions of the blocks in the spreadsheet. Click on Add to add the  necessary ones. In this case, we do need six.   12. Click on Next or Chart elements. 13.  Complete the Title, Subtitle, X axis, and Y axis blocks with the information about the   statistics that you are working with.  14.  Click on Finish.  72   15.  The chart will appear, as shown in the following screenshot:  Chapter 3  16.  You can right-click on the image. Copy it and paste it in software such as Paint or   Inkscape and save it as .png. Therefore, you can upload it to the Moodle course as  an image.  17.  Another possibility is to save the file. Thus, whenever you open it, the chart appears,   as shown in the previous screenshot.  How it works... We have already designed the chart that we are going to work with. It's time to think of an  activity. Therefore, an important link to this information is Ellis Island, where many immigrants  from different parts of the world arrived. There were many reasons for them to do so,  explained in the following website in a timeline: http:  www.ellisisland.org immexp  wseix_4_3.asp?. We have found a historic connecting element to our chart. We could  design the activity in a Forum.  73   Working with Different Types of Interactive Charts  We can also upload either the image of the chart or the file that we have created to our  activity within the Moodle course. Choose the weekly outline section where you want to   insert this activity and follow these steps:  1.  Click on Add an activity  Forum. 2.  Complete the Forum name block. 3.  Click on the downwards arrow in Forum type and choose Q and A forum. 4.  For uploading the image of the chart, click on the Insert edit image icon  Find or   upload an image  Browse, and look for the image that you have just saved.  5.  Click on Upload this file. 6.  Complete the Image description block and click on Insert. 7.  Make a link to the aforementioned website. 8.  Click on Save and return to course. The activity looks as shown in the   following screenshot:  Embedding a line chart  In this recipe, we will present the estimated number of people  in millions  using a particular  language over the Internet. To do this, we will include images in our line chart. Instead of  writing the name of the languages, we will insert the flags, which will represent the language  used. It is the first asset that we have inserted in our statistics drawings in order to make them  more appealing to the sight of our students. We design the line chart, taking into account the  statistics carried out in the following website: http:  www.internetworldstats.com  stats7.htm.  74   Chapter 3  Getting ready We have an element  the image  that we are going to use in this recipe though we have to  decide what to use in order to develop the line chart. We are going to carry out the activity  using the following website https:  documents.google.com ?hl=enall. We have to  sign in and follow the steps required in order to design a spreadsheet file. We have several  options to work with the document. After you have an account to work with Google Docs, let's  see how to do our line chart!  How to do it... We work with Spreadsheet because we need to make calculations and create a chart.  Therefore, we need to follow these steps:  1.  Click on File  New  Spreadsheet. 2.  Write the name of the languages spoken in column A. 3.  Write the figures in column B. 4.  Select the figures from column B1 up to B11. Click on Insert  Chart. 5.  Complete the options, as shown in the following screenshot:  6.  Click on Save chart. 7.  Add the images of the flags belonging to the languages spoken. Then click on   8.  Another pop-up window will appear. You may either copy the URL link in the block or   Insert  Image....  use the Google image search.  75   Working with Different Types of Interactive Charts  9.  There are many warnings about copyright issues. You should look for one flag for  each language and place it next to the chart that we have already designed in our  document. Check that the image is free to use without copyright.  10.  Click on the downwards arrow in Share  Publish as a web page, as shown in the   following screenshot:  11.  Another pop-up window appears.

Copy the HTML code that appears in the block that reads Copy and paste the   link above.  14.  Click on Close.  76   Chapter 3  How it works... We have just designed the chart that we want our students to work with. We are going to  embed the chart with the flags. If you want to design a warm up activity for students to guess  or find out which are the top languages used in the Internet; you could add a chat or a forum  in the course. After that, we design the activity making a link to the interactive chart in a Wiki.  Select the weekly outline section where you want to add the activity and follow these steps:  1.  Click on Add an activity  Wiki. 2.  Complete the Wiki name and Wiki description blocks. 3.  Click on the HTML icon and paste the HTML code that we have previously copied.   4.  Click on Save and return to course. The activity looks as shown in the   Then click on Update.  following screenshot:  When hovering the mouse on the line chart, apart from looking at the flags, students can read  the name of the language and the exact percentage of the statistic due to the fact that the  chart is interactive, as shown in the previous screenshot.

Therefore, our first step is to design a survey in our Moodle course.  How to do it... We design an activity to ask our students to vote in order to create the interactive pie chart.  We create the activity in a choice so that students can choose their favorite type of computer  games. Afterwards, we draw the interactive chart with the results.  Choose the weekly outline section where you want to add the activity. These are the steps that  you are going to follow:  1.  Click on Add an activity  Choice. 2.  Complete the Choice name and Introduction text blocks. 3.  Complete the Options blocks. 4.  Complete the Restrict answering to this time period, Miscellaneous Settings, and   Common module settings blocks, as shown in the following screenshot:  5.  Click on Save and return to course.  78   How it works... Students click on the activity and vote. The way that this activity was designed, it won't allow  students to vote more than once. This activity works as shown in the following screenshot:  Chapter 3  By the way, I have voted for board games; as you can see, I have no choice to vote again, and  also we can see how many people voted.  79   Working with Different Types of Interactive Charts  There's more After gathering the votes of our students, we can design the pie chart showing the results.  Therefore, we can use Google Docs to create the interactive chart, write the data, and insert  the chart, as shown in the following screenshot:  We have just used Google Docs like in the previous recipe, so we follow the same steps in  order to create the chart, but in this case we choose pie chart.  Inserting an interactive pie chart with labels  We have already designed the chart in Google Docs and it is time to upload it in our Moodle  course. We can create several types of activities where we can use the pie chart as a resource  to enhance our Moodle course. The only step that we have to bear in mind is to copy the HTML  code as we did in the previous recipe in order to paste it and embed the chart in our   Moodle course.  In order to get the HTML code from Google Docs, follow these steps:  1.  Click on the downwards arrow in Share  Publish as a web page. 2.  Another pop-up window appears. Click on the downwards arrow below Get a link to   the published data.  80   Chapter 3  3.  Click on HTML to embed in a page. 4.  Copy the HTML code that appears in the block that reads Copy and paste the   link above.  5.  Click on Close. 6.  Now that we have the HTML code, we can paste it in any activity that we want    to design in our Moodle course.  See also   f Embedding a line chart  Creating bar charts with hyperlinks In this recipe, we are going to perform a very simple activity. We are going to use Open Office  Spreadsheet, which we have already used before. Another option happens to be Microsoft  Excel. You can download a free trial version from the following website: http:  tinyurl. com 27xe849.   Getting ready We design a Database activity in our Moodle course to survey students according to the way  they spend their free time. We just carry out a simple statistic; we are not focusing on other  factors, though a Math teacher can help us. We design this activity in two parts so that the  first part is the survey to our students and the second part consists of gathering the data and  designing a chart using Open Office Spreadsheet, creating the hyperlinks through a website,  and uploading it to our Moodle course.  How to do it... We are going to enter our Moodle course and design the database activity in order to gather  information about the way our students spend their free time. Select the weekly outline  section and follow these steps in order to develop the activity:  1.  Click on Add an activity  Database. 2.  Complete the Name and the Introduction fields. 3.

Complete the Radio buttons field with "Spending   your free time at weekends" and "Spending your free time on holidays". You may  decide to add any other option.  9.  Go back to the course. The activity looks as shown in the following screenshot:  82   Chapter 3  How it works... We have just designed the survey to carry out in our class. Now, it is time to design the bar  chart to insert in our Moodle course telling the rest of the class how their friends spend their  free time on the different occasions. We are going to work with Open Office Spreadsheet.  Follow these steps so that you can design the activity:  1.  Complete the spreadsheet with the information that you obtain from the database   activity from the Moodle course.   2.  Select the first group of columns with the figures, click on Insert  Chart, and choose   a graph.  3.  The chart will appear. You may edit the chart as you wish. 4.  Save the file. The file looks as shown in the following screenshot:  83   Working with Different Types of Interactive Charts  There's more We can insert hyperlinks in the chart that we have just created using a website because it is  not possible to do it in Open Office Spreadsheet. Therefore, we are going to save the charts as  images. There are several ways to do this. The simplest way is to press the Print Screen key  and paste the image in Paint or Inkscape. Cut and paste the chart where you want to add the  hyperlinks and save it as .png. Repeat the same process for the other two charts.  Inserting hyperlinks to the images We have just saved the charts as images. Therefore, we can add hyperlinks to those images.  It is very simple. We can do it through a web page: http:  www.image-maps.com . Follow  these steps in order to get the hyperlinks:  1.  Click on Browse  choose the image that you want to upload  Open. 2.  Click on Start Mapping Your Image, as shown in the following screenshot:  3.  Click on continue to next step. 4.

Click on Save. 7.  Repeat steps 4-6 for each bar. When you finish adding the hyperlinks, click on    Get your code.  84   8.  Click on HTML Code. You will get the code to embed in our Moodle course. Search for   the name of the file that you have uploaded and erase the website information; just  leave the name of the file. You have to upload the image with the same name so as   to have the same file in the Moodle course and in the code. It is shown in the  following screenshot:  Chapter 3  9.  Copy the code.   Enter the Moodle course. Create an activity for students to discuss their different likes and  dislikes of their ways of spending their free time. First, upload the image to the Moodle  course. Create the activity and paste the code that will display the chart with the hyperlinks.  The following is an example of a chat activity. When hovering the mouse on the bar, a  hyperlink is displayed:  85   Working with Different Types of Interactive Charts Working with area charts We are going to design this activity using the following website: http:  sheet.zoho.com  login.do?serviceurl= home.do. First of all, you have to Sign Up for Free and then  we can design our chart there. It is very interesting because we can embed the chart in our  Moodle course.  Getting ready We are not going to survey our students. We can look for online statistics about any topic, or  we can upload an existing file to the aforementioned website. Therefore, we use the previous  activity that we designed in Open Office and upload it to sheet.zoho.com.  How to do it... You have to follow these steps in order to design the activity:  1.  Click on Import  Browse  Click on the file that you want to upload  Open  Import,   as shown in the following screenshot:  2.  Click on Import.

Save the file in this: sheet.zoho.com.  How it works... We did not create a chart in this activity because the idea was that you learned how to use  an existing one and import it to another online spreadsheet. It is time to embed this area  chart to our Moodle course. Therefore, we add a third element to the activity that we have   first designed as a database. We are going to create a Chat activity so that there is interaction  among our students and they can talk about their activities in their free time. Follow   these steps:  1.  Click on Add an activity  Chat. 2.  Complete the Name of this chat room and Introduction text fields.  87   Working with Different Types of Interactive Charts  3.  Click on the HTML icon and copy the HTML code of the chart. You may embed   the three charts that we have designed. In this case, you have to go back to   sheet.zoho.com and copy the different HTML code for the other charts.  4.  Click on Save and display. The activity looks as shown in the following screenshot:  Inserting an X Y  Scatter  chart This is a very simple recipe. We design and insert an X Y  Scatter  chart in our Moodle course  using http:  www.editgrid.com .  Getting ready We ask our students through a Choice, as we have done in a previous recipe, if they have  traveled abroad on holidays. This is a suggestion; you may change the subject of the poll.   As it is a yes no poll, it is very easy to design a chart. Let's see how to do it!  How to do it... We enter our Moodle course and select the weekly outline section. We just design a poll in  order to gather data to insert the chart afterwards. Therefore, we limit the choice to one week.  These are the steps that we have to follow:  1.  Click on Add an activity  Choice. 2.  Complete the Choice name and Introduction text blocks.  88   Chapter 3  3.  Write YES in the Option 1 block and NO in the Option 2 block. 4.  Tick the block Restrict answering to this time period and choose the Open and   Until date that you are going to poll your students.  5.  Within the Miscellaneous Settings blocks, click on the downwards arrow in Allow  choice to be updated and choose No, so that students cannot change their choice.  6.  Click on Save and return to course, the choice looks as shown in the following   screenshot:  How it works... After polling our students, we design the chart and insert it in our Moodle course in order to  design another activity. We enter http:  www.editgrid.com workspace. These are the  steps that you have to follow:  1.  Click on New. Click on File  Save  Write a name to the file  Within the Access   level, choose Public Read – only.  2.  Complete the spreadsheet in order to design a chart afterwards. Select the fields you   want to design the chart. Click on the Insert Chart icon.  3.  Choose XY Scatter and choose the one type you want to work with. Click on Insert. 4.  The chart is shown on the spreadsheet.

You can also embed the chart in the Moodle course. Click on Publish  Widgets    HTML Table, as shown in the following screenshot:  6.  A pop-up window will appear with the HTML code to copy and paste in our    Moodle course.  You can create a Forum activity, embedding the chart in which students post their comments  about their holidays abroad.   Working with stock charts We are going to work with very interesting websites that will brighten our Moodle course.  As we deal with stock charts, it is a must that we surf on the NYSE website. There happens  to be a useful poster in Adobe Acrobat PDF format that can be added as a resource to our  Moodle course, explaining how to read a stock chart. Then, we make a link to another website,  where we can create a portfolio online, and when hovering the mouse over the name of the  company, we have the stock charts of the company.  Getting ready We enter http:  www.nyse.com . On the left-hand margin, there is a cascade menu  where you can have access to a poster that reads: "Poster: How to Read Stock Tables". Click  on About us  Education  Education Materials. There will appear new information on the  right-hand margin displaying many resources concerning the stock market. We are going to  use the aforementioned under Publications For Teachers.  Click on it and copy the URL: http:  www.nyse.com pdfs NYSE_posterA_Mech.pdf .  How to do it... We enter our Moodle course and choose the weekly outline section. In this case, it is a  passive one, giving information about the terms related to stock tables. Follow these steps:  1.  Click on Add a resource  URL. 2.  Complete the Name field. 3.  Complete the Description field.  90   Chapter 3  4.  Complete the Content field and copy the following URL: http:  www.nyse.com   pdfs NYSE_posterA_Mech.pdf. 5.  Click on Save and return to course.  How it works... We are going to create a Forum activity, because finance is a nice topic to discuss. We work  with different links to websites that enrich the forum. You can ask the Accounts department   at school for help, if you do not happen to be a finance lover, in order to interact with the   said subject.  Remember to add the activity after the previous resource. These are the steps that you have  to follow:  1.  Click on Add an activity  Forum. 2.  Complete the Forum name and Forum introduction blocks. 3.  Click on the Insert   edit image icon, and minimize the website because you do not   4.

You have access to financial information about them, as shown in the  previous screenshot.  7.  Click on Publish Map at the bottom of the right-hand of the screen, as shown in the  previous screenshot. There will appear a pop-out window displaying two URLs, either  for a Large map or a Small map. It's a .PNG URL so copy it and paste it in the Insert  edit image block in our Moodle course, which we had minimized before.  8.  Complete the Image description block and click on Insert. Minimize the Moodle   course again and go back to http:  finviz.com .  9.  Click on Portfolio on the top menu. 10.  In the Ticker block, write the names of some companies, the acronyms used in the   map that you have just inserted in our Moodle course.  11.  Repeat the same process, and when you finish, write a name to the portfolio in the   Portfolio Name block. Click on Save Changes.  12. Click on View. The portfolio looks as shown in the following screenshot:  13.  When hovering the mouse on the name of a company, a stock chart is displayed.   Copy the URL so that you make a link to this portfolio that was just created. Go back  to our Moodle course.  14.  Click on the Insert edit link icon and complete the block. Paste the URL that you   have just copied. 15.  Click on Update.  92   16.  Click on Save and return to course. The activity looks as shown in the   following screenshot:  Chapter 3  Creating a poll and designing a surface chart We are going to create another poll in our Moodle course. In previous recipes, we have already  done a poll, but this time we design it through Feedback. We ask the students and they have  to provide their answers. Let's get ready!  Getting ready We design the poll using Feedback within activities, and we create the chart drawing by  exporting the file from Moodle. Feedback has this advantage. The poll is related to Music.   The question is: Which device do you use to listen to music?  How to do it... We enter our Moodle course and choose the weekly outline section where we want to place  the activity and follow these steps in order to carry out the activity:  1.  Click on Add an activity  Feedback. 2.  Complete the Name and Description blocks. 3.  Click on Save and display.  93   Working with Different Types of Interactive Charts  4.

Write the question: "Which device do you use to listen to music?" in the   Question block.   6.  Click on Save question.  7.  Go back to the course.  How it works... Students will answer the poll only once. We can see the answers of the poll and we can export  the files to Open Office or Microsoft Excel, and we can draw a chart using them without typing  the data. Feedback generates an .xls file. The said file can be opened with either Microsoft  Excel or Open Office spreadsheet, it all depends which one is used on your computer. Follow  these steps in order to draw the surface chart:  1.  Click on Analysis  Export to Excel  or Open Office is also possible depending on   which software you use .  2.  A pop-up window will appear displaying a message to open the file. Click on OK. 3.  Save the file. Divide the listeners of music between boys and girls because you need   two elements to take into account when drawing a surface chart.  94   4.  Highlight the necessary data to draw a surface chart. Click on Insert  Other Charts    Surface  you may also use another type of chart such as bars .  5.  The chart may look as shown in the following screenshot:  Chapter 3  6.  Right-click on the chart and select copy. Paste the chart in Paint or Inkscape and save   the file as .PNG. In that case, you can upload the image of the chart in the Moodle  course and design another activity showing the students the result of the poll.  It is also possible to do it in Open Office spreadsheet if that happens to be software that  you use.  Drawing a donut interactive chart We are going to create an interactive chart with Open Office Drawing. We can insert  a chart in a very simple way. We also add images to the chart and hyperlinks to the   images. We can also design the same type of activity saving the image as .PNG and use  http:  www.image-maps.com .  Getting ready We are going to work with statistics of the nationality of our students in the school. We first  enter the continents' nationalities. If you happen to live in a cosmopolitan city, it would be very  interesting! We then add hyperlinks to websites displaying information about the continents.  95   Working with Different Types of Interactive Charts  How to do it... Enter Open Office Drawing and follow these steps to carry out the activity:  1.  Click on Insert  Chart. 2.  Right-click on the chart and choose Chart Data Table. 3.  Complete the table with the information to display on the chart, using the nationality   of the students in the classroom or the school.  4.  Right-click again on the chart and choose Chart Type. 5.  Choose Pie  Exploded Donut Chart. 6.  Tick 3D Look. 7.  Click on OK. 8.  Click on Insert Picture From file. 9.  10.  Click on the image  Hyperlink. Complete the block with the hyperlinks. The file will   Insert one image related to each continent for each piece of the chart.  look as shown in the following screenshot:  How it works... We have just designed a chart with hyperlinks with Open Office. We can insert it in our Moodle  course as a resource. So, we can design an activity in several parts. You can make a survey  to know the nationality of students if you do not happen to have this kind of information  as  we have done in previous recipes . Then, create the chart in Drawing within Open Office  that  is your homework! , and add the file as a resource in the Moodle course. Finally, create an  Online text activity within Assignments, asking students which continent they find appealing  to visit and why based on the information.  96   4  Integrating Interactive  Documents  In this chapter, we will cover:   f Developing collaborative writing exercises with Google Docs  f Using Open Office and uploading the file to Moodle  f Using Flickr images in Open Office documents  f Including live PDF documents in Moodle exercises  f Reviewing PDF documents  f Designing a Wiki  Introduction This chapter explains how to use diverse types of interactive documents in Moodle courses.  The recipes use the most popular, free, web-based, commercial, and desktop-based software  to create the interactive documents and provide students the necessary information for their  research activities.  Integrating interactive documents in our Moodle courses is a very important asset to take into  account. Students not only have the possibility to work with another tool to edit their works,  but also use different types of elements that each of them own as a characteristic. Each of  the following software that we will look at in the upcoming recipes is eligible according to   the type of activity that will be carried out.   Integrating Interactive Documents  The baseline topic of this chapter will be Fact or Fiction. There are plenty of activities that  can be carried out using this baseline topic. According to the subject that you are teaching,  you can change the activities in such a way so that you can adapt the content of the recipe   to design a multimedia activity in your Moodle courses.  One of the new features of Moodle 2.0 is that it allows uploading files directly from the file  picker from the different places from where we have created them; therefore, as we are  dealing with interactive documents in this chapter, we cover how to do it. We do need to have  access to manage the repositories in order to achieve this. Thus, we will learn how to do it.  Depending on the subject that you are teaching or the type of activity that you want to design,  you can combine these recipes with integrating interactive documents with any of the recipes  in Chapter 3, Working with Different Types of Interactive Charts. As most of the recipes in  this chapter use the same software, thus you can apply the tips and tricks you learnt in the  previous chapter.  Recipes are not only based on the different tools that software have, but also on the several  ways that students can take advantage of them. In other words, collaborative writing is also  possible using those tools. These specific characteristics are to be pointed out in each of   the recipes.  Moodle per se allows us to carry out activities in collaborative writing, but the focus is  on multimedia assets, that is the reason why we deal with them. Besides, students will  be learning that there are plenty of options and many tools that can also be applied for  integrating interactive documents.  Developing collaborative writing exercises  with Google Docs In this recipe, we will deal with Google Docs because we want students to write in a  collaborative way. There are plenty of options that can be carried out according to the type   of activity that needs to be designed; that is to say, the way it can be uploaded into our  Moodle course.  Getting ready First of all, enter the following website: https:  docs.google.com . If you have already  used this online software, you must have an account; otherwise, you have to sign in so as to  create a document. Therefore, enter the previous website, sign in, and choose Documents.  98   Chapter 4  How to do it... The Yeti is the topic to be covered in this recipe because Fact or Fiction is the baseline topic  that is to be covered in this chapter. Now, we can create the activity—the first part of the  activity—in this document. Thus, the following are the steps that you have to follow:  1.  Create a file that is to start a debate among students whether the Yeti is a fact or   fiction. You can make a link to a website that gives information about the creature,   as shown in the following screenshot:  2.	 Click on File  Save  write a name for the file and save it.  99   Integrating Interactive Documents  3.  Click on Share on the top right-hand margin. Choose Anyone who has the link can   view, as shown in the following screenshot:  4.	 Click on Close.  How it works... We have just created the file that students can modify in a collaborative way. It is time to  upload it to our Moodle course. Choose the weekly outline section where you want to insert  this activity and follow these steps:  1.  Click on Add an activity  Online text. 2.  Complete the Assignment name and the Description blocks. 3.  Click on Insert   edit link icon. Make a link to the website of Google Docs, shown   4.  Click on Save and return to course. The activity looks as shown in the   in the previous screenshot.  following screenshot:  100   Chapter 4  There's more... You could also incorporate the following other options in your Moodle course:  Uploading a file from Google Docs from Moodle's file picker One of the new features of Moodle 2.0 is that you can upload files from different sources. You  can open the files that you have created directly from Moodle's file picker. So, as the file has  been created in Google Docs, we can have access to it from the file picker in Moodle.  Enabling Google Docs in Moodle There are some steps that you have to take into account in order to enable the Google Docs  options in the file picker. First of all, you have to switch role to "manager" in order to have  access to the options that we need to work with. After switching role, these are the steps that  we have to follow:  1.  Click on Site administration  Plugins  Repositories  Manage repositories. 2.  Click on Enabled and visible for Google Docs, as shown in the following screenshot:  3.	 Click on Save  Save changes.  101   Integrating Interactive Documents Uploading a file from Google Docs into Moodle We can add a resource in our Moodle course by uploading files from Google Docs directly from  the file picker because it's just been enabled. So, let's add a resource. Choose the weekly  outline section where you want to add the resource and follow these steps:  1.  Click on Add a resource  File. 2.  Complete the Name and Description blocks. 3.  Click on Add…, the pop-up window with the File picker will appear, as shown in the   following screenshot:  4.	 Click on Google Docs, as shown in the previous screenshot. 5.  Choose the file that you want to upload  Select this file. 6.  Click on Save and return to course.  In the previous activity, we have added a resource in Moodle, that is to say we  have just uploaded a file for our students to read, therefore, students cannot  modify the file. How to enable Google Docs in Moodle 2.0 is a new feature.  102   Chapter 4  See also In Chapter 3, Working with Different Types of Interactive Charts, see:   f Embedding a line chart  f Designing an interactive pie chart with labels  Using Open Office and uploading the file   to Moodle Open Office has already been used in the previous chapter in order to draw a chart, but in this  chapter, we are using it to write some text. Our students have this software, otherwise they  can download it for free; one important reason why we are dealing with it.  Getting ready We will design an activity in which students give their opinions if some things that happen are  fact or fiction. Therefore, we can develop the task in two parts: a resource and an activity.  How to do it... First of all, we need to design the resource because we have to create a new file in Open  Office. In said file, we make a link to a website in which students can have access to more  information about the topic to be covered. In this case, we give more data about the strange  creature—the Yeti, and add Bigfoot, also known as Sasquatch. Click on Open Office   Documents and follow these steps:  1.  Create a new file.   103   Integrating Interactive Documents  2.  Make a link to a website that gives information about the two creatures, as shown in   the following screenshot:  3.	 Click on Apply. 4.  Click on File  Save as  write a name for the file.  How it works... After designing the resource, we create within assignments another activity in which students  upload a file. That is to say, student have to complete the table that we have created,  uploading it to the Moodle course.  104   Chapter 4  Choose the weekly outline section where you want to add the resource. These are the steps   to follow:  1.  Click on Add a resource  File. 2.  Complete the Name and Description blocks. 3.  Click on Add  Upload a file  Browse  look for the file that has been created and   click on it  Open  Upload this file. 4.  Click on Save and return to course. 5.  The resource is ready! It looks as shown in the following screenshot:  6.  Let's create the activity. Click on Add an activity  Upload a single file within   Assignments.  7.  Complete the Assignment name and the Description blocks. Point out that students   have to fill in the previous file and submit it.  8.  Click on Save and return to course.  We combined the resource with the activity. Open Office does not allow us to use a file in a  collaborative way like Google Docs, but we can adjust this using the resource and activity that  Moodle offers.  105   Integrating Interactive Documents  Using Flickr images in Open Office   documents In the previous recipe, the same software was used; therefore, we can modify the previous  file and add images of those creatures from Flickr. We work with external files because Open  Office does not have a clipart library. Thus, this tool is the right option.  Getting ready We can both search for a photo in Flickr or upload a picture from our personal collection.  However, I doubt that we have a photo of these creatures! Therefore, visit http:  www. flickr.com , and create a free account, and upload photos to our document in Open Office.  How to do it... After signing in and creating the account, search for photos that people have uploaded.  Therefore, these are the steps to follow in order to find photos to insert in our Open Office file:  1.  Click on the downwards arrow in the Search block on the left and choose   2.   Everyone's Uploads. In the Search block on the right, write yeti, because we need photos of the said  creature, as shown in the following screenshot:  3.	 Click on Search and on the image that you want to insert in the file. 4.  Right-click on the image and choose Save Picture As. Bear in mind to select a free   license image.  5.  Another option is to right-click on the image and click on Copy. Then you go to the   document and paste the image.  106   Chapter 4  How it works... We have just selected the images that need to be uploaded in our document. They can be  uploaded in two ways, though it would be better to save the image in case we need it another  time. So, these are the steps to follow:  1.  Open the previous document in Open Office. 2.  Click on Insert  Picture  From file...  select the image to upload  Open. 3.  Enlarge the image so that it fits the table designed. 4.  Another option is to right-click on the place where the image is to be pasted and click   on Paste.  5.  Save the file. The file looks as shown in the following screenshot:  See also   f Using Open Office and uploading the file to Moodle.  107   Integrating Interactive Documents Including live PDF documents in   Moodle exercises This recipe is very interesting and appealing for our students. We can develop any type of  activities using this resource, because we are inserting Adobe Reader within our Moodle  course. For that reason, we do need to work with some code. Let's get ready!  Getting ready Open Office is needed in order to convert a file that we have just designed into a PDF. Use the  same file to avoid creating a new one. Besides, you may use one of the activities that you have  saved in your computer and convert it to carry out this activity.  Another software needed for this recipe is Adobe Reader, which can be downloaded from the  following website: http:  get.adobe.com reader download .  How to do it... First of all, convert the file into a PDF. Therefore, choose the file used in the previous recipe  and follow these steps to convert it:  1.  Enter Open Office  Text Document. 2.  Click on Open  and browse for the file to be converted into a PDF. 3.  Click on File  Export as PDF  Export, as shown in the following screenshots:  108   Chapter 4  4.	 Write a name for the file. Click on Save. 5.  You can now open the file using Adobe Reader.  How it works... We have just converted a file into a PDF. As we embed it, we need to work with some code. We  are going to create an activity, in this case create an Online text activity, you can choose any  other. These are the steps to follow:  1.  Click on Add an activity  Online text within Assignments. 2.  Complete the Assignment name block. 3.  Complete the Description block. In this block, highlight some words and click on   Insert  edit link icon.  4.  Click on Browse within Link URL block. 5.  Click on Upload a file  Browse  Choose the file  Open  Upload this file  Insert. 6.  A link to the PDF file was just created. 7.  Click on HTML icon. Write the following code:     8.  Change this code with some information. That is to say, add the name of the file just   uploaded, instead of FullScreenEmbed.pdf, as follows: <embed src="http:  localhost draftfile.php 13 user  draft 387786865 Yeti_and_Bigfoot.pdf"width="800" height="500">  9.  Click on Update. 10.  Click on Save and display. It looks as shown in the following screenshot:  109   Integrating Interactive Documents  See also   f Reviewing PDF documents  Reviewing PDF documents We have worked with PDF documents in the previous recipe. Therefore, use the comments  on them. You can review PDF documents in two different ways: add sticky notes or highlight  some text. In case you do not want to use Adobe Reader, Open Office and Microsoft Word also  provide reviewing facilities, so these are other options to bear in mind.  Getting ready We need to work with Adobe Reader as well in this recipe. Use the file that has been worked  with in the previous two recipes so as to avoid creating a new file. Why should we add some  comments? So as to guide students on how to complete a chart and add comments to a piece  of writing, among other ideas.  How to do it... The aim of the recipe is to focus on the way to add comments to the PDF file; therefore, we are  not dealing with the document but how to review it. We are covering the two ways to review a  file; we can also combine them in order to use both the tools. Enter Adobe Reader and open   a file. Follow these steps:  1.  Click on Highlight text icon, as shown in the following screenshot. Select the text that   you want to highlight.  2.  Click on Add sticky note icon, as shown in the following screenshot:  110   3.  Add a comment to the sticky note.  How it works... On the right-side of the document, you can see the words that you have highlighted and  the sticky notes as well as the comments that were added to the PDF. It is shown in the  following screenshot:  Chapter 4  We can add a resource to our Moodle course as done in the previous recipe, therefore,   instead of uploading a file from Open Office, upload a .pdf file with sticky notes or  highlighted comments.  Designing a Wiki Another interesting and different way of creating collaborative writing is designing a Wiki using  the following website: http:  www.wikispaces. It enhances students' way of learning.  Thus, we, as teachers, use several resources in order to avoid routine. Another option is to use  Wikis in Moodle 2.0, which are a bit different from the ones belonging to the previous version.  111   Integrating Interactive Documents  Getting ready Click on Create a free classroom wiki in the aforementioned site, as shown in the  following screenshot:  How to do it... When we click the previously mentioned link, we come across the following link where some  specific information is required; therefore, follow these steps in order to start designing   the Wiki:  1.  Complete all the blocks fields, as shown in the following screenshot:  112   2.  Another page appears, click on username, in this case silvinahillar, in order to start   designing the Wiki.  3.  Click on New Page, on the left margin, as shown circled in the following screenshot:  Chapter 4  4.	 Complete the Page Name and Add Tags blocks. Then, the New Page URL is given   underneath these blocks.  5.  Click on Create. 6.  An editor appears in order to create the Wiki. The editor is shown in the    following screenshot:  113   Integrating Interactive Documents  7.	 The editor is similar to any editor that we have been working with, the only different   item to give special attention to is Widget. When clicking on the said icon, the  following are the widgets that can be added to our Wiki, as shown in the   following screenshot:  8.	 We can add any of these previously shown widgets in our Wiki. The instructions are  shown when we click on any of these items. Many multimedia assets can easily be  uploaded to the wiki.  9.  After designing the Wiki, click on Preview, in case you want to edit something. When   ready, click on Save.  There are plenty of features that could take a whole chapter to be explored,  though it is not the aim of the book, it is just to let you know how to design a  Wiki using a website.  114   Chapter 4  How it works... We have just designed our Wiki. It is time to embed it in our Moodle course. We can design  either an activity or create a resource because the Wiki that we have just created is part of  an activity. Students should also write their opinions after discussing with their classmates.  Therefore, follow these steps in order to use this Wiki in our virtual classroom:  1.  Click on the Wiki that you have just created  Manage Wiki. 2.  Click on Badges within Tools. 3.  Choose the badge that you want to insert and copy the HTML code. 4.   It is time to start our Moodle course. Click on Add an activity  Offline activity  within Assignments.  5.  Complete the Assignment name and Description blocks. 6.  Click on the HTML icon and paste the code. Therefore, create the activity by pasting   the HTML code and inserting the badge.  7.  Click on Save and display. 8.  The activity looks as shown in the following screenshot:  115    5  Working with Audio,  Sound, Music, and  Podcasts  In this chapter, we will cover:   f Recording audio using a microphone  f Creating and embedding a podcast  f Creating MP3 files from diverse audio formats  f Embedding free sound available on the Internet  f Working with MIDI music  f Editing MIDI files  f Embedding playlists in a Moodle activity  Introduction This chapter explains how to work with different types of audio files to include sounds,   music, and podcasts to Moodle courses. These recipes will teach you how to use different  tools to record, edit, and convert different audio file formats, covering common scenarios   for multimedia Moodle activities.  The sense of hearing plays an important role for effective learning due to the fact that   there are plenty of students whose ability to learn depends on their musical intelligence.  Besides, inserting this type of ingredient into our activities makes them more interesting   to our students.   Working with Audio, Sound, Music, and Podcasts  You can combine several pieces of recording with not only our own voice, but also with  somebody else's speaking or sounds, therefore, podcasts won't be dull for students when  they have to listen only to the teacher speaking. The mixture of sounds, audio, and music  is interesting because students can listen to small pieces of recordings or music as well as  ourselves explaining what they are hearing.  Podcasting is an excellent way to share different elements with students. We can combine  parts of recordings to provide our students with facilities to listen like a radio show created  by their own teacher, depending on how creative you can be. Once you are confident with  podcasts, it can be easily enhanced by them.  Students can record their podcasts too. Some of the skills that students develop by creating  podcasts include writing scripts and their listening and speaking skills. They learn how to  speak better because they have to pay attention to what they listen to. It would be advisable  that students listen to our podcasts first and then make their own.  The baseline topic of this chapter is Music and sounds around the world. Therefore, we will  design several types of activities in which we need to use this multimedia element in our  recipes. We can combine several types of ingredients to make our recipes quite spicy!  Creating podcasts using different resources available on the Web enhances them further.  Therefore, we need to know which are the resources that we can bear in mind in order to  use them. One of these resources are the free sounds available on the Web. They can be  incorporated into Moodle courses or they can be used in order to create a podcast with  different sounds. It all depends on what type of activity you want to design.  The software that we use in the first three recipes in this chapter to create a podcast is  Audacity. It is free and open source and works with several Operating Systems  OS . It would  be advisable to read the recipes in order because they are designed in such a way that they  are threaded to one another.  In some of the recipes, we leave aside Audacity, but this does not mean that it cannot be used  in order to combine the audio files that we mention. However, it would become a chapter on  Audacity if we go on with said software. We can also add sounds available on the Web to the  podcasts. We create Audacity software that cannot edit MIDI files, but TuxGuitar can. It is a  free and open source software that supports several OS systems and is a great tool for editing  MIDI files. Besides, you can create a TuxGuitar Community account and share files with other  users. After signing in, you can upload, download, comment, and rate files. You can also ask  for help from the music teacher or work with students with said software, especially   music lovers.  We will learn how to allow students to record audio after listening to us speaking. It's time for  us to listen to them. Create this type of activity in order to make our virtual classroom more  vivid. Thus, students practice other skills, as we have stated before, when they have to   record themselves.  118   Chapter 5  Recording audio using a microphone In this recipe, we will learn how to record our voice using a microphone as well as a software.  Therefore, using this software we can not only record live audio, but also convert tapes and  records into digital recordings among other features for our Moodle courses. Also, be aware of  copyright issues of the material that you are using to be recorded.  Getting ready As we will record audio from a microphone using the Audacity software, download it from  the following website: http:  audacity.sourceforge.net download . Bear in mind  that this software works with different OS, therefore, click on the OS that is installed in   your computer.  How to do it... After downloading and installing Audacity onto your computer, record the instructions of an  activity or record; something that is more interesting to listen to. For example, as the baseline  topic of this chapter is Sounds and music around the world, focus on different accents of  spoken English. Therefore, follow these steps to design the activity:  1.  Start Audacity. 2.  Click on the Record button within the Audio Control and Editing Toolbars, as shown   in the following screenshot:  3.  When you finish recording, click on the Stop button.  119   Working with Audio, Sound, Music, and Podcasts  4.  The digital representation of the voice  wave form  is shown in the audio track portion   within the Project view, as shown in the following screenshot:  5.  Click on File  Save Project as, as shown in the following screenshot:  6.  Click on File  Export, and save the file as WAV type. Then, embed the podcast in our   Moodle course. It is shown in the following screenshot:  7.  Click on Save  OK.  120   Chapter 5  How it works... We need to upload the podcast to our Moodle course. To do this, choose the weekly outline  section where you want to insert it and follow these steps:  1.  Click on Add an activity  Online text within Assignments. 2.  Complete the Assignment name and Description blocks. 3.  Click on the Moodle Media icon  Find or upload a sound, video or applet…    Upload a file  Browse . Look for the file that you want to upload and click on it.  Remember to upload the file with WAV extension; that is to say look for the circled  icon, as shown in the following screenshot:  4.  Click on Open  Upload this file  Insert. 5.  Click on Save and return to course.   121   Working with Audio, Sound, Music, and Podcasts  6.  Click on the activity. It looks as shown in the following screenshot:  7.  When students click on the name of the file, they will see the following media player   toolbar, as shown in the following screenshot:  8.  When students click on Play, they will listen to what we have recorded.  See also   f Creating and embedding a podcast  122   Chapter 5  Creating and embedding a podcast In the previous recipe, we learnt how to record ourselves using Audacity  without pausing the  recording . If we want to create a podcast for our Moodle course, we can not only record our  voice, but also add some music or sound to it in order to enhance it. This is what this task   is about.  Getting ready Combine recordings of people speaking in their native English after describing its  characteristics, ask for help from a Linguistic or Phonetics teacher. You can add this element  if you happen to have it recorded. You can also add some sounds, for example for the  presentation and ending of the podcast as well.  How to do it... We will work with the Audacity software, which is used in the previous recipe. We can record  ourselves as we did before, and convert some parts of tapes, CDs, and MP3 files where we  can find the different types of English spoken around the world such as RP English, Creole,  Caribbean English, American English among others. Always bear in mind the copyright issues  of the material to be recorded. To design the podcast, follow these steps:  1.  Start Audacity. 2.  Click on the Record button within the Audio Control and Editing Toolbars in order   to record your voice.  3.  Click on the Stop button before inserting the extra material to enhance the podcast. 4.  Click on File  Import  Audio  select the file, and click on Open.  123   Working with Audio, Sound, Music, and Podcasts  5.  Two waveforms appear in separate audio track portions within the Project view. Click  on the second waveform and move the Selection boundary from the beginning to the  end in order to select it, as shown in the following screenshot:  6.  Click on Edit  Cut  another option is the keys Ctrl + X . 7.  Place the cursor at the end of the waveform in the first Project view and click  on Edit  Paste  another option is the keys Ctrl + V . It looks as shown in the  following screenshot:  124   Chapter 5  8.  Click on File  Save Project as and write a name for the project. 9.  Click on File  Export to save the file as WAV type so that you can embed the podcast   in the Moodle course.  10.  Click on Save  OK. 11.  You can repeat steps 2 to 7 as many times as you want if you want to go on recording   your voice or add extra audio files.   How it works... When we upload this podcast to our Moodle course, we can listen to it without pauses  because we have just created a podcast that was combined with another source of audio,  sound, or music. That is to say that we have learnt how to cope with different sounds in order  to design one recording. Those parts of the songs, sounds, or just phrases that we want our  students to listen to can be shared when designing a podcast for any activity.  This is a great tool suitable for any subject. Thus, the combination of sounds, music, and  audio make our podcast less dull and more appealing through the variety of content. It can  sometimes be boring to listen to the same person speaking all the time.  See also   f Recording audio using a microphone  Creating MP3 files from diverse audio formats It is because of the MP3 that it is one of the most amazing phenomena that enables us to  create files smaller in size without putting aside sound quality of different audio sources.   So, we focus on creating this type of file in this chapter. The MP3 format for digital audio has  an enormous impact on people collecting, listening, and distributing different sources of   audio recordings.  Getting ready The MP3 format is a compression system for music. Thus, the aim of the recipe is to create  this type of file in order to make it possible to store several audio sources in different  recordings that we want to upload to our Moodle courses.  The MP3 format is a lossy compression system, that is to say that there are certain sounds  that we cannot hear, or we hear certain sounds better than others; especially when  two sounds are playing simultaneously, we can hear the louder one. Thus, this type of  compression eliminates what we cannot hear properly. In order to create this type of file,   use Audacity.  125   Working with Audio, Sound, Music, and Podcasts  How to do it... We have already used Audacity in the previous recipes. Therefore, we are getting familiar with  the said software. In this recipe, we will create MP3 files from diverse audio formats. Create  an activity in which students can listen to Caribbean English. These are the steps to follow:  1.  Start Audacity. 2.  Click on File  Import  Audio , browse for the file that you want to open, and click   3.  Click on File  Export. A pop-up window appears. Choose MP3 Files, as shown in the   on it  Open.  following screenshot:  4.  Click on Save. 5.  There appears a pop-up window in which you can complete the following information   about the recording, as shown in the following screenshot:  126   6.  Click OK.  How it works... We have just converted an audio file to MP3. Combine different audio sources and create  one podcast. The recipes in this chapter are designed in such a way that they are linked to  one another, therefore, follow these three recipes and create a wonderful podcast in an MP3  format because it is smaller in size. In the following screenshot, compare the same file saved  in different formats, and pay attention to the size in both cases. The screenshot on the left is  a .WAV and the one on the right is an MP3 file:  Chapter 5  127   Working with Audio, Sound, Music, and Podcasts  Upload it to our Moodle course as we have already done so before. Just click on the  Moodle Media icon and upload the file as we did in the first recipe.   See also   f Recording audio from a microphone  f Creating and embedding a podcast  Embedding free sound available on the Web It is time we paid attention to the free sound available on the Web that can be useful to  enhance our podcasts. A useful website where you can find a wide variety of sound is  http:  www.freesound.org . The Freesound Project website offers sound with a  Creative Commons License. It only contains sound; you won't find any songs because   most of them are protected by copyright.  Getting ready Visit the aforementioned website and click on Join because it is necessary to register in  order to download its files. Both the registration and access to its content are free of cost.  Therefore, on the left-hand margin, click on Join   Register and complete the necessary  information. Bear in mind that this website does not work with Hotmail accounts because of  problems with the said service. Therefore, log in with another e-mail provider, for example  Gmail or Yahoo!. This information is shown in the following screenshot:  How to do it... Search for files to work with, find some sounds related to some countries or sounds of the  nature and mention where we can find them. We can accept a great variety of answers, or  just design a guessing activity with sound clues. Thus, focus on one country and add as many  sounds as possible for students to guess which country we are describing through the sound.  Follow these steps to find some sound files:  1.  Click on Search under Search   Browse on the left-hand margin.  128   2.  Activate the Filenames checkbox so that the website searches for the filenames of its   sound files database.  3.  Enter the sound that you want to look for and click on Submit. 4.  Click the Play button and listen to the recorded sound, as shown in the   following screenshot:  Chapter 5  5.  After listening to the results, click on the file that suits you. A new page with more   detailed information appears, as shown in the following screenshot:  129   Working with Audio, Sound, Music, and Podcasts  6.  After checking the license information of the chosen file, right-click on the   Download icon. The context menu appears; click on Save Target As, as shown  in the following screenshot:  7.  Name and save the file. 8.   If you want to download other sounds, repeat steps 1-7.  How it works... We can enhance any type of activity using sound. In this case, add a Chat to our course in  which students are to discuss which country we are describing through the sounds. Upload  it to our Moodle course, as we have already done so before. Just click on the Moodle Media  icon and upload the file as we did in the first recipe.  If we want to create a podcast in which we combine the sounds that we have downloaded with  our voice, we can do it using Audacity software, as we did in the previous recipes. In the case  that the file that we have chosen in the previous website is not an .mp3, we can convert it as  we did in the previous recipe using Audacity as well.  See also   f Recording audio using a microphone  f Creating and embedding a podcast  f Creating MP3 files from diverse audio formats  Working with MIDI music The digitalization of the sound is not the only function of a sound card; it also has the ability to  produce sounds electronically through a synthesizer incorporated in the card compatible with  MIDI  Musical Instruments Digital Interface  files. MIDI files have instructions that indicate  to the sound card synthesizer the musical note, intervals, the musical instrument among other  features that it will use so that the synthesizer generates the corresponding sound.  130   Chapter 5  In this way, the size of a file that has a complete note reading as MIDI files is a thousand times  smaller than a file that contains the digitalized note reading. Furthermore, its modifications  are easier in MIDI files. Games among other multimedia applications use MIDI in order to  reproduce their melodies.  We can connect a piano keyboard if the sound card supports MIDI to transmit commands to  the MIDI port  the same used for the old-fashioned joystick . We have to bear in mind that we  can connect some keyboards to a USB port, instead of using the MIDI port.  Getting ready We can find MIDI files at the following website: http:  mididb.com . You can search for  the music that you need to design your activity.  How to do it...  You can find several MIDI files in this website by clicking on the upper ribbon. Therefore, we  will search for National Anthems of English-speaking countries around the world in order to  use these files to create the activity in our Moodle course:  1.  Visit the http:  mididb.com  website. 2.  Click on Themes  National Anthems on the upper ribbon. 3.  Choose the Anthem that you want to upload. Right-click on it and choose Save Link   As…, as shown in the following screenshot:  4.  Click on Save. You can save other MIDI files following steps 2-4.  How it works... Create an activity in which students listen to different Anthems of different English-speaking  countries. Afterwards, they have to complete a chart adding more information about each of  those countries. Therefore, to add this activity, follow these steps:  1.  Click on Add an activity  Upload a single file within Assignments. 2.  Complete the Assignment Name and Description blocks.  131   Working with Audio, Sound, Music, and Podcasts  3.  Click on the Moodle Media icon  Find or upload a sound, video or applet…    Upload a file  Browse . Look for the MIDI file that you want to upload and click  on it.  4.  Click on Open  Upload this file  Insert. 5.  Click on Save and return to course. Click on the activity. It looks as shown in the   following screenshot:  See also   f Editing MIDI files  Editing MIDI files In the previous recipe, we found MIDI files available on the Web. Therefore, it is time to edit  them. So, search in the previous website for files to edit or we can find them in TuxGuitar   http:  tuxguitar.com.ar   with which we will work. Choose to edit any song, but bear  in mind the copyright issues.  Getting ready We will edit MIDI files using the software that we have mentioned before. Therefore, download  the software at http:  tuxguitar.com.ar download.html. This software supports  several OS, so choose yours accordingly. TuxGuitar is a multitrack tablature editor and player;  using it, we can compose music. Some of its features are tablature editor, score viewer,  multitrack display, among others.  132   How to do it... Run the said software. A pop-up window appears where you can click in order to join the  TuxGuitar community, as shown in the following screenshot:  Chapter 5  Go back to the said software and follow these steps in order to edit MIDI files:  1.  Click on File  Import  Import MiDi, as shown in the following screenshot:  2.  Search for the MIDI file that you want to edit. Click on the file  Open  OK.  133   Working with Audio, Sound, Music, and Podcasts  3.  When you open the file, it looks as shown in the following screenshot:  4.  The reading notes appear, and when you click on the instrument you can see it in the   underneath part.  5.  You can edit the MIDI file, clicking on the notes that appear on the upper ribbon and   add them to the existing one, as shown in the following screenshot:  134   6.  Click on View, and within that option you can choose from a range of options to   show different tools. To show   display tools  in pop-up windows , tick any all of the  following: Show Mixer, Show Player, Show Fretboard, Show Piano, Show Matrix. All  are shown in the following screenshot:  Chapter 5  7.  When you are done, save the file. Click on File  Save as and write a name for the   edited MIDI.  135   Working with Audio, Sound, Music, and Podcasts  How it works... Before uploading it to Moodle, listen to it in order to check what we have just done!  Afterwards, choose the weekly outline section where you want to add the activity or the  resource, and upload the file, as done in the previous recipes.  It would be advisable that students install TuxGuitar because when we save the changes to  the MIDI files, they appear with the extension of the said software otherwise, they will not be  able to open the file.  Allowing students to record audio This is a very simple recipe that can be carried out using Moodle assignments; that is to say  through uploading files. It means that students are going to record themselves and we can  listen to them through the file that they upload. We can set guidelines as we do when writing,  with respect to their speaking.  Getting ready It is time for our students to take a deep breath and talk. Therefore, clearly mention what we  want to hear from them. Ask students to talk about the type of English they speak according  to what they have heard before in the podcasts that we have created.  How to do it... Students can record themselves using either devices such as their mobile phones or the  Audacity software for creating podcasts. We should ask them to upload .mp3 files, as well  as other important guidelines such as time and information. Follow these steps to design   the activity:  1.  Click on Add an activity  Upload a single file within Assignments. 2.  Complete the Assignment name and Description blocks. Set the guidelines clearly   so that students know what they have to record.  136   3.   In the Maximum size within the Upload a single file block, choose 16MB, as shown  in the following screenshot:  Chapter 5  4.  Click on Save and return to course.  137   Working with Audio, Sound, Music, and Podcasts  How it works... When students submit their answers and we click on the file that they have uploaded in order  to grade them, just click on it and listen. The file created by the students appears as shown in  the following screenshot:  138   6  Creating and Integrating  Screencasts and Videos  In this chapter, we will cover:   f Creating a screencast  f Enhancing a screencast with annotations  f Embedding a YouTube video  f Embedding a Dailymotion video  f Recording a video  f Editing a video  f Creating a playlist  f Enhancing a video with comments  Introduction This chapter explains how to create screencasts and edit them, as well as link and embed  videos for our Moodle courses. The recipes use diverse free and open source multi-platform  tools to record, edit, and convert the different video files, covering the most common  scenarios for multimedia Moodle activities.  Besides, Moodle 2.0 offers new features, which make it easier to insert videos, especially  from the http:  www.youtube.com website. You can find them easily from the file picker,  provided you have administrative access to the course. You have to bear in mind that you  need to be an administrator in order to enable this option.   Creating and Integrating Screencasts and Videos  It covers different ways to create and interact using either screencasts or videos. We will work  with several multimedia assets, which will concern the baseline topic of Wildlife. This topic has  many resources, which can be integrated with screencasts and videos available on the Web.  Creating screencasts using several free and open source software available on the Web is one  of the main goals of this chapter. There is plenty of commercial software, which can be used  to create screencasts. We will not focus on them though. We add some special features to the  screencasts in order to enhance them.  Videos can be recorded in several ways. You may use your cell phone, camera, or the webcam  of your computer. We are to focus on the way of creating them and uploading into our Moodle  course. We can also use a recorded video from YouTube and upload it directly from the file  picker in Moodle 2.0.  You can also design a playlist in order to combine several videos and let your students watch  them in a row. We do it by creating an account in YouTube. The channel in YouTube can be  either public or private; it depends on how we want to carry it out.  You can create some screencasts in order to present information to your students instead of  showing presentations made using Open Office, PowerPoint, or Microsoft Word. Changing any  of these into a screencast is more appealing to the students and not such a difficult task to  carry out either.  We can create an explanation by recording our voice, for which we will create a virtual board  that we can choose to be visible to the audience; in the second case, our explanations can  only be heard with no visualization. This is quite an important aspect to be taken into account,  especially in teaching because students need a dynamic explanation by their teacher.  There are several software available that can be used to create screencasts. One of them is  Cam Studio. This software captures AVI files and it is open source. It captures onscreen video  and audio. Its disadvantage is that only Windows users can use it. You can download it from  http:  camstudio.com .   It is time for Mac users. There is also a free program for Mac users that focuses on   making quick films by saving the recorded video to get a quick access. It does not record  audio. This is Copernicus and you can download it from http:  danicsoft.com  software copernicus .  140   Chapter 6  We need a tool for both Mac and Windows, which is free and open source as well. So,  JingProject.com is the software. It does not only record video, but also allows you to take a  picture, draw, or add a message on it, and upload the media to a free hosting account. A URL  is provided in order to watch the video or the image. You can download it from the following   website: http:  www.techsmith.com download jing .  Screencast-o-matic is another tool that is based on Java that does not need to be downloaded  at all. It allows you to upload in an automatic way. It works well with both Mac and Windows  machines. You can use this at http:  www.screencast-o-matic.com . This is the tool  that we are to work with in the creation of a screencast.  We may also modify the videos to make them suitable for learning. We can add annotations in  different ways so as to interact through the video with our students. That is to say, we add our  comments instead of adding our voice so that students read what we need to tell them.  Creating a screencast In this recipe, we create a screencast and upload it to our Moodle course. The baseline  topic is Wildlife. Therefore, in this recipe, we will explain to our students where wild animals  are located. We can paste in a world map of the different animals, while we add extra data  through the audio files. Thus, we can also add more information using different types of  images that are inserted in the map.  Getting ready Before creating the screencast, plan the whole sequence of the explanation that we want   to show to our students, therefore, we will use a very useful Java applet available at  http:  www.screencast-o-matic.com .  Screencast-o-matic requires the free Java Run-time Environment  also known as JRE  for both  the teacher and the students' computers. You can download and install its latest version from  http:  java.sun.com.  How to do it... First of all, design the background scene of the screencast to work with. Afterwards, enter   the website http:  www.screencast-o-matic.com . Follow these to create  the screencast:  1.  Click on Start recording.  141   Creating and Integrating Screencasts and Videos  2.

Click on the activity; it looks as shown in the   following screenshot:  153   Creating and Integrating Screencasts and Videos Recording a video In this recipe, we will record a video. In this case, we record a visit to the zoo because, in  this chapter, we deal with wildlife. Therefore, we may have a video from a visit to the zoo,   or any park that we might have once visited. Thus, in this case, a mobile camera will be the  most suitable.   How to do it... Use a 720p HD video. It is a video from a visit to a national park in which we can find several  wild animals. In order to watch the video on our computer, we need to have installed VLC  Media Player. We have already used it in the previous recipe. This software will allow us to  watch the video that we have just recorded and its properties. Follow these steps to record   a video and save it in your computer:  1.  Record the video. 2.  Connect the video recorder to the computer. Click on Open the folder to view files. 3.  Select the video that you want to watch. Right-click on the video. Click on Copy. 4.

It looks as shown in the   following screenshot:  See also   f Creating a screencast  155   Creating and Integrating Screencasts and Videos Editing a video In order to edit a video, we will use VLMC. We can either cut the video or enlarge it using  another one. Therefore, in this recipe we work on both of these items. We will remove a part  of the video that we recorded and we enlarge it using another video. That is to say, we can  combine two or more videos for our students; we can use a video from the Web and combine  it with another of our creation.  Getting ready In this recipe, we will edit a video using VLMC. We can edit the video that we have just  recorded or choose any other video. Therefore, we need to download the software at   http:  trac.videolan.org vlmc. This software runs with Windows, Linux, and Mac OS.  How to do it... Click on the VLMC icon and run it. Follow these steps to edit this video:  1.  Click on File  Import  and browse for the video to edit. 2.

You can either use the parts of   the same video or you can import another one.  10.  When you finish the editing, save the file.  How it works... After we have edited our video, we can upload it to our Moodle course. Before uploading it  to Moodle, we can watch it using VLC Media Player. Afterwards, choose the weekly outline  section where you want to add the activity or the resource, and we can upload the video   to our Moodle course, as we have already done in the previous recipes.  Creating a playlist We can create a playlist so that instead of showing one video to our students, we can show  them several videos. It is not very difficult to do, but in order to create a playlist, we do need   to take a previous step: create an account on YouTube.  Getting ready Enter YouTube. Click on the Create Account icon and complete the necessary information, as  shown in the following screenshot:  158   How to do it... After filling all the information in the last screenshot, and reading all the terms and conditions,  click on the I accept icon and then follow these steps:  1.  Write a password in order to sign in to your account. Then, click on Sign in, as shown   in the following screenshot:  Chapter 6  159   Creating and Integrating Screencasts and Videos  2.  When you are signed in, click on Browse  complete the Search block with the items   that you need to look for, for instance National Geographic Channel wild animals. 3.  You can choose a video to upload in our channel. Click on the downwards arrow in   your user's name and choose My Videos.  4.  On the left-hand margin, there appears Playlist + New. Click on + New, and complete   the pop-up window that appears, as shown in the following screenshot:  5.  Click on the downwards arrow in the Add videos to playlist block. There will appear   the history of videos that you have watched, therefore, if you want to add them   to our playlist, click on Add, as shown in the following screenshot:  160   6.  The videos added are shown on the left.  How it works... We have already created a playlist. When we want to watch the playlist of videos, they are  displayed one after the other. Thus, enter your channel and click on the name of the playlist  that we have just created. Click on Play all, and all the videos will be played. The videos  belonging to the playlist are displayed underneath the video being broadcast in the playlist  bar. The playlist bar allows the viewer to browse through videos without leaving the watch  page, as shown in the following screenshot:  Chapter 6  161   Creating and Integrating Screencasts and Videos  If you want to Turn autoplay off or Shuffle videos, click on the following icons in the  playlist bar:  There's more Embed the playlist in our Moodle course. We would like our students to watch the videos  in a row. In order to design this type of resource, we have to copy the embedding code of   the playlist.  Uploading a playlist in Moodle In order to get the embedding code of the playlist, click on the name of the playlist that we  have created and follow these steps:  1.  Click on Play all. 2.  Click on Options  More information about this playlist, as shown in the   following screenshot:  162   3.

Thus, the playlist looks as shown in the  following screenshot:  Enhancing a video with comments We can also enhance videos that we want our students to watch with comments. For that  reason, we need to again use the channel that we have created on YouTube. We upload the  video that we have edited to our account and we enhance it with comments in our account.  163   Creating and Integrating Screencasts and Videos  Getting ready First of all, we need to choose the video to which we will add comments, and we have to think  about the information that we want to add to it. Therefore, as previously mentioned, we can  add comments to the video that we had edited before.  How to do it... Follow these steps to upload a video:  1.  Click on Upload  on the top margin   Upload a video  on the left-hand margin . 2.  Browse for the video that you want to upload and click on Open. 3.  You can publish the video as either Public or Private. Therefore, click on the ring   button that you desire. Click on Save changes.  4.  Click on the downwards arrow within your user's name block and choose My Videos. 5.  All the videos that have been uploaded in the account will appear. Next to the video to  which comments are to be added, click on the downwards arrow in the Insight block,  as shown in the following screenshot:  6.  Click on Annotations, as shown in the previous screenshot. 7.  Within Annotations, you can choose to add them among these options: Speech   bubble, Note, Title, Spotlight, or Pause, as shown in the following screenshot:  164   9.  You can choose when to add the annotations and the type. After inserting the  annotations, click on Save  Publish, as shown in the following screenshot:  Chapter 6  165   Creating and Integrating Screencasts and Videos  10.  You can choose the font color, font size, or background color among other options. 11.  You can also change the time period in which the annotation appears, as well as   including videos, playlists, and channels among other options.  How it works... When playing the video, we can read the annotations written in the video. They will be  displayed as we have designed them. We can upload the said video to our Moodle course  copying the embedding code, as shown in the following screenshot:  There are also other options available to share this video, such as e-mailing, copying the link,  or even using social networks, as shown in the previous screenshot.  166   7  Working with  Bitmap Images and  Photographs  In this chapter, we will cover:   f Selecting between lossy and lossless compression schemes  f Creating animated graphics  f Resizing photos to their appropriate size  f Adding hotspots to photos  f Editing color curves  f Adding effects and applying filters  f Uploading image filters to Moodle  f Linking external image files  Introduction This chapter explains how to work with different types of bitmap image file formats that use  lossless and lossy compression schemes. The recipes use diverse tools to edit, enhance, and  convert the different image files, covering most scenarios for multimedia Moodle activities  that deal with Arts and Photography as a base topic.  Animated graphics are a very important asset to take into account if we want to enhance the  look of our Moodle course. We will learn how to create and insert them in Moodle. Activities  are much more appealing and engaging with these types of graphics. Thus, we work with a  website where we can design them.   Working with Bitmap Images and Photographs  Adding elements to the graphics is also an interesting point to take into account when designing  an interesting course. We learn how to add hotspots and effects to photos, and apply filters.  After reading this chapter, we will learn how to link, edit, and embed bitmap images and  photographs. We will also be able to resize and convert them to the most appropriate formats  for Moodle courses. The recipes are designed in such a way that they are all combined.  When thinking of art or photography, we may have the idea of a painter or a photographer in  mind, though people who work for these fields may have related jobs such as designing logos  for companies or taking pictures for magazines.  Students could upload their images of drawings or design logos for a drawing competition. For  instance, some schools happen to be divided into houses that run inter-house competitions.  We could design activities in which students vote for the logo of their house or the diagram   of the flag.  These were some possibilities for creating social interaction among students using bitmap  images and photographs. We are going to learn the best way to upload them to our Moodle  course according to what we want to design. Moreover, you can design activities in which  you use famous works of art from well-known artists from different times in order to broaden  the culture of your students. Additionally, you could interact with a History or Art teacher and  develop the understanding of a painting or picture taken at a certain time and explore the  history of that period.  Selecting between lossy and lossless   compression schemes When we save a bitmap image, we can choose between lossy and lossless compression  schemes to reduce the file size that stores the color information for each pixel that is  composed in the bitmap image.  Lossless compression schemes retain all the original color information; and therefore,  they keep the original quality, but they produce a large file size. On the other hand, lossy  compression schemes replace some color information with approximated values to produce   a smaller file size. Thus, lossy compression schemes don't keep the original quality.  In this recipe, we will learn how to choose between one scheme over the other. However,   a smaller size is not the only thing that matters!  Getting ready Capture an image of the map of the Louvre Museum in France in order to use it in our Moodle  course. In this case, we contrast both lossy and lossless compression with this map. Save  them as .PNG, not as .JPG, because the resolution of a .JPG image is low and is not  convenient to work with.   168   Chapter 7  How to do it... Enter http:  maps.google.com  and capture the image of the location of the Louvre  Museum in France. We have already covered maps in Chapter 2, Working with 2D and 3D  Maps. We are going to use GIMP. If you do not have it yet, download and install GIMP 2.6.8   http:  www.gimp.org downloads  . Therefore, these are the steps to follow:  1.  Enter http:  maps.google.com  and look for the location of the Louvre Museum   in France. You may look for another museum or art gallery if you wish. 2.  Press the Print Screen key when you find the location of the museum. 3.  Paste the image in GIMP. Click on Rectangle Select Tool: Select a rectangular  region R and choose the part of the map where the museum is located  you do  not need the whole map, as shown in a later screenshot :  4.  Click on Edit  Cut and paste the new image in a new document. In fact,   you are going to work with two documents. Save the same image with two   different extensions.  How it works... We are going to compare the two files. The image is the same: the part of the map that shows  the location of the Louvre Museum in France. What we change is the extension, the type of  the image file. We compare the two pictures and they will show that lossless compression  is used when it is important that the original and the decompressed bitmap image or  photograph be identical. PNG only uses lossless compression.  169   Working with Bitmap Images and Photographs  Remember that we are still working with GIMP. Follow these steps in order to compare  both images:  1.  Click on File  Save as …. 2.  Complete the Name field. Type "Louvre_Lossy". 3.  Click on the downwards arrow in All images at the bottom of the pop-up window  and choose JPEG image. The image is blurry and pixilated. If you happen to see  them in color, they tend to fade away. The more you enlarge the .JPG image, the  blurrier it gets. Pixels with different colors that add noise to the image delete color  information and replace it with pixels of approximated values. This is shown in the  following screenshot:  4.   It is time to see how .PNG works. This type of image is lossless compression. Follow  steps 1 – 3. The difference is that in the Name field, type "Louvre_Lossless" and  make sure the extension is PNG image.  170   5.  The image will be clearer and of a better quality than the previous one. It is shown in   the following screenshot:  Chapter 7  See also   f Chapter 2, Working with 2D and 3D Maps  f Uploading images to Moodle  Creating animated graphics We are going to create animated graphics in order to make our course more appealing. Create  different types of animations according to the activity that we want to design. Considering the  fact that we are dealing with art and photographs, we can create an animated gif about the  way a painting was made, or how a place changes in the different seasons and how it looks   in different pictures.  171   Working with Bitmap Images and Photographs  Getting ready Design the animated graphics using the available tools online or using free and open source  software. It is very simple, even simpler than its name itself. First of all, bear in mind which  pictures you want to insert because neither the software nor the website will add special  effects to the pictures to be uploaded.  How to do it... In this recipe, we will work with a website that creates the animated gif. We work with  photographs showing different sceneries after selecting the images or photographs to upload.  Follow these steps to create the animated graphics:  1.  Enter the http:  picasion.com  website. 2.  Click on Browse and choose the image that you want to upload. 3.  Repeat step 2 multiple times. To add more images, click on Add one more picture   as many times as required, as shown in the following screenshot:  4.  Choose the size of the animated graphic. Click on the downwards arrow in the    5.  Choose the speed of the animated graphic. Click on the downwards arrow in the   Size block.  Speed block.  172   6.  Click on Create animation. 7.  The animated graphic that you have just created will be displayed. Copy the HTML  code for blog website in order to embed it or click on Save this animation to your  computer, as shown in the following screenshot:  Chapter 7  173   Working with Bitmap Images and Photographs  How it works... We have just created some animated graphics. The following screenshot shows the four  frames with images that compose the animated gif:  Open the animated gif with GIMP that we have already used in the previous recipe. You can  see the different animations as layers, as shown in the following screenshot:  174   Chapter 7  See also   f Uploading images to Moodle  Resizing photos to their appropriate size When working with pictures taken by modern digital cameras, we usually have higher  dimensions on the screen. Your Moodle course displays data on the web browser and the   web browser usually does not take advantage of the whole screen size. Technology offers  devices with different screens; therefore, consider them when dealing with mobile and   special devices.  Getting ready As previously mentioned, there are different screen sizes so the target will be different. Full  HD is 1920 x 1080, though it does not fit all the devices, so we will work with 1000 x width  and 700 x height as the maximum size of the images.  How to do it... It is typical that pictures usually have more than 3000 pixels width and 2400 height. We do  not want to upload such a huge image to our Moodle course. Thus, we need to resize the  photograph to the appropriate height and width values. The larger the image dimensions are,  the larger the file sizes are. We will work with GIMP in this recipe too. Therefore, follow these  steps in order to resize the image:  1.  Click on File  Open and browse for the picture to work with. 2.  Click on Save a copy because you can make a mistake and delete the original image. 3.  Write a name for the image and click on Save twice. 4.  Click on Image  Scale Image. Change the aspect ratio. The aspect ratio is the   proportion between width and height. You want the same image with fewer pixels.  5.  Write 1000 in Width within Image Size, and Height will automatically change to 750.   The aspect ratio is calculated automatically.  175   Working with Bitmap Images and Photographs  6.  Click on Scale, as shown in the following screenshot:  How it works... We have resized the image, the result of the new resolution 1000 x 750 pixels. If you want a  full screen image, check how it looks when you upload it to the Moodle course. You have to  save the new image in order to be able to upload it, resized, in our Moodle course. Therefore,  click on File  Save. Remember that we have saved a copy of the original image previously.  The image looks as shown in the following screenshot:  176   Chapter 7  See also   f Selecting between lossy and lossless compression schemes  f Uploading images to Moodle  Adding hotspots to photos In this recipe, we are going to work with photos and add hotspots to them. We use GIMP in  order to create them. In Chapter 3, Working with Different Types of Interactive Charts, we had  created hotspots using a website. In this chapter, we will create them using this free and open  source software.  Getting ready Choose a photo and think of the links that you want to add to it. A good idea related to Art is  to choose some famous paintings and add hotspots related to the painter who did them and  their biography.  How to do it... It would be a good idea to resize the image before adding hotspots to it, especially if we are  dealing with a photo. Follow these steps in order to add hotspots to the image:  1.  Click on File  Open. Choose the photo to work with. 2.  Click on Filters  Web  Image map. The editor block appears and you can add   the hotspots.  177   Working with Bitmap Images and Photographs  3.  Click on the left-hand margin to choose a shape to map the image. Circle a part of   the image to add hotspots. Another pop-up window will appear. Unclick the Relative  link block. Complete the blocks marked with the links that you want to display, as  shown in the following screenshot:  4.  Click on Apply  OK. 5.  The links appear on the right panel. 6.  Save the file as .map. Click on File  Save and the extension .map will appear   automatically. Click on Save.  7.  You can add as many hotspots to the photo as you want. If so, repeat steps 2 – 4 as   many times as hotspots you want to add.  8.  When you finish adding hotspots, click on File  Save. 9.  Click on View  Source. A pop-up window displaying the HTML code will appear, as   shown in the following screenshot:  178   Chapter 7  How it works... We have just added a hotspot to the photo. Our photo will not be an ordinary one; when  hovering the mouse over the selected area, we will be able to click, and the website that we  have selected will appear.   It is time to upload the image to our Moodle course. Therefore, choose the weekly outline  section where you want to add the activity and upload the image to the Edit summary section.  These are the steps that you have to follow:  1.  Click on the Edit summary icon in the week that you want to upload the image. 2.   If you want to complete the Section name block, untick the Use default section  name box. In the Summary block, click on the Insert edit image icon. Click on Find or upload  an image  Upload a file  Browse and look for the photo that you want to upload.  3.   4.  Click on Upload this file. 5.  Complete the Image description block. Click on Insert. 6.  Click on the HTML icon. 7.  This is the original HTML code you will see:   <img alt="hotspots" src="http:  localhost draftfile.php 13  user draft 765594482 Hotspots.JPG" width="1000" height="750"  ><  p>  8.   Insert the following code before  >: usemap="map" border="0"  9.  The code will read as follows:   <img alt="hotspots" src="http:  localhost draftfile.php 13  user draft 765594482 Hotspots.JPG" width="1000" height="750"  usemap="map" border="0" >   10.  Now, insert a new line after the last line and paste the code from GIMP's map source:              <area shape="circle" coords="57,241,124" alt="Packt Publishing  Author" target="Vanesa S. Olsen" href="http:  www.packtpub.com  authors profiles vanesa-olsen%20"  >    179   Working with Bitmap Images and Photographs  11.  Do not copy the code of the image because you have already uploaded the image   into our Moodle course. It was the first step! The final code is:  <img alt="hotspots" src="http:  localhost draftfile.php 13  user draft 803924560 Hotspots.JPG" usemap="map" border="0"  width="1000" height="750"  >        <!--  $-:GIMP Image Map plug-in by Maurits Rijk --> <!-- $-:Please do  not edit lines starting with "$" -->   <!--  $AUTHOR:Silvina --> <area shape="circle" coords="57,241,124" alt="Packt Publishing  Author" target="Vanesa S.

Click on Save changes.  180   When hovering the mouse over the image, you will be able to click on the selected image and  the website that we have inserted will appear, as shown in the following screenshot:  Chapter 7  See also   f Resizing photos to their appropriate size  Editing color curves We are going to change the color in our pictures. In this recipe, it would be a good idea to work  with the art of your students or with a well-known painting as well, for example to add light or  dark to a picture in order to change the perceived time of day.  Getting ready Choose a photo or a painting for which we want to change its color. We add a bit of our art in  order to alter the image. It is a very simple recipe. So, let's see how to do it!  181   Working with Bitmap Images and Photographs  How to do it... After choosing the photo or painting, run GIMP. Follow these steps in order to edit   color curves:  1.  Click on File  Open and browse for the picture that you are going to work with. 2.  Click on Colors  Curves. A pop-up window will appear displaying the curves that you   can change.  3.  Move the linear histogram to make the image darker or lighter. 4.  You can also work with individual channels, that is to say add a value and increase  one of the colors shown in the following screenshot. Add green value because the  picture shows vegetation. Click on the downwards arrow in Value  Green, as shown  in this screenshot:  5.  When you have finished adjusting color curves, click on OK. 6.  Save the changes to the photo. Click on File  Save  Save.  How it works... It is time to see how these curves work on a photo. Therefore, compare the same photo before  and after adjusting color curves to it. The following screenshot spots the differences in color.  The graph in the right-hand margin shows how we applied the color curve:  182   Chapter 7  See also   f Selecting between lossy and lossless compression schemes  f Resizing photos to their appropriate size  f Uploading an image to Moodle  Adding effects and applying filters In this recipe, we continue working with GIMP. We apply different effects and filters to the  photographs. We can also work with paintings from our own students or famous painters as  well. However, in this case, we will deal with photos that we have done in the previous recipes.  Getting ready First of all, choose the pictures that we want to work with. They can be personal pictures, like  the ones that I chose previously, or work with photos from the Internet, but bear in mind the  copyright issues. Let's change our photos.  How to do it... Run GIMP and choose a photo to work in our Moodle course. The sort of effects that we could  apply depends on the type of activity that is to be designed. These are the steps to follow:  1.  Open the file that you are going to work with. Click on File  Open and browse for   the photo.  2.  Click on Filters  Artistic  Apply canvas. 3.  There appears the Apply Canvas pop-up window.  183   Working with Bitmap Images and Photographs  4.  Choose the Depth of the canvas; it is circled in the screenshot. You can change the   Depth from 1 to 50 by clicking on the arrows, as shown inside the square in the  following screenshot:  5.  Preview is ticked in the previous screenshot; therefore, if you click on the four point's   arrow, which is not seen in the screenshot but pointed with an arrow, you have the  preview of the canvassed photo.  6.  When you agree with the changes, click OK.  7.  Now the photo has the appearance of a canvas. Save the file. Click on    File  Save Save.  How it works... We are going to compare both photos before and after applying the canvas effect. We have  worked with a picture of a scenery—the same used in the previous recipe. It would also be a  great idea to work with a picture of the face of a person to change that photo into a portrait.  So, let's compare the before and after applying the effect. The screenshot shows the photo   on the left and the canvas on the right:  184   Chapter 7  185  There's more We can also apply other effects on the photos. For example, add the photocopy effect, or  change a new picture into an old photo or combine a film strip. Exploring GIMP alternatives  to the changes that we can apply to a photo can take a whole chapter of the book, but this is  not the aim. The appropriate effect should be selected in relation to the design and or aim of  each activity. Let's explore one more alternative.  Applying an old photo effect to a photo We are going to work with the old photo effect. In this case, we will work with the picture of  two little children. Follow these steps:  1.  Click on File  Open and browse for the picture that you want to work with. 2.  Save the photo with a new name. Click on File  Save as and write a new name for   the photo.   Working with Bitmap Images and Photographs  3.  Click on Filters  Decor  Old Photo, as shown in the following screenshot:  4.  There will appear a pop-up window and you may add the changes to the way you want   the photo effect, as shown in the following screenshot:  186   5.  Click on OK. The following screenshot shows the same photo before on the left and   after on the right:  Chapter 7  See also   f Selecting between lossy and lossless compression schemes  f Resizing photos to their appropriate size  f Uploading images to Moodle  Uploading images to Moodle In the previous recipes, we have worked with different types of images, but we have not  designed activities with them. The aim of this chapter is to work with images and photographs,  so it is time to upload them into our Moodle course.  Getting ready We are working with art and photographs in this chapter, so we have to design an activity to  cope with the previous bitmaps and photographs. Add a map of the Louvre museum to an  HTML block in the Moodle course.  We have saved the same image in both formats: .PNG and .JPG. We will insert .PNG in our  Moodle course because we have already learnt the difference in quality. When hovering the  mouse over the said image, we can click and enter the official website of the Louvre Museum  because we are linking the said image with a website.  187   Working with Bitmap Images and Photographs  How to do it... Enter our Moodle course and follow these steps:  1.  Click on the downwards arrow in Add… within the block of Add a block. 2.  Choose HTML. When the new block appears, click on the Configuration icon. 3.  Complete the Block title, as shown in the following screenshot:  4.   In the Content block, click on the Insert Edit image icon  Find or upload an image   Upload a file  Browse  you are going to choose the .PNG file .  5.  Select the image and click on Open  Upload this file. 6.  Complete the Description block. 7.  Click on Appearance, on the top margin. 8.  Click on the downwards arrow in Alignment and choose Middle. 9.  Within Dimensions, write 200 x 200 px. 10.  Click on Insert.  188   11.  Click on the image and click on the Insert Edit link icon, as shown in the   following screenshot:  Chapter 7  12. Complete the block and make a link to the following website: http:  www.louvre.  fr llv commun home.jsp?bmLocale=en.  13.  Click on Save changes.  How it works... We have just uploaded the image of the Louvre Museum that we created to our Moodle  course. We did not upload it in the ordinary way; we have made a link to a website using the  said image. Therefore, when hovering the mouse over the said image, it will look as shown in  the following screenshot:  189   Working with Bitmap Images and Photographs  We can also upload image files in the ordinary way without making links to a website, though  it would be sometimes more attractive to our students to do it. Instead of making an ordinary  link with words, an icon related to something that they are going to deal with is a good idea to  strengthen our Moodle course.  See also   f Selecting between lossy and lossless compression schemes  f Resizing photos to their appropriate size  Linking external image files This is a very simple recipe. We will work with external files in case we need a photo of  something specific. Teaching is enhanced when a visual aid is provided to our students, no  matter which subject we are teaching. It is sometimes very difficult to have photos of all the  things that we want to show them. Thus, we are going to work with Flickr.  Getting ready Using Flickr to search for photos is an amazing tool due to the fact that we can insert them in  our Moodle course in several ways. Copy the link to the file or embed it using the HTML code.  Another option is to enable it through our file picker; in this case, we need to switch our role   to administrator.  How to do it... Enter http:  www.flickr.com  and create a free account  we can also upload photos  and videos, though this is not the aim . Follow these steps in order to find a photo:  1.  Go to the aforementioned website. 2.  Click on Create Your Account. 3.  Complete the pop up that appears with the necessary data. You will have to create    a Yahoo! account if you do not happen to have one.  4.  Click on Sign in. 5.  Click on Sign in on the right-hand margin. 6.  Complete the Search block with the type of photo that we need, as shown in the   following screenshot:  190   7.  Click on Search. 8.  Click on Share this  Grab the link, as shown in the following screenshot:  Chapter 7  9.  Copy the link. 10.  Another option is to click on Share this  Grab the HTML BBCode. 11.  Copy the HTML code to embed in the Moodle course.  How it works... It is time to upload the art photo in our Moodle course. Choose the weekly outline section  where we want to create the activity.

The recipes  use diverse, free, and open source tools to edit, enhance, and convert the different vector  graphics files, covering the most common scenarios for multimedia Moodle activities. Vector  graphics are one of the most difficult formats to handle in Moodle courses.  The general knowledge topic to be used in the recipes for this chapter is General facts about  2D and 3D Geometry. Different types of activities are to be created using geometrical shapes.  You can also create puzzles in order to develop another activity using these types of graphics.  We are always eager to insert these graphics in our Moodle activity due to the fact that they  strengthen the activities to be performed by our students.   Working with Vector Graphics  The recipes are organized in such a way that they are linked among themselves. So, it would  be a good idea to read the whole chapter in its order without skipping recipes because they  add more information as you advance through the recipes. You will also use what you have  created in the initial recipes to design the final ones.  It is also very important to read the previous chapter that deals with bitmap images and  photographs. There are some aspects considered in that chapter that we are going to cover   in this one.  Different types of vector graphics are involved in this chapter due to the fact that they can  enhance and create interactive activities. We can not only use them, but also modify them. It  is like when you read something and like to share a part of it with your students. Similarly, you  can also change the vector graphics in order to use a part of them.  We will cover not just inserting the SVG graphics in Moodle, but also using them in other types  of software that can be uploaded to our Moodle courses. You will be working with mainly  Inkscape, Open Office, and Adobe Reader. Therefore, it would be a good idea for you to have  them installed.  Inkscape is a free and open source vector drawing software to be used in order to perform  many recipes. It will allow us to work with many vector assets in several file formats and export  them to a format recognized by Moodle. Another possibility is to export the said file format to  Hot Potatoes and Quandary 2 used in Chapter 1, Creating Interactive User eXperiences.  We can either design the SVG or look for one on the Internet and learn how to do it. Then, we  can change it, save as another file extension, and so on. We can also modify it; we may not  need to use it per se, but just a part of it. We may insert the SVG in Moodle, or in other types  of software such as OpenOffice or PDF, using Adobe Reader.  We are focusing on 2D and 3D Geometry, though the information can be applied to any  subject to be taught due to the fact that SVG are needed to enhance our Moodle courses no  matter what we are teaching. Images are a great asset to take into account when teaching  because students do not read a plain and dull text. They look more appealing when an image  is on it.  Converting vector graphics to bitmap images In this recipe, vector graphics are to be converted into bitmaps. That is to say, we do need to  convert them because there is a simple process that we can carry out. It is very easy, but we  need to use a free and open source software. Let's get ready!   194   Chapter 8  Getting ready This transformation process is done with the help of Inkscape. Therefore, if you do not have  Inkscape installed, you can download it from the following website: http:  inkscape.org  download ?lang=eng. After downloading it, there are many features that you can learn  about and how they work.  How to do it... After installing Inkscape, search for vector graphics. There is a very interesting website where  you can find many kinds of icons: http:  www.openclipart.org browse. Download  the SVG clipart and Inkscape will automatically open with the clipart in the middle  if you  have previously installed it in your computer . Therefore, follow these steps to start the  transformation process:   1.  Open your default web browser and enter the website URL. 2.  On the top-right margin there appears a Search block and type the word 'triangle'. 3.  Click on Search. Many results showing triangles will appear. Click on one of them. 4.  The image will appear bigger. Click on Download SVG  Open, as shown in the   following screenshot:  195   Working with Vector Graphics  5.   Inkscape will open automatically and the clipart will appear, as shown in the  following screenshot:  6.  Select File  Save. Save the file as triangle.svg, for example. 7.  Click on Save.  How it works... We have just selected the clipart and saved it in Inkscape as .svg. Now, it is time to  transform this .svg into a bitmap  .png file . Therefore, these are the steps to follow  in order to carry out the transformation:  196   1.  Click on File  Export bitmap, as shown in the following screenshot:  Chapter 8  2.  Export area block will appear showing many export options, as shown in the   previous screenshot.  3.  Write 30 on the first dpi textbox, as shown in the previous screenshot  it says 90 . 4.  Click on the Drawing button, as circled in the previous screenshot. 5.  Click on the Export button, as shown in the previous screenshot. 6.   Inkscape has transformed or exported the drawing in .PNG format.  PNG is an open image format that has lossless compression, as  we have already dealt with in Chapter 7, Working with Bitmap  Images and Photographs. Moodle, Hot Potatoes, and Quandary 2  work very well with these types of files. We have worked with the  PNG format due to the fact that the images are small in size.  See also   f Chapter 7, Uploading images to Moodle recipe  197   Working with Vector Graphics  Rendering parts of a vector drawing In this recipe, we will work with Inkscape  used in the previous recipe . By this time, you  must have this software installed on your computer. We will create an SVG using the drawing  options in Inkscape that is very simple. After creating the graphic, we will render some of   its parts.  Getting ready In the previous recipe, we worked with a triangle, so let's work with stars, with which we can  combine both shapes and create an activity sharing both of them. Imagine that we had the  said file, but we want to use only a part of it; it looks as if you have an article in a magazine  and you need to take out the advertisement.  How to do it... Rendering parts of vector graphics means that we use a part of a drawing that we have  designed. Therefore, we will not use all the shapes in the file; we will save some of them that  we are to select before exporting them. The aim of this recipe is to transform the selection in   a bitmap.  Run the Inskape software and follow these steps:  1.  Click on Create stars and polygons  *  on the left-hand side margin, as shown in the   following screenshot:  2.  Draw several stars of different sizes. 3.  Right-click on one of the stars. A pop-up window appears; choose Fill and Stroke.  Another window on the right-hand margin appears and you can change the color or  you can add stripes to the shapes as you click on each of them.  4.  When you finish, press the Shift key and click on the stars that you want to export as   bitmap images.  198   5.  You can move the stars that you want to save onto the left right-hand margin of the   drawing area, as shown in the following screenshot:  Chapter 8  6.  Save the file. Click on File  Save as … and write a name for the file. 7.  Click on File  Export Bitmap. A pop-up window appears. On its ribbon, Selection is  highlighted. You export the stars that you have selected on the left, as shown in the  previous screenshot.  8.  Click on Browse  and write the name of the file. 9.  Click on Export.  How it works... We have just designed the drawing that we want our students to work with. It was a very  simple drawing, but we can also do the same process with others that we just want to use a  part of. We can check what we have done. We can look for the file in our computer files, and in  this case, this is what we have just saved, as shown in the following screenshot:  It is time to Moodle it! We can insert this image in any activity that we want to design in our  Moodle course.   199   Working with Vector Graphics  See also   f Chapter 7, Uploading images to Moodle   Embedding scalable vector graphics This recipe explores different ways of uploading files into our Moodle courses. The steps that  we have to follow have to be together, that is to say it is not advisable to do them separately or  edit the activity because they might not work.  Getting ready We are dealing with a pure SVG and it is advisable that we use the Mozilla Firefox web browser  because it might not work with other web browsers. You can download it at http:  www. mozilla.com en-US products download.html. So, let's see how to do this recipe!  How to do it... We have already used a triangle and stars in the previous recipes, so it is time to change   the shape. We can work with a spiral that we can create using Inkscape. Therefore, let's   start said software and follow these steps in order to design the SVG to be embedded in   our Moodle course:  1.  Click on Create spirals, as shown in the following screenshot:  2.  Drag-and-drop the spiral shape to the desired size. 3.  Click on File  Save as  and write a name for the file. 4.  Click on Save.  200   Chapter 8  How it works... We have just designed the SVG. Therefore, we need to embed it in our Moodle course. In this  recipe, we need to work with some code! Thus, choose the weekly outline section where you  want to add the activity. These are the steps that you are going to follow:  1.  Click on Add an activity  Online text. 2.  Complete the Assignment name block. 3.  Complete the Description block, as shown in the following screenshot:  4.  Highlight a word or phrase, and click on the Insert edit link icon, as shown circled in   the previous screenshot.  5.  Click on Browse next to the Link to URL block. 6.  Click on Upload a file  Browse  and look for the file that was just created. 7.  Click on the file  Open  Upload this file. 8.  Click on Insert. The image will not appear. 9.  Click on HTML Source Editor. Some code will appear, so edit the code. The following  code will appear on the HTML source editor. The only difference will be the location of  the file  "http:  localhost draftfile.php 13 user draft 168792725  Embed_SVG_Spiral.svg" :  <a href="http:  localhost draftfile.php 13 user  draft 168792725 Embed_SVG_Spiral.svg">Define this.    What is it?   Where can you find it?         201   Working with Vector Graphics  10.  Add the following code in order to embed the spiral or any SVG file that you want to   upload in our Moodle course: <object type="image svg+xml" data="http:  localhost draftfile. php 13 user draft 168792725 Embed_SVG_Spiral.svg">      11.  You must bear in mind that the name of the file previously linked is the same in the   code that you insert. Otherwise it won't work!  12. Click on Update. 13.  Click on Save and display to see how it works, as shown in the following screenshot:  See also   f Improving vector graphics rendering with anti-aliasing  f Chapter 7, Resizing photos to the appropriate size  202   Chapter 8  Improving vector graphics rendering with  anti-aliasing In this recipe, we will use the previous spiral. Therefore, it means that we also need Inkscape.  The aim of this recipe is to export the whole vector graphic as a rendered bitmap with a low  resolution. We will take advantage of anti-aliasing.  Getting ready Anti-aliasing applies intermediate colors in order to eliminate the saw tooth look of pixelated  lines. Therefore, we will use Inkscape default anti-aliasing feature to remove the saw tooth  effect when rendering the SVG vector graphics to its bitmap representation in a specific  resolution.  How to do it... Start Inkscape software in order to work with an SVG and follow these steps in order to  develop the activity:  1.  Click on File Open. 2.  Open the file created in the previous recipe or draw a spiral of 20 turns. It looks as   shown in the following screenshot:  203   Working with Vector Graphics  following screenshot:  3.  Click on File  Export bitmap. Complete the pop-up window, as shown in the   4.  Click on Export.  How it works... If we follow the previous steps, we get the rendered bitmap with anti-aliasing applied to it  from the source SVG vector graphic. Inkscape applies anti-aliasing by default when we use   the export bitmap feature. Therefore, the exported image will look smooth and clear with   saw tooth effect reduced, as shown in the following screenshot:  204   Chapter 8  See also   f Chapter 7, Uploading Images to Moodle  Include vector graphics in Open Office   documents This recipe is very simple and it will be designed using Open Office. We have worked in  previous chapters with Spreadsheet and Drawing in Open Office, so it is time to work with  Presentation  you could also use Microsoft Office .  Getting ready It is time to look for an SVG graphic to insert in our presentation. As our baseline topic in  this chapter is 2D and 3D Geometry, our SVG is to be with shapes. We can insert the stars  designed in a previous recipe. In that case, we can combine the activities in our Moodle  course. We can insert the graphic in the weekly outline section to introduce the topic, and we  can now use the SVG graphic to design an activity. We can also render the drawing as we did  in previous recipes, in that case, we do not want to use all of it.  How to do it... Click on the Open Office icon to run the software. In this case, choose Presentation. Then,  these are the steps that you have to follow in order to design the file:  1.  When you click on Presentation, a pop-up window with the Presentation Wizard   appears. Click on Next.  2.  Select a slide design, for example, Numbers on Dark Background to contrast with   shapes, but keeping the Math idea.  3.  Click on Next.  4.  Select a slide transition, for example, Shape Diamond to keep the shapes idea.  205   Working with Vector Graphics  5.  Click on Create, as shown in the following screenshot:  6.   It is time to create the presentation. On the right-hand margin, there appears a  Layouts tab that you may choose in order to design the presentation. Choose the  layout with a Title, Clipart, Text. When hovering the mouse on them, it says what  you can insert, though it is quite clear, as shown in the following screenshot:  7.  Double-click on the chosen layout. Then, follow the instructions on the slide to   complete it.  8.  Click to add title, write the title.  206   Chapter 8  9.  Double-click to add graphics, browse for the SVG to insert, and click on Open. 10.  Click to add an outline. Write the outline. You may write it using bullets. 11.  Save the file. Click on File  Save as …  write a name for the file  click on Save.  How it works... After designing the presentation and saving it, we can upload it to our Moodle course. It is  the introduction to an activity, therefore, we can add a resource to our course. So, choose the  weekly outline section where you want to add the resource and follow these steps:  1.  Click on Add a resource  File. 2.  Complete the Name and Description blocks. 3.  Click on Add  Upload a file  Browse and look for the file to be uploaded. 4.  Click on Open  Upload this file. 5.  Within Options, click on the downwards arrow in Display and choose Embed. 6.  Click on Save and return to course. 7.  When students click on the activity, it looks as shown in the following screenshot:  The screenshot on the left shows what students see before opening the file. The screenshot  on the right shows the presentation that we have created using Open Office, in which we  included SVG.  207   Working with Vector Graphics  Include vector graphics in PDF files This is a very simple recipe. In the previous recipe, we created a file in Open Office in which we  included some SVG. So, we can use the same file to work with in order to avoid some steps.  Let's get ready!  Getting ready What we need to have installed is Open Office, which we have already used in previous  recipes, and Adobe Reader. We can download the latest software from: http:  get. adobe.com reader .  How to do it... We open the file in Open Office and we only make a little change to it, in order to export it as  PDF. It is very simple, we are just a click away. Start Open Office Presentation and open the file  that we created in the previous recipe. Then, follow these steps:  1.  Click on File  Export as PDF, as shown in the following screenshot:  2.  Click on Export. 3.  Write a name for the file and click on Save.  208   Chapter 8  How it works... We have just saved the file as PDF. It is time to open the file in Adobe Reader. Considering the  fact that in the original file there were SVG, it means that when transforming to original file to  PDF, we have included SVG in PDF. You can also perform the same procedure using Microsoft  Office or any other type of Open Office. In this case, we converted a presentation into a PDF, but  we can convert a Text document as well. These are the steps that you have to follow:   1.  Run Adobe Reader. 2.  Click on File  Open and look for the file that you have just saved as PDF. 3.  Click on the said file and click on Open. 4.  The file looks as shown in the following screenshot:  We can upload this file to our Moodle course in the same way that we did in the previous recipe.  Linking to scalable vector graphics This is a very short and simple recipe. The title tells us what to do. We need to use Inkscape  again; we can also use any of the SVG that we have already designed in the previous recipes.  We are to upload a PNG image to our Moodle course, and when clicking on the said image, the  SVG will appear. We can create many activities using this, especially puzzles.  209   Working with Vector Graphics  Getting ready Our baseline topic in this chapter is 2D and 3D Geometry. Therefore, shapes is the best topic  to deal with. Let's choose some 3D shapes that we haven't used yet. When students click on  the said shape, another SVG graphic will appear. So, can you think of any interesting activity   to design?  How to do it... Enter your Moodle course and choose the weekly outline section where you want to add   the activity. In this case, we will design an online text activity; we'll create a puzzle. Follow  these steps:  1.  Click on Add an activity  Online text. 2.  Complete the Assignment name block. 3.  Complete the Description block. 4.  Click on the Insert edit image icon  Upload a file  Browse  look for the file that   you want to upload.  5.  Click on the file  Open Upload this file Insert. 6.  Click on the image that you have just uploaded. Click on the Insert  edit a link icon. 7.  Click on Browse next to the Link URL block and browse for the SVG file that you want   to upload.  8.  Upload a file  Browse  look for the file that you want to upload. 9.  Click on the file  Open Upload this file Insert. 10.  Click on Save and display. The activity looks as shown in the following screenshot:  210   How it works... When students work on this activity, they are going to be able to click on the image and they  are going to open an SVG graphic linked from it. We first uploaded a PNG and the SVG was  linked to it. So, this is the way it works, as shown in the following screenshot:  Chapter 8  Enhancing scalable vector graphics with   hyperlinks In this recipe, we need to use Inkscape once more. We have become quite familiar with said  software. This time, we will create hyperlinks on the SVG graphics. When students click on the  image, they will open a website.  211   Working with Vector Graphics  Getting ready Shapes are to be displayed in this activity, as we have done with the previous recipes.  Therefore, an interesting idea would be to display a website related to the definition of   them or some geometrical information about them.  How to do it... We need to start Inkscape software in order to design the image and add the hyperlinks.  Therefore, follow these steps:  1.  Draw some geometrical shapes. 2.  Choose one of them and click on it. 3.  Right-click on the said shape.  4.  There appears a pop-up window. Choose Create  Link, as shown circled in the   following screenshot:  5.  Right-click again on the same shape. Click on Link properties. 6.  Another pop-up window appears. Complete the Href with the website that you want  to link to, that is to give additional information about the SVG  you may choose any  graphic or website related to your subject .  7.  Close the pop-up window. 8.  Repeat steps 2 – 7 to add hyperlinks to other shapes as required. 9.  Save the file. Click on File  Save as  write a name for the file.  212   Chapter 8  How it works... We have just enhanced SVG with hyperlinks using Inkscape software. Therefore, it is time to  see how it works. We can upload the graphic to our Moodle course, as we have done in the  previous recipes. Another option is to open the file in your web browser. Remember that it is  advisable to open SVG files in Mozilla Firefox where these files work properly. When hovering  the mouse on the SVG graphic and you click on the graphic, another window will open showing  the website of the hyperlink, as shown in the following screenshot:  See also   f Embedding scalable vector graphics  f Linking to scalable vector graphics  213    9  Designing and  Integrating E-portfolios  In this chapter, we will cover:   f Enabling a portfolio  f Preparing a portfolio strategy using a Google Docs portfolio  f Gathering students' work using a File download portfolio  f Enabling a Box.net portfolio  f Using a Box.net portfolio  f Embedding a Box.net folder in Moodle   Introduction This chapter explains how to design and integrate e-Portfolios into Moodle courses. We will  also learn exciting new techniques to organize the information for our students as well as  combine everything learned so far in interacting with e-portfolios.  The recipes are short and precise; beginning with simple portfolios before moving on to more  interesting and complex ones. We will take a look at all the portfolios made available until now  in Moodle 2.0.  Unfortunately, the three most interesting portfolios available in Moodle 1.9.x—Mahara, Exabis,  and MyStuff—are not available at the time of the writing of this book in Moodle 2.x. Therefore,  they won't be covered in this chapter.   Designing and Integrating E-portfolios  Another interesting portfolio that is worth paying attention to is Box.net. You need to sign up  for an account in order to create an application and get the API key to use it in the Moodle  course. An interesting feature of this portfolio is that you can embed a folder in any activity  that you design.  An E-portfolio  electronic portfolio or digital portfolio  is a collection of electronic evidence  gathered and administered by a user on the Web. The evidence should be inputted files,  images, and text, among other types of files. Furthermore, E-portfolios in Moodle 2.x enable  information to be exported to external systems.  In order to benefit from e-portfolios in Moodle, they must be enabled. Also, as the recipes in  this chapter are interrelated, it is best if they read one after another.  When exporting either images or text to a portfolio, we can choose among the ones that we  have enabled. Therefore, when dealing with the last recipe, we can select which portfolio to  use. After exploring the options that each of them offers, we can decide which portfolio is the  best option.  Another characteristic to be considered as an advantage is that portfolios gather files saved  on the Web, not on our computer  except for File Download . That is to say, we can change   the files anywhere; all we need is an Internet connection, so we just log in and edit the files   we need!  We can also share the files and let other students edit them, like in the Wiki activity. We can  use Box.net in order to create and embed a folder in our Moodle course in which students can  upload files. It only takes some steps, and is a different task that students have to deal with.  To sum up, we could say that e-portfolios are easy to back up, and have a good portability as  well as shelf life. Therefore, it would be advisable that we consider them when we design any  Moodle course to use them and teach our students to use them too.  The baseline topic of this chapter is History, so we create activities related to that. Besides,  the results of the eight previous courses created before is to be considered as well because  what we need to export is what our students have written on Forums, Chats, Databases, and  other activities that they have carried out.  Enabling a portfolio The first recipe of this chapter shows how to enable a portfolio in our Moodle course. One of  its advantages is that content from our Moodle course can be exported to a virtual and stable  external portfolio. So, let's get started!  216   Chapter 9  Getting ready Before entering the Moodle course that we want to edit, we need to change our role to  Manager in order to have access to the Site Administration. When we enable a portfolio we  can publish items from our Moodle course to other places to store and organize content.  How to do it... Enabling a portfolio is a very simple process. After switching roles, we have to follow these  steps to enable portfolios in our Moodle course:  1.  Click on Site Administration  Advanced features, as shown in the   following screenshot:  2.  Click on Site Administration  Plugins. 3.  Click on the box next to Enable portfolios, as shown in the following screenshot:  4.  Click on Save changes.  217   Designing and Integrating E-portfolios  How it works... We have just enabled the option portfolio so that it is visible inside the plugins list. There are  many portfolios that can be enabled in Moodle 2.0, therefore, follow these steps in order to  make them visible:  1.  Click on Site Administration  Plugins  Portfolios  Manage portfolios, as shown in   the following screenshot:  2.  Click on the downwards arrow next to File download and choose Enable and visible    Save  Continue.  3.  Repeat step 2 for Google Docs and Picassa.  218   4.  You have enabled three portfolios, as shown in the following screenshot:  Chapter 9  5.  Click on Save changes.  See also   f Preparing a portfolio strategy using a Google Docs portfolio  f Gathering students' work using a File download portfolio   Preparing a portfolio strategy using a   Google Docs portfolio In the previous recipe, we have enabled three portfolios. Therefore, in this recipe, we will work  with one of them. We will use the portfolio to save our files in Google Docs, which we have  enabled before. We have worked with Google Docs in earlier chapters, so we already have an  account in this tool. If you do not have an account, it is necessary to create one.  219   Designing and Integrating E-portfolios  Getting ready To see how a Google Docs portfolio works, open your default web browser and go to Google  Docs at https:  docs.google.com . We enter this website and minimize the screen,  when we save a file there, we maximize it in order to compare the files that we have before  doing this activity and after we export to the portfolio.  How to do it... Enter any Moodle course created. Search the results or find a Forum activity that we have  already created. In this recipe, we enter the course Traveling around the World and Watching  the Universe; the course was created during a recipe in Chapter 2, Working with 2D and 3D  Maps. We will focus on the result of the forum activity Apollo 17. Therefore, these are the  steps that we have to follow in order to save a portfolio using Google Docs:  1.  Enter the Moodle course. Click on Apollo 17 forum activity  or any other forum activity   2.  Click on the discussion topic that you want to save, in this case Apollo 17, as shown   that you want to save .  in the following screenshot:  3.  Click on the downwards arrow to select the way you want to see the forum answers,   as shown in the following screenshot:  4.  Next to the aforementioned block  the one that you choose how the information is  to be displayed , there appears the Save button. Click on the downwards arrow and  choose Google Docs, as shown in the following screenshot:  220   5.  Click on Save. The following message appears, as shown in the following screenshot:  6.  You can choose to Return to where you were or Continue to your portfolio. Thus,   click on the place where you want to go.  How it works... At the beginning of the recipe, we entered the Google Docs account and saw our files in the  said website. Thus, when we click on Continue to your portfolio, as shown in the previous  screenshot, we can see that the discussion in the forum was successfully saved in our Google  Docs account, as shown in the following screenshot:  Chapter 9  221   Designing and Integrating E-portfolios  Gathering students' work using a File   download portfolio Gathering our students' work is one of the characteristics of portfolios. Therefore, in this  recipe we deal with File download. Through this portfolio, we can save the homework done in  a simple way. The first step that we should bear in mind is to create a folder in which we save  all the files, in order to organize ourselves.  Getting ready We enter a course where we need to grade a student's activity. In this case, we save the result  of a Chat activity that was created in a History course. Students discuss Medieval England  after dealing with different resources.  How to do it... We have to enter the Chat activity in order to save our students' conversations. We can also  carry out similar steps if we want to save the opinions of our students through a Forum  activity. These are the steps that we have to follow:  1.  Enter the Chat activity that was done by the students. 2.  Click on View past chat sessions, as shown in the following screenshot:  3.  Click on List all sessions and select the session that you want to save. 4.  Click on Export to portfolio, next to the File download option, as shown in the   following screenshot:  222   5.  A pop-up window appears displaying the information about which software the file will   be opened in. Click on OK, as shown in the following screenshot:  Chapter 9  6.  The file appears in our default web browser. Click on Return to where you were in the   Moodle course and go back to the course.  How it works... The file was opened with our default web browser, and we can save it so as not to lose it.  Therefore, follow these steps:  1.  Click on Page  Save as giving a name for the file, as shown in the following   screenshot:  223   Designing and Integrating E-portfolios  2.  Click on Save.  We have already exported the chat session of our students and saved it in our computer. On  the left-side of the screenshot, there appears the chat session of our students.  Enabling a Box.net portfolio Box.net is a portfolio that can also be enabled in our Moodle course. It is not as simple as the  other portfolios that we have enabled; we just need one more step to enjoy its advantages. We  need to enter http:  www.box.net  and sign up to create an account.  Bear in mind that during this recipe we must switch our roles to Managers in order to be able  to have access to enable this portfolio.  Getting ready There are two Box.net plans available. One of them is free of charge that happens to be  personal and the business one is paid. We choose the personal one that is free. After that, we  set up our account after completing some information.  How to do it... It is time to get the Box.net API key to enable the portfolio. API stands for Application  Programming Interface. Moodle incorporates third-party API so that portfolio developers   can develop more efficient plugins in order to integrate portfolios in Moodle 2.x.  In order to get the Box.net API key, enter the following website: http:  www.box.net  developers services and create a new application. These are the steps to follow:  1.  Click on Create new Application. 2.  Read the terms and conditions and click on Accept.  224   3.  Complete the General information required, as shown in the following screenshot:  Chapter 9  4.  Complete the website URL, which is optional with the URL provided by our Moodle  course. Therefore, leave that block aside and minimize this window for a moment.  5.  Open your Moodle course and switch role to Administrator. 6.  Click on Site Administration  Plugins  Portfolios  Manage portfolios. 7.  Click on the downwards arrow next to Box.net internet storage and select   Enabled and visible.  8.  Copy the URL that appears, as shown in the following screenshot:  225   Designing and Integrating E-portfolios  9.  Minimize the screen  do not close it . 10.  Maximize the Box.net website  that was minimized , and paste the URL you have just   copied in the block that was left aside in step 4. Click on Continue.  11.  Another screenshot appears with the API key that you need to paste in the Moodle   course, as shown in the following screenshot:  12. Copy the API key, and minimize this web browser. 13.  Go back to the Moodle course and paste the API Key in the blank block. 14.  Click on Save  Continue  Save changes. The portfolio has been successfully   enabled.  How it works... On the left-hand margin of our Moodle course under Site administration heading  Plugins   Portfolios appears Box.net internet storage  now visible . Therefore, it means that we  enabled the said portfolio, as shown in the following screenshot:  226   Chapter 9  See also   f Using a Box.net portfolio  f Embedding a Box.net folder in Moodle  Using a Box.net portfolio In this recipe, we work with Box.net, the portfolio that we have just enabled in the previous  recipe. Therefore, as we have already worked in previous recipes with other portfolios, we will  focus on this one in this task.  Getting ready We can open our default web browser and log in to our account in order to see how the export   to this portfolio works. Therefore, enter http:  www.box.net  and log in to your account,  the one that we have created before.  227   Designing and Integrating E-portfolios  How to do it...  First of all, we need to select what files we want to export to Box.net. Therefore, enter a  Moodle course and choose a Forum activity that students have worked in. These are the  steps to follow:  1.  Enter any Moodle course and click on a Forum activity. 2.  Click on the name of the discussion topic. 3.  Click on the downwards arrow and select Box.net internet storage, as shown in the   following screenshot:  4.  Click on Save. 5.  Tick the Share this file? and Share this new folder? blocks  shown in the screenshot   6.  Click on the downwards arrow and choose Moodle portfolios  shared , as shown in   after step 6 .  the following screenshot:  7.  Click on Next.  228   8.  The following information appears, as shown in the following screenshot:  Chapter 9  9.  Click on Continue. 10.  The portfolio export is complete. You can Return to where you where or   Continue to your portfolio.  How it works... We have just successfully exported our portfolio, but we have not seen it. Thus, if we click on  Continue to your portfolio, we can see that we have just saved our file in Box.net. Therefore,  the Forum discussion appears, as shown in the following screenshot:  Note that next to updates, 1NEW appears. It means that there is the file that we have just  exported from our Moodle course. Click on the file to see what students have written in said  Forum activity.  229   Designing and Integrating E-portfolios  See also   f Enabling a Box.net portfolio  f Embedding a Box.net folder in Moodle  Embedding a Box.net folder in Moodle This is a very interesting way to use a portfolio. It is sometimes advisable to use portfolios in  different ways so that we do not get used to the same process. Besides, designing activities  that are not alike enhances the course. We will embed a Box.net folder in our Moodle course.   Getting ready We have to create an activity in this recipe because we need to embed a folder in it. The  purpose is that students should upload a file in this folder. Its advantage is that we are   using the portfolio directly from our Moodle course.   How to do it... Before embedding a Box.net folder in our Moodle course, we need to create a folder to  embed. Apart from that, we need to choose the characteristics of the said folder. Log in   to your Box.net account and follow these steps in order to create a folder:  1.  Click on Files on the upper ribbon. 2.  Click on the downwards arrow in New and choose Folder, as shown in the   following screenshot:  3.  Complete the Folder Name block. 4.  Click on the ring button Invite people to upload or download files. 5.  Click on the downwards arrow in Access Type and choose Editor. 6.  Click Okay.  230   7.  The folder has been created, as shown in the following screenshot:  Chapter 9  8.  Click on the folder you have just created, in this case Moodle History course, as   shown in the previous screenshot.  9.  Click on the downwards arrow in the Folder Options block, as shown in the   following screenshot:  10.  Click on Share  Embed folder in your site  if you do not want to embed the folder  you can click on Get Link to Folder and copy the URL. You can make a link in the  Moodle course . A pop-up window appears, as shown in the following screenshot:  231   Designing and Integrating E-portfolios  11.  Copy the HTML code and click on Close.  How it works... We have just copied the HTML code that we need to paste in our Moodle course in order  to embed the Box.net folder. Therefore, we now need to create an activity. Follow these steps:  1.  Click on Add an activity  Offline activity within Assignments. 2.  Complete the Assignment name and Description blocks. 3.  Click on the Edit HTML source icon and paste the HTML code. 4.  Click on Update. 5.  Click on Save and display.

Part of Packt's Cookbook series, each chapter focuses on a different multimedia effect. If you don't have the time to work your way through a long tutorial, then this is the book for you. The step-by-step recipes are independent from each other so you can dip in and out of the book to add great effects to your course as and when you need them. This cookbook is designed for teachers who want to learn how to insert different multimedia assets into their Moodle courses. It is expected that you will have basic knowledge of Moodle 1.9 or 2.0 and have Moodle installed and ready to be worked on. Teachers of different subjects can adapt the recipes to best suit their specific subject
