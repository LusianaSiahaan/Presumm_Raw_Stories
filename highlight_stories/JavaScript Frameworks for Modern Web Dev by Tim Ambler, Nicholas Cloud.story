His knowledge, experience, and steadfast dedication to this project have been  immeasurably helpful. Thank you.  Louise Corrigan, Kevin Walter, Christine Ricketts, Melissa Maldonado, and the rest of the staff at Apress  who supported us throughout the course of this project. I am grateful for the invitation that was extended to  embark upon this journey and for the ongoing support that you have provided.  Robin Hawkes, our technical reviewer. The examples and source code included with this book have   greatly benefited from his keen insight and sharp eye.  James Coglan, the creator of Faye. Thank you for taking the time to share your technical expertise    and feedback.  My friends and colleagues Greg Jones, Jeff Crump, Seth Steele, Jon Zumbrun, and Brian Hiatt. I am   grateful for your feedback and encouragement.  —Tim   Acknowledgements are slippery things. I have so many debts, and so little space to repay.  First, the debt to my co-author Tim who reached out and invited me on this journey. We’ve never met  in person but worked remotely as co-workers for about half a year—enough time for each of us to leave an  impression on each other across the miles. For his trust, encouragement, and constant effort I am grateful. Second, my debt to the staff at Apress who guided us through the publishing process: Kevin, Louise,   Christine, and Melissa. Their patience and careful guidance spared you, the reader, from no small amount of  cringes, and kept me on my toes during the entire writing process. They are all sharp professionals with whom  I hope to work again some day.  Third, I am indebted to Robin for his excellent technical reviews; for reading and executing more code   samples than a developer should ever be tasked with groking.  Finally, I cannot repay the subject-matter expertise I gleaned from Michael Jackson  @mjackson  while   researching Mach, and Ryan Niemeyer  @RPNiemeyer  while researching Knockout—I can only pay it forward  to you, the reader.  —Nicholas  xxiii  www.it-ebooks.info   Introduction  They tell me we’re living in an information age, but none of it seems to be the information  I need or brings me closer to what I want to know. In fact  I’m becoming more and more  convinced  all this electronic wizardry only adds to our confusion, delivering inside scoops  and verdicts about events that have hardly begun: a torrent of chatter moving at the speed  of light, making it nearly impossible for any of the important things to be heard.  —Matthew Flaming, The Kingdom of Ohio  The notion that “technology moves quickly” is a well-worn aphorism, and with good reason: technology  does move quickly. But at this moment, JavaScript in particular is moving very quickly indeed—much like  that “torrent of chatter moving at the speed of light” that Matthew Flaming refers to in The Kingdom of Ohio.  The language is in the midst of what many have called a renaissance, brought about by the rapidly increasing  sophistication of browser-based applications and the rising popularity of JavaScript on the server, thanks to  Node.js.  An almost feverish pace of innovation is occurring within the JavaScript community that, while   endlessly fascinating to follow, also presents some unique challenges of its own. JavaScript’s ecosystem of  libraries, frameworks, and utilities has grown dramatically. Where once a small number of solutions for any  given problem existed, many can now be found… and the options continue to grow by the day. As a result,  developers find themselves faced with the increasingly difficult task of choosing the appropriate tools from  among many seemingly good options.  If you’ve ever found yourself wondering why JavaScript seems to be attracting so much attention lately,  as we have, it’s worth stopping for a moment to consider the fact that JavaScript, a language that was created  by one person in ten days, now serves as the foundation upon which much of the Web as we know it sits.  A language that was originally created to solve relatively simple problems is now being applied in new  and innovative ways that were not originally foreseen. What’s more, JavaScript is a beautifully expressive  language, but it’s not without its share of rough edges and potential pitfalls. While flexible, efficient, and  ubiquitous, JavaScript concepts such as the event loop and prototypal inheritance can prove particularly  challenging for those coming to the language for the first time.  For these and many other reasons, the development community at large is still coming to terms with   how best to apply the unique features that JavaScript brings to the table. We’ve no doubt only scratched  the surface of what the language and the community behind it are capable of. For those with an insatiable  appetite for knowledge and a desire to create, now is the perfect time to be a JavaScript developer.  We have written Pro JavaScript Frameworks for Modern Web Dev to serve as your guide to a wide   range of popular JavaScript tools that solve difficult problems at both ends of the development stack: in  the browser and on the server. The tutorials and downloadable code examples contained within this book  illustrate the usage of tools that manage dependencies, structure code in a modular fashion, automate  repetitive build tasks, create specialized servers, structure client side applications, facilitate horizontal  scaling, perform event logging, and interacting with disparate data stores.  The libraries and frameworks covered include Bower, Grunt, Yeoman, PM2, RequireJS, Browserify,   Knockout, AngularJS, Kraken, Mach, Mongoose, Knex, Bookshelf, Faye, Q, Async.js, Underscore, and Lodash.  xxv  www.it-ebooks.info     IntroduCtIon  In writing Pro JavaScript Frameworks for Modern Web Dev, our goal was to create a filter for the    “torrent of chatter” that often seems to surround JavaScript, and in so doing, to allow what we believe are  some important things to be heard. We hope the information contained within these pages proves as useful  to you as it has to us.  Who This Book Is For  This book is intended for web developers who are already confident with JavaScript, but also frustrated with  the sheer number of solutions that exist for seemingly every problem. This book helps lift the fog, providing  the reader with an in-depth guide to specific libraries and frameworks that well-known organizations are  using right now with great success. Topics pertaining to both client-side and server-side development  are covered. As a result, readers will gain the most benefit from this book if they already have at least an  intermediate familiarity with both the web browser Document Object Model  DOM , common client-side  libraries like jQuery, and Node.js.  How This Book Is Structured  This book covers a wide selection of JavaScript tools that are applicable throughout the entire development  process, from a project’s first commit to its first release and beyond. To that end, the chapters have been  grouped into the following parts.  Part 1: Development Tools Bower Dependency management is hardly a new idea - well-known examples include Node’s npm, Python’s pip,  and PHP’s composer. A practice that has only recently begun to see widespread adoption, however, is the  application of this concept to the management of front-end web assets - the JavaScript libraries, stylesheets,  fonts, icons, and images that serve as the building blocks of modern web applications. In this chapter, we’ll  discover several ways in which Bower - a popular tool within this field - can improve your development  process by providing you with a mechanism for organizing these dependencies within your application.  Grunt Larry Wall, the creator of Perl, describes the three virtues of a great programmer as: laziness, impatience,  and hubris. In this chapter, we’ll focus on a tool that will help you strengthen the virtue of laziness - Grunt.  This popular task runner provides developers with a framework for creating command-line utilities  that automative repetitive build tasks such as running tests, concatenating files, compiling SASS   LESS  stylesheets, checking for JavaScript errors, and more. After reading this chapter, you’ll know how to use several  popular Grunt plugins, as well as how to go about creating and sharing your own plugins with the community.  xxvi  www.it-ebooks.info     IntroduCtIon  Yeoman Yeoman provides JavaScript developers with a mechanism for creating reusable templates  “generators”   that describe the overall structure of a project  initially required dependencies, Grunt tasks, etc…  in a way  that can be easily re-used over and over. Broad community support also allows you to take advantage of a  wide variety of pre-existing templates. In this chapter, we’ll walk through the process of installing Yeoman  and using several popular pre-existing generators. Finally, we’ll take a look at how we can create and share  our own templates with the community.  PM2 In this chapter, we will close out our discussion of development tools by taking a look at PM2, a command-line  utility that simplifies many of the tasks associated with running Node applications, monitoring their status,  and efficiently scaling them to meet increasing demand.  Part 2: Module Loaders RequireJS and Browserify JavaScript’s lacks a native method for loading external dependencies in the browser—a frustrating oversight  for developers. Fortunately, the community has stepped in to fill this gap with two very different and  competing standards: the Asynchronous Module Definition  AMD  API and CommonJS. We’ll dive into the  details of both and take a look at widely-used implementations of each: RequireJS and Browserify. Each  have their merits, which we’ll discuss in detail, but both can have a profoundly positive impact on the way in  which you go about structuring your applications.  Part 3: Client-Side Frameworks Knockout and AngularJS In recent years, web developers have witnessed a sharp rise in popularity of so-called “single-page apps.”  Such applications exhibit behavior once available only on the desktop, but at the expense of increased code  complexity within the browser. In this section, we’ll dive into two widely-used front-end frameworks that  help minimize that complexity by providing proven patterns for solving frequently-encountered problems:  Knockout and AngularJS. Knockout focuses on the relationship between view and data, but otherwise leaves  the application architecture and plumbing to the developer’s discretion. AngularJS takes a more prescriptive  approach, covering the view, application routing, data transfer, and module design.  Part 4: Server-Side Frameworks Kraken and Mach Client-side applications aren’t very useful without a server with which to interact. In this section, we’ll take  a look at two popular frameworks that support developers in the creation of back-end applications: Kraken  and Mach.  Mach is more than just a simple web server: it is HTTP for the web. Mach can both serve and retrieve  content via an intuitive, extensible HTTP stack.  The Mach interface remains the same whether servicing  web page requests in a Node.js application, fetching JSON data with a Mach AJAX request in the browser,   or rewriting and proxying requests to another web stack entirely.  In many ways Mach is the Swiss army knife  of HTTP.  xxvii  www.it-ebooks.info     IntroduCtIon  Part 5: Managing Database Interaction Mongoose, Knex, and Bookshelf At the core of every application lies the most important component of any development stack - the data  that our users seek. In this section, we’ll become familiar with two libraries that help simplify some of the  complexity that’s often experienced when interacting with popular storage platforms such as MongoDB,  MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite. After reading this section, you’ll be comfortable defining schemas,  associations, lifecycle “hooks”, and more.  Part 6: Communication Faye In this section, you’ll be introduced to Faye, a Node.js library that provides developers with a robust and  easy-to-use platform for building products that rely on real-time communication between servers and all  major browsers.Much of Faye’s popularity stems from the project’s goal of working everywhere the Web  works. Faye accomplishes this by providing seamless fallback support for a number of communication  protocols.  Part 7: Managing Control Flow Q and Async js The asynchronous nature of JavaScript provides developers with a significant degree of flexibility - as  opposed to forcing developers to execute their code in a linear fashion, JavaScript allows developers to  orchestrate multiple actions simultaneously. Unfortunately, along with this flexibility comes a significant  degree of additional complexity - what many developers refer to as “callback hell” or the “pyramid of  doom.” In this section, we’ll examine two popular libraries that will aid you in taming the complexities of  asynchronous control flow: Q and Async.js.  Part 8: Further Useful Libraries A number of wonderfully useful libraries exist that this book would be remiss not to cover, but for which  additional parts are not necessarily warranted. This part will cover such libraries.  Underscore and Lo-Dash Underscore  and its successor, Lo-Dash  is an incredibly useful collection of functions that simplifies many  frequently used patterns that can be tedious to implement otherwise. This brief chapter will bring these  libraries to your attention, along with some of the more popular extensions that can also be included to  enhance their usefulness even further. Examples are included that that highlight some of the most frequently  used portions of these libraries.  xxviii  www.it-ebooks.info     IntroduCtIon  Downloading the Code  Each chapter in this book contains many examples, the source code for which may be downloaded from   http:  www.apress.com 9781484206638 in zipped form.  Subdirectories within each chapter’s zip file contain source code  often executable  that corresponds    to specific example listings in each chapter. The first line in each chapter listing will be a source code  comment identifying the specific file path where the source code lives. If you were to encounter   Listing 0-1 in Chapter 10  covering Mach , for example, the actual source code file would be located in   mach example-000 no-such-file.js, relative to where the mach.zip file was extracted.  Listing 0-1.  Not a Real Example     example-000 no-such-file.js console.log 'this is not a real example' ;  Most examples are run with the Node.js runtime, which may be obtained from https:  nodejs.org.    Chapters with additional prerequisites will explain the necessary procedures for downloading and  installing the examples.  For example, MongoDB is necessary to run examples in Chapter 11, which covers  Mongoose.   Any additional steps necessary for running code examples  e.g., executing curl requests  or interacting   with a running example  e.g., opening a web browser and navigating to a specific URL  are explained  alongside each listing.  xxix  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 1  Bower  Great things are done by a series of small things brought together.  —Vincent Van Gogh  The concept of package management, also known as dependency management, is not new. Utilities within  this category provide developers with a mechanism for managing the various third-party libraries that a  project relies on. Widely used examples include  npm: The package manager for Node.js  Composer: A tool for dependency management in PHP   	  	  	  	 NuGet: The package manager for the Microsoft development platform including .NET  pip: The PyPA recommended tool for installing Python packages  While package management is hardly a new idea, a practice that has only recently begun to see   widespread adoption is the application of this concept to the management of front-end web assets—the  JavaScript libraries, stylesheets, fonts, icons, and images that serve as the building blocks of modern web  applications. The need for such structure has become evident as the foundations on which modern web  applications are built have grown in complexity. Web applications that once relied on a small selection of  broadly defined, “one size fits all” third-party libraries  e.g., jQuery  now find themselves using the work  of many more smaller libraries, each with a tightly defined purpose. Benefits of this approach include  smaller modules that are easier to test, as well as an enhanced degree of flexibility on the part of the  parent application, which can more easily extend third-party libraries or replace them altogether when  necessary.  This chapter is designed to get you up and running quickly with Bower, the front-end package manager   whose roots lie in open source initiatives at Twitter. Topics covered include  Finding, adding, and removing packages  Adding Bower to a project  Installing and configuring Bower   	  	  	  	  	 Managing the dependency chain  	 Creating Bower packages  Semantic Versioning  1  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 1   Bower  Getting Started  $ npm install -g bower $ bower --version 1.3.12  All interaction with Bower occurs through a command-line utility that can be installed via npm. If you do not  already have Bower installed, you should install it before you continue, as shown in Listing 1-1.  Listing 1-1.  Installing the bower Command-Line Utility via npm   Node’s package manager  npm  allows users to install packages in one of two contexts: locally       Note  or globally. In this example, bower is installed within the global context, which is typically reserved for  command-line utilities.  Configuring Bower  Bower is configured on a per-project basis through a single  optional  JSON file that exists in your project’s  root folder, .bowerrc. For the purposes of this introduction, we’ll only look at the most frequently changed  setting within this file  see Listing 1-2 .  Listing 1-2.  The .bowerrc File from This Chapter’s Sample Project     example-bootstrap .bowerrc   {     "directory": ". public bower_components" }  By default, Bower will store your project’s dependencies in the bower_components folder. You will likely   want to change this location, and the directory setting allows you to do so.  The Manifest  Bower provides developers with a single point of entry from which third-party libraries can be found, added,  upgraded, and removed. As these actions occur, Bower updates a JSON file referred to as the “manifest”  with an up-to-date list of the project’s dependencies. The Bower manifest for this chapter’s sample project is  shown in Listing 1-3. In this example, Bower is aware of a single dependency, the Bootstrap CSS framework.  Listing 1-3.  Bower Manifest for This Chapter’s Sample Project     example-bootstrap bower.json   {     "name": "example-bootstrap",     "version": "1.0.0",     "homepage": "https:  github.com username project",  2  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 1   Bower      "authors": [         "John Doe  "     ],     "dependencies": {         "bootstrap": "3.2.0"     } }  If we were to accidentally delete all of our project’s dependencies by removing the public bower_  components folder, we could easily restore our project to its previous state by issuing a single command, as  shown next. Doing so would cause Bower to compare its manifest with our project’s current file structure,  determine what dependencies are missing, and restore them.  $ bower install  As a result of this behavior, we have the option of ignoring our project’s  public bower_components   folder within version control. By committing only Bower’s manifest, and not the dependencies themselves,  our project’s source code can be kept in a cleaner state, containing only files that pertain directly to our  own work.     Note   opinions differ as to whether or not keeping your project’s dependencies out of version control is  a good idea. on the one hand, doing so results in a cleaner repository. on the other hand, this also opens the  door to potential problems should you  or the Bower registry, or Github, etc.  encounter connection issues.  the general consensus seems to be that if you are working on a “deployable” project  i.e., an application,  not a module , committing your dependencies is the preferred approach. otherwise, keeping your project’s  dependencies out of version control is probably a good idea.  Creating a New Manifest When you begin to use Bower within a project for the first time, it’s typically best to allow Bower to create a  new manifest for you, as shown next. Afterward, you can modify it further if necessary.  $ bower init  Finding, Adding, and Removing Bower Packages  Bower’s command-line utility provides a number of useful commands for locating, installing, and removing  packages. Let’s take a look at how these commands can help simplify the process of managing a project’s  external dependencies.  Finding Packages One of the primary ways in which Bower can improve your development workflow is by providing you with a  centralized registry from which third-party libraries can be found. To search the Bower registry, simply pass  the search argument to Bower, followed by a keyword to search for, as shown in Listing 1-4. In this example,  only a short excerpt from the returned list of search results is shown.  3  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 1   Bower  Listing 1-4.  Searching Bower for jQuery  $ bower search jquery   Search results:       jquery git:  github.com jquery jquery.git     jquery-ui git:  github.com components jqueryui     jquery.cookie git:  github.com carhartl jquery-cookie.git     jquery-placeholder git:  github.com mathiasbynens jquery-placeholder.git  Adding Packages Each search result includes the name under which the package was registered, along with the URL of the  GitHub repository at which it can be accessed directly. Once we have located the desired package, we can  add it to our project as shown in Listing 1-5.  Listing 1-5.  Adding jQuery to Our Project  $ bower install jquery --save bower jquery*            cached git:  github.com jquery jquery.git2.1.3 bower jquery*          validate 2.1.3 against git:  github.com jquery jquery.git* bower jquery>= 1.9.1     cached git:  github.com jquery jquery.git2.1.3 bower jquery>= 1.9.1   validate 2.1.3 against git:  github.com jquery jquery.git>= 1.9.1 bower jquery>= 1.9.1     cached git:  github.com jquery jquery.git2.1.3 bower jquery>= 1.9.1   validate 2.1.3 against git:  github.com jquery jquery.git>= 1.9.1 bower jquery>= 1.9.1    install jquery2.1.3   jquery2.1.3 public bower_components jquery     Note   Bower does not host any of the files associated with the packages contained within its registry; it  defers to Github for that responsibility. while it is possible to host packages at any UrL, the majority of public  packages are found on Github.  Take note of the fact that in Listing 1-5, we pass the --save option to Bower’s install command. By  default, the install command will add the requested package to a project without updating its manifest.  By passing the --save option, we instruct Bower to permanently store this package within its list of  dependencies.  Listing 1-6 shows the HTML from this chapter’s sample project. After adding jQuery to our project via   Bower, we can load it via a script tag as we would any other library.  4  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 1   Bower  Listing 1-6.  HTML from Our Sample Project That References the jQuery Package Just Added     example-jquery public index.html                                                    Bower Example                                                      $ document .ready function   {             $ 'container' .html ' Hello, world! ' ;         } ;                    Development Dependencies By default, any packages that Bower installs are considered to be “production” dependencies, but this  behavior can be overridden by passing the --save-dev option. Doing so will flag any installed packages as  “development” dependencies. Such packages are intended for development purposes only, not for the final  users of a project.  Once we are ready to deploy our application to a production environment, we can instruct Bower to  install only the production dependencies, as shown next, resulting in a leaner build that does not contain  extraneous files of no interest to the end user.  $ bower install --production  Removing Packages The process of removing Bower packages is straightforward. As in previous examples, we pass the --save  argument to update Bower’s manifest to reflect this change:  $ bower uninstall jquery --save  5  www.it-ebooks.info   If you were to install jQuery  as shown in Listing 1-5  and then look at the contents of your project’s Bower  manifest, you would see something that resembles Listing 1-7.  Chapter 1   Bower  Semantic Versioning  Listing 1-7.  Semantic Version  Semver  Number  "dependencies": {     "jquery": "~2.1.3" }  The version number 2.1.3 that we see in Listing 1-7  ignore the ~ character for a moment  is what is  known as a semantic version number  semver for short . Semantic versioning is a standard that describes  a common format that developers can use to assign version numbers to their projects. The format is  illustrated here:  Version X.Y.Z  Major.Minor.Patch   The semantic versioning format dictates that developers create clearly defined  either by   documentation or by clear, self-documenting code  APIs that provide users with a single point of entry into a  library. New projects that are just getting off the ground typically begin at version 0.0.0 and work their way up  incrementally as new releases are created. A project with a version number below 1.0.0 is considered to be  under heavy development and, as such, is allowed to make sweeping changes to its API without altering its  major version number. A project with a version number at or above 1.0.0, however, is guided by the following  set of rules that determines how version numbers should be changed:   	   	   	  A project’s major version number should change when updates occur that result in  breaking changes with how users have interacted with a project’s API in previous  versions.  A project’s minor version number should change when new features are added to a  project in a way that is backward-compatible  i.e., the existing API is not broken .  A project’s patch version number should change when backward-compatible bug  fixes are introduced.  These rules provide developers with insight into the extent of changes that have occurred between any   two versions. Such insight will prove useful as our Bower manifest grows and we begin adding more and  more dependencies to our project.   the ~ character shown in Listing 1-7 tells Bower that whenever the install command is run, it is      Note  allowed to automatically install future versions of jQuery that are “relatively close to” version 2.1.3. If the use of  the phrases “relatively close to” and “automatically install” within the same sentence makes your skin crawl,  you’re not alone. Best practices suggest that you avoid the “~X.Y.Z” format when referencing dependencies  with Bower. Instead, you are better off specifying the exact version of the dependency that you wish to include  within your project. as future updates are released, you can then manually review them and make your own  decisions regarding if and when to update. Subsequent examples within this chapter will follow this advice.  6  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 1   Bower  Managing the Dependency Chain  One of the primary benefits that developers gain as a result of using Bower is the ease with which updates to  a project’s entire dependency chain can be monitored and integrated. To illustrate this point, let’s take a look  at the list of dependencies contained within this chapter’s sample project  see Listing 1-8 .  Listing 1-8.  Installing and Listing the Various Bower Packages Required by Our Sample Project  $ bower install bower bootstrap3.2.0     cached git:  github.com twbs bootstrap.git3.2.0 bower bootstrap3.2.0   validate 3.2.0 against git:  github.com twbs bootstrap.git3.2.0 bower jquery>= 1.9.0     cached git:  github.com jquery jquery.git2.1.3 bower jquery>= 1.9.0   validate 2.1.3 against git:  github.com jquery jquery.git>= 1.9.0 bower bootstrap3.2.0    install bootstrap3.2.0 bower jquery>= 1.9.0    install jquery2.1.3   bootstrap3.2.0 public bower_components bootstrap └── jquery2.1.3   jquery2.1.3 public bower_components jquery   $ bower list bower check-new     Checking for new versions of the project dependencies.. example-bootstrap1.0.0  opt example-bootstrap └─┬ bootstrap3.2.0  latest is 3.3.2    └── jquery2.1.3  Thanks to Bower, we now have a simple graph that describes the external dependencies that our project   relies on, as well as the relationships between them. We can see that we have a Bootstrap dependency,  which in turn has its own dependency on jQuery. Bower also prints the specific version of each component  that is currently installed.     Note   Many third-party libraries are not entirely self-contained—they have dependencies of their own.  Bootstrap  with its reliance on jQuery  is one such example. when adding such a package, Bower is smart  enough to recognize these additional dependencies and will proactively add them to your project if they don’t  already exist. It is important to note, however, that unlike more sophisticated package managers  e.g., npm ,  Bower stores all of its packages within a flat folder structure, which means you will occasionally run into version  conflicts, if you’re not careful.  In Listing 1-8, Bower has informed us that a version of Bootstrap  3.3.2  newer than the version currently   relied upon by our project  3.2.0  is available. We can update this dependency by modifying our project’s  manifest to refer to this newer version and rerunning the install command, as shown in Listing 1-9.  7  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 1   Bower  Listing 1-9.  Installing Bower Packages After Having Updated the Version of jQuery Our Project Relies On  $ bower install bower bootstrap3.3.2     cached git:  github.com twbs bootstrap.git3.3.2 bower bootstrap3.3.2   validate 3.3.2 against git:  github.com twbs bootstrap.git3.3.2 bower bootstrap3.3.2    install bootstrap3.3.2   bootstrap3.3.2 public bower_components bootstrap └── jquery2.1.3  Creating Bower Packages  Until now, our focus has been on integrating Bower into our own projects. We’ve initialized Bower within  our project and discovered how we can go about finding, adding, and removing packages. At a certain point,  however, you’ll hopefully find yourself wanting to share your own packages with others. To do so, you’ll need  to ensure that you follow a few simple guidelines, starting with choosing a valid name.  Choose a Valid Name You’ll need to settle on a name for your package that is unique throughout Bower’s public registry. Use  Bower’s search command to find out if your desired name is available. Additional requirements include  The name should be in “slug” format; for example, my-unique-project.  The name should be all lowercase.   	  	  	 Only alphanumeric characters, dots, and dashes are allowed.  	  	 Consecutive dots and dashes are not allowed.  	  The name should begin and end with an alphabetic character.  After settling on a name, update the contents of your project’s bower.json file  accordingly.  Use Semver Git Tags Earlier in the chapter, we took a look at the concept of semantic versioning, a common standard for  assigning meaningful version numbers to projects. You’ll want to ensure that you follow this standard, as this  will allow the consumers of your package to track and integrate your future changes.  If the package you want to share is just getting started, an appropriate version number would be   0.0.0. As you commit future changes and create new releases, you can increment this value as appropriate,  depending on the extent of your updates. When you determine that your project has reached its first “stable”  milestone, update your version number to 1.0.0 to reflect that status.  Every version number of your project should have a corresponding tag on GitHub. It is this relationship  between GitHub tags and the versions of your package that allows consumers to reference specific versions  within their projects.  Assuming you’ve already committed your code to GitHub, see Listing 1-10 for an example of how you   might go about creating your first tag.  8  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 1   Bower  Listing 1-10.  Creating Your First Semver Git Tag  $ git tag -a 0.0.1 -m "First release." $ git push origin 0.0.1  Publish Your Package to the Registry Now that we’ve chosen an appropriate name for our package and assigned a version number  along with a  corresponding tag on GitHub , it’s time to publish our package to the public Bower registry:  $ bower register my-package-name https:  github.com username my-package-name.git     Note   Bear in mind that Bower is intended to serve as a centralized registry for libraries and components  that other developers can use within their own projects. It is not intended to serve as a distribution mechanism  for entire applications.  Summary  Bower is a simple command-line utility that eases some of the tedious tasks associated with managing  front-end assets. Unlike well-known package managers from other platforms  e.g., Node’s npm , Bower  was not designed to handle the specific needs of any one platform or language; instead, it favors a rather  generic approach to the concept of package management. The developers who created Bower intentionally  set out to create a very simple tool for managing a wide variety of front-end assets—not just code, but also  stylesheets, fonts, images, and other, unforeseen future dependencies.  Developers working on trivial web applications with few external dependencies may find little value   in the benefits that Bower brings to the table. That said, trivial web applications have a tendency to quickly  evolve into complex web applications, and as that process occurs, developers often come to appreciate  Bower’s benefits.  Regardless of how complex  or simple  you consider your project to be, we would encourage you to  consider integrating Bower into your workflow sooner rather than later. As bitter experience has taught  us—the project itself. Err on the side of too little structure, and you risk creating an ever-increasing burden  of “technical debt” for which you must eventually pay a price. The process of striking a delicate balance  between these undesired alternatives is as much an art as it is a science. It is also a process that is never fully  learned, but must continuously be adapted as the tools of our trade change.  9  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 2  Grunt  I’m lazy. But it’s the lazy people who invented the wheel and the bicycle because they didn’t  like walking or carrying things.  —Lech Walesa, former president of Poland  In his book Programming Perl, Larry Wall  the well-known creator of the language  puts forth the idea that  all successful programmers share three important characteristics: laziness, impatience, and hubris. At first  glance, these traits all sound quite negative, but dig a little deeper, and you’ll find the hidden meaning in his  statement:  Laziness: Lazy programmers hate to repeat themselves. As a result, they tend to  put a lot of effort into creating useful tools that perform repetitive tasks for them.  They also tend to document those tools well, to spare themselves the trouble of  answering questions about them later.  Impatience: Impatient programmers have learned to expect much from their  tools. This expectation teaches them to create software that doesn’t just react to  the needs of its users, but that actually attempts to anticipate those needs.  Hubris: Good programmers take great pride in their work. It is this pride that  compels them to write software that others won’t want to criticize—the type of  work that we should all be striving for.  In this chapter, we’ll focus on the first of these three characteristics, laziness, along with Grunt, a   popular JavaScript “task runner” that supports developers in nurturing this trait by providing them with a  toolkit for automating the repetitive build tasks that often accompany software development, such as:  Script and stylesheet compilation and minification  Testing   	  	  	  	 Database migrations  	 Deployments  Linting  11  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 2   Grunt  In other words, Grunt helps developers who strive to work smarter, not harder. If that idea appeals to   you, read on. After you have finished this chapter, you will be well on your way toward mastering Grunt.  You’ll learn how to do the following in this chapter:   	 Create configurable tasks that automate the repetitive aspects of software   development that accompany nearly every project   	   	   	  Interact with the file system using simple yet powerful abstractions provided   by Grunt  Publish Grunt plugins from which other developers can benefit and to which they  can contribute  Take advantage of Grunt’s preexisting library of community-supported plugins, of  which over 4,400 examples exist at the time of writing  Before continuing, you should ensure that you have installed Grunt’s command-line utility. Available as an  npm package, the installation process is shown in Listing 2-1.  Listing 2-1.  Installing the grunt Command-Line Utility via npm  Installing Grunt  $ npm install -g grunt-cli $ grunt --version grunt-cli v0.1.13  How Grunt Works  Grunt provides developers with a toolkit for creating command-line utilities that perform repetitive project  tasks. Examples of such tasks include the minification of JavaScript code and the compilation of Sass  stylesheets, but there’s no limit to how Grunt can be put to work. Grunt can be used to create simple tasks  that address the specific needs of a single project—tasks that you don’t intend to share or reuse—but Grunt’s  true power derives from its ability to package tasks as reusable plugins that can then be published, shared,  used, and improved upon by others. At the time of this writing, over 4,400 such plugins exist.  Four core components make Grunt tick, which we will now cover.  Gruntfile.js At Grunt’s core lies the Gruntfile, a Node module saved as Gruntfile.js  see Listing 2-2  at the root of  your project. It’s within this file that we can load Grunt plugins, create our own custom tasks, and configure  them according to the needs of our project. Each time Grunt is run, its first order of business is to retrieve its  marching orders from this module.  12  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 2   Grunt  Listing 2-2.  Sample Gruntfile     example-starter Gruntfile.js   module.exports = function grunt  {        **      * Configure the various tasks and plugins that we'll be using      *      grunt.initConfig {          * Grunt's 'file' API provides developers with helpful abstractions for         interacting  with the file system.

In Listing 2-2, a simple hello-world task is shown that  prints a message to the console. This task can be called from the command line as shown in Listing 2-3.  Listing 2-3.  Running the hello-world Task Shown in Listing 2-2  Multiple Grunt tasks can also be run in sequence with a single command, as shown in Listing 2-4.    Each task will be run in the order in which it was passed.  $ grunt hello-world Running "hello-world" task Hello, world.   Done, without errors.  Listing 2-4.  Running Multiple Grunt Tasks in Sequence  $ grunt hello-world uglify Running "hello-world" task Hello, world.   Running "uglify:development"  uglify  task >> 1 file created.   Done, without errors.  The hello-world task that we’ve just seen serves as an example of a basic, stand-alone Grunt task. Such  tasks can be used to implement simple actions specific to the needs of a single project that you don’t intend  to re-use or share. Most of the time, however, you will find yourself interacting not with stand-alone tasks,  but instead with tasks that have been packaged as Grunt plugins and published to npm so that others can  reuse them and contribute to them.  Plugins A Grunt plugin is a collection of configurable tasks  published as an npm package  that can be reused across  multiple projects. Thousands of such plugins exist. In Listing 2-2, Grunt’s loadNpmTasks   method is used to  load the grunt-contrib-uglify Node module, a Grunt plugin that merges a project’s JavaScript code into a  single, minified file that is suitable for deployment.   a list of all available Grunt plugins can be found at http:  gruntjs.com plugins. plugins whose      Note  names are prefixed with contrib- are officially maintained by the developers behind Grunt.  14  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 2   Grunt  Configuration Grunt is known for emphasizing “configuration over code”: the creation of tasks and plugins whose  functionality is tailored by configuration that is specified within each project. It is this separation of code  from configuration that allows developers to create plugins that are easily reusable by others. Later in the  chapter, we’ll take a look at the various ways in which Grunt plugins and tasks can be configured.  Adding Grunt to Your Project  Earlier in the chapter, we installed Grunt’s command-line utility by installing the grunt-cli npm package  as a global module. We should now have access to the grunt utility from the command line, but we still  need to add a local grunt dependency to each project we intend to use it with. The command to be called  from within the root folder of your project is shown next. This example assumes that npm has already been  initialized within the project and that a package.json file already exists.  $ npm install grunt --save-dev  Our project’s package.json file should now contain a grunt entry similar to that shown in Listing 2-5.  Listing 2-5.  Our Project’s Updated package.json File     example-tasks package.json   {     "name": "example-tasks",     "version": "1.0.0",     "devDependencies": {         "grunt": "0.4.5"     } }  Listing 2-6.  Contents of Our Project’s Gruntfile     example-tasks Gruntfile.js   module.exports = function grunt  {     grunt.loadTasks 'tasks' ; };  The final step toward integrating Grunt with our project is the creation of a Gruntfile  see Listing 2-6 ,  which should be saved within the root folder of the project. Within our Gruntfile, a single method is called,  loadTasks  , which is discussed in the upcoming section.  Maintaining a Sane Grunt Structure We hope that by the time you have finished this chapter, you will have found Grunt to be a worthwhile tool  for automating many of the repetitive, tedious tasks that you encounter during the course of your daily  workflow. That said, we’d be lying if we told you that our initial reaction to Grunt was positive. In fact,  we were quite turned off by the tool at first. To help explain why, let’s take a look at the Gruntfile that is  prominently displayed within Grunt’s official documentation  see Listing 2-7 .  15  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 2   Grunt  Listing 2-7.  Example Gruntfile Provided by Grunt’s Official Documentation  module.exports = function grunt  {       grunt.initConfig {         pkg: grunt.file.readJSON 'package.json' ,         concat: {             options: {                 separator: ';'             },             dist: {                 src: ['src ** *.js'],                 dest: 'dist  .js'             }         },         uglify: {             options: {                 banner: ' *!   * \n'             },             dist: {                 files: {                     'dist  .min.js': [' ']                 }             }         },         qunit: {             files: ['test ** *.html']         },         jshint: {             files: ['Gruntfile.js', 'src ** *.js', 'test ** *.js'],             options: {                    options here to override JSHint defaults                 globals: {                     jQuery: true,                     console: true,                     module: true,                     document: true                 }             }         },         watch: {             files: [' '],             tasks: ['jshint', 'qunit']         }     } ;    16  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 2   Grunt      grunt.loadNpmTasks 'grunt-contrib-uglify' ;     grunt.loadNpmTasks 'grunt-contrib-jshint' ;     grunt.loadNpmTasks 'grunt-contrib-qunit' ;     grunt.loadNpmTasks 'grunt-contrib-watch' ;     grunt.loadNpmTasks 'grunt-contrib-concat' ;       grunt.registerTask 'test', ['jshint', 'qunit'] ;       grunt.registerTask 'default', ['jshint', 'qunit', 'concat', 'uglify'] ;   };  The Gruntfile shown in Listing 2-7 is for a relatively simple project. We already find this example to be   slightly unwieldy, but within larger projects we have seen this file balloon to many times this size. The result  is an unreadable and difficult-to-maintain mess. Experienced developers would never write their code in a  way that combines functionality from across unrelated areas into a single, monolithic file, so why should we  approach our task runner any differently?  The secret to maintaining a sane Grunt structure lies with Grunt’s loadTasks   function, as shown in  Listing 2-6. In this example, the tasks argument refers to a tasks folder relative to our project’s Gruntfile.  Once this method is called, Grunt will load and execute each Node module it finds within this folder,  passing along a reference to the grunt object each time. This behavior provides us with the opportunity to  organize our project’s Grunt configuration as a series of separate modules, each responsible for loading and  configuring a single task or plugin. An example of one of these smaller modules is shown in Listing 2-8. This  task can be executed by running grunt uglify from the command line.  Listing 2-8.  Example Module  uglify.js  Within Our New tasks Folder     example-tasks tasks uglify.js   module.exports = function grunt  {       grunt.loadNpmTasks 'grunt-contrib-uglify' ;       grunt.config 'uglify', {         'options': {             'banner': ' *!   * \n'         },         'dist': {             'files': {                 'dist app.min.js': ['src index.js']             }         }     } ;   };  17  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 2   Grunt  Working with Tasks  As previously mentioned, tasks serve as the foundation on which Grunt is built—everything begins here.   A Grunt plugin, as you’ll soon discover, is nothing more than one or more tasks that have been packaged into  a Node module and published via npm. We’ve already seen a few examples that demonstrate the creation of  basic Grunt tasks, so let’s take a look at some additional features that can help us get the most out of them.  Managing Configuration Grunt’s config   method serves as both a “getter” and a “setter” for configuration. In Listing 2-9, we see how  a basic Grunt task can access its configuration through the use of this method.  Listing 2-9.  Managing Configuration Within a Basic Grunt Task  module.exports = function grunt  {       grunt.config 'basic-task', {         'message': 'Hello, world.'     } ;       grunt.registerTask 'basic-task', function   {         grunt.log.writeln grunt.config 'basic-task.message'  ;     } ;   };   In Listing 2-9, “dot notation” is used for accessing nested configuration values. In the same way,      Note  dot notation can be used to set nested configuration values. If at any point Grunt encounters a path within the  configuration object that does not exist, Grunt will create a new, empty object without throwing an error.  Task Descriptions Over time, projects have a tendency to grow in complexity. With this additional complexity often comes  new Grunt tasks. As new tasks are added, it’s often easy to lose track of what tasks are available, what they  do, and how they are called. Fortunately, Grunt provides us with a way to address this problem by assigning  descriptions to our tasks, as shown in Listing 2-10.  Listing 2-10.  Assigning a Description to a Grunt Task     example-task-description Gruntfile.js   module.exports = function grunt  {       grunt.config 'basic-task', {         'message': 'Hello, world.'     } ;    18  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 2   Grunt      grunt.registerTask 'basic-task', 'This is an example task.', function   {         grunt.log.writeln grunt.config 'basic-task.message'  ;     } ;       grunt.registerTask 'default', 'This is the default task.', ['basic-task'] ;   };  By passing an additional argument to the registerTask   method, Grunt allows us to provide a   description for the task being created. Grunt helpfully provides this information when help is requested from  the command line, as shown in Listing 2-11, which includes an excerpt of the information Grunt provides.  Listing 2-11.  Requesting Help from the Command Line  $ grunt --help ... Available tasks     basic-task  This is an example task.        default  This is the default task. ...  Asynchronous Tasks By default, Grunt tasks are expected to run synchronously. As soon as a task’s function returns, it  is considered finished. There will be times, however, when you find yourself interacting with other  asynchronous methods within a task, which must first complete before your task can hand control back over  to Grunt. The solution to this problem is shown in Listing 2-12. Within a task, a call to the async   method  will notify Grunt that it executes asynchronously. The method will return a callback function to be called  when our task has completed. Until this is done, Grunt will hold the execution of any additional tasks.  Listing 2-12.  Asynchronous Grunt Task     example-async tasks list-files.js   var glob = require 'glob' ;   module.exports = function grunt  {       grunt.registerTask 'list-files', function   {            **          * Grunt will wait until we call the `done  ` function to indicate that our          * asynchronous task is complete.          *          var done = this.async  ;    19  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 2   Grunt          glob '*', function err, files  {             if  err  {                 grunt.fail.fatal err ;             }             grunt.log.writeln files ;             done  ;         } ;       } ;   };  Listing 2-13.  Declaring a Task Dependency     example-task-dependency tasks step-two.js   module.exports = function grunt  {     grunt.registerTask 'step-two', function   {         grunt.task.requires 'step-one' ;     } ; };  Task Dependencies Complicated Grunt workflows are best thought of as a series of steps that work together to produce a final  result. In such situations, it can often be helpful to specify that a task requires one or more separate tasks to  precede it, as shown in Listing 2-13.  In this example, the step-two task requires that the step-one task run first before it can proceed. Any   attempt to call step-two directly will result in an error, as shown in Listing 2-14.  Listing 2-14.  Grunt Reporting an Error When a Task Is Called Before Any Tasks on Which   It Depends Have Run  $ grunt step-two Running "step-two" task Warning: Required task "step-one" must be run first. Use --force to continue.   Aborted due to warnings.  Multi-Tasks In addition to basic tasks, Grunt offers support for what it calls “multi-tasks.” Multi-tasks are easily the most  complicated aspect of Grunt, so if you find yourself confused at first, you’re not alone. After reviewing a few  examples, however, their purpose should start to come into focus—at which point you’ll be well on your way  toward mastering Grunt.  Before we go any further, let’s take a look at a brief example  see Listing 2-15  that shows a Grunt    multi-task, along with its configuration.  20  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 2   Grunt  Listing 2-15.  Grunt Multi-Task     example-list-animals tasks list-animals.js   module.exports = function grunt  {        **      * Our multi-task's configuration object. In this example, 'mammals'      * and 'birds' each represent what Grunt refers to as a 'target.'      *      grunt.config 'list-animals', {         'mammals': {             'animals': ['Cat', 'Zebra', 'Koala', 'Kangaroo']         },         'birds': {             'animals': ['Penguin', 'Sparrow', 'Eagle', 'Parrot']         }     } ;       grunt.registerMultiTask 'list-animals', function   {         grunt.log.writeln 'Target:', this.target ;         grunt.log.writeln 'Data:', this.data ;     } ;   };  Multi-tasks are extremely flexible, in that they are designed to support multiple configurations  referred   to as “targets”  within a single project. The multi-task shown in Listing 2-15 has two targets: mammals and  birds. This task can be run against a specific target as shown in Listing 2-16.  Listing 2-16.  Running the Grunt Multi-Task Shown in Listing 2-15 Against a Specific Target  $ grunt list-animals:mammals Running "list-animals:mammals"  list-animals  task Target: mammals Data: { animals: [ 'Cat', 'Zebra', 'Koala', 'Kangaroo' ] }   Done, without errors.  Multi-tasks can also be called without any arguments, in which case they are executed multiple times,   once for each available target. Listing 2-17 shows the result of calling this task without specifying a target.  Listing 2-17.  Running the Multi-Task Shown in Listing 2-15 Without Specifying a Target  $ grunt list-animals Running "list-animals:mammals"  list-animals  task Target: mammals Data: { animals: [ 'Cat', 'Zebra', 'Koala', 'Kangaroo' ] }   Running "list-animals:birds"  list-animals  task Target: birds Data: { animals: [ 'Penguin', 'Sparrow', 'Eagle', 'Parrot' ] }  21  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 2   Grunt  In this example, our multi-task ran twice, once for each available target  mammals and birds . Notice   in Listing 2-15 that within our multi-task we referenced two properties: this.target and this.data. These  properties allow our multi-task to fetch information about the target that it is currently running against.  Multi-Task Options Within a multi-task’s configuration object, any values stored under the options key  see Listing 2-18  receive  special treatment.  Listing 2-18.  Grunt Multi-Task with Configuration Options     example-list-animals-options tasks list-animals.js   module.exports = function grunt  {       grunt.config 'list-animals', {         'options': {             'format': 'array'         },         'mammals': {             'options': {                 'format': 'json'             },             'animals': ['Cat', 'Zebra', 'Koala', 'Kangaroo']         },         'birds': {             'animals': ['Penguin', 'Sparrow', 'Eagle', 'Parrot']         }     } ;       grunt.registerMultiTask 'list-animals', function   {           var options = this.options  ;           switch  options.format  {             case 'array':                 grunt.log.writeln this.data.animals ;             break;             case 'json':                 grunt.log.writeln JSON.stringify this.data.animals  ;             break;             default:                 grunt.fail.fatal 'Unknown format: ' + options.format ;             break;         }       } ;   };  22  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 2   Grunt  Multi-task options provide developers with a mechanism for defining global options for a task, which   can then be overridden at the target level. In this example, a global format in which to list animals  'array'   is defined at the task level. The mammals target has chosen to override this value  'json' , while the birds  task has not. As a result, mammals will be displayed as JSON, while birds will be shown as an array due to its  inheritance of the global option.  The vast majority of Grunt plugins that you will encounter are configurable as multi-tasks. The flexibility   afforded by this approach allows you to apply the same task differently under different circumstances. A  frequently encountered scenario involves the creation of separate targets for each build environment. For  example, when compiling an application, you may want to modify the behavior of a task based on whether  you are compiling for a local development environment or in preparation for release to production.  Configuration Templates Grunt configuration objects support the embedding of template strings, which can then be used to reference  other configuration values. The template format favored by Grunt follows that of the Lodash and Underscore  utility libraries, which are covered in further detail in a later chapter. For an example of how this feature can  be put to use, see Listing 2-19 and Listing 2-20.  Listing 2-19.  Sample Gruntfile That Stores the Contents of Its Project’s package.json   File Under the pkg Key Within Grunt’s Configuration Object  Listing 2-20.  A Subsequently Loaded Task with Its Own Configuration That Is Able to Reference   Other Configuration Values Through the Use of Templates     example-templates Gruntfile.js   module.exports = function grunt  {     grunt.initConfig {         'pkg': grunt.file.readJSON 'package.json'      } ;     grunt.loadTasks 'tasks' ;     grunt.registerTask 'default', ['test'] ; };     example-templates tasks test.js   module.exports = function grunt  {     grunt.config 'test', {         'banner': ' - '     } ;     grunt.registerTask 'test', function   {         grunt.log.writeln grunt.config 'test.banner'  ;     } ; };  Listing 2-19 shows a sample Gruntfile that loads the contents of the project’s package.json file using  one of several built-in methods for interacting with the file system that are discussed in further detail later  in the chapter. The contents of this file are then stored under the pkg key of Grunt’s configuration object. In  Listing 2-20, we see a task that is able to directly reference this information through the use of configuration  templates.  23  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 2   Grunt  Command-Line Options Additional options can be passed to Grunt using the following format:  $ grunt count --count=5  The example shown in Listing 2-21 demonstrates how a Grunt task can access this information via the   grunt.option   method. The result of calling this task is shown in Listing 2-22.  Listing 2-21.  Simple Grunt Task That Counts to the Specified Number     example-options tasks count.js   module.exports = function grunt  {       grunt.registerTask 'count', function   {         var limit = parseInt grunt.option 'limit' , 10 ;         if  isNaN limit   grunt.fail.fatal 'A limit must be provided  e.g. --limit=10 ' ;         console.log 'Counting to: %s', limit ;         for  var i = 1; i <= limit; i++  console.log i ;     } ;   };  Listing 2-22.  Result of Calling the Task Shown in Listing 2-21  $ grunt count --limit=5 Running "count" task Counting to: 5 1 2 3 4 5   Done, without errors.  Providing Feedback Grunt provides a number of built-in methods for providing feedback to users during the execution of tasks,  a few of which you have already seen used throughout this chapter. While we won’t list all of them here,  several useful examples can be found in Table 2-1.  24  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 2   Grunt  Table 2-1.  Useful Grunt Methods for Displaying Feedback to the User  Method  Description  grunt.log.write    grunt.log.writeln    grunt.log.oklns    grunt.log.error    grunt.log.subhead    Prints a message to the console Prints a message to the console, followed by a newline character Prints a success message to the console, followed by a newline character Prints an error message to the console, followed by a newline character Prints a bold message to the console, following by a newline character  grunt.log.debug    Prints a message to the console only if the --debug flag was passed  Handling Errors During the course of task execution, errors can occur. When they do, it’s important to know how to  appropriately handle them. When faced with an error, developers should make use of Grunt’s error API,  which is easy to use, as it provides just two methods, shown in Table 2-2.  Table 2-2.  Methods Available via Grunt’s error API  Method  Description  grunt.fail.warn    Displays a warning and aborts Grunt immediately. Tasks will continue to run  if the --force option is passed.  grunt.fail.fatal    Displays a warning and aborts Grunt immediately.  Interacting with the File System  As a build tool, it comes as no surprise that the majority of Grunt’s plugins interact with the file system in one  way or another. Given its importance, Grunt provides helpful abstractions that allow developers to interact  with the file system with a minimal amount of boilerplate code.  While we won’t list all of them here, Table 2-3 shows several of the most frequently used methods within   Grunt’s file API.  Table 2-3.  Useful Grunt Methods for Interacting with the File System  Method  Description  grunt.file.read   grunt.file.readJSON   Reads a file’s contents, parsing the data as JSON, and returns the result grunt.file.write    Reads and returns file’s contents  grunt.file.copy    grunt.file.delete    grunt.file.mkdir    Writes the specified contents to a file, creating intermediate directories, if necessary Copies a source file to a destination path, creating intermediate directories, if  necessary Deletes the specified file path; deletes files and folders recursively Creates a directory, along with any missing intermediate directories  grunt.file.recurse    Recurses into a directory, executing a callback for every file that is found  25  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 2   Grunt  Source-Destination Mappings Many Grunt tasks that interact with the file system rely heavily on the concept of source-destination mappings,  a format that describes a set of files to be processed and a corresponding destination for each. Such mappings  can be tedious to construct, but thankfully Grunt provides helpful shortcuts that address this need.  Imagine for a moment that you are working on a project with a public folder located at its root. Within   this folder are the files to be served over the Web once the project is deployed, as shown in Listing 2-23.  Listing 2-23.  Contents of an Imaginary Project’s public Folder     example-iterate1   . └── public     └── images         ├── cat1.jpg         ├── cat2.jpg         └── cat3.png  As you can see, our project has an images folder containing three files. Knowing this, let’s take a look at   a few ways in which Grunt can help us iterate through these files.  In Listing 2-24, we find a Grunt multi-task similar to those we’ve recently been introduced to. The key  difference here is the presence of an src key within our task’s configuration. Grunt gives special attention  to multi-task configurations that contain this key, as we’ll soon see. When the src key is present, Grunt  provides a this.files property within our task that provides an array containing paths to every matching  file that is found via the node-glob module. The output from this task is shown in Listing 2-25.  Listing 2-24.  Grunt Multi-Task with a Configuration Object Containing an src Key     example-iterate1 tasks list-files.js   module.exports = function grunt  {       grunt.config 'list-files', {         'images': {             'src': ['public ** *.jpg', 'public ** *.png']         }     } ;       grunt.registerMultiTask 'list-files', function   {         this.files.forEach function files  {             grunt.log.writeln 'Source:', files.src ;         } ;     } ;   };  26  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 2   Grunt  Listing 2-25.  Output from the Grunt Task Shown in Listing 2-24  $ grunt list-files Running "list-files:images"  list-files  task Source: [ 'public images cat1.jpg',   'public images cat2.jpg',   'public images cat3.png' ]   Done, without errors.  The combination of the src configuration property and the this.files multi-task property provides   developers with a concise syntax for iterating over multiple files. The contrived example that we’ve just  looked at is fairly simple, but Grunt also provides additional options for tackling more complex scenarios.  Let’s take a look.  As opposed to the src key that was used to configure our task in Listing 2-24, the example in Listing 2-26   demonstrates the use of the files array—a slightly more verbose, but more powerful format for selecting  files. This format accepts additional options that allow us to more finely tune our selection. Of particular  importance is the expand option, as you’ll see in Listing 2-27. Pay close attention to how the output differs  from that of Listing 2-26, due to the use of the expand option.  Listing 2-26.  Iterating Through Files Using the “Files Array” Format     example-iterate2 tasks list-files.js   module.exports = function grunt  {       grunt.config 'list-files', {         'images': {             'files': [                 {                     'cwd': 'public',                     'src': ['** *.jpg', '** *.png'],                     'dest': 'tmp',                     'expand': true                 }             ]         }     } ;       grunt.registerMultiTask 'list-files', function   {         this.files.forEach function files  {             grunt.log.writeln 'Source:', files.src ;             grunt.log.writeln 'Destination:', files.dest ;         } ;     } ;   };  27  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 2   Grunt  Listing 2-27.  Output from the Grunt Task shown in Listing 2-26  $ grunt list-files Running "list-files:images"  list-files  task Source: [ 'public images cat1.jpg' ] Destination: tmp images cat1.jpg Source: [ 'public images cat2.jpg' ] Destination: tmp images cat2.jpg   Done, without errors.  The expand option, when paired with the dest option, instructs Grunt to iterate through our task’s  this.files.forEach loop once for every entry it finds, within which we can find a corresponding dest  property. Using this approach, we can easily create source-destination mappings that can be used to copy   or move  files from one location to another.  Watching for File Changes One of Grunt’s most popular plugins, grunt-contrib-watch, gives Grunt the ability to run predefined tasks  whenever files that match a specified pattern are created, modified, or deleted. When combined with other  tasks, grunt-contrib-watch enables developers to create powerful workflows that automate actions such as   	 Checking JavaScript code for errors  i.e., “linting”   	 Compiling Sass L stylesheets  	  Running unit tests  Let’s take a look at a few examples that demonstrate such workflows put into action.  Automated JavaScript Linting Listing 2-28 shows a basic Grunt setup similar to those already shown in this chapter. A default task is  registered which serves as an alias to the watch task, allowing us to start watching for changes within our  project by simply running $ grunt from the command line. In this example, Grunt will watch for changes  within the src folder. As they occur, the jshint task is triggered, which will scan our project’s src folder in  search of JavaScript errors.  Listing 2-28.  Automatically Checking for JavaScript Errors As Changes Occur     example-watch-hint Gruntfile.js   module.exports = function grunt  {     grunt.loadTasks 'tasks' ;     grunt.registerTask 'default', ['watch'] ; };      example-watch-hint tasks jshint.js   module.exports = function grunt  {       grunt.loadNpmTasks 'grunt-contrib-jshint' ;    28  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 2   Grunt      grunt.config 'jshint', {         'options': {             'globalstrict': true,             'node': true,             'scripturl': true,             'browser': true,             'jquery': true         },         'all': [             'src ** *.js'         ]     } ;   };      example-watch-hint tasks watch.js   module.exports = function grunt  {       grunt.loadNpmTasks 'grunt-contrib-watch' ;       grunt.config 'watch', {         'js': {             'files': [                 'src ** *'             ],             'tasks': ['jshint'],             'options': {                 'spawn': true             }         }     } ;   };  Automated Sass Stylesheet Compilation Listing 2-29 shows an example in which Grunt is instructed to watch our project for changes. This time, however,  instead of watching our JavaScript, Grunt is configured to watch our project’s Sass stylesheets. As changes occur,  the grunt-contrib-compass plugin is called, which compiles our stylesheets into their final form.  Listing 2-29.  Automatically Compiling Sass Stylesheets As Changes Occur     example-watch-sass Gruntfile.js   module.exports = function grunt  {     grunt.loadTasks 'tasks' ;     grunt.registerTask 'default', ['watch'] ; };    29  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 2   Grunt     example-watch-sass tasks compass.js   module.exports = function grunt  {       grunt.loadNpmTasks 'grunt-contrib-compass' ;       grunt.config 'compass', {         'all': {             'options': {                 'httpPath': ' ',                 'cssDir': 'public css',                 'sassDir': 'scss',                 'imagesDir': 'public images',                 'relativeAssets': true,                 'outputStyle': 'compressed'             }         }     } ;   };      example-watch-compass tasks watch.js   module.exports = function grunt  {       grunt.loadNpmTasks 'grunt-contrib-watch' ;       grunt.config 'watch', {         'scss': {             'files': [                 'scss ** *'             ],             'tasks': ['compass'],             'options': {                 'spawn': true             }         }     } ;   };     Note   In order for this example to function, you must install Compass, an open source CSS authoring  framework. You can find additional information on how to install Compass at http:  compass-style.org  install.  30  www.it-ebooks.info   Automated Unit Testing Our final example regarding grunt-contrib-watch concerns unit testing. In Listing 2-30, we see a Gruntfile  that watches our project’s JavaScript for changes. As these changes occur, our project’s unit tests are  immediately triggered with the help of Grunt’s grunt-mocha-test plugin.  Listing 2-30.  Automatically Running Unit Tests As Changes Occur  Chapter 2   Grunt     example-watch-test Gruntfile.js   module.exports = function grunt  {     grunt.loadTasks 'tasks' ;     grunt.registerTask 'default', ['watch'] ; };      example-watch-test tasks mochaTest.js   module.exports = function grunt  {       grunt.loadNpmTasks 'grunt-mocha-test' ;       grunt.config 'mochaTest', {         'test': {             'options': {                 'reporter': 'spec'             },             'src': ['test ** *.js']         }     } ;   };      example-watch-test tasks watch.js   module.exports = function grunt  {       grunt.loadNpmTasks 'grunt-contrib-watch' ;       grunt.config 'watch', {         'scss': {             'files': [                 'src ** *.js'             ],             'tasks': ['mochaTest'],             'options': {                 'spawn': true             }         }     } ;   };  31  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 2   Grunt  Creating Plugins  A large library of community-supported plugins is what makes Grunt truly shine—a library that will allow  you to start benefitting from Grunt immediately, without the need to create complex tasks from scratch. If  you need to automate a build process within your project, there’s a good chance that someone has already  done the “grunt” work  zing!  for you.  In this section, you’ll discover how you can contribute back to the community with Grunt plugins of   your own creation.  Getting Started One of the first things you’ll want to do is create a public GitHub repository in which to store your new plugin.  The example that we will be referencing is included with the source code that accompanies this book. Once your new repository is ready, clone it to your computer. Next, initialize Grunt within it by   following the same steps that were outlined earlier in this chapter’s “Adding Grunt to Your Project” section.  Afterward, the file structure of your new Grunt plugin should resemble that shown in Listing 2-31.  Listing 2-31.  File Structure of Your New Grunt Plugin  . ├── Gruntfile.js ├── README.md ├── package.json └── tasks   the most important point to note here is that there is no special structure or knowledge required      Note   apart from what has already been covered in this chapter  for the creation of Grunt plugins. the process  mirrors that of integrating Grunt into an existing project—the creation of a Gruntfile that loads tasks, along with  the tasks themselves. Once published to npm, other Grunt projects will be able to load your plugin in the same  way that other plugins have been referenced throughout this chapter.  Creating the Task By way of an example, let’s create a Grunt plugin capable of generating a report that details the type, size,  and number of files contained within a project. An example demonstrating the configuration for this plugin  is shown in Listing 2-32.  Listing 2-32.  Example Demonstrating the Configuration of Our Plugin     example-plugin Gruntfile.js   module.exports = function grunt  {       grunt.config 'file-report', {         'options': {         },         'public': {             'src': ['public ** *']         },  32  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 2   Grunt          'images': {             'src': ['public ** *.jpg', 'public ** *.png', 'public ** *.gif']         }     } ;       grunt.loadNpmTasks 'grunt-file-reporter' ;     grunt.registerTask 'default', ['file-report'] ;   };  The source code for our plugin is shown in Listing 2-33. Within our plugin, a Grunt multi-task named   file-report is registered. When called, the task will iterate through the various target files that were  specified in Listing 2-32. As it does so, the plugin will compile a report that details the type, number, and size  of the files it finds.  Listing 2-33.

Weilacher  The development community has witnessed a role-reversal of sorts take place in recent years. Web  applications, once considered by many to be second-class citizens in comparison to their native  counterparts, have largely supplanted traditional desktop applications, thanks in large part to the  widespread adoption of modern web development technologies and the rise of the mobile Web. But as web  applications have grown increasingly sophisticated, so too have the tools on which they rely and the steps  required to bootstrap them into existence.  The topic of this chapter, Yeoman, is a popular project “scaffolding” tool that helps to alleviate this   problem by automating the tedious tasks associated with bootstrapping new applications off the ground.  Yeoman provides a mechanism for creating reusable templates that describe a project’s initial file structure,  HTML, third-party libraries, and task runner configurations. These templates, which can be shared with the  wider development community via npm, allow developers to bootstrap new projects that follow agreed- upon best practices in a matter of minutes. In this chapter, you will learn how to:  Install Yeoman   	  	  Take advantage of Yeoman generators that have already been published by the  community   	 Contribute back to the community with your own Yeoman generators     Note  This chapter builds on topics that have already been covered in this book’s first two chapters on  Bower and Grunt. If you are unfamiliar with either of these tools, you may wish to read the respective chapter  for that tool before you continue.  37  www.it-ebooks.info   Yeoman’s command-line utility, yo, is available via npm. If you have not already installed Yeoman, you  should do so before you continue, as shown in Listing 3-1.  ChapTer 3   Yeoman  Installing Yeoman  Listing 3-1.  Installing the yo Command-Line Utility via npm  $ npm install -g yo $ yo --version 1.4.6  Creating Your First Project  Yeoman allows developers to quickly create the initial structure of an application through the use of reusable  templates, which Yeoman refers to as “generators.” To better understand how this process can improve your  workflow, let’s create a new project with the help of the modernweb generator that was created specifically for  this chapter. Afterward, we will look at how this generator was created, providing you with the knowledge  you need to create and share your own custom Yeoman generators with the wider development community.  The generator we will be using will create the initial foundations of a project that uses the following   Bower  tools and libraries:  	 Grunt  	  	  	  	 Browserify  	 Compass  AngularJS  jQuery  Yeoman generators are installed as global npm modules. That being the case, the command for   installing our generator should look familiar:  $ npm install -g generator-modernweb     Note  This generator’s name is prefixed with generator-, which is an important convention that all Yeoman  generators must follow. at runtime, Yeoman will determine what  if any  generators have been installed by  searching for global modules whose names follow this format.  With our generator now installed, we can move forward with setting up our first project. First, we create   a new folder to contain it. Afterward, we instruct Yeoman to create a new project based on the generator  that we just installed. Listing 3-2 shows these steps in action, along with several questions the generator is  designed to prompt you with.  38  www.it-ebooks.info   ChapTer 3   Yeoman  Listing 3-2.  Creating Our First Project with the modernweb Generator  $ mkdir my-app $ cd my-app $ yo modernweb   ? Project Title: My Project ? Package Name: my-project ? Project Description: My awesome project ? Project Author: John Doe ? Express Port: 7000  After responding to the generator’s questions  you can safely accept the defaults , Yeoman will move  forward with creating the project. Afterward, we can easily build and launch it using the project’s default  Grunt task, which our generator has conveniently set up for us  see Listing 3-3 .  Listing 3-3.  Our New Project’s Default Grunt Task Will Trigger Various Build Steps and Open the Project  Within Our Browser  $ grunt Running "concat:app"  concat  task File public dist libs.js created.   Running "compass:app"  compass  task unchanged scss style.scss Compilation took 0.002s   Running "browserify" task   Running "concurrent:app"  concurrent  task Running "watch" task Waiting… Running "open:app"  open  task Running "server" task Server is now listening on port: 7000   Done, without errors.  As you can see, our new project’s default Grunt task executes several additional build steps for us:  JavaScript libraries are compiled into a single, minified script.  Sass stylesheets are compiled.  The source code of the application itself is compiled via Browserify.  An instance of Express is created to serve our project.   	  	  	  	  	  Various watch scripts are initialized that will automatically recompile our project as  changes are made.  The final action of our project’s default Grunt task will be to launch our project within a new browser   window, as shown in Figure 3-1.  39  www.it-ebooks.info   ChapTer 3   Yeoman  Figure 3-1.  Our new project’s home page, opened for us by the default Grunt task  Now that our new project is ready for further development, let’s take a few moments to become familiar  with the various templates, scripts, and Grunt tasks that our generator has put in place for us, paying special  attention to the contents of these files:  With the help of Yeoman’s support for user prompts and templates  which we will discuss in more detail   in the next section , the generator has merged our answers to its initial questions with the contents of our  project’s files, where appropriate. For instance, the values for name, description, and author within our  project’s package.json file have been set for us  see Listing 3-4 .  Listing 3-4.  Contents of Our Project’s package.json File   	  	  	  	  bower.json  Gruntfile.js  package.json  public index.html     package.json   {   "name": "my-project",   "description": "My awesome project",   "author": "John Doe",   "files": [],   "keywords": [],   "dependencies": {},   "browserify": {     "transform": [       "brfs",  40  www.it-ebooks.info   ChapTer 3   Yeoman        "bulkify",       "folderify"     ]   },   "browser": {} }  Subcommands In their simplest form, generators act as configurable project templates that simplify the creation of  new projects, but that’s not their only purpose. In addition to assisting with the initial creation of new  projects, generators can also include other commands that project maintainers will find useful throughout  development.  In Listing 3-2, we used the modernweb generator to create a new single-page application built using the  AngularJS framework. If you are unfamiliar with Angular, don’t worry—the particulars of this framework are  unimportant for now. What is important, however, is the contents of the project’s public app routes folder.  Notice that a single folder, dashboard, has been created for us at this location. The contents of this folder is  shown in Listing 3-5.  Listing 3-5.  Contents of Our Project’s public app routes dashboard Folder  . ├── index.js └── template.html      public app routes dashboard index.js   module.exports = {     'route': ' dashboard',     'controller': function   {     },     'templateUrl': ' app routes dashboard template.html',     'resolve': {} };      public app routes dashboard template.html         Welcome to the " dashboard" route.    This project has been set up such that each folder within public app routes defines a different   “hashbang” route within the application. In this example, the project’s dashboard folder defines a route that  can be accessed at http:  localhost:7000  dashboard. Knowing this, suppose that we wanted to add a  new users route to our application. To do so, we could manually create the necessary files at the appropriate  location. Alternatively, we could use an additional command provided by our generator that simplifies this  process  see Listing 3-6 .  41  www.it-ebooks.info   ChapTer 3   Yeoman  Listing 3-6.  Example of Calling the route Sub-generator to Automate the Process of Creating New Routes  Within Our Angular Application  $ yo modernweb:route users    create public app routes users index.js    create public app routes users template.html Route `users` created.  After running this command, refer to the project’s  public app routes folder and note the existence   of a new folder named users. Within this folder, our Yeoman generator has taken care of creating the  appropriate files for us. If you happen to still have the server that we created in Listing 3-3 running, you  should also be able to see that the watch scripts that were started for us have detected this change and  automatically recompiled our application  see Listing 3-7 .  Listing 3-7.  Grunt Automatically Recompiles Application As Changes Are Made  >> File "public app routes users" added. Running "browserify" task Done, without errors.  Creating Your First Generator  The remainder of this chapter will focus on the creation of a custom Yeoman generator—the same one used  in the previous section to bootstrap a new project built around AngularJS  among other tools . Afterward,  you will be well prepared to begin creating your own generators that will allow you to quickly get up-and- running with workflows that meet your specific needs.  Yeoman Generators are Node Modules A Yeoman generator is nothing more than a simple Node module that follows Yeoman’s prescribed  guidelines. As such, the first step in creating a generator is the creation of a new Node module. Listing 3-8  shows the required commands, along with the resulting package.json file.  Listing 3-8.  Creating a New Node Module to Contain the Contents of Our First Yeoman Generator  $ mkdir generator-example $ cd generator-example $ npm init      generator-example package.json {   "name": "generator-example",   "version": "1.0.0",   "description": "An example Yeoman generator",   "files": [],   "keywords": [     "yeoman-generator"   ],   "dependencies": {} }  42  www.it-ebooks.info   ChapTer 3   Yeoman     Note  although we are following the same steps that were used to create the modernweb generator that  was referenced earlier in this chapter, we are assigning a different name to our new module, so as not to  conflict with the one that has already been installed. also note the inclusion of yeoman-generator within our  module’s list of keywords. Yeoman’s website maintains a list of every generator available within npm, making it  easy for developers to find preexisting generators to suit their needs. If a generator is to be included within this  list, it must include this keyword, along with a description in its package.json file.  Yeoman generators have the option of relying on external dependencies, as is the case with any other   Node module. At a bare minimum, however, every generator must specify the yeoman-generator module as  a local dependency. This module will provide us with the core functionality provided by Yeoman for creating  user interactions, interacting with the file system, and other important tasks. This module is installed as a  local dependency using the following command:  $ npm install yeoman-generator --save  Sub-Generators Yeoman generators consist of one or more commands, each of which can be called separately from the  command line. These commands, which Yeoman refers to as “sub-generators,” are defined within folders  that exist at the root level of the module. For some additional context, refer back to Listing 3-2, in which we  created a new project based off of the modernweb generator by running $ yo modernweb from the command  line. In that example, we did not specify a command—we simply passed Yeoman the name of a generator. As  a result, Yeoman executed that generator’s default sub-generator, which by convention is always named app.  We could have accomplished the same thing by running this command:  $ yo modernweb:app  To better understand how this works, let’s move forward with creating our generator’s default app    sub-generator. We do so in four steps:              1.  Create a folder named app at the root level of our module.  2.  Create a folder named templates within our new app folder.  3.  Place various files within our templates folder that we want to copy into the  target project  e.g., HTML files, Grunt tasks, a Bower manifest, and so forth .  4.  Create the script shown in Listing 3-9, which is responsible for driving the   functionality for this command.  Listing 3-9.

The contents of our generator’s app folder. The contents of the templates folder will be copied into  the target project  In Listing 3-9, our generator’s default app command is created by exporting a class that extends from   Yeoman’s Base class. Within this class, four instance methods are defined:  prompting    writing    install    end     	  	  	  	   	  	  	  	   	  	  	  	  These method names play an important role during execution  they were not arbitrarily chosen . When   Yeoman runs a generator, it searches for prototype methods whose names match those listed here:  initializing  : Initialization methods  checking project state, getting configs .  prompting  : Prompting the user for information  configuring  : Saving configuration files.  default  : Prototype methods with names not included within this list will be  executed during this step.  writing  : Write operations specific to this generator occur here.  conflicts  : Conflicts are handled here  used internally by Yeoman .  install  : Installation procedures occur here  npm, bower .  end  : Last function to be called. Cleanup closing messages.  47  www.it-ebooks.info   ChapTer 3   Yeoman  Once Yeoman has compiled a list of the various prototype methods that exist within our generator, it   will execute them in the priority shown in the preceding list.  Lodash Templates In Listing 3-9, Yeoman’s fs.copyTpl   method was used to copy files from our sub-generator’s templates  folder to the target project. This method differs from Yeoman’s fs.copy   method, in that it also processes  each file it finds as a Lodash template. Listing 3-10 shows the contents of our sub-generator’s templates  pkg.json file, which will be processed in this way before being saved to the folder of the new project as  package.json.  Listing 3-10.  Contents of Our Sub-generator’s templates pkg.json File     generator-example app templates pkg.json   {   "name": " ",   "description": " ",   "author": " ",   "files": [],   "keywords": [],   "dependencies": {},   "browserify": {     "transform": [       "brfs",       "bulkify",       "folderify"     ]   },   "browser": {} }     Note  The process by which Yeoman generators can modify their behavior and alter the contents of  templates based on a user’s answers to prompts opens up a lot of exciting possibilities. It allows for the creation  of new projects that are dynamically configured according to a user’s specific needs. It’s this aspect of Yeoman,  more than any other, that makes the tool truly useful.  We’re now ready to create our first project using our new generator. To do so, open a new terminal   window and create a folder to contain it. Next, move into the new folder and run the generator, as shown in  Listing 3-11.  Listing 3-11.  Running Our New Generator for the First Time  $ mkdir new-project $ cd new-project $ yo example   Error example    48  www.it-ebooks.info   ChapTer 3   Yeoman  You don't seem to have a generator with the name example installed. You can see available generators with npm search yeoman-generator and then install the with npm install [name].  Obviously, this isn’t the result we were hoping for. To understand what caused this error, recall from earlier   in the chapter that when Yeoman is called, it locates generators by searching for modules whose names begin  with generator- that have been installed in the global context. As a result, Yeoman is currently unaware of  the existence of our new generator. Fortunately, npm provides a handy command that will solve this problem  for us. The npm link command creates a symbolic link  symlink  between our new module and Node’s global  modules folder. The command is executed at the root level of our new module  see Listing 3-12 .  Listing 3-12.  Creating a Symbolic Link with the npm link Command  $ npm link  Users tim .nvm v0.10.33 lib node_modules generator-example ->  opt generator-example  Npm’s link command creates a symbolic link between the folder in which it is run and the folder in  which globally installed Node modules are stored. By running this command, we place a reference to our  new generator in a location that Yeoman can find. With this link in place, let’s run our generator again    see Listing 3-13 .  Listing 3-13.  Successfully Running Our New Generator for the First Time  $ yo example   ? Project Title: My Project ? Package Name: my-project ? Project Description: My awesome project ? Project Author: John Doe ? Express Port: 7000  After responding to the generator’s questions, Yeoman will move forward with building our new project,   just as it did with the modernweb generator that we used in the first half of this chapter. Once this process is  finished, run Grunt’s default task—$ grunt—to build and launch the project.  Defining Secondary Commands In the first half of this chapter, you learned that multiple commands can be included with Yeoman generators— commands whose usefulness can extend well beyond the initial creation of a new project. The modernweb  generator demonstrated this by including a route command that automated the process of creating new routes  within an Angular application  refer to Listing 3-6 earlier in the chapter . The steps involved in creating this  command closely follow those we took when we created our generator’s default app command:              1.  Create a folder named route at the root level of our module.  2.  Create a folder named templates within our new route folder.  3.  Place various files within our templates folder that we want to copy into the   target project.  4.  Create the script shown in Listing 3-14, which is responsible for driving the   functionality for the route command.  49  www.it-ebooks.info   ChapTer 3   Yeoman  Listing 3-14.  A route Sub-generator That Automates the Creation of New Angular Routes     generator-example route index.js   var generators = require 'yeoman-generator' ;    * Our generator's default `app` command was created by extending Yeoman's `Base` class.   In this example, we extend the `NamedBase` class, instead. Doing so alerts Yeoman to   the fact that this command expects one or more arguments. For example: $ yo example:route   my-new-route *  module.exports = generators.NamedBase.extend {       'constructor': function args  {         this._opts = {             'route': args[0]         };         generators.NamedBase.apply this, arguments ;     },       'writing': function   {           this.fs.copyTpl              this.templatePath 'index.js' ,             this.destinationPath 'public app routes ' + this._opts.route + ' index.js' ,             this._opts          ;           this.fs.copyTpl              this.templatePath 'template.html' ,              this.destinationPath 'public app routes ' + this._opts.route +    ' template.html' ,              this._opts          ;       },       'end': function   {         this.log 'Route `' + this._opts.route + '` created.' ;     }   } ;  The script shown in Listing 3-14 looks very similar to that shown in Listing 3-9, the primary difference   being the use of Yeoman’s NamedBase class. By creating a sub-generator that extends from NamedBase, we  alert Yeoman to the fact that this command expects to receive one or more arguments.  Listing 3-15 demonstrates the use of our generator’s new route command.  50  www.it-ebooks.info   ChapTer 3   Yeoman  Listing 3-15.  Creating a New Angular Route Using Our Generator’s route Command  $ yo example:route users    create public app routes users index.js    create public app routes users template.html Route `users` created.  Composability When creating Yeoman generators, it is not uncommon to encounter situations in which having the ability  to execute one sub-generator from within another would be useful. For example, consider the generator that  we just created. It’s easy to imagine a scenario in which we might want our generator to automatically create  several default routes when run. To accomplish that goal, it would be helpful if we had the ability to call our  generator’s route command from within its app command. Yeoman’s composeWith   method exists for this  very reason  see Listing 3-16 .  Listing 3-16.  Yeoman’s composeWith   Method Allows One Sub-generator to Call Another     generator-example app index.js  excerpt    'writing': function   {       this.fs.copyTpl          this.templatePath '** *' ,         this.destinationPath  ,         this._answers      ;       this.fs.copy          this.templatePath '.bowerrc' ,         this.destinationPath '.bowerrc' ,         this._answers      ;        *     Yeoman's `composeWith` method allows us to execute external generators.     Here, we trigger the creation of a new route named "dashboard".     *      this.composeWith 'example:route', {         'args': ['dashboard']     } ;       this.config.save  ;   }  With the help of Yeoman’s composeWith   method, simple sub-generators can be combined     i.e., “composed”  with one another to create fairly sophisticated workflows. By taking advantage of this  method, developers can create complex, multicommand generators, while avoiding the use of duplicate  code across commands.  51  www.it-ebooks.info   ChapTer 3   Yeoman  Summary  Yeoman is a simple but powerful tool that automates the tedious tasks associated with bootstrapping  new applications into existence, speeding up the process by which developers can move from concept  to prototype. When used, it allows developers to focus their attention where it matters most—on the  applications themselves.  At last count, more than 1,500 Yeoman generators have been published to npm, making it easy for   developers to experiment with a wide variety of tools, libraries, frameworks, and design patterns  e.g., Bower,  Grunt, AngularJS, Knockout, React  with which they may not have experience.

In this chapter, we will round out our coverage of  development tools by shifting our focus to the server. We will be exploring PM2, a command-line utility  that simplifies many of the tasks associated with running Node applications, monitoring their status, and  efficiently scaling them to meet increasing demand. Topics covered include:   	 Working with processes  	 Monitoring logs  	 Monitoring resource usage  	  	  	  Zero-downtime deployments  Advanced process management  Load-balancing across multiple processors  PM2’s command-line utility, pm2, is available via npm. If you have not already installed PM2, you should do  so before you continue, as shown in Listing 4-1.  Listing 4-1.  Installing the pm2 Command-line Utility via npm  Installation  $ npm install -g pm2 $ pm2 --version 0.12.15  53  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 4   pM2     Note  Node’s package manager  npm  allows users to install packages in one of two contexts: locally   or globally. In this example, bower is installed within the global context, which is typically reserved for  command-line utilities.  Listing 4-2 shows the contents of a simple Node application that will form the basis of our first several  interactions with PM2. When accessed, it does nothing more than display the message “Hello, world.” to users.  Working with Processes  Listing 4-2.  Simple Express Application     my-app index.js   var express = require 'express' ; var morgan = require 'morgan' ; var app = express  ; app.use morgan 'combined'  ;   app.get ' ', function req, res, next  {     res.send 'Hello, world.\n' ; } ;   app.listen 8000 ;  Figure 4-1 demonstrates the process by which we can launch this application with the help of the pm2  command-line utility. In this example, we instruct PM2 to start our application by executing its index.js  script. We also provide PM2 with an  optional  name for our application  my-app , making it easier for us to  reference it at a later time. Before doing so, be sure you install the project’s dependencies by running $ npm  install.  Figure 4-1.  Launching the application shown in Listing 4-2 with PM2  After calling PM2’s start command, PM2 helpfully displays a table containing information about every   Node application it is currently aware of before returning us to the command prompt. The meaning of the  columns that we see in this example is summarized in Table 4-1.  54  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 4   pM2  Table 4-1.  Summary of Columns Shown in Figure 4-1  Heading  Description  App name  id  mode  pid  status  restart  uptime  memory  watching  The name of the process. Defaults to the name of the script that was executed. A unique ID assigned to the process by PM2. Processes can be referenced by name or ID. The method of execution  fork or cluster . Defaults to fork. Explored in more detail later  in the chapter. A unique number assigned by the operating system to the process. The current status of the process  e.g., online, stopped, etc. . The number of times the process has been restarted by PM2. The length of time the process has been running since last being restarted. The amount of memory consumed by the process.  Indicates whether PM2 will automatically restart the process when it detects changes within  a project’s file structure. Particularly useful during development. Defaults to disabled.  As indicated by the output provided by PM2 in Listing 4-3, our application is now online and ready for  use. We can verify this by calling our application’s sole route using the curl command-line utility, as shown  in Figure 4-2.  Figure 4-2.  Accessing the sole route defined by our Express application     Note  Figure 4-2 assumes the existence of the curl command-line utility within your environment. If you  happen to be working in an environment where this utility is not available, you could also verify the status of  this application by opening it directly within your web browser.  In addition to the start command, PM2 also provides a number of useful commands for interacting   with processes that PM2 is already aware of, the most common of which are shown in Table 4-2.  Table 4-2.  Frequently Used Commands for Interacting with PM2 Processes  Command  Description  list  stop  restart  delete  show  Displays an up-to-date version of the table shown in Listing 4-4 Stops the process, without removing it from PM2’s list Restarts the process Stops the process and removes it from PM2’s list  Displays details regarding the specified process  55  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 4   pM2  Simple commands such as stop, start, and delete require no additional commentary. Figure 4-3,   on the other hand, shows the information you can expect to receive when requesting information about a  specific PM2 process via the show command.  Figure 4-3.  Viewing details for a specific PM2 process  Recovering from Errors At this point, you are now familiar with some of the basic steps involved in interacting with PM2. You’ve  learned how to create new processes with the help of PM2’s start command. You’ve also discovered how  you can subsequently manage running processes with the help of commands such as list, stop, restart,  delete, and show. We’ve yet to discuss, however, much of the real value that PM2 brings to the table in  regard to managing Node processes. We’ll begin that discussion by discovering how PM2 can assist Node  applications in automatically recovering from fatal errors.  Listing 4-3 shows a modified version of the application we originally saw in Listing 4-2. In this version,   however, an uncaught exception is thrown at a regular interval.  Listing 4-3.  Modified Version of Our Original Application That Throws an Uncaught Exception Every   Four Seconds     my-bad-app index.js   var express = require 'express' ; var morgan = require 'morgan' ; var app = express  ; app.use morgan 'combined'  ;    56  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 4   pM2  app.get ' ', function req, res, next  {     res.send 'Hello, world.\n' ; } ;   setInterval function   {     throw new Error 'Uh oh.' ; }, 4000 ;   app.listen 8000 ;  If we were to start this application without the help of PM2 by passing it directly to the node executable,  we would quickly find ourselves out of luck the moment our first error was thrown. Node would simply print  the error message to the console before dumping us back to the command prompt, as shown in Figure 4-4.  Figure 4-4.  Output provided by Node after crashing from the error shown in Listing 4-3  Such behavior won’t get us very far in a real usage scenario. Ideally, an application that has been   released to a production environment should be thoroughly tested and devoid from such uncaught  exceptions. However, in the event of such a crash, an application should at the very least be able to bring  itself back online without requiring manual intervention. PM2 can help us accomplish this goal.  In Figure 4-5, we remove our existing process from PM2’s list via the delete command and create a new   instance of the poorly written application shown in Listing 4-3. Afterward, we wait several seconds before  requesting an up-to-date process list from PM2.  Figure 4-5.  PM2 helps Node applications recover from fatal errors  57  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 4   pM2  Notice anything interesting here? Based on the values within the status, restart, and uptime columns,   we can see that our application has crashed three times already. Each time, PM2 has helpfully stepped in  and restarted it for us. The most recent process has been running for a total of two seconds, which means we  can expect another crash  and automatic restart  two seconds from now.  PM2’s ability to assist applications in recovering from fatal errors in a production environment,   while useful, is just one of several useful features the utility provides. PM2 is also equally useful within  development environments, as we’ll soon see.  Responding to File Changes Imagine a scenario in which you’ve recently begun work on a new Node project. Let’s assume it’s a web API  built with Express. Without the help of additional tools, you must manually restart the related Node process  in order to see the effects of your ongoing work—a frustrating chore that quickly grows old. PM2 can assist  you in this situation by automatically monitoring the file structure of your project. As changes are detected,  PM2 can automatically restart your application for you, if you instruct it to do so.  Figure 4-6 demonstrates this process. In this example, we first remove our currently running instance of   my-bad-app. Next, we create a new instance of the application that was shown in our original example    see Listing 4-2 . This time, however, we pass an additional flag, --watch, which instructs PM2 to monitor  our project for changes and to respond accordingly.  Figure 4-6.  Creating a new PM2 process that will automatically restart itself as changes are detected  As changes are saved to this project’s files, subsequent calls to PM2’s list command will indicate how   many times PM2 has restarted the application, as seen in a previous example.  Monitoring Logs  Refer back to Listing 4-2 and note this application’s use of morgan, a module for logging incoming HTTP  requests. In this example, morgan is configured to print such information to the console. We can see the  result by running our application directly via the node executable, as shown in Figure 4-7.  58  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 4   pM2  Figure 4-7.  Logging incoming requests to Express with morgan  We recently explored how to allow PM2 to manage the execution of this application for us via the   start command  see Figure 4-1 . Doing so provides us with several benefits, but it also causes us to lose  immediate insight into the output being generated by our application to the console. Fortunately, PM2  provides us with a simple mechanism for monitoring such output.  In Figure 4-3, we requested information from PM2 regarding a specific process under its control   via the show command. Contained within the provided information were paths to two log files that PM2  automatically created for this process—one labeled “out log path” and one labeled “error log path”—to  which PM2 will save this process’s standard output and error messages, respectively. We could view these  files directly, but PM2 provides a much more convenient method for interacting with them, as shown in  Figure 4-8.  Figure 4-8.  Monitoring the output from processes under PM2’s control  Here we see how the output from processes under PM2’s control can be monitored as needed via the   logs command. In this example, we monitor the output from all processes under PM2’s control. Notice how  PM2 helpfully prefixes each entry with information regarding the process from which each line of output  originated. This information is particularly useful when using PM2 to manage multiple processes, which  we will begin doing in the upcoming section. Alternatively, we can also monitor the output from a specific  process by passing the name  or ID  for that process to the logs command  see Figure 4-9 .  59  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 4   pM2  Figure 4-9.  Monitoring the output from a specific process under PM2’s control  Should you wish to clear out the content of log files generated by PM2 at any point, you can quickly  do so by calling PM2’s flush command. The behavior of the utility’s logs command can also be tweaked  slightly with the use of two optional arguments, which are listed in Table 4-3.  Table 4-3.  Arguments Accepted by PM2’s logs Command  Argument  Description  –raw  Displays the raw content of log files, stripping prefixed process identifiers in the process  –lines    Instructs PM2 to display the last N lines, instead of the default of 20  Monitoring Resource Usage  In the previous section, you learned how PM2 can assist you in monitoring the standard output and errors  being generated by processes under its control. In much the same way, PM2 also provides easy-to-use tools  for monitoring the health of those processes, as well as for monitoring the overall health of the server on  which they are running.  Monitoring Local Resources Figure 4-10 demonstrates the output that is generated when PM2’s monit command is called. Here we see  a continuously updated view that allows us to track the amount of CPU processing power as well as the  amount of RAM consumed by each process being managed by PM2.  Figure 4-10.  Monitoring CPU and memory usage via PM2’s monit command  60  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 4   pM2  Monitoring Remote Resources The information provided by PM2’s monit command provides us with a quick and easy method for  monitoring the health of its processes. This functionality is particularly helpful during development, when  our primary focus is on the resources being consumed within our own environment. It’s less helpful,  however, as an application moves into a remote, production environment that could easily consist of  multiple servers, each running its own instance of PM2.  PM2 takes this into account by also providing a built-in JSON API that can be accessed over the Web on   port 9615. Disabled by default, the process for enabling it is shown in Figure 4-11.  Figure 4-11.  Enabling PM2’s JSON web API  In this example, we enable PM2’s web-accessible JSON API by calling the utility’s web command. PM2  implements this functionality as part of a separate application that runs independently of PM2 itself. As a  result, we can see that a new process, pm2-http-interface, is now under PM2’s control. Should we ever  wish to disable PM2’s JSON API, we can do so by removing this process as we would any other, by passing its  name  or ID  to the delete  or stop  commands.  Listing 4-4 shows an excerpt of the output that is provided when a GET request is made to the server   running PM2 over port 9615. As you can see, PM2 provides us with a number of details regarding each of the  processes currently under its control, as well as the system on which it is running.  Listing 4-4.

On their own, commands such as start, stop, restart, and delete provide us with simple  mechanisms for managing processes in a quick, one-off fashion. But what about more complex scenarios?  Perhaps an application requires that additional parameters be specified at runtime, or perhaps it expects  that one or more environment variables be set.  JSON Application Declarations To meet these needs, additional configuration is needed, and the best way to accomplish this is with the  help of what PM2 refers to as “JSON application configuration” files. An example configuration file that  demonstrates most of the various options that are available is shown in Listing 4-5.  63  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 4   pM2  Listing 4-5.  Sample of the Various Options Available Within a JSON Application Configuration File  {     "name"              : "my-app",     "cwd"               : " opt my-app",     "args"              : ["--argument1=value", "--flag", "value"],     "script"            : "index.js",     "node_args"         : ["--harmony"],     "log_date_format"   : "YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm Z",     "error_file"        : " var log my-app err.log",     "out_file"          : " var log my-app out.log",     "pid_file"          : "pids my-app.pid",     "instances"         : 1,    or 0 => 'max'     "max_restarts"      : 10,    defaults to 15     "max_memory_restart": "1M",    1 megabytes, e.g.: "2G", "10M", "100K"     "cron_restart"      : "1 0 * * *",     "watch"             : false,     "ignore_watch"      : ["node_modules"],     "merge_logs"        : true,     "exec_mode"         : "fork",     "autorestart"       : false,     "env": {         "NODE_ENV": "production"     } }  JSON application configuration files provide us with a standard format for passing advanced settings to  PM2 in a way that is easily repeatable and that can be shared with others. Several of the options that you see  here should be familiar, based on previous examples  e.g., name, out_file, error_file, watch, etc. . Others  will be touched on later in the chapter.

Included with this chapter is a microservices project that provides a working demonstration of JSON  configuration files in action. Contained within this project are two applications: a weather application with  an API that returns random temperature information for a specified postal code, and a main application that  generates a request to the API every two seconds and prints the result to the console. The main script for  each of these applications is shown in Listing 4-6.  Listing 4-6.  Source Code for the main and weather Applications     microservices main index.js   var request = require 'request' ;   if  !process.env.WEATHER_API_URL  {     throw new Error 'The `WEATHER_API_URL` environment variable must be set.' ; }   setInterval function   {       request {         'url': process.env.WEATHER_API_URL + ' api weather 37204',         'json': true,         'method': 'GET'     }, function err, res, result  {         if  err  throw new Error err ;         console.log 'The temperature is: %s', result.temperature.fahrenheit ;     } ;   }, 2000 ;    65  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 4   pM2     microservices weather index.js   if  !process.env.PORT  {     throw new Error 'The `PORT` environment variable must be set.' ; }   var express = require 'express' ; var morgan = require 'morgan' ; var app = express  ; app.use morgan 'combined'  ;   var random = function min, max  {     return Math.floor Math.random   *  max - min + 1  + min ; };   app.get ' api weather :postal_code', function req, res, next  {     var fahr = random 70, 110 ;     res.send {         'temperature': {             'fahrenheit': fahr,             'celsius':  fahr - 32  *  5 9          }     } ; } ;   app.listen process.env.PORT ;  A single JSON application configuration file is also included with the microservices project, the   content of which is shown in Listing 4-7.  Listing 4-7.  JSON Application Configuration File for this Chapter’s microservices Projectmicroservices  pm2 development.json  [     {         "name"              : "main",         "cwd"               : ".. microservices",         "script"            : "main index.js",         "max_memory_restart": "60M",         "watch"             : true,         "env": {             "NODE_ENV": "development",             "WEATHER_API_URL": "http:  localhost:7010"         }     },     {         "name"              : "weather-api",         "cwd"               : ".. microservices",         "script"            : "weather index.js",         "max_memory_restart": "60M",         "watch"             : true,         "env": {  66  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 4   pM2              "NODE_ENV": "development",             "PORT": 7010         }     } ]  The application configuration file shown here provides PM2 with instructions on how to launch each of  the applications included within this project. In this example, PM2 is instructed to restart each application if  changes are detected to either’s file structure, or if they begin to consume more than 60MB of memory. The  file also provides PM2 with separate environment variables to be passed to each process.   Before running this example, you will need to adjust the values for the cwd settings within this file      Note  so that they reference the absolute path to the microservices folder on your computer. after making the  appropriate adjustments, launch both applications with a single call to pM2, as shown in Figure 4-12.  Figure 4-12.  Launching the main and weather-api applications with PM2  As expected, PM2 has created two instances for us, one for each of the applications referenced within   our configuration file. As in previous examples, we can monitor the output that is generated with the help of  PM2’s logs command  see Figure 4-13 .  Figure 4-13.  Excerpt of the output generated by PM2’s logs command  67  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 4   pM2  Load-Balancing Across Multiple Processors  The single-threaded, nonblocking nature of Node’s I O model makes it possible for developers to create  applications capable of handling thousands of concurrent connections with relative ease. While impressive,  the efficiency with which Node is capable of processing incoming requests comes with one major expense:  an inability to spread computation across multiple CPUs. Thankfully, Node’s core cluster module provides  a method for addressing this limitation. With it, developers can write applications capable of creating their  own child processes—each running on a separate processor, and each capable of sharing the use of ports  with other child processes and the parent process that launched it.  Before we close out this chapter, let’s take a look at a convenient abstraction of Node’s cluster   module that is provided by PM2. With this functionality, applications that were not originally written to  take advantage of Node’s cluster module can be launched in a way that allows them to take full advantage  of multiprocessor environments. As a result, developers can quickly scale up their applications to meet  increasing demand without immediately being forced to bring additional servers to bear.  Listing 4-8 shows the source code for a simple Express application that we will be scaling across multiple   processors with the help of PM2, while Listing 4-9 shows the accompanying JSON application configuration file.  Listing 4-8  Express Application to be Scaled Across Multiple CPUs     multicore index.js   if  !process.env.port  throw new Error 'The port environment variable must be set' ;   var express = require 'express' ; var morgan = require 'morgan' ; var app = express  ; app.use morgan 'combined'  ;   app.route ' '      .get function req, res, next  {         res.send 'Hello, world.' ;     } ;   app.listen process.env.port ;  Listing 4-9.  JSON Application Configuration File with Which Our Application Will Be Launched     multicore pm2 development.json   {     "name": "multicore",     "cwd": ".. multicore",     "max_memory_restart": "60M",     "watch": false,     "script": "index.js",     "instances": 0,    max     "exec_mode": "cluster",     "autorestart": true,     "merge_logs": true,     "env": {         "port": 9000     } }  68  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 4   pM2  The application configuration file shown in Listing 4-9 contains two key items of interest. The first is  the instances property. In this example, we specify a value of 0, which instructs PM2 to launch a separate  process for every CPU that it finds. The second is the exec_mode property. By specifying a value of cluster,  we instruct PM2 to launch its own parent process, which will in turn launch separate child processes for our  application with the help of Node’s cluster module.  In Figure 4-14, we launch the application by passing the path to our application configuration file to   PM2’s start command. Afterward, PM2 displays a listing of every known process, as in previous examples.  In this instance, we see that PM2 has launched a separate process for each of the eight CPUs available within  our environment. We can verify this by monitoring CPU usage for each of these new processes using the  monit command, as shown in Figure 4-15.  Figure 4-14.  Launching the application on cluster mode with PM2  Figure 4-15.  Monitoring CPU usage with PM2’s monit command  69  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 4   pM2   When launching applications in cluster mode, pM2 will print a message to the console warning that      Note  this functionality is still a beta feature. according to the lead developer of pM2, however, this functionality is  stable enough for production environments, so long as Node v0.12.0 or higher is being used.  Before you continue, you can quickly remove each of the eight processes launched by this example by   running $ pm2 delete multicore.  Zero-Downtime Deployments After launching an application in cluster mode, PM2 will begin forwarding incoming requests in a round- robin fashion to each of the eight processes under its control—providing us with an enormous increase in  performance. As an added benefit, having our application distributed across multiple processors also allows  us to release updates without incurring any downtime, as we will see in a moment.  Imagine a scenario in which an application under PM2’s control is running on one or more servers. As   updates to this application become available, releasing them to the public will involve two critical steps:   	 Copying the updated source code to the appropriate server s   	  Restarting each of the processes under PM2’s control  As these steps take place, a brief period of downtime will be introduced, during which incoming   requests to the application will be rejected—unless special precautions are taken. Fortunately, launching  applications with PM2 in cluster mode provides us with the tools we need to take those precautions.  To avoid any downtime when relaunching the application we previously saw in Listing 4-8, we will first  need to make a minor adjustment to our application’s source code and application configuration files. The  updated versions are shown in Listing 4-10.  Listing 4-10.  Application Designed to Take Advantage of PM2’s gracefulReload Command     graceful index.js   if  !process.env.port  throw new Error 'The port environment variable must be set' ;   var server; var express = require 'express' ; var morgan = require 'morgan' ; var app = express  ; app.use morgan 'combined'  ;   app.route ' '      .get function req, res, next  {         res.send 'Hello, world.' ;     } ;   process.on 'message', function msg  {     switch  msg  {         case 'shutdown':             server.close  ;         break;     } } ;   70  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 4   pM2  server = app.listen process.env.port, function   {     console.log 'App is listening on port: %s', process.env.port ; } ;      graceful pm2 production.json   {     "name": "graceful",     "cwd": ".. graceful",     "max_memory_restart": "60M",     "watch": false,     "script": "index.js",     "instances": 0,    max     "exec_mode": "cluster",     "autorestart": true,     "merge_logs": false,     "env": {         "port": 9000,         "PM2_GRACEFUL_TIMEOUT": 10000     } }  Previous examples have demonstrated the use of PM2’s restart command, which immediately   stops and starts a specified process. While this behavior is typically not a problem within nonproduction  environments, issues begin to surface when we consider the impact it would have on any active requests that  our application may be processing at the moment this command is issued. When stability is of the upmost  importance, PM2’s gracefulReload command serves as a more appropriate alternative.  When called, gracefulReload first sends a shutdown message to each of the processes under its control,   providing them with the opportunity to take any necessary precautions to ensure that any active   connections are not disturbed. Only after a configurable period of time has passed  specified via the   PM2_GRACEFUL_TIMEOUT environment variable  will PM2 then move forward with restarting the process.  In this example, after receiving the shutdown message, our application responds by calling the close     method on the HTTP server that was created for us by Express. This method instructs our server to stop  accepting new connections, but allows those that have already been established to complete. Only after ten  seconds have passed  as specified via PM2_GRACEFUL_TIMEOUT  will PM2 restart the process, at which point  any connections managed by this process should already have been completed.  Figure 4-16 demonstrates the process by which this application can be started and subsequently   restarted through the use of the gracefulReload command. By doing so, we are able to release updates  without interrupting our application’s users.  71  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 4   pM2  Figure 4-16.  Gracefully reloading each of the processes under PM2’s control  Summary  PM2 provides developers with a powerful utility for managing Node applications that is equally at home  in both production and nonproduction environments. Simple aspects, such as the utility’s ability to  automatically restart processes under its control as source code changes occur, serve as convenient  timesavers during development. More advanced features, such as the ability to load balance applications  across multiple processors and to gracefully restart those applications in a way that does not negatively  impact users, also provide critical functionality for using Node in a significant capacity.

Worrying is not a form of thinking.  —Peter Saint-Andre  While JavaScript now plays a far more significant role in web applications, the HTML5 specification    and therefore modern browsers  does not specify a means to detect dependency relationships among  scripts, or how to load script dependencies in a particular order. In the simplest scenario, scripts are typically  referenced in page markup with simple   tags. These tags are evaluated, loaded, and executed  in order, which means that common libraries or modules are typically included first, then application  scripts follow.  For example, a page might load jQuery and then load an application script that uses jQuery  to manipulate the Document Object Model [DOM].  Simple web pages with easily traceable dependency  hierarchies fit well into this model, but as the complexity of a web application increases, the number of  application scripts will grow and the web of dependencies may become difficult, if not impossible, to manage.  The whole process is made even messier by asynchronous scripts. If a   tag possesses an   async attribute, the script content will be loaded over HTTP in the background and executed as soon as it  becomes available. While the script is loading, the remainder of the page, including any subsequent script  tags, will continue to load. Large dependencies  or dependencies delivered by slow sources  that are loaded  asynchronously may not be available when application scripts are evaluated and executed. Even if application    tags possess async attributes as well, a developer has no means of controlling the order in which all  asynchronous scripts are loaded, and therefore no way to ensure that the dependency hierarchy is respected.     Tip  The HTML5   tag attribute defer is similar to async but delays script execution until page  parsing has finished. Both of these attributes reduce page rendering delays, thereby improving user experience  and page performance. This is especially important for mobile devices.  RequireJS was created to address this dependency orchestration problem by giving developers a   standard way to write JavaScript modules  “scripts”  that declare their own dependencies before any module  execution occurs. By declaring all dependencies up front, RequireJS can ensure that the overall dependency  hierarchy is loaded asynchronously while executing modules in the correct order. This pattern, known as  Asynchronous Module Definition  AMD , stands in contrast to the CommonJS module-loading pattern  adopted by Node.js and the Browserify module-loading library. While there are certainly strong points to be  made for using both patterns in a variety of use cases, RequireJS and AMD were developed to address issues  specific to web browsers and DOM shortcomings. In reality, the concessions that RequireJS and Browserify  make in their implementations are usually mitigated by workflow and community plugins.  73  www.it-ebooks.info   CHapTer 5   requireJS  For example, RequireJS can create dynamic shims for non-AMD dependencies that it must load    usually remote libraries on content delivery networks or legacy code . This is important because RequireJS  assumes that scripts in a web application may come from multiple sources and will not all directly be under  a developer’s control. By default, RequireJS does not concatenate all application scripts  “packing”  into a  single file, opting instead to issue HTTP requests for every script it loads. The RequireJS tool r.js, discussed  later, produces packed bundles for production environments, but can still load remote, shimmed scripts  from other locations. Browserify, on the other hand, takes a “pack-first” approach. It assumes that all internal  scripts and dependencies will be packed into a single file and that other remote scripts will be loaded  separately. This places remote scripts beyond the control of Browserify, but plugins like bromote work within  the CommonJS model to load remote scripts during the packing process. For both approaches, the end  result is the same: a remote resource is made available to the application at runtime.  Running the Examples  This chapter contains a variety of examples that may be run in a modern web browser. Node.js is necessary  to install code dependencies and to run all web server scripts.  To install the example code dependencies, open the code requirejs directory in a terminal and   execute the command npm install. This command will read the package.json file and download the few  packages necessary to run each example.  Example code blocks throughout the chapter contain a comment at the top to indicate in which file the  source code may be found. The fictitious index.html file in Listing 5-1, for example, would be found in the  example-000 public directory.  This directory does not really exist, so don’t worry if you can’t find it.   Listing 5-1.  An Exciting HTML File               Hello world!      Listing 5-2.  Launching an Exciting Web Server  example-000$ node index.js >> mach web server started on node 0.12.0 >> Listening on :::8080, use CTRL+C to stop  Unless otherwise specified, assume that all example code directories contain an index.js file that  launches a very basic web server. Listing 5-2 shows how Node.js would be used in a terminal to run the  fictitious web server script example-000 index.js.  The command output shows that the web server is listening at http:  localhost:8080. In a web   browser, navigating to http:  localhost:8080 index.html would render the HTML snippet in Listing 5-1.  Working with RequireJS  The workflow for using RequireJS in a web application typically includes some common steps. First, RequireJS  must be loaded in an HTML file with a   tag. RequireJS may be referenced as a stand-alone script on a  web server or CDN, or it may also be installed with package managers like Bower and npm, then served from  a local web server. Next, RequireJS must be configured so that it knows where scripts and modules live, how to   74  www.it-ebooks.info   CHapTer 5   requireJS  shim scripts that are not AMD compliant, which plugins to load, and so on. Once configuration is complete,  RequireJS will load a primary application module that is responsible for loading the major page components,  essentially “kicking off” the page’s application code. At this point RequireJS evaluates the dependency tree  created by modules and begins asynchronously loading dependency scripts in the background. Once all  modules are loaded, the application code proceeds to do whatever is within its purview.  Each step in this process is given detailed consideration in the following sections. The examples code   used in each section represents the evolution of a simple application that will show inspirational and  humorous quotes by  semi-  famous persons.  Installation The RequireJS script may be downloaded directly from http:  requirejs.org. It comes in a few distinct  flavors: a vanilla RequireJS script, a vanilla RequireJS script prebundled with jQuery, and a Node.js package  that includes both RequireJS and its packing utility, r.js. For most examples in this chapter, the vanilla script  is used. The prebundled jQuery script is merely offered as a convenience for developers. If you wish to add  RequireJS to a project that is already using jQuery, the vanilla RequireJS script can accommodate the existing  jQuery installation with no issues, though older versions of jQuery may need to be shimmed.  Shimmed  scripts will be covered later.   Once acquired, the RequireJS script is referenced in the web application with a   tag. Because   RequireJS is a module loader, it bears the responsibility of loading all other JavaScript files and modules that  an application may need. It is therefore very likely that the RequireJS   tag will be the only    tag that occupies a web page. A simplified example is given in Listing 5-3.  Listing 5-3.  Including the RequireJS Script on a Web Page               Ponderings    < header         Configuration After the RequireJS script is loaded on a page, it looks for a configuration which will primarily tell RequireJS  where script and modules live. Configuration options can be provided in in one of three ways.  First, a global require object may be created before the RequireJS script is loaded. This object may   contain all of the RequireJS configuration options as well as a “kickoff” callback that will be executed once  RequireJS has finished loading all application modules.  The script block in Listing 5-4 shows a newly minted RequireJS configuration object stored in the global   require variable.  Listing 5-4.  Configuring RequireJS with a Global require Object               Ponderings       75  www.it-ebooks.info   CHapTer 5   requireJS              *    * Will be automatically attached to the    * global window object as window.require.    *    var require = {        configuration     baseUrl: ' scripts',        kickoff     deps: ['quotes-view'],     callback: function  quotesView  {       quotesView.addQuote 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.' ;       quotesView.addQuote 'Nunc non purus faucibus justo tristique porta.' ;     }   };             The most important configuration property on this object, baseUrl, identifies a path relative to the   application root where RequireJS should begin to resolve module dependencies. The deps array specifies  modules that should be loaded immediately after configuration, and the callback function exists to receive  these modules once they are loaded. This example loads a single module, quotes-view. Once the callback is  invoked, it may access the properties and methods on this module.  The directory tree in Listing 5-5 shows the position of the quotes-view.js file relative to both   config01.html  the page being viewed  and require.js.  Listing 5-5.  Application File Locations ├── config01.html ├── scripts  │   ├── quotes-view.js  │   └── require.js └── styles     └── app.css  Notice that the absolute path and file extension for the quotes-view module is omitted in the deps  array. By default, RequireJS assumes that any given module is located relative to the page being viewed  and that it is contained within a single JavaScript file with the appropriate file extension. In this case the  latter assumption is true but the first is not, which is why specifying a baseUrl property is necessary. When  RequireJS attempts to resolve any module, it will combine any configured baseUrl value and the module  name, then append the .js file extension to produce a full path relative to the application root.  When the config01.html page loads, the strings passed to the quotesView.addQuote   method will be   displayed on the page.  The second configuration method is similar to the first but uses the RequireJS API to perform   configuration after the RequireJS script is loaded, as demonstrated in Listing 5-6.  76  www.it-ebooks.info   CHapTer 5   requireJS  Listing 5-6.  Configuration with the RequireJS API               Ponderings                         configuration   requirejs.config {     baseUrl: ' scripts'   } ;      kickoff   requirejs ['quotes-view'], function  quotesView  {     quotesView.addQuote 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.' ;     quotesView.addQuote 'Nunc non purus faucibus justo tristique porta.' ;   } ;        In this example a   block first uses the global requirejs object, created by the require.js  script, to configure RequireJS by invoking its config   method. It then invokes requirejs to kick off the  application. The object passed to the config   method resembles the global require object from   Listing 5-4, but lacks its deps and callback properties. The requirejs function accepts an array of  application dependencies and a callback function instead, a pattern that will become very familiar when  module design is covered later.  The net effect is the same: RequireJS uses its configuration to load the quotes-view module, and once   loaded, the callback function interacts with it to affect the page.  The third configuration method uses the syntax of the second, but moves the configuration and kickoff   code into its own script. The RequireJS   tag in Listing 5-7 uses the data-main attribute to tell  RequireJS where its configuration and kickoff module live.  Listing 5-7.  Configuring RequireJS with an External Script               Ponderings                   Once RequireJS has loaded, it will look for the data-main attribute and, if found, asynchronously   load the script specified in the attribute. Listing 5-8 shows the content of main.js, which is identical to the    block in Listing 5-6.  77  www.it-ebooks.info   CHapTer 5   requireJS  Listing 5-8.  The RequireJS Main Module     example-001 public scripts main.js    configuration requirejs.config {   baseUrl: ' scripts' } ;      kickoff requirejs ['quotes-view'], function  quotesView  {   quotesView.addQuote 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.' ;   quotesView.addQuote 'Nunc non purus faucibus justo tristique porta.' ; } ;     Tip  Because the data-main script is loaded asynchronously, scripts or   blocks included  immediately after requireJS will likely be run first. if requireJS manages all scripts in an application, or if  scripts loaded after requireJS have no bearing on the application itself  such as advertiser scripts , there will be  no conflicts.  Application Modules and Dependencies RequireJS modules are defined by three things:  1.  A module name  2.  A list of dependencies  modules   3.  A module closure that will accept the output from each dependency module as  function arguments, set up module code, and potentially return something that  other modules can use  Listing 5-9 shows each of these points in a fake module definition. Modules are created when the global  define   function is invoked. This function takes three arguments, corresponding to the three points above.           78  Listing 5-9.  Module Anatomy  define  *1* 'm1',  *2* ['d1', 'd2'],  *3* function  d1, d2  {    *    * Variables declared within the module closure    * are private to the module, and will not be    * exposed to other modules    *    var privateModuleVariable = "can't touch this";      *    * The returned value  if any  will now be available    * to any other module if they specify m1 as a    * dependency.    *   www.it-ebooks.info   CHapTer 5   requireJS    return {     getPrivateModuleVariable: function    {       return privateModuleVariable;     }   }; }   A module’s name is key. In Listing 5-9 a module name, m1, is explicitly declared. If a module name is  omitted  leaving the dependencies and module closure as the only arguments passed to define   , then  RequireJS will assume that the name of the module is the file name containing the module script, without its  .js extension. This is fairly common in practice, but the module name is shown here for clarity.     Tip  Giving modules specific names can introduce unwanted complexity, as requireJS depends on script  urL paths for loading modules. if a module is explicitly named and the file name does not match the module  name, then a module alias that maps the module name to an actual JavaScript file needs to be defined in the  requireJS configuration. This is covered in the next section.  The dependency list in Listing 5-9 identifies two other modules that RequireJS should load. The values  d1 and d2 are the names of these modules, located in script files d1.js and d2.js. These scripts look similar  to the module definition in Listing 5-9, but they will load their own dependencies.  Finally, the module closure accepts the output from each dependency module as function arguments.   This output is any value returned from each dependency module’s closure function. The closure in   Listing 5-9 returns its own value, and if another module were to declare m1 as a dependency, it is this  returned value that would be passed to that module’s closure.  If a module has no dependencies, its dependency array will be empty and it will receive no arguments   to its closure.  Once a module is loaded, it exists in memory until the application is terminated. If multiple modules   declare the same dependency, that dependency is loaded only once. Whatever value it returns from its  closure will be passed to both modules by reference. The state of a given module, then, is shared among all  other modules that use it.  A module may return any valid JavaScript value, or none at all if the module exists only to manipulate   other modules or simply produce side effects in the application.  Listing 5-10 shows the structure of the example-002 public directory. This looks similar to   example-001 but a few additional modules have been added, namely data quotes.js  a module for fetching  quote data  and util dom.js  a module that wraps the global window object for other modules so that they  do not need to access window directly .  Listing 5-10.  Public Directory Structure for example-002  public   ├── index.html   ├── scripts    │   ├── data    │    │   └── quotes.js    │   ├── main.js    │   ├── quotes-view.js    │   ├── require.js    │   └── util    │       └── dom.js  79  www.it-ebooks.info   CHapTer 5   requireJS  Recall that a module’s dependencies exist relative to the RequireJS baseUrl value. When a module   specifies dependency paths, it does so relative to the baseUrl path. In Listing 5-11 the main.js file depends  on the data quotes module  public scripts data quotes.js , while the quotes-view.js module  depends on util dom  public scripts util dom.js .  Listing 5-11.  Module Dependency Paths     example-002 public scripts main.js requirejs ['data quotes', 'quotes-view'], function  quoteData, quotesView  {      ... } ;      example-002 public scripts data quotes.js define [ *no dependencies* ], function    {      ... } ;      example-002 public scripts quotes-view.js define ['util dom'], function  dom  {      ... } ;      example-002 public scripts util dom.js define [ *no dependencies* ], function    {        ... } ;  Figure 5-1 shows the logical dependency tree created when these modules are loaded.  Figure 5-1.  RequireJS dependency tree  80  www.it-ebooks.info   CHapTer 5   requireJS  As application dependencies multiply, module pathing can become tedious, but there are two ways to   mitigate this.  First, a module may use leading dot notation to specify dependencies relative to itself. For example, a  module with the declared dependency . foo would load foo.js as a sibling file, located on the same URL  segment as itself, whereas a module with the dependency .. bar would load bar.js one URL segment “up”  from itself. This greatly reduces dependency verbosity.  Second, modules may be named with path aliases, defined in the RequireJS configuration, as described   in the next section.  Paths and Aliases Assigning an alias to a module allows other modules to use the alias as a dependency name instead of the  full module pathname. This can be useful for a variety of reasons but is commonly used to simplify vendor  module paths, eliminate version numbers from vendor module names, or deal with vendor libraries that  declare their own module names explicitly.  The module in Listing 5-12 depends on the vendor library jQuery. If the jquery module script was   located at  scripts jquery.js, no module aliasing would be required to load the dependency; RequireJS  would locate the module based on the configured baseUrl configuration value.  Listing 5-12.  Specifying a jQuery Module Dependency  define ['jquery'], function  $  {      ... } ;  It is unlikely that jquery lives at the module root defined by the baseUrl configuration, however. It is  more likely that the jquery script would exist within a vendor directory such as  scripts vendor jquery,  and that the script name would contain the jQuery version  e.g., jquery-2.1.3.min , as this is how jQuery  scripts are distributed. To further complicate matters, jQuery explicitly declares its own module name,  jquery. If a module attempted to load jquery using the full path to the jQuery script,  scripts vendor  jquery jquery-2.1.3.min, RequireJS would load the script over HTTP and then fail to import the module  because its declared name is jquery, not jquery-2.1.3.min.     Tip  explicitly naming modules is considered bad practice because application modules must use a  module’s declared name, and the script file that contains the module must either share its name or be aliased in  the requireJS configuration. a special concession is made for jquery because it is a fairly ubiquitous library.  Aliases are specified in the RequireJS configuration hash under the paths property. In Listing 5-13 the   alias jquery is assigned to vendor jquery jquery-2.1.3.min, a path which is relative to the baseUrl.  Listing 5-13.  Configuration Module Path Aliases  requirejs.config {   baseUrl: ' scripts',      ... other options ...   paths: {     'jquery': 'vendor jquery jquery-2.1.3.min'   } } ;  81  www.it-ebooks.info   CHapTer 5   requireJS  In the paths object, aliases are keys and the scripts to which they are mapped are values. Once a module   alias is defined, it may be used in any other module’s dependency list. Listing 5-14 shows the jquery alias in use.  Listing 5-14.  Using a Module Alias in a Dependency List     jquery alias points to vendor jquery jquery-2.1.3.min define ['jquery'], function  $  {        ... } ;  Because module aliases take precedence over actual module locations, RequireJS will resolve the   location of the jQuery script before attempting to locate it at  scripts jquery.js.     Note  anonymous modules  that do not declare their own module names  may be aliased with any module  name, but if named modules are aliased  like jquery  they must be aliased with their declared module names.  Loading Plugins with Proxy Modules Libraries such as jQuery, Underscore, Lodash, Handlebars, and so forth all have plugin systems that let  developers extend the functionality of each. Strategic use of module aliases can actually help developers  load extensions for these libraries all at once, without having to specify such extensions in every module that  makes use of them.  In Listing 5-15 the jquery script location is aliased with the name jquery and a custom module,    util jquery-all, is aliased with the name jquery-all for brevity. All application modules will load jquery  by specifying jquery-all as a dependency. The jquery-all module, in turn, loads the normal jquery  module and then attaches custom plugins to it.  Listing 5-15.  Using Module Aliases to Load jQuery Plugins  requirejs.config {   baseUrl: ' scripts',      ... other options ...   paths: {        vendor script     'jquery': 'vendor jquery jquery-2.1.3.min',        custom extensions     'jquery-all': 'util jquery-all'   } } ;      example-003 public scripts util jquery-all define ['jquery'], function  $  {     $.fn.addQuotes = function    { *...* };     return $;      or     return $.noConflict true ; } ;  82  www.it-ebooks.info   CHapTer 5   requireJS  The jquery-all proxy module returns the jQuery object itself, which allows modules that depend on   jquery-all to access jquery with the loaded custom extensions. By default, jQuery registers itself with  the global window object, even when it is used as an AMD module. If all application modules are accessing  jQuery through the jquery-all module  or even the plain jquery module, as most vendor libraries do , then  there is no need for the jQuery global. It may be removed by invoking $.noConflict true . This will return  the jquery object and is the alternate return value for the jquery-all module in Listing 5-15.  Because jQuery is now part of the example application, the quotes-view module, responsible for   rendering quote data in the DOM, need no longer rely on the util dom module. It can specify jquery-all as  a dependency and load jquery and the custom addQuotes   plugin method all at once. Listing 5-16 shows  the changes made to the quotes-view module.  Listing 5-16.  Loading jQuery and Custom Plugins in the quotes-view Module     example-003 public scripts quotes-view.js define ['jquery-all'], function  $  {   var $quotes = $ 'quotes' ;     return {     render: function  groupedQuotes  {       for  var attribution in groupedQuotes  {         if  !groupedQuotes.hasOwnProperty attribution   continue;         $quotes.addQuotes attribution, groupedQuotes[attribution] ;       }     }   }; } ;  The advantage to using a module proxy to load jquery is that it eliminates the need to specify both  jquery and custom plugin modules in other modules that depend on both. Without this technique, for  example, application modules would all have multiple dependencies to ensure that the appropriate jQuery  plugins are loaded when needed, as shown in Listing 5-17.  Listing 5-17.  Loading Plugins Without a Proxy Module     scripts util jquery-plugin-1.js define ['jquery'], function  $  {     $.fn.customPlugin1 = function    { *...* }; } ;      scripts util jquery-plugin-2.js define ['jquery'], function  $  {     $.fn.customPlugin2 = function    { *...* }; } ;      scripts * module-that-uses-jquery.js define ['jquery', 'util jquery-plugins-1', 'util jquery-plugins-2'], function  $  {      ... } ;  In this case, even though jquery-plugin-1 and jquery-plugin-2 do not return values, they must still   be added as dependencies so that their side effects—adding plugins to the jquery module—still occur.  83  www.it-ebooks.info   CHapTer 5   requireJS  Shims Libraries that support the AMD module format are straightforward to use with RequireJS. Non-AMD  libraries may still be used by configuring RequireJS shims, or by creating a shimmed modules manually.  The data quotes module in example-003 exposes a groupByAttribution   method that iterates over   the collection of quotes. It creates a hash where keys are the names of people and values are arrays of quotes  attributed to them. This grouping functionality would likely be useful for other collections as well.  Fortunately, a vendor library, undrln, can provide a generalized version of this functionality, but it is   not AMD-compatible. A shim would be necessary for other AMD modules to use undrln as a dependency.  Undrln is written as a standard JavaScript module within a function closure, shown in Listing 5-18. It assigns  itself to the global window object, where it may be accessed by other scripts on a page.     Note  The undrln.js script blatantly mimics a subset of the Lodash api without aMD module compatibility,  exclusively for this chapter’s examples.  Several things must be added to the RequireJS configuration to create a shim. First, a module alias   must be created under paths so that RequireJS knows where the shimmed module lives. Second, a shim  configuration entry must be added to the shim section. Both are added to the RequireJS configuration in  Listing 5-19.  Listing 5-18.  The Completely Original Undrln Library     example-004 public scripts vendor undrln undrln.js  **  * undrln  c  2015 l33th@x0r  * MIT license.  * v0.0.0.0.1-alpha-DEV-theta-r2  *   function    {     var undrln = window._ = {};     undrln.groupBy = function  collection, key  {        ...   };   }   ;  Listing 5-19.  Configuration of a Module Shim     example-004 public scripts main.js requirejs.config {   baseUrl: ' scripts',   paths: {     jquery: 'vendor jquery jquery-2.1.3.min',     'jquery-all': 'util jquery-all',        giving undrln a module alias     undrln: 'vendor undrln undrln'   },  84  www.it-ebooks.info   CHapTer 5   requireJS    shim: {        defining a shim for undrln     undrln: {       exports: '_'     }   } } ;  Each key under the shim section identifies the module alias  or name  to be shimmed, and the objects  assigned to those keys specify details about how the shim works. Under the hood, RequireJS creates a shim  by defining an empty AMD module that returns the global object created by a script or library. Undrln  creates the global window._ object, and so the name _ is specified in the shim configuration as undrln’s  export. The final, generated RequireJS shim will look something like the module in Listing 5-20. Note that  these shims are created dynamically as modules are loaded and do not actually exist as “files” on the web  server.  One exception to this rule is the r.js packing utility, discussed later, which writes generated shim  output to a bundle file as an optimization measure.   The quotes module in Listing 5-21 may now use the undrln shim as a dependency.  Listing 5-20.  Example RequireJS Shim Module  define 'undrln', [], function    {   return window._; } ;  Listing 5-21.  Using the Undrln Shim As a Dependency     example-004 public scripts data quotes.js define ['undrln'], function  _  {     ...   return {     groupByAttribution: function    {       return _.groupBy quoteData, 'attribution' ;     },       ...   } } ;  By shimming non-AMD scripts, RequireJS can use its asynchronous module-loading capabilities   behind the scenes to load non-AMD scripts when they are dependencies of other AMD modules. Without  this capability these scripts would need to be included on every page with a standard   tag and  loaded synchronously to ensure availability.  Running the web application in example-004 and then browsing to http:  localhost:8080 index.html    will display a list of quotes. Figure 5-2 shows the rendered page and Chrome’s Network panel in which  all loaded JavaScript modules are listed. Note that the Initiator column clearly shows that RequireJS is  responsible for loading all modules, and that even undrln.js, a non-AMD module, is included in the list.  85  www.it-ebooks.info   CHapTer 5   requireJS  Figure 5-2.  RequireJS modules shown loaded in Chrome  Shim Dependencies It is reasonable to expect shimmed scripts to have dependencies, likely objects in the global scope. When  AMD modules specify dependencies, RequireJS ensures that the dependencies are loaded first, before the  module code is executed. Dependencies for shimmed scripts are specified in a similar manner within the  shim configuration. A shimmed script may depend on other shimmed scripts, or even AMD modules if those  modules make content available in the global scope  usually a bad idea, but sometimes necessary .  To enhance the example application, a search field has been added to the quote page in example-005.   Terms entered into the search field appear highlighted in the text of any quote in which they are found. Up to  this point all examples have used a single view, quotes-view, to display the rendered markup. Because the  application features are growing, two new modules will be introduced to help manage features: search-view  and quotes-state. The search-view module is responsible for monitoring a text field for user input. When  this field changes, the view informs the quotes-state module that a search has occurred, passing it the  search term. The quotes-state module acts as the single source of state for all views, and when it receives a  new search term, it triggers an event to which views may subscribe.  Digging through some legacy source code produced the file public scripts util jquery.highlight.js,    a non-AMD jQuery plugin that highlights text in the DOM. When the quotes-view module receives the  search event from the quotes-state module, it uses this plugin to highlight text in the DOM based on the  search term stored in quotes-state. To use this legacy script, a path and a shim entry are both added to  the main.js configuration. The highlight plugin doesn’t export any values, but it does need jQuery to be  loaded first or the plugin will throw an error when it attempts to access the global jQuery object.  86  www.it-ebooks.info   Dependencies have been added to the highlight shim with the deps property, shown in Listing 5-22.  This property contains an array of module names  or aliases  that should be loaded before the shim--in this  case jQuery.  CHapTer 5   requireJS  Listing 5-22.  The highlight Shim Depends on jQuery     example-005 public scripts main.js requirejs.config {   baseUrl: ' scripts',   paths: {     jquery: 'vendor jquery jquery-2.1.3.min',     'jquery-all': 'util jquery-all',     undrln: 'vendor undrln undrln',     ventage: 'vendor ventage ventage',     highlight: 'util jquery.highlight'   },   shim: {     undrln: {       exports: '_'     },     highlight: {       deps: ['jquery']     }   } } ;  Once the highlight plugin has been shimmed, it may be loaded as a dependency of another module.   Since the jquery-all module is responsible for loading custom plugins anyway, making the highlight  module one of its dependencies in Listing 5-23 seems sensible.  Shimmed scripts should only have two kinds of dependencies:   	 Other shimmed scripts that execute immediately and potentially create one or more   reusable variables or namespaces in the global scope   	  AMD modules that also create reusable variables or namespaces in the global scope   such as window.jQuery  as a side effect  Because AMD modules typically don’t meddle with the global scope at all, it is practically useless to   use them as dependencies for a shimmed script because there is no way for the shimmed script to access an  AMD module’s API. If an AMD module adds nothing to the global scope, it is useless to shimed scripts. Also,  AMD modules are loaded asynchronously and their closures are executed in a particular order  discussed  in the next section , whereas shimmed scripts will be run as soon as they are loaded.  Rembmer: shimmed  scripts are normal scripts that run once they’ve been introduced into the DOM. A generated shim module  simply delivers the global export created by a non-AMD script to other AMD modules as a dependency.   Even if a shimmed script could access an AMD module’s API, there is no guarantee that the module would  be available when the shimmed script actually runs.  87  www.it-ebooks.info   CHapTer 5   requireJS  Listing 5-23.  Loading the highlight Module As a Dependency of Another Module     example-005 public scripts util jquery-all.js define ['jquery', 'highlight'], function  $  {     $.fn.addQuotes = function  attribution, quotes  {        ...   };     return $; } ;  With this arrangement there are likely two questions that spring to mind immediately:        1.   Since both the highlight and jquery-all modules declare jquery as a  dependency, when is jQuery actually loaded?  2.  Why isn’t a second highlight parameter specified in the jquery-all module   closure function?  First, when RequireJS evaluates dependencies among modules, it creates an internal dependency tree  based on module hierarchy. By doing this it can determine the optimal time to load any particular module,  starting from the leaves and moving toward the trunk. In this case the “trunk” is the jquery-all module, and  the furthest leaf is the jquery module on which highlight depends. RequireJS will execute module closures  in the following order: jquery, highlight, jquery-all. Because jquery is also a dependency of jquery-all,  RequireJS will simply deliver the same jquery instance created for the highlight module.  Second, the highlight module returns no value and is used merely for side effects—for adding a   plugin to the jQuery object. No parameter is passed to the jquery-all module because highlight returns  none. Dependencies that are used only for side effects should always be placed at the end of a module’s  dependency list for this reason.  Loader Plugins There are several RequireJS loader plugins that are so useful, they find a home in most projects. A loader  plugin is an external script that is used to conveniently load, and sometimes parse, specific kinds of  resources that may then be imported as standard AMD dependencies, even though the resources themselves  may not be actual AMD modules.  text.js The RequireJS text plugin can load a plain text resource over HTTP, serialize it as a string, and deliver it to  an AMD module as a dependency. This is commonly used to load HTML templates, or even raw JSON data  from HTTP endpoints. To install the plugin, the text.js script must be copied from the project repository  and, by convention, placed in the same directory as the main.js configuration file.  Alternative installation  methods are listed in the plugin project’s README.   The quotes-view module in the example application uses a jQuery plugin to build up the list of quotes,  one DOM element at a time. This is not very efficient and could easily be replaced by a templating solution.  The AMD-compatible Handlebars templating library is a popular choice for such tasks. In Listing 5-24 the  library has been added to the vendor directory in example-006 and a convenient module alias has been  created in the main.js configuration.  88  www.it-ebooks.info   CHapTer 5   requireJS  When the quotes-view module renders itself, it uses quote data in an object hash where the keys are   attributions  i.e., the person credited with each quote  and the values are arrays of quotes for each.  A given  attribution may be associated with one or more quotes.  Listing 5-25 shows the template that will be bound  to this data structure, located in the public scripts templates quotes.hbs file.  Listing 5-24.  Handlebars Module Alias     example-006 public scripts main.js requirejs.config {   baseUrl: ' scripts',   paths: {       ...     Handlebars: 'vendor handlebars handlebars-v3.0.3'   },     ... } ;  Listing 5-25.  The quotes-view Handlebars Template    {{each this as quotes attribution}}      {{attribution}}    {{each quotes}}       {{explode text delim="\n"}}      {{this}}    {{ explode}}       {{ each}}   {{ each}}  It is not necessary to be completely familiar with Handlebars syntax to understand that this template   iterates over the data object, pulling out each attribution and its associated quotes. It creates an    element for the attribution, then for each quote builds a   element to hold the quote text.   A special block helper, explode, breaks the quote text apart at the new line  \n  delimiter, and then wraps  each segment of the quote text in a   tag.  The explode helper is significant because it is not native to Handlebars. It is defined and registered as a   Handlebars helper in the file public scripts util handlebars-all.js, as shown in Listing 5-26.  Listing 5-26.  explode Handlebars Helper     example-006 public scripts util handlebars-all.js define ['Handlebars'], function  Handlebars  {   Handlebars.registerHelper 'explode', function  context, options  {     var delimiter = options.hash.delim  '';     var parts = context.split delimiter ;     var processed = '';     while  parts.length  {       processed += options.fn parts.shift  .trim   ;     }  89  www.it-ebooks.info   CHapTer 5   requireJS      return processed;   } ;   return Handlebars; } ;  Because this module adds helpers and then returns the Handlebars object, the quotes-view module   will import it as a dependency instead of the vanilla Handlebars module, in much the same way as  the jquery-all module is used in lieu of jquery. The appropriate module alias has been added to the  configuration in Listing 5-27.  In Listing 5-28, the quotes-view module has been modified to import both handlebars-all and the  quotes.hbs template. The module name for the text template is very specific: it must begin with the prefix  text! followed by the path to the template file relative to the baseUrl path defined in main.js.  Listing 5-28.  The quotes.hbs Template Imported As a Module Dependency  Listing 5-27.  handlebars-all Module Alias     example-006 public scripts main.js requirejs.config {   baseUrl: ' scripts',   paths: {       ...     Handlebars: 'vendor handlebars handlebars-v3.0.3',     'handlebars-all': 'util handlebars-all'   },     ... } ;     example-006 public scripts quotes-view.js define [   'jquery-all',   'quotes-state',   'handlebars-all',   'text!templates quote.hbs' ], function  $, quotesState, Handlebars, quotesTemplate  {     var bindTemplate = Handlebars.compile quotesTemplate ;     var view = {        ...     render: function    {       view.$el.empty  ;       var groupedQuotes = quotesState.quotes;       view.$el.html bindTemplate groupedQuotes  ;     },        ...   };          ... } ;  90  www.it-ebooks.info   CHapTer 5   requireJS  When RequireJS encounters a dependency name with the text! prefix, it automatically attempts to   load the text.js plugin script, which will then load and serialize the specified file content as a string. The  quotesTemplate function argument in the quotes-view closure will contain the serialized content of the  quotes.hbs file, which is then compiled by Handlebars and used to render the module in the DOM.  Page Load When a web page has fully loaded, it triggers a DOMContentLoaded event  in modern browsers . Scripts that  are loaded before the browser has finished building the DOM often listen for this event to know when it is  safe to begin manipulating page elements. If scripts are loaded just before the ending   tag, they may  assume that the bulk of the DOM has already been loaded and that they need not listen for this event. Scripts  anywhere else in the   element, or more commonly the   element, have no such luxury, however.  Even though RequireJS is loaded before the closing   tag in the application example, the    main.js file  configuration omitted  in Listing 5-29 still passes a function to jQuery that will be executed  once the DOMContentLoaded has fired. If the RequireJS   tag were moved into the document  ,  nothing would break.  Listing 5-29.  Using jQuery to Determine If the DOM Is Fully Loaded     example-006 public scripts main.js    ...   requirejs ['jquery-all', 'quotes-view', 'search-view'],   function  $, quotesView  {   $ function    {     quotesView.ready  ;   } ; } ;  The domReady plugin is a peculiar kind of “loader” in that it simply stalls the invocation of a module’s   closure until the DOM is completely ready. Like the text plugin, the domReady.js file must be accessible  to RequireJS within the baseUrl path defined in the main.js configuration. By convention it is typically a  sibling of main.js.  Listing 5-30 shows a modified version of main.js  configuration omitted  in which the jquery   dependency has been removed and the domReady! plugin has been appended to the dependency list. The  trailing exclamation mark tells RequireJS that this module acts as a loader plugin rather than a standard  module. Unlike the text plugin, domReady actually loads nothing, so no additional information is required  after the exclamation mark.  Listing 5-30.  Using the domReady Plugin to Determine If the DOM Is Fully Loaded     example-007 public scripts main.js    ...   requirejs ['quotes-view', 'search-view', 'domReady!'],   function  quotesView  {     quotesView.ready  ; } ;  91  www.it-ebooks.info   CHapTer 5   requireJS  i18n RequireJS supports internationalization via the i18n loader plugin.  i18n is a numeronym, which means  that the number “18” represents the 18 characters between “i” and “n” in the word “internationalization”.   Internationalization is the act of writing a web application such that it can adapt its content to a user’s  language and locale  also known as National Language Support, or NLS . The i18n plugin is primarily used  for translating text in a website’s controls and “chrome”: button labels, headers, hyperlink text, fieldset  legends, and so forth. To demonstrate this plugin’s capabilities, two new templates have been added to the  example application, one for the page title in the header, and one for the search field with placeholder text.  The actual quote data will not be translated because, presumably, it comes from an application server that  would be responsible for rendering the appropriate translation. In this application, though, the data is hard- coded in the data quotes module for simplicity and will always appear in English.  The search.hbs template in Listing 5-31 has also been extracted from the index.html file and now   accepts placeholder text for the search field as its only input. The search-view module has been adapted to  use this template when it renders content in the DOM.  Listing 5-31.  The search.hbs Template Will Display the Placeholder Translation                       Listing 5-32 shows the new header.hbs template that will be rendered by the new header-view module.   The template accepts a single input, the page title.  Listing 5-32.  The header.hbs Template Will Display the Page Title Translation     {{pageTitle}}   The header-view module in Listing 5-33 demonstrates not only how the template dependency is   imported with the text plugin, but also how a language module dependency is imported with the i18n  plugin. The familiar loader syntax looks nearly identical: the plugin name followed by an exclamation mark  and a module path relative to the configured baseUrl, in this case nls lang. When a template is loaded, its  serialized string content is passed to a module’s closure, but the i18n plugin loads a language module that  contains translated text data and passes that module’s object to the closure. In Listing 5-33 this object will be  accessible through the lang parameter.  Listing 5-33.  The header-view Module Depends on the i18n Language Object     example-008 public scripts header-view.js define [   'quotes-state',   'jquery-all',   'handlebars-all',   'text!templates header.hbs',   'i18n!nls lang' ], function  quotesState, $, Handlebars, headerTemplate, lang  {      ... } ;  92  www.it-ebooks.info   The language module is a regular AMD module, but instead of passing a list of dependencies and a   closure to define  , a simple object literal is used. This object literal follows a very specific syntax, shown in  Listing 5-34.  CHapTer 5   requireJS  Listing 5-34.  Default English Language Module     example-008 public scripts nls lang.js define {   root: {     pageTitle: 'Ponderings',     searchPlaceholder: 'search'   },   de: true } ;  First, a root property holds the key value pairs that will be used to fetch translated data when the plugin  resolves the language translations. The keys in this object are simply keys by which the translated text may be  accessed programmatically. In the search template, for example, {{searchPlaceholder}} will be replaced  with the string value at the language object’s key searchPlaceholder when the template is bound to it.  Second, siblings to the root property are the various IETF language tags for active and inactive translations   that should be resolved based on a browser’s language setting. In this example, the German de language tag  is assigned the value true. If a Spanish translation was made available, an es-es property with the value true  could be added. And for a French translation, a fr-fr property could be added, and so forth for other languages.  When a new language tag is enabled in the default language module, a directory corresponding to the   language code must be made as a sibling to the module file. The nls de directory can be seen in Listing 5-35.  Once the language-specific directory has been created, a language module file of the same name as the  default language module file must be created within. This new language module will contain the translated  content of the root property in the default language module only. Listing 5-36 shows the German  de   translation of the pageTitle and searchPlaceholder properties.  Listing 5-35.  Directory Structure for NLS Modules ├── nls  │   ├── de  │    │   └── lang.js  │   └── lang.js  Listing 5-36.  German  de  Translation Module     example-008 public scripts nls de lang.js define {   pageTitle: 'Grübeleien',   searchPlaceholder: 'suche' } ;  When the default language module is loaded with the i18n plugin, it examines the browser’s    window.navigator.language property to determine what locale and language translation should be used.   If the default language module specifies a compatible, enabled locale, the i18n plugin loads the locale-specific  module and then merges it with the default language module’s root object. Missing translations in the  locale-specific module will be filled with values from the default language module.  Figure 5-3 shows how the quotes page looks when a Google Chrome browser’s language has been    set to German.   93  www.it-ebooks.info   CHapTer 5   requireJS  Figure 5-3.  Switching the browser language loads the German translation      Note  The window.navigator.language property is affected by different settings in different browsers.  For example, in Google Chrome it only reflects the user’s language setting, whereas in Mozilla Firefox it can be  affected by an Accept-Language header in a page’s HTTp response as well.  Cache Busting Application servers often cache resources like script files, images, stylesheets, and so on to eliminate  unnecessary disk access when serving a resource that has not changed since it was last read. Cached  resources are often stored in memory and associated with some key, usually the URL of the resource.  When multiple requests for a given URL occur within a specified cache period, the resource is fetched from  memory using the key  URL . This can have significant performance benefits in a production environment,  but invalidating cache in development or testing environments every time a code change is made, or a new  resource is introduced, can become tedious.  Certainly caching can be toggled on a per-environment basis, but a simpler solution, at least for   JavaScript  or any resource loaded by RequireJS , might be to utilize the RequireJS cache-busting feature.  Cache busting is the act of mutating the URL for every resource request in such a way that the resource may  still be fetched, but will never be found in cache because its “key” is always different. This is commonly done  by including a query string parameter that changes whenever a page is reloaded.  94  www.it-ebooks.info   A urlArgs property has been added to the configuration script in Listing 5-37. This will append the   query string parameter bust={timestamp} to all requests generated by RequireJS. The time stamp is  recalculated for each page load to ensure that the parameter value changes, making URLs unique.  Listing 5-37.  The urlArgs Configuration Property Can Be Used to Bust Cache  CHapTer 5   requireJS     example-009 public scripts main.js requirejs.config {   baseUrl: ' scripts',   urlArgs: 'bust=' +  new Date  .getTime   ,   paths: {        ...   },   shim: {        ...   } } ;  Figure 5-4 shows that the bust parameter is indeed applied to each request initiated by RequireJS, even   XHR requests for text resources like header.hbs.  Figure 5-4.  The bust parameter is appended to each RequireJS request   95  www.it-ebooks.info   CHapTer 5   requireJS  While the usefulness of this feature is evident, it can also create a few problems. First, RequireJS respects HTTP cache headers, so even if urlArgs is used as a cache-busting   mechanism, RequireJS may still request  and receive  a cached version of a resource, depending on how  cache is implemented. If possible, always serve the appropriate cache headers in each environment.  Second, be aware that some proxy servers drop query string parameters. If a development or staging   environment includes proxies to mimic a production environment, a cache-busting query string parameter  may be ineffective. Some developers use urlArgs to specify particular resource versions in a production  environment  e.g., version=v2 , but this is generally discouraged for this very reason. It is an unreliable  versioning technique, at best.  Finally, some browsers treat resources with different URLs as distinct, debuggable entities. In Chrome   and Firefox, for example, if a debug breakpoint is set in the source code for http:  localhost:8080  scripts quotes-state.js?bust=1432504595280, it will be removed if the page is refreshed, when the  new resource URL becomes http:  localhost:8080 scripts quotes-state.js?bust=1432504694566.  Resetting breakpoints can become tedious, and though the debugger keyword can be used to circumvent  this problem by forcing the browser to pause execution, it still requires a diligent developer to ensure that all  debugger breakpoints are removed before code is promoted to production.  RequireJS Optimizer  The RequireJS optimizer, r.js, is a build tool for RequireJS projects. It can be used to concatenate all RequireJS  modules into a single file, minify source code, copy build output to a distinct directory, and much more.   This section introduces the tool and its basic configuration. Specific examples for several common scenarios  will be covered next.  The most common way to use r.js involves installing the RequireJS npm package for Node.js, either   as a global package or as a local project package. The examples in this section will use the local RequireJS  installation created when all npm modules were installed.  Configuring r.js A wide array of parameters may be passed as arguments to the r.js tool to control its behavior. Fortunately  these parameters can also be passed to r.js in a regular JavaScript configuration file, which makes the  terminal command significantly shorter. For non-trivial projects this is the preferred configuration method,  and will be the only one covered in this chapter.  The code files in the example-010 directory have been moved into a standard src directory, and a   new file, rjs-config.js, has been placed in the directory root. This file, unsurprisingly, contains the r.js  configuration. Its contents are shown in Listing 5-38.  Listing 5-38.  r.js Configuration     example-010 rjs-config.js  {      build input directory for application code   appDir: '. src',      build output directory for application code   dir: '. build',      path relative to build input directory where scripts live   baseUrl: 'public scripts',      predefined configuration file used to resolve dependencies   mainConfigFile: '. src public scripts main.js',  96  www.it-ebooks.info   CHapTer 5   requireJS       include all text! references as inline modules   inlineText: true,      do not copy files that were combined in build output   removeCombined: true,        specific modules to be built   modules: [     {       name: 'main'     }   ],        uglify the output   optimize: 'uglify' }   Developers who are familiar with build tools will immediately recognize the input output pattern   The appDir property specifies the project “input” directory, relative to the configuration file, where   present in the configuration.  uncompiled source code lives.  The dir property specifies the project “output” directory, relative to the configuration file, where   compiled and minified output will be written when the r.js tool runs.  The baseUrl property tells r.js where the project scripts are located relative to the appDir property. This  should not be confused with the baseUrl property in the main.js file, which tells RequireJS where modules  are located relative to the web application root.  The mainConfigFile property points to the actual RequireJS  not r.js  configuration. This helps r.js  understand how modules are related to each other, and what module aliases and shims exist, if any. It is  possible to omit this property and specify all of these paths in the r.js configuration, though that is beyond  the scope of this example.  Setting the inlineText property to true ensures that all text files referenced with the text plugin prefix  text! will be compiled with RequireJS modules in the final build output. This option is enabled by default  but is explicitly set in this project for clarity.  By default, r.js will minify and copy all scripts  packed and unpacked  to the output directory. The  removeCombined property toggles this behavior. In this case only the packed, compiled script s  and any  other scripts that could not be included in the packed output will be copied to the output directory.  The modules array lists all of the top-level modules to be compiled. Because this is a single-page   application, only the actual main module needs to be compiled.  Finally, the optimize property instructs r.js to apply an uglify transform to all scripts, minimizing all   JavaScript code.  Running the r.js Command Building the project is simply a matter of running the r.js command in a terminal, passing it the path to the  configuration file via its -o flag as shown in Listing 5-39.  Listing 5-39.  Running the r.js Command  example-010$ .. node_modules .bin r.js -o rjs-config.js  Terminal output shows which files are compiled and copied by r.js during the build. Examining the   build output files in Listing 5-40 shows what, exactly, r.js optimized and copied.  97  www.it-ebooks.info   CHapTer 5   requireJS  Listing 5-40.

First, the require.js and main.js scripts are both present. Since these scripts are the only files   referenced in index.html, their presence here is expected. Other scripts such as the quotes-view.js and  quotes-state.js scripts are noticeably absent, but examining the content of main.js reveals why: they have  been packed and minified according to the r.js build settings.  Second, the localization file nls lang.js is now missing because it has been included as part of  main.js. The nls de lang.js script still remains as part of the build output, though its contents have  been minified. Any user browsing the example web page in the default locale will receive an optimized  experience, as RequireJS will not have to make an external AJAX call to load the default language  translations. Users from Germany will incur the additional HTTP request because the German localization  file has not been included in the packed output. This is a limitation of the localization plugin that r.js must  respect.  98  www.it-ebooks.info   CHapTer 5   requireJS  Third, the Handlebars templates, though compiled as part of the build output in main.js, have also   been copied to the public scripts templates directory. This happens because RequireJS plugins currently  have no visibility into the build process and therefore no method of honoring the removeCombined option in  the r.js configuration file. Fortunately, because these templates have been wrapped in AMD modules and  concatenated with main.js, RequireJS will not attempt to load them with AJAX requests. If deployment size  is an issue for this project, a post-build script or task can be created to remove the templates directory if  needed.  Fourth, the vendor ventage directory has been copied to the build directory even though its core  module, ventage.js, has been concatenated with main.js. While RequireJS can automatically remove  individual module files  like ventage.js  after compilation, it will not clean up other files associated with a  module  in this case, unit tests and package definition files like package.json and bower.json , so they must  be removed manually, or as part of a post-build process.  Summary  RequireJS is a very pragmatic JavaScript module loader that works well in a browser environment. Its ability  to load and resolve modules asynchronously means that it does not rely solely on bundling or packing  scripts for performance benefits. For further optimization, though, the r.js optimization tool may be used  to combine RequireJS modules into a single, minified script to minimize the number of HTTP requests  necessary to load modules and other resources.  Though RequireJS modules must be defined in AMD format, RequireJS can shim non-AMD scripts so   that legacy code may be imported by AMD modules where necessary. Shimmed modules may also have  dependencies that can automatically be loaded by RequireJS.  The text plugin lets modules import external text file dependencies  such as templates  as strings.   These text files are loaded like any other module dependency, and may even be inlined in build output by  the r.js optimizer.  Localization is supported by the i18n module loader, which can dynamically load text translation   modules based on a browser’s locale settings. While the primary locale translation module can be optimized  and concatenated with r.js, additional locale translation modules will always be loaded with HTTP requests.  Module execution can be deferred by the pageLoad plugin, which prevents a module’s closure from   executing until the DOM has been fully rendered. This can be an effective way to eliminate repeat calls  to jQuery’s ready   function, or fumbling through the cross-browser code necessary to subscribe to the  DOMContentLoaded event manually.  Finally, the RequireJS configuration can automatically append query string parameters to all RequireJS   HTTP requests, providing a cheap but effective cache-busting feature for development environments.  99  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 6  Browserify  Less is more.  —Ludwig Mies van der Rohe  Browserify is a JavaScript module loader that works around the language’s current lack of support for  importing modules within the browser by serving as a “pre-processor” for your code. In much the same way  that CSS extensions such as SASS and LESS have brought enhanced syntax support to stylesheets, Browserify  enhances client-side JavaScript applications by recursively scanning their source code for calls to a global  require   function. When Browserify finds such calls, it immediately loads the referenced modules  using  the same require   function that is available within Node.js  and combines them into a single, minified  file—a “bundle”—that can then be loaded within the browser.  This simple but elegant approach brings the power and convenience of CommonJS  the method   by which modules are loaded within Node.js  to the browser, while also doing away with the additional  complexity and boilerplate code required by Asynchronous Module Definition  AMD  loaders such as  RequireJS  described in Chapter 5 .  In this chapter, you will learn how to   	 Distinguish between AMD and CommonJS module loaders  	 Create modular front-end JavaScript applications that follow the simple patterns for   module management popularized by tools such as Node.js  Visualize a project’s dependency tree   	  	 Compile your application as quickly as possible—as changes are made—using   Browserify’s sister application, Watchify   	 Use third-party Browserify plugins  “transforms”  to extend the tool beyond its core   functionality    Portions of this chapter discuss concepts already covered in this book’s previous chapters on Bower     Note   Chapter 1  and Grunt  Chapter 2 . If you are unfamiliar with these tools, you are encouraged to cover that  material before proceeding.  101  www.it-ebooks.info   ChaPter 6   BrowserIfy  The AMD API vs. CommonJS  The Asynchronous Module Definition API, covered in Chapter 5, serves as a clever workaround to  JavaScript’s current lack of support for loading external modules inline. Often referred to as a “browser-first”   approach, the AMD API accomplishes its goal of bringing modules to the browser by requiring that  developers wrap each of their modules within a callback function, which can then be loaded asynchronously   i.e., “lazy loaded”  as needed. This process is demonstrated by the modules shown in Listing 6-1.  Listing 6-1.  Defining and Requiring an AMD Module     requirejs-example public app weather.js   define [], function   {     return {         'getForecast': function   {             document.getElementById 'forecast' .innerHTML = 'Partly cloudy.';         }     }; } ;      requirejs-example public app index.js   define ['weather'], function weather  {     weather.getForecast  ; } ;  The AMD API is both clever and effective, but many developers also find it to be a bit clumsy and   verbose. Ideally, JavaScript applications should be capable of referencing external modules without the  added complexity and boilerplate code that the AMD API requires. Fortunately, a popular alternative known  as CommonJS exists that addresses this concern.  While most people tend to associate JavaScript with web browsers, the truth is that JavaScript has   found widespread use in a number of other environments for quite some time—well before Node.js came  on the scene. Examples of such environments include Rhino, a server-side runtime environment created by  Mozilla, and ActionScript, a derivative used by Adobe’s once-popular Flash platform that has fallen out of  favor in recent years. Each of these platforms works around JavaScript’s lack of built-in module support by  creating its own approach.  Sensing a need for a standard solution to this problem, a group of developers got together and proposed   what became known as CommonJS, a standardized approach to defining and using JavaScript modules.  Node.js follows a similar approach, as does the next major update to JavaScript  ECMAScript 6, a.k.a. ES6  Harmony . This approach can also be used to write modular JavaScript applications that work in all web  browsers in use today, although not without the help of additional tools such as Browserify, the subject of  this chapter.  Installing Browserify  Before going any further, you should ensure that you have installed Browserify’s command-line utility.  Available as an npm package, the installation process is shown in Listing 6-2.  102  www.it-ebooks.info   Listing 6-2.  Installing the browserify Command-Line Utility via npm  $ npm install -g browserify $ browserify --version 10.2.4   ChaPter 6   BrowserIfy   Node’s package manager  npm  allows users to install packages in one of two contexts: locally      Note  or globally. In this example, browserify is installed within the global context, which is typically reserved for  command-line utilities.  Creating Your First Bundle  Much of Browserify’s appeal lies in its simplicity; JavaScript developers familiar with CommonJS and Node  will find themselves immediately at home. By way of an example, consider Listing 6-3, which shows the  CommonJS-based equivalent of the simple RequireJS-based application we saw in Listing 6-1.  Listing 6-3.  Front-End Application That Requires Modules via CommonJS     simple public app index.js   var weather = require '. weather' ; weather.getForecast  ;      simple public app weather.js   module.exports = {     'getForecast': function   {         document.getElementById 'forecast' .innerHTML = 'Partly cloudy.';     } };  Unlike our RequireJS-based example, this application cannot be run directly within the browser   because the browser lacks a built-in mechanism for loading modules via require  . Before the browser  can understand this application, we must first compile it into a bundle with the help of the browserify  command-line utility or via Browserify’s API.  The command for compiling this application using Browserify’s command-line utility is as follows:  $ browserify app index.js -o public dist app.js  Here we pass the browserify utility the path to our application’s main file, public app index.js, and  specify that the compiled output should be saved to public dist app.js, the script referenced within the  project’s HTML  see Listing 6-4 .  103  www.it-ebooks.info   ChaPter 6   BrowserIfy  Listing 6-4.  HTML File Referencing Our Compiled Browserify Bundle     simple public index.html                                Browserify - Simple Example                         In addition to using Browserify’s command-line utility, we also have the option of compiling this   application programmatically via Browserify’s API. Doing so will allow us to easily incorporate this step  into a larger build process  developed with tools such as Grunt . Listing 6-5 shows this project’s browserify  Grunt task.  Listing 6-5.  Grunt Task That Compiles the Application via Browserify’s API     simple tasks browserify.js   module.exports = function grunt  {       grunt.registerTask 'browserify', function   {         var done = this.async  ;         var path = require 'path' ;         var fs = require 'fs' ;         var src = path.join 'public', 'app', 'index.js' ;         var target = path.join 'public', 'dist', 'app.js' ;         var browserify = require 'browserify'  [src] ;         browserify.bundle function err, data  {             if  err  return grunt.fail.fatal err ;             grunt.file.mkdir path.join 'public', 'dist'  ;             fs.writeFileSync target, data ;             done  ;         } ;     } ;   };  Visualizing the Dependency Tree  If you happen to be more of a visual learner, the chart shown in Figure 6-1 may go a long way toward  conveying what occurs during Browserify’s compilation process. Here we see a visualization of the various  dependencies encountered by Browserify as it compiled this chapter’s advanced project.  104  www.it-ebooks.info   ChaPter 6   BrowserIfy  Figure 6-1.  Visualizing the advanced project’s dependency tree  Viewing this chart as a static rendering on a page really does not do it justice. For the full effect, you   should compile the project and view the chart within your browser by running npm start from within the  project’s folder. Doing so will allow you to hover your mouse over the various segments of the chart, each of  which represents a dependency encountered by Browserify during its compilation process. While it is not  evident in Figure 6-1, an in-depth analysis of the chart indicates that our application’s custom code accounts  for only a tiny sliver  9.7kB  of the total size of the bundle generated by Browserify. The vast majority of this  project’s nearly 2MB of code consists of third-party dependencies  e.g., Angular, jQuery, Lodash, etc. , an  important fact that will be referenced again later in the chapter.   you may also be interested in investigating the browserify-graph and colony command-line       Note  utilities  also available via npm , which you can use to generate additional visualizations of a project’s  dependency tree.  Creating New Bundles As Changes Occur  Projects that take advantage of Browserify cannot be run directly within the browser—they must first be  compiled. In order to make the most efficient use of the tool, it is important that projects be set up in such a  way as to automatically trigger this step as changes occur within their source code. Let’s take a look at two  methods by which this can be achieved.  105  www.it-ebooks.info   ChaPter 6   BrowserIfy  Watching for File Changes with Grunt In Chapter 2 on Grunt, you discovered how plugins such as grunt-contrib-watch allow developers to  trigger build steps as changes are made within an application’s source code. It’s easy to see how such  tools could be applied to projects using Browserify, triggering the creation of new bundles as changes  are detected. An example of this process in action can be seen by running the default Grunt task for this  chapter’s simple project, as shown in Listing 6-6.  Listing 6-6.  Triggering the Creation of New Browserify Builds with Grunt  $ grunt Running "browserify" task   Running "concurrent:serve"  concurrent  task     Running "watch" task     Waiting...     Running "server" task     App is now available at: http:  localhost:7000     >> File "app index.js" changed.     Running "browserify" task       Done, without errors.     Completed in 0.615s at Fri Jun 26 2015 08:31:25 GMT-0500  CDT  - Waiting...  In this example, running the default Grunt task triggered three steps:  A Browserify bundle was immediately created.  A web server was launched to host the project.   	  	  	  A watch script was executed that triggers the creation of new Browserify bundles as  source code changes are detected.  This simple approach typically serves most small projects quite well; however, as small projects  gradually evolve into large projects, developers often grow frustrated, understandably, with the ever- increasing build times that accompany it. Having to wait several seconds before you can try out each of your  updates can quickly destroy any sense of “flow” that you might hope to achieve. Fortunately, Browserify’s  sister application, Watchify, can help us in these situations.  Watching for File Changes with Watchify If Browserify  which compiles applications in their entirety  can be thought of as a meat cleaver, Watchify  can be thought of as a paring knife. When invoked, Watchify initially compiles a specified application in its  entirety; however, rather than exiting once this process has completed, Watchify continues to run, watching  for changes to a project’s source code. As changes are detected, Watchify recompiles only those files that  have changed, resulting in drastically faster build times. Watchify accomplishes this by maintaining its own  internal caching mechanism throughout each build.  As with Browserify, Watchify can be invoked via either the command line or a provided API. In   Listing 6-7, this chapter’s simple project is compiled with the help of Watchify’s command-line utility. In  this example, the -v argument is passed to specify that Watchify should run in verbose mode. As a result,  Watchify notifies us as changes are detected.  106  www.it-ebooks.info   ChaPter 6   BrowserIfy  Listing 6-7.  Installing Watchify via npm and Running It Against This Chapter’s simple Project  $ npm install -g watchify $ watchify public app index.js -o public dist app.js -v 778 bytes written to public dist app.js  0.03 seconds  786 bytes written to public dist app.js  0.01 seconds   As with Browserify, Watchify provides a convenient API that allows us to integrate it into a larger build  process  see Listing 6-8 . We can do so with just a few small tweaks to the Browserify task previously shown  in Listing 6-7.  Listing 6-8.  Grunt Task Demonstrating the Use of Watchify’s API     simple tasks watchify.js   module.exports = function grunt  {       grunt.registerTask 'watchify', function   {           var done = this.async  ;         var browserify = require 'browserify' ;         var watchify = require 'watchify' ;         var fs = require 'fs' ;         var path = require 'path' ;         var src = path.join 'public', 'app', 'index.js' ;         var target = path.join 'public', 'dist', 'app.js' ;         var targetDir = path.join 'public', 'dist' ;           var browserify = browserify {             'cache': {},             'packageCache': {}         } ;         browserify = watchify browserify ;         browserify.add src ;           var compile = function err, data  {             if  err  return grunt.log.error err ;             if  !data  return grunt.log.error 'No data' ;             grunt.file.mkdir targetDir ;             fs.writeFileSync target, data ;         };           browserify.bundle compile ;           browserify.on 'update', function   {             browserify.bundle compile ;         } ;           browserify.on 'log', function msg  {             grunt.log.oklns msg ;         } ;       } ;   };  107  www.it-ebooks.info   ChaPter 6   BrowserIfy  In this example, we wrap our browserify instance with watchify. Afterward, we recompile the project   as needed by subscribing to the update event emitted by our wrapped instance.  Using Multiple Bundles  In the earlier section “Visualizing the Dependency Tree,” we looked at an interactive chart that allowed us to  visualize the various dependencies encountered by Browserify as it compiled this chapter’s advanced project   see Figure 6-1 . One of the most important facts that we can take away from this chart is that the project’s  custom code  found in  app  accounts for only a tiny portion  9.7kB  of the bundle’s total size of 1.8MB. In  other words, the vast majority of this project’s code consists of third-party libraries  e.g., Angular, jQuery,  Lodash, etc.  that are unlikely to frequently change. Let’s take a look at how we can use this knowledge to our  advantage.  This chapter’s extracted project is identical to the advanced project in every way, with one exception:  instead of compiling a single Browserify bundle, the extracted project’s build process creates two separate  bundles:  	  	   dist vendor.js: Third-party dependencies   dist app.js: Custom application code  By taking this approach, browsers can more efficiently access project updates as they are released.   In other words, as changes occur within the project’s custom code, browsers only need to re-download    dist app.js. Contrast this approach with that of the advanced project, in which each update  no matter  how small  forces clients to re-download the project’s nearly 2MB bundle.  Listing 6-9 shows the HTML file for the extracted project. As you can see, here we reference two   separate bundles,  dist vendor.js and  dist app.js.  Listing 6-9.

This task largely  mimics the corresponding task in the advanced project, with one major exception. In this task, we iterate  through the third-party modules that we defined in the project’s Gruntfile, and for each entry, we instruct  Browserify to exclude the referenced module from the compiled bundle.  Listing 6-11.  The extracted Project’s browserify Grunt Task     extracted tasks browserify.js   module.exports = function grunt  {       grunt.registerTask 'browserify', function   {           var done = this.async  ;         var path = require 'path' ;         var fs = require 'fs' ;         var target = path.join 'public', 'dist', 'app.js' ;         var vendorModules = grunt.config.get 'browserify.vendor_modules'   [];    109  www.it-ebooks.info   ChaPter 6   BrowserIfy          var browserify = require 'browserify'  [             path.join 'app', 'index.js'          ], {             'paths': ['app'],             'fullPaths': true,             'bundleExternal': true         } ;           vendorModules.forEach function vm  {             grunt.log.writelns 'Excluding module from application bundle: %s', vm ;             browserify.exclude vm ;         } ;           browserify.bundle function err, data  {             if  err  return grunt.fail.fatal err ;             grunt.file.mkdir path.join 'public', 'dist'  ;             fs.writeFileSync target, data ;             grunt.task.run 'disc' ;             done  ;         } ;       } ;   };  Finally, Listing 6-12 shows the contents of the extracted project’s browserify-vendor Grunt task.   When run, this task will create a separate Browserify bundle consisting solely of the third-party modules that  we defined in Listing 6-10.  Listing 6-12.  The extracted Project’s browserify-vendor Grunt Task     extracted tasks browserify-vendor.js   module.exports = function grunt  {       grunt.registerTask 'browserify-vendor', function   {           var done = this.async  ;         var path = require 'path' ;         var fs = require 'fs' ;         var target = path.join 'public', 'dist', 'vendor.js' ;         var vendorModules = grunt.config.get 'browserify.vendor_modules'   [];           var browserify = require 'browserify'  {             'paths': [                 'app'             ],             'fullPaths': true         } ;    110  www.it-ebooks.info   ChaPter 6   BrowserIfy          vendorModules.forEach function vm  {             browserify.require vm ;         } ;           browserify.bundle function err, data  {             if  err  return grunt.fail.fatal err ;             grunt.file.mkdir path.join 'public', 'dist'  ;             fs.writeFileSync target, data ;             done  ;         } ;       } ;   };  To see this process in action, navigate to the extracted project in your terminal and run $ npm start.  Any missing npm modules will be installed, and the project’s default Grunt task will be run. As this process  occurs, two separate bundles will be created. The bundle containing the project’s custom code,  dist app.js,  comes in at only 14kB in size.  The Node Way  As mentioned in this chapter’s introduction, Browserify compiles a project by recursively scanning its source  code in search of calls to a global require   function. As these calls are found, Browserify loads the modules  they reference via the same require   function used by Node. Afterward, Browserify merges them into a  single bundle that browsers are capable of understanding.  In this regard, projects that use Browserify are best thought of as client-side Node applications. Many   aspects of Browserify that tend to confuse newcomers are more readily understood when this concept— along with everything that it entails—is kept in mind. Let’s take a look at two such aspects now: module  resolution and dependency management.  Module Resolution and the NODE_PATH Environment Variable Node applications have the ability to reference modules in a number of ways. For example, here we see a  simple Node application that requires a module by providing a relative path to its location:  var animals = require '. lib animals' ;  In a similar manner, this example could also have provided the full, absolute path to this module.   Either way, the location at which Node is expected to find this module is rather obvious. Now consider the  following example, in which a module is referenced solely by name:  var animals = require 'animals' ;  In situations such as this, Node will first attempt to locate the referenced module within its core library.  This process can be seen in action when loading modules such as fs, Node’s file system module. If no match  is found, Node will then proceed to search for folders named node_modules, starting with the location of  the module that called require   and working its way upward through the file system. As these folders  are encountered, Node will check to see if they contain a module  or package  matching that which was  requested. This process will continue until a match is found, and if none is found, an exception is thrown.  111  www.it-ebooks.info   ChaPter 6   BrowserIfy  This simple yet powerful method by which module resolution occurs within Node revolves almost  exclusively around the node_modules folder. However, Node provides an often-overlooked method that  allows developers to augment this behavior by defining additional folders within which Node should be  allowed to search for modules, should the previous steps turn up empty-handed. Let’s take a look at this  chapter’s path-env project, which demonstrates how this can be accomplished.  Listing 6-13 shows an excerpt from this project’s package.json file. Of particular importance is the   start script that has been defined. Based on the settings shown here, when $ npm start is run within this  project, the NODE_PATH environment variable will be updated to include a reference to this project’s    lib folder before the application is run. As a result, Node will add this folder to those it uses to resolve the  location of named modules.  Listing 6-13.  This Project’s npm start Script Updates the NODE_PATH Environment Variable     path-env package.json   {     "name": "path-env",     "version": "1.0.0",     "main": ". bin index.js",     "scripts": {             "start": "export NODE_PATH=$NODE_PATH:. lib && node . bin index.js"     } }    on os X and Linux, environment variables are set from the terminal by running       Note  export ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE=value. the command to be used within the windows command line is   set ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE=value.  The significance of setting the NODE_PATH environment variable may not be obvious at first glance;   however, doing so can have a dramatically positive impact on the cleanliness and maintainability of complex  projects. Why? Because when this approach is used, it essentially allows developers to create a namespace  through which an application’s modules  those that do not exist as independent npm packages  can be  referenced by name, rather than by lengthy relative paths. Listing 6-14 shows a simple example of what this  looks like in practice.  Listing 6-14.  Several of the Modules Contained Within the path-env Project     path-env bin index.js   var api = require 'app api' ;      path-env lib app api index.js   var express = require 'express' ; var path = require 'path' ; var app = express  ; var animals = require 'app models animal' ; app.use ' ', express.static path.join __dirname, '..', '..', '..', 'public'   ;  112  www.it-ebooks.info   ChaPter 6   BrowserIfy  app.get ' animals', function req, res, next  {     res.send animals ; } ; app.listen 7000, function   {     console.log 'App is now available at: http:  localhost:7000' ; } ; module.exports = app;      path-env lib app models animal index.js   module.exports = [     'Aardvarks', 'Cats', 'Dogs', 'Lemurs', 'Three-Toed Sloths', 'Zebras' ];  Take note of this example’s lack of relative module references. For example, notice how this project’s   main script, bin index.js, is able to load a custom module responsible for initializing Express via  require 'app api' ;. The alternative would be to use a relative path: require '.. lib app api' ;.  Anyone who has worked within complex Node applications and encountered module references along the  line of require '.. .. .. .. models animal' ; will quickly come to appreciate the increase in code  clarity that this approach affords.     Note   It is important to bear in mind that the use of the NODE_PATH environment variable only makes sense  within the context of a Node  or Browserify  application—not a package. when creating a reusable package that  is intended to be shared with others, you should rely solely on Node’s default module resolution behavior.  Taking Advantage of NODE_PATH Within Browserify Thus far, we have focused on how the NODE_PATH environment variable can have a positive impact on server- side Node applications. Now that we have laid that groundwork, let’s see how this concept can be applied  within the context of client-side, browser-based applications compiled with Browserify.  Listing 6-15 shows the browserify Grunt task for this chapter’s advanced project, which is responsible  for compiling the application via Browserify’s API. Of particular importance is the use of the paths option,  which allows us to provide Browserify with an array of paths that should be appended to the NODE_PATH  environment variable before compilation begins. It is this setting that allows us to easily take advantage of  the same benefits demonstrated in this section’s previous examples.  Listing 6-15.  The browserify Grunt Task for This Chapter’s advanced Project     advanced tasks browserify.js   module.exports = function grunt  {       grunt.registerTask 'browserify', function   {         var done = this.async  ;         var path = require 'path' ;         var fs = require 'fs' ;         var target = path.join 'public', 'dist', 'app.js' ;         var browserify = require 'browserify'  [  113  www.it-ebooks.info   ChaPter 6   BrowserIfy              path.join 'app', 'index.js'          ], {             'paths': [                 'app'             ],             'fullPaths': true         } ;         browserify.bundle function err, data  {             if  err  return grunt.fail.fatal err ;             grunt.file.mkdir path.join 'public', 'dist'  ;             fs.writeFileSync target, data ;             grunt.task.run 'disc' ;             done  ;         } ;     } ;   };  For a simple demonstration of how this approach has positively impacted this project, consider   Listing 6-16. Here we see a small module that is responsible for loading lodash and integrating two   third-party utilities, underscore.string and lodash-deep. The final, exported value is a single object  containing the combined functionality of all three modules.  Listing 6-16.  Module Responsible for Loading Lodash and Integrating Various Third-Party Plugins     advanced app utils index.js   var _ = require 'lodash' ; _.mixin require 'underscore.string'  ; _.mixin require 'lodash-deep'  ; module.exports = _;  As a result of the paths value that was provided to Browserify, our application can now reference this   module from any location by simply calling require 'app utils' ;.  Dependency Management Up until quite recently, the notion of “dependency management” has  for the most part  been a foreign  concept within the context of client-side, browser-based projects. The tide has swiftly turned, however,  thanks in large part to the rapidly increasing popularity of Node, along with additional utilities built on top  of it—a few of which this book has already covered  e.g., Bower, Grunt, and Yeoman . These utilities have  helped to bring desperately needed tooling and guidance to the untamed, “Wild West” that once was  and  largely still is  client-side development.  In regard to dependency management, Bower has helped address this need by providing client-side    developers with an easy-to-use mechanism for managing the various third-party libraries that  applications rely on. For developers who are new to this concept and are not using client-side compilers  such as Browserify, Bower has always been and continues to be a viable option for managing a project’s  dependencies; however, as developers begin to see the advantages afforded by tools such as Browserify,  Bower has begun to show signs of age.  114  www.it-ebooks.info   ChaPter 6   BrowserIfy  At the beginning of this section, we mentioned that projects using Browserify are best thought of  as client-side Node applications. In regard to dependency management, this statement is particularly  important. Recall that during Browserify’s compile process, a project’s source code is scanned for calls to  a global require   function. When found, these calls are executed within Node, and the returned value is  subsequently made available to the client-side application. The important implication here is that when  using Browserify, dependency management is significantly simplified when developers rely solely on npm,  Node’s package manager. While technically, yes, it is possible to instruct Browserify on how to load packages  installed by Bower, more often than not, it’s simply more trouble than it’s worth.  Defining Browser-Specific Modules  Consider a scenario in which you would like to create a new module, which you intend to publish and  share via npm. You want this module to work both within Node and within the browser  via Browserify . To  facilitate this, Browserify supports the use of a browser configuration setting within a project’s package.json  file. When defined, this setting allows developers to override the location used to locate a particular module.  To better understand how this works, let’s take a look at two brief examples.  Listing 6-17 shows the contents of a simple package. Within this package, two modules exist, lib node.js    and lib browser.js. According to this package’s package.json file, the main module for this package is  lib node.js. In other words, when this package is referenced by name within a Node application, this   is the module Node will load. Notice, however, that an additional configuration setting has been defined:  "browser": ". lib browser.js". As a result of this setting, Browserify will load this module rather than  the one specified by main.  Listing 6-17.  Module Exposing Two Distinct Entry Points: One for Node, the Other for Browserify     browser1 package.json   {   "name": "browser1",   "version": "1.0.0",   "main": ". lib node.js",   "browser": ". lib browser.js" }      browser1 lib browser.js   module.exports = {     'run': function   {         console.log 'I am running within a browser.' ;     } };      browser1 lib node.js   module.exports = {     'run': function   {         console.log 'I am running within Node.' ;     } };  115  www.it-ebooks.info   ChaPter 6   BrowserIfy  As you will see in a moment, Browserify’s browser configuration setting need not be limited to simply  overriding the location of a package’s main module. It can also be used to override the location of multiple  modules within a package. By way of an example, consider Listing 6-18. In this instance, instead of providing  a string for our package.json file’s browser setting, we provide an object, allowing us to specify multiple,  browser-specific overrides.  Listing 6-18.  Module Exposing Multiple, Distinct Modules for Node and Browserify     browser2 package.json   {   "name": "browser2",   "version": "1.0.0",   "main": ". lib node.js",   "browser": {     ". lib node.js": ". lib browser.js",     ". lib extra.js": ". lib extra-browser.js"   } }  As in Listing 6-17, a module that implements this pattern will expose distinct entry points into itself:   one for Node, and a separate one for applications compiled via Browserify. This example takes this concept a  step further, however. As this module is compiled, should it ever attempt to load the module located at lib  extra.js, the module located at lib extra-browser will be substituted instead. In this way, the browser  setting allows us to create modules with behavior that can vary greatly depending on whether those modules  are run within Node or within the browser.  Extending Browserify with Transforms  Developers can build upon Browserify’s core functionality by creating plugins, called transforms, that tap  into the compilation process that occurs as new bundles are created. Such transforms are installed via npm  and are enabled once their names are included within the browserify.transform array in an application’s  package.json file. Let’s take a look at a few useful examples.  brfs The brfs transform simplifies the process of loading file contents inline. It extends Browserify’s compilation  process to search for calls to the fs.readFileSync   method. When found, the contents of the referenced  file are immediately loaded and returned.  Listing 6-19 shows an excerpt from the package.json file for this chapter’s transforms-brfs project.   In this example, the brfs module has been installed and included within the browserify.transform  configuration setting.  116  www.it-ebooks.info   Listing 6-19.  Excerpt from the package.json File for This Chapter’s transforms-brfs Project  ChaPter 6   BrowserIfy     transforms-brfs package.json   {   "name": "transforms-brfs",   "dependencies": {     "browserify": "^10.2.4",     "brfs": "^1.4.0"   },   "browserify": {     "transform": [         "brfs"     ]   } }  Listing 6-20 shows the contents of this project’s  app index.js module. In this example, the brfs   transform will load the contents of  app templates lorem.html, which is subsequently assigned to the tpl  variable.  Listing 6-20.  Loading a Template via fs.readFileSync       transforms-brfs app index.js   var fs = require 'fs' ; var $ = require 'jquery' ; var tpl = fs.readFileSync __dirname + ' templates lorem.html', 'utf8' ; $ 'container' .html tpl ;  folderify Much like the brfs transform, the folderify transform allows you to load the contents of files inline.  Rather than operating on a single file at a time, however, folderify allows you to quickly load the contents  of multiple files. By way of an example, consider Listing 6-21, which shows the contents of this chapter’s  transforms-folderify application.  Listing 6-21.  Loading the Contents of Multiple Files with folderify     transforms-folderify app index.js   var $ = require 'jquery' ; var includeFolder = require 'include-folder' ; var folder = includeFolder __dirname + ' templates' ;   for  var k in folder  {     $ 'container' .append ' ' + k + ': ' + folder[k] + ' ' ; }  117  www.it-ebooks.info   ChaPter 6   BrowserIfy  As in the previous example, the package.json file for this project has been modified to include   folderify within its browserify.transform array. When compiled, Browserify will search for references to  the include-folder module. When the function it returns is called, Browserify will load the contents of each  file it finds within the specified folder and return them in the form of an object.  bulkify With the bulkify transform, developers can import multiple modules with a single call. To better  understand how this works, see Listing 6-22, which shows an excerpt of the contents of the main application  file for this chapter’s transforms-bulkify project.  Listing 6-22.  Main Application File for This Chapter’s transforms-bulkify Project     transforms-bulkify app index.js   var bulk = require 'bulk-require' ;   var app = angular.module 'app', [     'ngRoute' ] ;   var routes = bulk __dirname, [     'routes ** route.js' ] .routes;   app.config function $routeProvider  {       var defaultRoute = 'dashboard';       _.each routes, function route, route_name  {         route = route.route;         route.config.resolve = route.config.resolve  {};         $routeProvider.when route.route, route.config ;     } ;       $routeProvider.otherwise {         'redirectTo': defaultRoute     } ;   } ;  This particular example demonstrates the use of Browserify within the context of an Angular   application. If you are unfamiliar with Angular  covered in Chapter 8 , don’t worry—the important aspect of  this example is the manner in which the bulk   method allows us to require   multiple modules matching  one or more specified patterns  in this case, routes ** route.js .  Figure 6-2 shows the file structure for this project. As you can see, the app routes module contains   three folders, each representing a route within our Angular application. The bulkify transform has allowed  us to quickly require   each of these modules with a single call to bulk  . Afterward, we are able to iterate  over the resulting object and pass each route to Angular.  118  www.it-ebooks.info   ChaPter 6   BrowserIfy  Figure 6-2.  File structure for this chapter’s transforms-bulkify project  Browserify-Shim Developers using Browserify will occasionally find themselves needing to import modules that do not  conform to the CommonJS way of doing things. Consider a third-party Foo library that, once loaded, assigns  itself to the global window.Foo variable  see Listing 6-23 . Such libraries can be imported with the help of the  browserify-shim transform.  Listing 6-23.  Third-Party Foo Library That Assigns Itself to the Global Foo Variable     transforms-shim app vendor foo.js   function Foo   {     console.log 'Bar' ; }  After installing the browserify-shim module locally via npm, enable it by adding its name to the   list of enabled transforms within a project’s package.json file, as shown previously in Listing 6-19. Next,  create a browserify-shim object at the root level of your application’s package.json file, which will serve  as the configuration object for this transform  see Listing 6-24 . In this example, each key within this object  represents the path to an improperly exposed module, while the corresponding value specifies the global  variable to which the module has assigned itself.  119  www.it-ebooks.info   Listing 6-24.  Configuring browserify-shim Within a Project’s package.json File  ChaPter 6   BrowserIfy     transforms-shim package.json   {   "name": "transforms-shim",   "version": "1.0.0",   "main": "server.js",   "browserify": {     "transform": [       "browserify-shim"     ]   },   "browserify-shim": {     ". app vendor foo.js": "Foo"   } }  Summary  With the browserify-shim transform installed and configured, the module located at app vendor foo.js   can now be properly imported via require  .  Browserify is a powerful utility that extends the intuitive process by which modules are created and imported  within Node to the browser. With its help, browser-based JavaScript applications can be organized as a  series of small, easy-to-understand, and tightly focused modules that work together to form a larger and  more complicated whole. What’s more, there is nothing preventing applications that currently have no  module management system in place from putting Browserify to use right away. The process of refactoring  a monolithic application down into smaller components is not an overnight process, and is best taken one  step at a time. With the help of Browserify, you can do just that—as time and resources allow.

It is not a full  framework. It has no state router, HTTP AJAX capability, internal message bus, or module loader. Instead,  it focuses on two-way data binding between JavaScript objects and the DOM. When the data in a JavaScript  application changes, HTML elements bound to Knockout views receive automatic updates. Likewise, when  DOM input occurs--through form field manipulation, for example--Knockout captures the input changes  and updates the application state accordingly.  In place of low-level, imperative HTML element manipulation, Knockout uses specialized objects called   observables and a custom binding syntax to express how application data relates to markup. The internal  mechanics are fully customizable so developers can extend Knockout’s capabilities with custom binding  syntax and behaviors.  As an independent JavaScript library, Knockout has no dependencies. The presence of other libraries   is often required to fulfill the application functions that Knockout does not perform, however, so it plays  well with many other common libraries like jQuery, Underscore, Q, etc. The Knockout API represents data  binding operations at a much higher level than strict DOM manipulation, and so places Knockout closer to  Backbone or Angular in terms of abstraction, but its slim, view-oriented feature set means it has a far smaller  footprint.  Knockout will fully function in all modern browsers and, as of this writing, extends back to cover   Firefox 3+, Internet Explorer 6+, and Safari 6+. Its backward compatibility is especially impressive in light of  its newest feature, HTML5-compatible components with custom markup tags. The Knockout team has taken  pains to make the Knockout development experience seamless in a variety of browser environments.  This chapter explores Knockout’s features and API through an example application that manages   kitchen recipes. All chapter code examples will be prefixed with a comment to indicate in which file  the example code actually resides. For example, in Listing 7-1, the index.js file would be found in the  knockout example-000 directory distributed with this book’s source code.  Listing 7-1.  Not a Real Example     example-000 index.js console.log 'this is not a real example' ;  To run examples, first install Node.js  refer to the Node.js documentation for your system  and then run   npm install in the knockout directory to install all example code dependencies. Each example directory  will contain an index.js file that runs a simple Node.js web server. To run each example, it will be necessary   121  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 7   KnoCKout  to launch this server and then navigate to a specified URL in a web browser. For example, to run the index.js   file in Listing 7-1, navigate to the knockout example-000 directory at a terminal prompt and run node  index.js.  All example pages include the core Knockout script in a   tag reference. You can download   this script from http:  knockoutjs.com or from one of a number of reputable content delivery networks.  Knockout can also be installed as a Bower package or npm module and is both AMD and CommonJS  compatible. The Knockout documentation contains detailed instructions for all of these installation  methods.  Views, Models, and View Models  Knockout distinguishes between two sources of information in an application’s user interface: the data  model, which represents the state of the application, and the view model, which represents how that state  is displayed or communicated to the user. Both of these models are created in an application as JavaScript  objects. Knockout bridges them by giving view models a way to represent a data model in a view  HTML   friendly way, while establishing bidirectional communication between views and data models so that input  affects application state, and application state affects how a view represents data.  Since HTML is the technology that represents data in a web browser, Knockout view models can either   bind directly to preexisting HTML document elements or create new elements with HTML templates.  Knockout can even create complete reusable HTML components  custom HTML tags with their own  attributes and behaviors .  The example application included with this chapter, Omnom Recipes, displays recipe data  “data   model”  in a browsable master detail user interface. Both parts of this interface—the list of recipes and the  details presented for each—are logical components situated ideally for Knockout view models. Each will  have its own view model, and the application will coordinate the interactions between them. Eventually  users will want to add or edit recipes, so additional HTML markup and view models will be introduced for  that purpose.  Listing 7-2 shows the example application structure in the example-001 directory as output of the tree   command.  Listing 7-2.  Example Application Structure  example-001$ tree --dirsfirst . ├── public  │   ├── scripts  │    │   ├── vendor  │    │    │   ├── jquery-2.1.3.min.js  │    │    │   └── knockout-3.3.0.js  │    │   ├── app.js  │    │   ├── recipe-details.js  │    │      └── recipe-list.js  │     ├── styles  │    │    └── app.css  │   ├── index.html ├── index.js └── recipes.json  The index.js file is responsible for launching a web server that will service requests for files in the   public directory. When the application’s web page makes an AJAX request for recipe data, the web server  will serialize the data in recipes.json and return it to the client.  122  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 7   KnoCKout  In the public directory the index.html file will be served up by default when a user visits    http:  localhost:8080. This file contains application markup augmented with Knockout attributes.   The index.html file also references the app.css stylesheet in public styles, the two vendor scripts in  public scripts vendor, and the three application scripts in public scripts.  A Knockout view model can be applied to an entire page, or scoped to specific elements on a page. For   nontrivial applications, it is advisable to use multiple view models to maintain modularity. In the Omnom  Recipes application, the user interface exists as two logical “components”: a list of recipes and a detailed view  of a selected recipe. Instead of using a monolithic view model for the entire page, the application divides  Knockout logic into two JavaScript modules in public scripts: recipe-list.js and recipe-details.js.  The app.js module consumes both of these view models and coordinates their activities on the page.  Figure 7-1 shows a screenshot of the rendered application, the recipe list clearly visible on the left and   the recipe details on the right.   Figure 7-1.  Omnom Recipes screenshot  123  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 7   KnoCKout     Note   to avoid confusion the example application makes use of simple JavaScript closures instead of  client-side frameworks or module-oriented build tools to organize modules. these closures often assign a  single object to a property on the global window object that will be consumed by other scripts. For example,  the recipe-list.js file creates a global object, window.RecipeList, to be used in the app.js file. While  completely valid, this architectural decision should be viewed in light of the example application’s simplistic  requirements.  The Recipe List The index.html file, which contains the full page markup and Knockout templates, is divided into three key  top-level elements:   	   	   	  The   element, which contains static HTML content that will not be  manipulated by Knockout  The   element, which contains an unordered list of recipes  and will be manipulated by Knockout  The   element, which displays recipe information  and will also be manipulated by Knockout  Although the recipe list element is small, it contains a number of different Knockout-specific bindings.   The view model for this bit of HTML will be bound to the   element. With that in mind, there are a  number of things that may be inferred about how Knockout bindings work strictly from examining the  markup in Listing 7-3.  Listing 7-3.  Recipe List Markup and Bindings                <li data-bind="text: title,       click: $parent.selectRecipe.bind $parent ,       css: {selected: $parent.isSelected $data }">         First, it is apparent that Knockout bindings are applied to HTML elements with the data-bind attribute.  This is not the sole binding method but it is the most common. Both the   element and the   element  have bindings in the form binding-name: binding-value.  Second, multiple bindings may be applied to an element as a comma-delimited list, demonstrated by   the   element, which has bindings for text, click, and css.  Third, bindings with more complex values, such as the css binding on the   element, use key value   hashes  {key: value, ... }  to define specific binding options.  Finally, binding values may refer to JavaScript primitives, view model properties, view model methods,   or any valid JavaScript expression.  The recipe list Knockout bindings reveal certain things about the Knockout view model that will be   bound to the   element. Developers will immediately recognize the foreach flow control statement, and  correctly infer that recipes will be some collection exposed by the view model over which foreach will loop.  124  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 7   KnoCKout  The   element within the unordered list has no HTML content of its own, so it may also be inferred   that this element serves as a kind of template element that will be bound and rendered for each item in  the recipes collection. As with most foreach loops, it is reasonable to expect the object within the loop   the loop’s “context”  to be an element of the collection. The list item’s text binding references the title  property of the recipe object for the current iteration and will be injected as the text content of the    element when rendered.  The click and css bindings both reference the special $parent object, which tells Knockout that the  binding values should target the view model bound with foreach and not the current recipe object.  The  view model is the “parent” context and the recipe is its “child”.   The click binding invokes the selectRecipe   method on the view model whenever the list item’s   click event is triggered. It binds the method to the view model specifically, by passing the $parent reference  to the method’s bind   function. This ensures that the value of this within the selectRecipe   method  does not refer to the DOM element on which the handler is attached when it executes  the DOM’s default  behavior .  In contrast, the isSelected   method on the $parent  view model  object is invoked by the css   binding, but Knockout, not the DOM, manages the invocation, ensuring the value of this within the method  refers to the view model and not a DOM element.  The css binding instructs Knockout to apply specific CSS classes to a DOM element whenever specific   criteria are met. The css binding value is a hash of selector function pairs that Knockout evaluates whenever  the DOM element is rendered. If the isSelected   method returns true, the selected CSS class will be  added to the list item element. Another special variable, $data, is passed to isSelected  . The $data  variable always refers to the current object context in which Knockout is working, in this case an individual  recipe object. Some Knockout bindings, like text, operate on the current object context by default; others,  like foreach, cause a context switch as a side effect.  In Listing 7-4, the context objects and values of each special variable are shown in HTML comments.   Bindings have been abbreviated for clarity.  Listing 7-4.  Changing Contexts with Knockout Bindings                                                        The recipe list module in Listing 7-5 creates the view model object that Knockout will bind to the recipe   list markup when the page is rendered. The module’s create   method accepts a list of recipe objects— JSON data loaded from the server—and returns a view model object with data properties and methods.  Nearly all Knockout view models will need to access helper functions on the global window.ko object, so it is  passed to the module’s closure function as an argument.  125  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 7   KnoCKout  Listing 7-5.  Recipe List View Model     example-001 public scripts recipe-list.js 'use strict'; window.RecipeList =  function  ko  {     return {     create: function  recipes  {       var viewmodel = {};            properties       viewmodel.recipes = recipes;       viewmodel.selectedRecipe = ko.observable recipes[0] ;            methods       viewmodel.selectRecipe = function  recipe  {         this.selectedRecipe recipe ;       };         viewmodel.isSelected = function  recipe  {         return this.selectedRecipe   === recipe;       };         return viewmodel;     }   };   } window.ko  ;    the view model object itself may be created in any manner a developer chooses. In the example      Note  code each view model is a simple object literal created by a factory method. It is common to see the JavaScript  constructor function pattern used to create view models in the wild, but view models are merely objects and  may be constructed as a developer sees fit.  Other than the selectedRecipe property, the recipe list view model is wholly unremarkable. The   template’s foreach binding is applied to the recipes property  an array of plain JavaScript objects , the  click binding on each list item invokes the selectRecipe   method  passing it a specific recipe , and when  each list item is rendered, the isSelected   method is called to determine if the recipe being evaluated  has been assigned to the selectedRecipe property or not. Actually, that is not entirely correct. The value of  selectedRecipe is not actually a recipe object, but a function--a Knockout observable.  An observable is a special kind of function that holds a value, and can notify potential subscribers  whenever that value changes. Bindings between HTML elements and observables automatically create  subscriptions that Knockout manages in the background. Observables are created with special factory  functions on the global ko object. The selectedRecipe observable in Listing 7-5 is created when ko. observable recipes[0]  is called. Its initial value is the first element in the recipes array. When  selectedRecipe   is invoked with no argument, it returns the value it contains  in this case, the object  in recipes[0] . Any value passed to selectedRecipe   will become its new value. Although the  selectedRecipe   property is not bound to any element in the recipe list template, it is manipulated when  the user interacts with the recipe list via the view model’s methods. The changing value of this element will  be used as input for the next page component: recipe details.  126  www.it-ebooks.info   Recipe Details When a recipe is clicked in the recipe list, the recipe details are displayed in the right pane  refer to Figure 7-1 .   The markup in Listing 7-6 shows the HTML elements and Knockout bindings used to render the recipe  details view model in the DOM.  Chapter 7   KnoCKout  Listing 7-6.  Recipe Details Markup and Bindings                Details     Servings:        Approximate Cook Time:          Ingredients                        Instructions                       <a data-bind="visible: hasCitation,     attr: {href: citation, title: title}"     target="_blank">Source       Some bindings, like the   text binding, read a value from a view model property and inject its string   value into the HTML element.  Because the paragraphs under the “Details” heading have static content  the text “Servings:” and   “Approximate Cook Time:” ,   tags are used to anchor the Knockout bindings for the servings and  cookingTimes properties at the end of each paragraph.  The ingredients list iterates over a collection of strings with the foreach binding, so the context object  within each loop is a string represented by the $data variable. Each string becomes the text content of a  list item.  The   tag at the bottom links to the recipe’s website of origin as a citation. If the recipe has no citation,   the anchor will not be displayed. The element’s visible binding examines the view model’s hasCitation  observable and if the value is empty, hides the anchor element. Like the css binding used in the recipe list,  the attr binding takes a key value hash as its binding value. Hash keys  href and title  are the element  attributes to be set on the the anchor, and values are properties on the view model that will be bound to  each attribute.  127  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 7   KnoCKout  The recipe details view model has many more members than the recipe list view model. Listing 7-7  shows that the recipe details view model is created in a similar fashion, by invoking the RecipeDetails. create   function with a specific recipe object that will be used to add data to the view model. This module  uses several functions on the global ko object, and so, like the recipe list, it is passed as an argument to the  module closure.  Listing 7-7.  Recipe Details View Model     example-001 public scripts recipe-details.js 'use strict'; window.RecipeDetails =  function  ko  {     return {     create: function  recipe  {       var viewmodel = {};          add properties and methods...       return viewmodel;     }   };   } window.ko  ;  For each property on the recipe object, the recipe details view model has a corresponding observable   property, shown in Listing 7-8. Observables are really only useful if the value they contain is expected to  change. If values are expected to be static, plain JavaScript properties and values may be used instead.  Observables are used in the recipe details view model because there will only be one instance of the view  model bound to the page. When a new recipe is selected in the recipe list, the recipe details view model  will be updated with the new recipe’s values. Because its properties are observables, the page’s markup will  change immediately.  Listing 7-8.  Recipe Details View Model Properties     example-001 public scripts recipe-details.js    properties viewmodel.title = ko.observable recipe.title ; viewmodel.servings = ko.observable recipe.servings ; viewmodel.hours = ko.observable recipe.cookingTime.hours ; viewmodel.minutes = ko.observable recipe.cookingTime.minutes ; viewmodel.ingredients = ko.observableArray recipe.ingredients ; viewmodel.instructions = ko.observableArray recipe.instructions ; viewmodel.citation = ko.observable recipe.citation ;   viewmodel.cookingTime = ko.computed function    {   return '$1 hours, $2 minutes'     .replace '$1', this.hours        .replace '$2', this.minutes   ; }, viewmodel ;  Listing 7-8 shows two new types of observables: ko.observableArray   and ko.computed  .  128  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 7   KnoCKout  Observable arrays monitor their values  normal JavaScript arrays  for additions, deletions, and index   changes, so that if the array mutates, any subscriber to the observable array is notified. While the ingredients  and instructions do not change in this example, code will be introduced later to manipulate the collections  and show the observable array’s automatic binding updates in action.  Computed observables generate or compute a value based on other values exposed by observables on  the view model. The ko.computed   function accepts callback that will be invoked to generate the value of  the computed observable, and optionally a context object that acts as the value of this within the callback.  When referenced by a template binding, a computed observable’s value will be whatever its callback returns.  The cookingTime property in Listing 7-8 creates a formatted string interpolated with the values from the  hours and minutes observables. If either hours or minutes changes, the cookingTime computed observable  will also update its subscribers.   Because hours and minutes are really functions  though they are treated as properties in      Note  Knockout binding expressions , each must be invoked in the body of the computed observable in order to  retrieve its value.  The recipe details view model methods in Listing 7-9 are fairly straightforward. The hasCitation     method tests the citation property for a nonempty value, while the update   method accepts a recipe and  updates observable properties on the view model with new values. This method is not bound to the view,  but will be used when a recipe in the recipe lists view model is selected.  Listing 7-9.  Recipe Details View Model Methods     example-001 public scripts recipe-details.js    methods viewmodel.hasCitation = function    {   return this.citation   !== ''; };   viewmodel.update = function  recipe  {   this.title recipe.title ;   this.servings recipe.servings ;   this.hours recipe.cookingTime.hours ;   this.minutes recipe.cookingTime.minutes ;   this.ingredients recipe.ingredients ;   this.instructions recipe.instructions ;   this.citation recipe.citation ; };  Binding View Models to the DOM  Both view model factories are attached to the global window object and can be used to create individual view  model instances that will be bound to the page. The app.js file, shown in Listing 7-10, is the main script that  ties both recipe view models together.  129  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 7   KnoCKout  Listing 7-10.  Binding View Models to the DOM     example-001 public scripts app.js  function app  $, ko, RecipeList, RecipeDetails  {      1   var getRecipes = $.get ' recipes' ;        2   $ function    {        3     getRecipes.then function  recipes  {          4       var list = RecipeList.create recipes ;          5       var details = RecipeDetails.create list.selectedRecipe   ;          6       list.selectedRecipe.subscribe function  recipe  {         details.update recipe ;       } ;          7       ko.applyBindings list, document.querySelector 'recipe-list'  ;       ko.applyBindings details, document.querySelector 'recipe-details'  ;       } .fail function    {       alert 'No recipes for you!' ;     } ;   } ;   } window.jQuery, window.ko, window.RecipeList, window.RecipeDetails  ;  The app module is responsible for loading an initial set of recipe data from the server, waiting for  the DOM to enter a ready state, and then instantiating view model instances and binding each to the  appropriate elements. The following list describes each step comment  e.g.,    1  shown in Listing 7-10.  1.  A jQuery promise is created that will resolve at some point in the future, when   the data obtained from the GET  recipes request becomes available.  2.  The function passed to $   will be triggered when the DOM has been completely   initialized to ensure that all Knockout template elements will be present before  any binding attempts.  3.  When the jQuery promise resolves, it passes the list of recipes to its resolution   handler. If the promise fails, an alert is shown to the user indicating that a  problem occurred.  4.  Once the recipe data has been loaded, the list view model is created. The recipe  array is passed as an argument to RecipeList.create  . The return value is the  actual recipe list view model object.  5.  The recipe details view model is created in a similar fashion. Its factory function  accepts a single recipe, and so the selectedRecipe property on the recipe list is  queried for a value.  The recipe list view model chooses the very first recipe in its  data array for this value, by default.                  130  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 7   KnoCKout        6.  After the recipe details view model has been created, it subscribes to change   notifications on the recipe list’s selectedRecipe observable. This is the manual  equivalent of a DOM subscription created by Knockout when an observable is  bound to an HTML element. The function provided to the subscribe   method  will be invoked whenever selectedRecipe changes, receiving the new value as  an argument. When the callback fires the recipe details view model uses any  newly selected recipe to update itself, thereby changing the values of its own  observable properties.  7.  Finally, view models are bound to the DOM when the global ko.  applyBindings   function is invoked. In Listing 7-10 this function receives two  arguments: the view model to be bound, and the DOM element to which the  view model will be bound. Any binding attribute Knockout encounters on this  element or its descendants will be applied to the specified view model. If no  DOM element is specified, Knockout assumes that the view model applies to the  entire page. For simplistic pages this might be appropriate, but for more complex  scenarios, using multiple view models that encapsulate their own data and  behavior is the better option.  View Models and Forms  Knockout view model properties may be bound to form controls. Many controls, such as the    elements, share standard bindings like value; but others like   have element-specific bindings. For  example, the options binding controls the creation of   elements within a   tag. In general,  form field bindings behave much like bindings seen in example code up to this point, but complex forms can  be tricky beasts and sometimes require more creative binding strategies.  The examples in this section build on the recipe details template and view model. Specifically, an “edit”   mode is introduced whereby a user viewing a particular recipe can choose to alter its details through form  fields. The same view model is used, but new form field elements have been added to the recipe details  template, adding additional complexity to both.  Switching to “Edit” Mode Three buttons have been added to the top and bottom of the recipe details markup. Figures 7-2 and 7-3 show  how the buttons appear when rendered.  Figure 7-2.  In “view” mode, the Edit button is visible  131  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 7   KnoCKout  Figure 7-3.  In “edit” mode, the Save and Cancel buttons are visible  The Edit button switches the page from viewing mode to edit mode  and shows the appropriate form  fields for each part of the recipe being viewed . While in edit mode the Edit button itself is hidden, but two  other buttons, Save and Cancel, become visible. If the user clicks the Save button any changes made to the  recipe will be persisted; in contrast, if the user clicks the Cancel button, the edit session will be aborted and  the recipe details will revert to their original states.  The Knockout bindings for each button, shown in Listing 7-11, vary slightly from the bindings discussed   so far.  Listing 7-11.  Editing Button Markup             Edit         Save     Cancel     First, each button has a click event handler that calls a method on the view model: edit  , save  ,   and cancelEdit  . But unlike previous examples, these methods do not use the bind   function to ensure  the value of this within the view model. Instead, all occurrences of the keyword this within the view  model have been replaced with a reference to the object literal viewmodel, shown in Listing 7-12. The new  properties and methods for these buttons have also been added to the recipe details view model. For brevity,  Listing 7-12 omits the portions of recipe-list.js that have not changed.  Listing 7-12.  Methods reference the viewmodel object, not this     example-002 public scripts recipe-details.js    properties viewmodel.previousState = null; viewmodel.isEditing = ko.observable false ;      methods viewmodel.edit = function    {   viewmodel.previousState = ko.mapping.toJS viewmodel ;   viewmodel.isEditing true ; };    132  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 7   KnoCKout  viewmodel.save = function    {      TODO save recipe   viewmodel.isEditing false ; };   viewmodel.cancelEdit = function    {   viewmodel.isEditing false ;   ko.mapping.fromJS viewmodel.previousState, {}, viewmodel ; };  Because the view model itself is assigned to a variable within the RecipeDetails.create   closure, its  methods may reference it by name. By avoiding this altogether, event bindings are simplified and potential  bugs are avoided.  Second, each button has a visible binding attached to the view model’s isEditing observable, but   only the Edit button invokes the method directly as a function. It also possesses the only binding that uses a  negation  !  operator, which turns the binding value into an expression. Any observable evaluated within an  expression must be invoked as a function to retrieve its value. If an observable is itself used as the binding  value, as is the case with visible bindings for the Save and Cancel buttons, it will be invoked automatically  when Knockout evaluates the binding.  All three methods, edit  , save  , and cancelEdit  , manipulate the value of the isEditing  observable, which determines which button or buttons are displayed on the form  and, as shall be  demonstrated shortly, which form fields are displayed as well . Editing begins when the edit   method is  called and ends when the user either saves the recipe or cancels the editing session.  To ensure that changes to the recipe are discarded when a user cancels the edit session, the view model  serializes its state when the editing session begins in anticipation of possible reversion. If the editing session  is canceled, the previous state is deserialized and the value of each observable property is effectively reset. The Knockout mapping plugin is used to serialize and deserialize the view model’s state in the edit     and cancelEdit   methods:     serializing the view model viewmodel.previousState = ko.mapping.toJS viewmodel ;    deserializing the view model ko.mapping.fromJS viewmodel.previousState, {}, viewmodel ;   Knockout’s mapping plugin is distributed separately from the core Knockout library. the current      Tip  version may be downloaded from http:  knockoutjs.com documentation plugins-mapping.html. to install  the plugin, simply add a   tag reference to the plugin script after the core Knockout   tag on an  htML page. It will automatically create the ko.mapping namespace property on the global ko object.  The mapping plugin serializes deserializes objects that possess observable properties, reading their   values during serialization and setting their values during deserialization. When the edit   method  calls ko.mapping.toJS viewmodel , it receives a plain JavaScript object literal whose property names are   133  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 7   KnoCKout  identical to those of the view model, but contain plain JavaScript data instead of observable functions.  To push these values back into the view model’s own observables when the edit session is cancelled, the  cancelEdit   method invokes ko.mapping.fromJS   with three arguments:   	   	   	  The plain JavaScript object literal that contains the data to be written to the view  model’s observable properties  An object literal that maps properties on the plain JavaScript state object to  observable properties on the view model  if this object is empty, it is assumed that  the properties for both share the same names   The view model that will receive the object literal’s data      Note   the Knockout mapper plugin can serialize deserialize view models as plain JavaScript object literals  with its toJS   and fromJS   functions, or as JSon strings with its toJSON   and fromJSON   functions. these  functions can be particularly useful for CruD  create + read + update + delete  view models that bind JSon  data to simple forms.  Although the Save button is present on the form, its method has only been stubbed in the view model.   Its functionality will be added in a later example.  Changing the Recipe Title The recipe title is visible regardless of whether the recipe details view is in edit mode or read-only mode.  When the user clicks the Edit button, a label and input field become visible beneath the   tag so the user  may update the recipe title if necessary. A visible binding on the containing   element controls shows  and hides this field by subscribing to the isEditing observable on the view model. The value of the input  field is bound to the view model’s title observable via the value binding. By default, the value binding  will only refresh data in an observable when the field to which the observable is bound looses focus. When  the title input in Listing 7-13 looses focus, the   tag’s content will be instantly updated with the new title  value because both are bound to the title observable. The rendered field is shown in Figure 7-4.  Listing 7-13.  Recipe Title Markup              Title:          134  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 7   KnoCKout  Figure 7-4.  Editing the recipe title  Updating Recipe Servings and Cooking Time In Listing 7-14 the recipe’s read-only serving size   element is hidden when the form enters edit mode.  In its place a   element is displayed with a number of serving size options from which the user may  select. Once again, the isEditing observable is used to determine which elements are displayed.  Listing 7-14.  Serving Size Markup     Details        Servings:             Servings:    <select data-bind="options: servingSizes,           optionsText: 'text',           optionsValue: 'numeral',           value: servings,           optionsCaption: 'Choose...'"           name="recipeServings"           id="recipe-servings">        New, element-specific Knockout bindings are declared for the   tag in Listing 7-14 to control  the manner in which it uses view model data. The options binding tells Knockout which property on the  view model holds the data set that will be used to create   elements within the tag. The binding  value is the name of the property  in this case servingSizes , a plain array of read-only reference data.  For primitive values, like strings or numbers, the options binding assumes that each primitive should   be both the text and value of its   element. For complex objects, the optionsText and optionsValue  bindings tell Knockout which properties on each object in the array will be used to generate the text and  value of each   element instead. The serving size objects are defined in Listing 7-15. Notice that the  text value is the name of each number, while the numeral value is a corresponding digit. When a serving size  is selected by the user the numeral value will be assigned to viewmodel.servings  .  135  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 7   KnoCKout  Listing 7-15.  Recipe Serving Size Data in the View Model     example-002 public scripts recipe-details.js    properties viewmodel.servings = ko.observable recipe.servings ; viewmodel.servingSizes = [   {text: 'one', numeral: 1},   {text: 'two', numeral: 2},   {text: 'three', numeral: 3},   {text: 'four', numeral: 4},   {text: 'five', numeral: 5},   {text: 'six', numeral: 6},   {text: 'seven', numeral: 7},   {text: 'eight', numeral: 8},   {text: 'nine', numeral: 9},   {text: 'ten', numeral: 10} ];  The   tag’s value binding ties the selected value of the drop-down to an observable on the view  model. When the   tag is rendered, this value will be automatically selected for the user in the DOM;  when the user chooses a new value the bound observable will be updated.  Finally, the optionsCaption binding creates a special   element in the DOM that appears at the   top of the drop-down options list, but will never be set as the selected value on the view model. It is a mere  cosmetic enhancement that gives some instruction to the user about how the drop-down is to be used.  Figures 7-5 and 7-6 show a collapsed and expanded serving size drop-down.  Figure 7-5.  Servings drop-down with a pre-selected value  136  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 7   KnoCKout  Figure 7-6.  Choosing a new value from the Servings drop-down  The cooking time fields, also shown in Figure 7-5, contain no special bindings. Both input fields  hours  and minutes  shown in Listing 7-16 are number fields that use simple value bindings to update observables  on the view model. They are shown and hidden by the same visibility mechanism discussed earlier.  Listing 7-16.  Cooking Time Markup          Approximate Cook Time:             Approximate Cook Time:    <input data-bind="value: hours"          name="hours"          id="recipe-hours"          type="number"  >   <input data-bind="value: minutes"          name="minutes"          id="recipe-minutes"          type="number"  >    137  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 7   KnoCKout  Recall that when cooking time is displayed to the user in read-only mode, the cookingTime computed   observable in Listing 7-17 is used, not the hours and minutes observables. When the values of these  observables change based on the input bindings in Listing 7-16, the computed observable regenerates the  formatted string for the view. Also notice that the computed observable no longer has a context argument,  because inside the observable the view model variable is referenced by name instead of being resolved with  the this keyword.  Listing 7-17.  View Model Hours, Minutes, and Computed Cooking Time     example-002 public scripts recipe-details.js    properties viewmodel.hours = ko.observable recipe.cookingTime.hours ; viewmodel.minutes = ko.observable recipe.cookingTime.minutes ; viewmodel.cookingTime = ko.computed function    {   return '$1 hours, $2 minutes'     .replace '$1', viewmodel.hours        .replace '$2', viewmodel.minutes   ; } ;  Adding and Removing Ingredients In read-only mode, recipe ingredients are rendered as an unordered list. To maintain form, when the recipe  details view enters edit mode, an input is generated for each item in the list, shown in Figure 7-7. A minus  button next to each ingredient allows the user to remove any or all ingredients, while an empty input field  and a plus button below the input list may be used to add a new ingredient. Text changes made within any  ingredient input will update the values in the view model’s ingredients array.  Figure 7-7.  Creating and editing recipe ingredients  138  www.it-ebooks.info   Adding a new ingredient is more straight-forward than editing existing ingredients in place. The markup   in Listing 7-18 shows part of the changes to the Ingredients section of the form. The read-only unordered  list is present, and below it is a   element that contains all the new form fields. A comment block  indicates where the   elements for existing ingredients will go  discussed in a moment , but the new  Ingredients fields are shown below it.  Chapter 7   KnoCKout  Listing 7-18.  New Ingredients Markup     Ingredients                           <input data-bind="value: newIngredient"          type="text"          name="new-ingredient"          id="recipe-new-ingredient" >   <button data-bind="click: commitNewIngredient"           class="fa fa-plus">     Listing 7-19.  Creating a New Ingredient in the View Model     example-002 public scripts recipe-details.js    properties viewmodel.ingredients = ko.observableArray recipe.ingredients ; viewmodel.newIngredient = ko.observable '' ;      methods viewmodel.commitNewIngredient = function    {   var ingredient = viewmodel.newIngredient  ;   if  ingredient === ''  return;   viewmodel.ingredients.push ingredient ;   viewmodel.newIngredient '' ; };  To add a new ingredient a user enters text into the new ingredient   field and then clicks the plus   button next to it. The   is bound to the newIngredient observable on the view model, and the Plus  button’s click event invokes the commitNewIngredient   method, both shown in Listing 7-19.  The commitNewIngredient   method evaluates the content of the newIngredient observable to   determine if it is empty or not. If it is, the user has entered no text into the  , and so the method  returns prematurely. If not, the value of newIngredient is pushed into the ingredients observable array and  the newIngredient observable is cleared.  139  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 7   KnoCKout   observable arrays share a nearly identical apI with normal JavaScript arrays. Most array operations,      Tip  such as push  , pop  , slice  , splice  , and so on, are available on observable arrays and will trigger  update notifications to the observable array’s subscribers when called.  When the new ingredient is appended to ingredients, Knockout updates the DOM to reflect the   change. The read-only list, hidden while in edit mode, silently acquires a new list item element, and the  editable list of existing   elements, shown in Listing 7-20, gains a new entry as well.  Listing 7-20.  Ingredients Markup     Ingredients                                 <input data-bind="value: $data,              valueUpdate: 'input',              attr: {name: 'ingredient-' + $index  },              event: {input: $parent.changeIngredient.bind $parent, $index   }"              type="text"  >       <button data-bind="click: $parent.removeIngredient.bind $parent, $index   "               class="fa fa-minus">                     For each ingredient in the ingredients observable array, an input is rendered above the new ingredient  field. These inputs are nested within an unordered list, and their values are all bound to specific ingredients  in the array, denoted by the $data variable within the foreach loop. The attr binding is used to give a  name to each   element by concatenating the string “ingredient-” with the current index of the loop,  exposed by the special $index observable. Like any observable used in a binding expression, $index must be  invoked to retrieve its value.  It cannot be emphasized enough that the bindings exposed by observable arrays apply only to the   arrays themselves and not to the elements they contain. When each ingredient is bound to a DOM    element, it is wrapped in the $data observable, but there is no communication between this observable  and the containing observable array. If the value within $data changes because of input, the array will be  oblivious and still contain its own copy of the unchanged data. This is a source of consternation, but there  are several coping strategies that make it bearable.  First, the observable ingredients array could be filled with objects that each expose the ingredient text  as an observable property  something like { ingredient: ko.observable '20 mushrooms'  } . The value  binding of each   would then use each object’s $data.ingredient property to establish a two-way  binding. The observable array still remains ignorant of changes to its members, but because each element is  an object that tracks its own data through an observable, this becomes a moot point.  140  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 7   KnoCKout  The second approach, taken in Listing 7-20, is to listen for change events on each   element  through the valueUpdate and event bindings, and then tell the view model to replace specific ingredient  values in the ingredients observable array as they change. Neither way is “right”—both merely have their  own advantages and disadvantages.  The valueUpdate binding first instructs Knockout to change the value of $data each time the DOM   input event fires on each   element.  Remember: Knockout normally updates $data once an element  looses focus, not when it receives input.  Second, a Knockout event binding is added that invokes the  changeIngredient   method on the view model every time the DOM input event fires as well. By default  Knockout submits the current value of $data to changeIngredient  , but since the new value will replace the  old, the view model must know which index in the ingredients array is being targeted. Using bind  , the value  of $index is bound to the method as the first argument ensuring that the value of $data will be the second.  The code in Listing 7-21 shows that the changeIngredient   method accesses the actual underlying   array within the ingredients observable array in order to replace a value at a given index.  Listing 7-21.  Changing a Recipe Ingredient in the View Model     example-002 public scripts recipe-details.js    properties viewmodel.ingredients = ko.observableArray recipe.ingredients ;      methods viewmodel.changeIngredient = function  index, newValue  {   viewmodel.ingredients  [index] = newValue; };  Unfortunately, when an observable array’s underlying array structure is changed, the observable   array will not automatically notify any subscribers, which means that other DOM elements, such as the  read-only unordered list that displays the ingredients, will remain unchanged. To mitigate this, the view  model listens to its own isEditing observable, shown in Listing 7-22. When the value passed to the  observable is false  meaning that the user has either saved changes to the recipe or canceled the editing  session , the view model forcibly notifies any subscribers to the ingredients observable array by calling its  valueHasMutated   method. This ensures that the read-only unordered list displayed in “view” mode will  accurately reflect any changed values in the ingredients array.  Listing 7-22.  Forcing Observable Arrays to Notify Their Subscribers of Underlying Changes     example-002 public scripts recipe-details.js    properties viewmodel.isEditing = ko.observable false ; viewmodel.isEditing.subscribe function  isEditing  {   if  isEditing  return;      force refresh        viewmodel.ingredients.valueHasMutated  ; } ;  Next to each recipe   is a minus button used to remove a given ingredient from the   ingredients observable array. Its click event is bound to the removeIngredient   method which, like  changeIngredient  , must also receive the value of $index so that the view model knows which element to  remove. Observable arrays expose a splice   method, shown in Listing 7-23, that may be used to remove an  element at a specific index. Using this method instead of manipulating the underlying array directly ensures  that subscribers to the ingredients observable array are notified of the change immediately.  141  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 7   KnoCKout  Listing 7-23.  Removing a Recipe Ingredient     example-002 public scripts recipe-details.js    properties viewmodel.ingredients = ko.observableArray recipe.ingredients ;      methods viewmodel.removeIngredient = function  index  {   viewmodel.ingredients.splice index, 1 ; };  Instructions Recipe instructions are very similar to recipe ingredients but differ in two notable ways. First, instructions  are rendered in an ordered list because instructions must be followed step-by-step. And second, instructions  may be promoted or demoted within the list. Figure 7-8 shows a screenshot of the ordered Instructions fields  and the buttons associated with each.  Figure 7-8.  Creating and editing recipe instructions  The recipe instruction use cases that overlap with ingredient use cases  creating an instruction,   removing an instruction, updating an existing instruction  will not be discussed, as the markup, Knockout  bindings, and view model structure of both are essentially the same, but operate on the instructions  observable array instead. Instruction demotion and promotion within the array are new features, however,  represented by the addition of up and down   tags in Listing 7-24.  Listing 7-24.  Instructions Markup     Instructions              142  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 7   KnoCKout                          <input data-bind="value: $data,              valueUpdate: 'input',              attr: {name: 'instruction-' + $index  },              event: {input: $parent.changeInstruction.bind $parent, $index   }"              type="text"  >       <button data-bind="click: $parent.demoteInstruction.bind $parent, $index   "               class="fa fa-caret-down">        <button data-bind="click: $parent.promoteInstruction.bind $parent, $index   "               class="fa fa-caret-up">        <button data-bind="click: $parent.removeInstruction.bind $parent, $index   "               class="fa fa-minus">                     Like the minus button, both up and down buttons use Knockout click bindings to invoke methods on   the view model, passing the associated item index as an argument to each.  Listing 7-25 shows how both methods manipulate the instructions observable array. The   promoteInstruction   method evaluates the index and, if it is zero, exits early  the first instruction cannot  be promoted . It then plucks the instruction at the given index from the observable array using its splice    method, calculates the new index for the instruction by subtracting one  e.g., going from index 2 to 1 would  be a promotion in the list , and then splices the instruction back into the observable array at its new index.  The demoteInstruction   method does the opposite. It prevents the instruction at the “end” of the list from  being demoted further; otherwise it moves instructions down the list by re-splicing the observable array. In  both cases any DOM elements bound to the instructions property are notified of changes automatically.  Listing 7-25.  Promoting and Demoting Recipe Instructions in the View Model     example-002 public scripts recipe-details.js    properties viewmodel.instructions = ko.observableArray recipe.instructions ;   viewmodel.promoteInstruction = function  index  {   if  index === 0  return;   var instruction = viewmodel.instructions.splice index, 1 ;   var newIndex = index - 1;   viewmodel.instructions.splice newIndex, 0, instruction ; };   viewmodel.demoteInstruction = function  index  {   var lastIndex =  viewmodel.instructions.length - 1 ;   if  index === lastIndex  return;   var instruction = viewmodel.instructions.splice index, 1 ;   var newIndex = index + 1;   viewmodel.instructions.splice newIndex, 0, instruction ; };  143  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 7   KnoCKout  Citation The Citation field addition is a fairly vanilla affair considering the complexities involved with instructions  and ingredients. A single text   uses the value binding to update the view model’s citation  observable. The rendered field is shown in Figure 7-9.  Figure 7-9.  Updating a Recipe’s Citation  The visible binding on the citation hyperlink has been changed to a compound expression. Now, the   hyperlink in Listing 7-26 will only be displayed if the recipe details view is in read-only mode  !isEditing     and the recipe actually has a citation.  Listing 7-26.  Citation Field Markup    <a data-bind="visible: hasCitation   && !isEditing  ,   attr: {href: citation, title: title}"   target="_blank">Source       Citation:         Custom Components  With inspiration from the popular webcomponents.js polyfill  http:  webcomponents.org , Knockout  provides a custom component system that produces reusable HTML elements with custom tag names,  markup, and behavior.  In the Omnom Recipes application, the recipe details view contains two editable lists, Ingredients and  Instructions, that share many similar characteristics, both in terms of markup and view model properties  and methods. A custom component can, with a little effort, replace both of these lists in the application.  The goal is to reduce the complex markup and binding expressions in the DOM to new, custom elements,  envisioned in Listing 7-27.  Listing 7-27.  Input List Element      <input-list params="items: ingredients,             isOrdered: false">          <input-list params="items: instructions,             isOrdered: true">   144  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 7   KnoCKout  Knockout components are the intersection of several things:   	   	   	  A factory function that creates a view model for each instance of the custom  component on a page  An HTML template with its own Knockout bindings that will be injected wherever  the component is used  A custom tag registration that tells Knockout where to find the template and how to  instantiate its view model when it encounters component tags on a page  The Input List View Model The recipe details view model already possesses the properties and methods used to manipulate its  ingredients and instructions arrays, but it is necessary to abstract this code and move it into its own  module, input-list.js, so that Knockout can use it exclusively for the new input list component.  Listing 7-28 shows an abbreviated version of the input list module. It is structured in the same manner  as the other view model factory modules, exposing a create   method on the global InputList object. This  factory method accepts a params parameter that will be used to pass the input list component a reference  to an observable array  params.items , and a host of optional settings that will determine how the input  list will behave when bound to the rendered template: params.isOrdered, params.enableAdd, params. enableUpdate, and params.enableRemove.  The defaultTo   function exists as a simple utility function that returns default values for missing   properties on the params object.  Listing 7-28.  Input List View Model     example-003 public scripts input-list.js 'use strict'; window.InputList =  function  ko  {     function defaultTo object, property, defaultValue  { *...* }     return {     create: function  params  {       var viewmodel = {};            properties       viewmodel.items = params.items;    the collection       viewmodel.newItem = ko.observable '' ;         viewmodel.isOrdered = defaultTo params, 'isOrdered', false ;       viewmodel.enableAdd = defaultTo params, 'enableAdd', true ;       viewmodel.enableUpdate = defaultTo params, 'enableUpdate', true ;       viewmodel.enableRemove = defaultTo params, 'enableRemove', true ;    145  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 7   KnoCKout           methods       viewmodel.commitNewItem = function    { *...* };       viewmodel.changeItem = function  index, newValue  { *...* };       viewmodel.removeItem = function  index  { *...* };       viewmodel.promoteItem = function  index  { *...* };       viewmodel.demoteItem = function  index  { *...* };         return viewmodel;     }   };   } window.ko  ;  The params.items and params.isOrdered properties correspond to the binding attributes in Listing 7-27.   When a component is used on a page, the values of its binding attributes are passed, by reference, to the  component’s view model via the params object. In this scenario, input list components will be given access  to the ingredients and instructions observable arrays on the recipe details view model.  Input list methods have been redacted in Listing 7-28 because they are nearly identical to their   counterparts in Listing 7-25. Instead of referencing ingredients or instructions, however, these methods  reference the abstracted items observable array. The component populates this array with data it receives  from params.items. The newItem observable holds the value of the new item input, in exactly the same  manner as the newIngredient and newInstruction observables behaved in the recipe-details.js module.  It is not shared with the recipe details view model, however, as it only has relevance within the input list.  Since the input list component will now handle the manipulation of the Ingredients and Instructions  lists on the page, the properties and methods in the recipe details view model that previously performed  these manipulations have been removed.  The Input List Template A reusable component needs an abstracted, reusable template, so the markup associated with editing  instructions and ingredients has also been collected into a single HTML template. Each time an instance of  the input list component is created on the page, Knockout will inject the template into the DOM, then bind a  new instance of the input list view model to it.  Since the input list component can accommodate both ordered and unordered lists, the template   must use Knockout bindings to intelligently decide which kind of list to display. Only ordered lists will have  promotion and demotion buttons, while items can be added and removed from both kinds of lists. Since the  input list view model exposes boolean properties it receives from its params object, the template can alter  its behavior based on the values of those properties. For example, if the view model property isOrdered is  true, the template will show an ordered list; otherwise it will show an unordered list. Likewise the fields  and buttons associated with adding new items or removing existing items are toggled by the enableAdd and  enableRemove properties, respectively.  Template markup is typically added to the DOM in nonparsed elements like   or the <script  type="text html"> element. In Listing 7-29, the full component markup and all bindings are shown within  a   tag. The element’s id will be used by Knockout to find the template content within the DOM  when the component is registered with the framework.  146  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 7   KnoCKout  Listing 7-29.

These comment  blocks evaluate properties on the view model and alter the template processing control flow accordingly.  This differs from the visible elements bindings, which merely hide elements that already exist in the DOM.     Tip    the syntax used within ko comment block bindings is known as containerless control flow syntax.  All fields and buttons in the input list template are bound to properties and methods on the input list   view model. If a demote button is clicked, for example, the input list view model will manipulate its internal  items collection, which is really a reference to the instructions observable array in the recipe details  view model, shared via the items binding. The template determines which type of list to display based  on the isOrdered property, while the add and remove controls are toggled based on the enableAdd and  enableRemove properties. Because these properties are read from the params object in the view model, any  of them may be added to the   component tag as a binding attribute. In this way the component  abstracts and encapsulates all operations made against any collection that can be represented as a list of  inputs.  Registering the Input List Tag Once a component view model and template have been defined, the component itself must be registered  with Knockout. This tells Knockout how to resolve component instances when it encounters the  component’s custom tag in the DOM, and also what template and view model to use when rendering the  component’s contents.  The app.js script has been updated in Listing 7-30 to register the input list component immediately   after the DOM becomes ready, but before any Knockout bindings are applied to the page  with ko. applyBindings   . This ensures that Knockout has time to render the component’s markup in the DOM so  before any view model is bound to it.  Listing 7-30.  Registering the Input List Component     example-003 public scripts app.js  function app  $, ko, InputList  *...*   {      ...     $ function    {        register the custom component tag before        Knockout bindings are applied to the page     ko.components.register 'input-list', {       template: {         element: 'item-list-template'       },       viewModel: InputList.create     } ;          ...   } ;   } window.jQuery, window.ko, window.InputList  *...*   ;  148  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 7   KnoCKout  In Listing 7-30, the ko.components.register   function receives two arguments: the name of the new  component’s custom tag, input-list, and an options hash that provides Knockout with the information it  needs to construct the component.  Knockout uses the custom tag name to identify the   element in the DOM and replace it   with the template content specified in the options hash.  Since markup for the input list element has been defined in a   element, the Knockout   component system only needs to know what element ID it should use to find that element in the DOM. The  template object in the options hash contains this ID in its element property. For smaller components, the  entire HTML template could be assigned, as a string, to the template property directly.  To construct a view model for the component, a factory function is assigned to the viewModel property   of the options hash. This property can also reference a regular constructor function, but using factory  functions sidesteps potential problems that arise when event bindings reassign the this keyword within  view models. Regardless of approach, the view model function will receive a params object populated with  values from the template’s binding declarations.   Knockout can load component templates and view model functions via requireJS automatically.      Tip  Consult the Knockout component documentation for more details. the requireJS module loader is covered in  Chapter 5.  Now that the input list component is registered with Knockout, the complicated markup for the editable  Ingredients and Instructions lists can be replaced with simple instances of  . Listing 7-31 shows  the resulting lighter, cleaner page markup.  Listing 7-31.  Editing Instructions and Ingredients with the Input List Component       Ingredients                   <input-list params="items: ingredients,               isOrdered: false">       Instructions                   <input-list params="items: instructions,               isOrdered: true">       149  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 7   KnoCKout  Not only are the complexities of the input list obscured behind the new   tag, but aspects of  the list, such as the ability to add and remove items, are controlled through bound attributes. This promotes  both flexibility and maintainability as common behaviors are bundled into a single element.  Subscribables: Cheap Messaging  At this point the recipe details view model manipulates the recipe data but does nothing to persist changes.  It also fails to communicate recipe changes to the recipe list, so that even if a user modifies a recipe’s title, the  recipe list continues to display the recipe’s original title. From a use case perspective, the recipe list should  only be updated if the recipe details are sent to the server and successfully persisted. A more sophisticated  mechanism is needed to facilitate this workflow.  Knockout observables implement the behavior of a Knockout subscribable, a more abstract object   that does not hold a value but acts as a kind of eventing mechanism to which other objects may subscribe.  Observables take advantage of the subscribable interface by publishing their own changes through  subscribables, to which DOM bindings  and perhaps even other view models  listen.  Subscribables may be directly, attached to view models as properties, or passed around by reference  to any object interested in their events. In Listing 7-32 a subscribable is constructed in the app.js file and  passed as an argument to both the recipe list and recipe details modules. Note that, unlike an observable,  subscribables must be instantiated with the new keyword.  Listing 7-32.  Knockout Subscribable Acting As a Primitive Message Bus     example-004 public scripts app.js var bus = new ko.subscribable  ; var list = RecipeList.create recipes, bus ; var details = RecipeDetails.create list.selectedRecipe  , bus ;  To effectively publish an updated recipe to the subscribable, the recipe details view model has been   modified in several ways.  First, the subscribable is passed to the recipe details factory function as an argument named bus    shorthand for “poor developer’s message bus” . The recipe details module will use this subscribable to raise  events when recipe details change.  Second, the view model now tracks the recipe’s ID since this value will be used to update recipe data on   the server. The recipe list will also use the ID to replace stale recipe data after changes have been saved.  Finally, the save   method has been updated to trigger the recipe.saved event on the bus   subscribable, passing the modified recipe data as an argument that will be delivered to any subscribers. The  modified save   method is shown in Listing 7-33.  Listing 7-33.  Recipe Details View Model Saving a Modified Recipe     example-004 public scripts recipe-details.js viewmodel.save = function    {   var savedRecipe = {     id: viewmodel.id,     title: viewmodel.title  ,     ingredients: viewmodel.ingredients  ,     instructions: viewmodel.instructions  ,     cookingTime: {       hours: viewmodel.hours  ,       minutes: viewmodel.minutes       },  150  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 7   KnoCKout      servings: viewmodel.servings  ,     citation: viewmodel.citation     };   bus.notifySubscribers savedRecipe, 'recipe.saved' ;   viewmodel.isEditing false ; };  The notifySubscribers   method on a subscribable accepts two arguments—the data object  subscribers will receive and the name of the event being raised. The app.js module subscribes to the  recipe.saved event on the subscribable bus, shown in Listing 7-34, and initiates an AJAX request to send  the modified recipe data to the server. Because the recipe details view model and the app.js module  share a reference to the bus object, any events triggered by the recipe details view model can be handled in  the app.js module.  Listing 7-34.  Saved Recipe Is Persisted to the Server     example-004 public scripts app.js var bus = new ko.subscribable  ;   bus.subscribe function  updatedRecipe  {   $.ajax {     method: 'PUT',     url: ' recipes ' + updatedRecipe.id,     data: updatedRecipe   } .then function    {     bus.notifySubscribers updatedRecipe, 'recipe.persisted' ;   }  }, null, 'recipe.saved' ;  The subscribable’s subscribe   method accepts three arguments:   	   	   	  The callback function to be executed when the specified event is triggered on the  subscribable  The context object that will be bound to the this keyword within the callback  function  or null, if the this keyword is never used within the callback   The name of the event to which the callback is subscribed  e.g., recipe.saved   If the AJAX update succeeds, the app.js module triggers a recipe.persisted event on the subscribable   to notify listeners. A reference to the bus subscribable has also been passed to the recipe list view model,  which actively listens for the recipe.persisted event. When the event fires, the recipe list receives the saved  data in Listing 7-35 and updates its internal recipes collection and selected recipe based on the persisted  recipie’s ID.  Listing 7-35.  Updating the Recipe List with a Persisted Recipe     example-004 public scripts recipe-list.js window.RecipeList =  function  ko  {     return {     create: function  recipes, bus  {       var viewmodel = {};    151  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 7   KnoCKout           properties       viewmodel.recipes = ko.observableArray recipes ;       viewmodel.selectedRecipe = ko.observable recipes[0] ;            ...       bus.subscribe function  updatedRecipe  {           var recipes = viewmodel.recipes  ;         var i = 0,           count = recipes.length;         while  i < count  {           if  recipes[i].id !== updatedRecipe.id  {             i += 1;             continue;           }           recipes[i] = updatedRecipe;           viewmodel.recipes recipes ;           viewmodel.selectRecipe recipes[i] ;           break;         }         }, null, 'recipe.persisted' ;          ...     }   };   } window.ko  ;  Though subscribables aren’t the only way to raise events in an application, they can be effective for   straightforward uses cases, creating a decoupled communication chain between modules.  Summary  Many front-end frameworks offer suites of compelling features and plugins, but Knockout really focuses on  the interaction between the HTML view and data model in an application. Knockout’s observables alleviate  the pain of manually pulling data from, and pushing data to, HTML DOM elements. Developers can add  data-bind attributes to any element on a page, gluing the markup to one or more view models through two- way bindings.  While form data can be directly bound to view model properties, DOM event bindings can also invoke   methods on Knockout view models as well. Any changes these methods make to view model observable  properties are immediately reflected in the DOM. Bindings like visible and css determine how an element  is displayed to the user, while bindings like text and value determine an element’s content.  Observables are special objects that hold view model data values. When their values change,   observables notify any interested subscribers, including bound DOM elements. Primitive observables hold  single values, while observable arrays hold collections. Mutations that happen on observable arrays can be  tracked and mirrored by HTML elements that are bound to the collection. The foreach binding is especially  useful when iterating over an observable array’s elements, though special considerations must be taken if  individual members of an observable array are changed or replaced.  152  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 7   KnoCKout  Knockout templates and view models can be abstracted into reusable components with unique HTML   tags. These components can be added to a page and bound to other view model properties, just as any  standard HTML elements would be bound. Encapsulating state and behavior in a component reduces the  total markup on a page, and also guarantees that similar portions of an application  for example, a list of  inputs bound to a collection  behave the same wherever used.  Finally, subscribable objects—the basic building blocks behind observables—can be used as primitive  message busses, notifying subscribers of published events and potentially delivering payloads of data where  needed.

Break your applications into  small pieces. Then, assemble those testable, bite-sized pieces into your big application.  —Justin Meyer, creator of JavaScriptMVC  AngularJS has managed to attract a tremendous amount of attention within the developer community, and  with good reason: the framework’s unique approach to solving many of the challenges typically associated  with single-page application development differs significantly from those of popular alternatives. These  differences have won Angular a legion of devoted fans, as well as an increasingly vocal group of critics. As you progress through this chapter, you will be introduced to several of the unique features that   distinguish Angular from alternative single-page application frameworks. We will also provide some  guidance as to what types of projects might best be able to benefit from Angular, as well as for what types of  projects other alternatives may be better suited. Before we close out the chapter, we will also spend a brief bit  of time discussing Angular’s history, its current state, and what the future holds for the framework.  A Declarative Approach to Building Web Applications  Angular’s most distinguishing characteristic is the manner in which it allows developers to create web  applications in a so-called “declarative” fashion, as opposed to the “imperative” approach that most  developers are accustomed to. The difference between these two approaches is subtle, but it must be  understood to truly appreciate the unique benefits that Angular brings to the table. Let’s take a look at two  examples that demonstrate each approach.  The Imperative Approach  imperative:  having  the  form  that  expresses  a  command  rather  than  a  statement  or  a  question  —Merriam-Webster.com  When most people think of “programming,” the imperative approach is typically what they have in   mind. Using this approach, a developer instructs a computer on how to do something. As a result, a desired  behavior is  hopefully  achieved. By way of an example, consider Listing 8-1, which shows a simple web  application that uses an imperative approach to display an unordered list of animals.  155  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 8   angularJS  Listing 8-1.  Simple, Imperative Web Application     example-imperative public index.html                    Imperative App                                         var App = function App   {         this.init = function   {             var animals = ['cats', 'dogs', 'aardvarks', 'hamsters', 'squirrels'];             var $list = $ 'myList' ;             animals.forEach function animal  {                 $list.append ' ' + animal + ' ' ;             } ;         };     };       var app = new App  ;     app.init  ;              In this example, our application’s desired behavior—the creation of a list of animals—is achieved as a   result of our having explicitly instructed the computer on how to go about creating it:  1.  We start our application by creating a new instance of the App class and calling its   init   method.  2.  We specify our list’s entries in the form of an array  animals .  3.  We create a reference to the desired container of our list  $list .  4.  Finally, we iterate through each of our array’s entries and append them, one by   one, to the container.  When an application is created with an imperative approach, that application’s source code serves as   the primary source of control behind what that application does and when it does it. Put simply, imperative  applications tell computers how to behave.              156  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 8   angularJS  The Declarative Approach  declarative: having the form of a statement rather than a question or a command  —Merriam-Webster.com  The declarative approach to programming takes the traditional, imperative approach with which most   are familiar and flips it on its head. When developers use this approach, they focus their efforts on describing  a desired result, leaving the steps necessary to achieve that result up to the computer itself.  By way of an example, Listing 8-2 shows a simple web application very similar to that shown in Listing 8-1.   Here, an unordered list of animals is displayed using a more declarative approach with the help of Angular.  Listing 8-2.  Declarative Web Application Developed with Angular     example-declarative public index.html                    Declarative App                                     {{animal}}                                     var app = angular.module 'app', [] ;     app.controller 'BodyController', function $scope  {         $scope.animals = ['cats', 'dogs', 'aardvarks', 'hamsters', 'squirrels'];     } ;              The HTML shown in Listing 8-2 contains several items of importance, but for the moment, direct    your attention to the various nonstandard attributes that are used throughout the page  e.g., ng-app,   ng-controller, and ng-repeat . These attributes demonstrate the use of directives, one of Angular’s most  prominent and popular features.  Put simply, Angular directives allow developers to enhance HTML’s syntax with their own custom   extensions. These extensions can occur in the form of classes, custom attributes, comments, and  even entirely new DOM elements, as we’ll soon see. When Angular encounters these directives, it  automatically executes whatever functionality has been associated with them. This could include the  execution of a function, the loading of a template, and much more. Angular also includes several of its  own built-in directives  such as those used in Listing 8-2 , many of which we will be covering throughout  this chapter.  157  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 8   angularJS  When a web application is created with a declarative approach, the responsibility for determining   the flow of control within that application shifts from its source code to its interface. Rather than explicitly  stating what needs to occur once our application has loaded  as shown in Listing 8-1 , we allow our  application’s interface to describe for itself what needs to occur. Angular directives help make this possible.  For newcomers, the differences between the imperative and declarative approaches to application   development may seem subtle, but as we continue, I think you will find that there is much to be   excited about.  Modules: A Foundation for Building Loosely   Coupled Applications  Complex applications cease to be complex when we approach them not as a single entity, but instead as  a collection of small components that work together to achieve a desired goal. Angular modules, which  serve as the fundamental building blocks of all Angular projects, provide us with a convenient pattern for  structuring our applications in this way.  Take another look at Listing 8-2 and take note of this example’s call to Angular’s module   method,   which serves as both a setter and a getter. Here we create a module representing our application as a whole.  To define a new module using the setter syntax, we supply the name of our new module, along with an  array of names referencing other modules that this module depends on. In this example, our module has  no dependencies, but we still pass an empty array in order to use the setter syntax. Listing 8-3, on the other  hand, demonstrates the creation of a new app module with two dependencies.  Listing 8-3.  Creating a New Angular Module with Dependencies   **  * Creates a new module that depends on two other modules - `module1` and `module2`  *  var app = angular.module 'app', ['module1', 'module2'] ;  Once a module has been defined, we can get a reference to it later by using the module   method’s   getter syntax, as shown in Listing 8-4.  Listing 8-4.  Angular’s module   Method Serves As a Getter when No Dependencies Array Is Passed   **  * Returns a reference to a pre-existing module named `app`  *  var app = angular.module 'app' ;  Throughout this chapter, we will take a look at a number of tools that Angular provides for building  applications. As we do so, bear in mind that these tools are always used within the context of a module.  Every Angular application is itself a module that relies on other modules. Knowing this, we can visualize the  general structure of an Angular application as resembling that shown in Figure 8-1.  158  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 8   angularJS  Figure 8-1.  Every Angular application is a module, and Angular modules may specify other modules as  dependencies  Specifying a Bootstrap Module Significant architectural projects in the physical world often begin with the laying of a cornerstone, the first  block around which all other blocks are set in reference to. Similarly, every Angular project has what can be  considered a cornerstone of its own—a module representing the application itself. The process by which this  module  along with its dependencies  is initialized is referred to as Angular’s “bootstrap” process, and can  be kicked off in one of two possible ways.  Automatic Bootstrapping Refer back to Listing 8-2 and take note of the ng-app directive that is attached to the page’s html tag. When  this page has finished loading, Angular will automatically check for the presence of this directive. If it is  found, the module that it references will serve as the application’s foundational module—the module  representing the application itself. This module will automatically be initialized, at which point the  application will be ready.  Manual Bootstrapping For most applications, Angular’s automatic bootstrapping process should suffice. However, in certain  situations it can be useful to exert a greater degree of control over when this process occurs. In such cases, it  is possible to manually initiate Angular’s bootstrap process, as shown in Listing 8-5.  159  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 8   angularJS  Listing 8-5.  Deferring Angular’s Bootstrap Process Until the Completion of an Initial jQuery-based   AJAX Request  $.ajax {     'url': ' api data',     'type': 'GET' } .done function   {     angular.bootstrap document, ['app'] ; } ;  In this example, we defer Angular’s bootstrap process until an initial AJAX request completes. Only then  do we call Angular’s bootstrap   method, passing a DOM object to serve as a container for our application   its “root element” , along with an array that specifies a module named app  the module representing our  application  as a dependency.   Most of the time, an angular application will exist as the only such application within a page;      Note  however, multiple angular applications can coexist within the same page. When they do, only one may take  advantage of angular’s automatic bootstrap process, while others must manually bootstrap themselves at the  appropriate time.  Directives: An Abstraction Layer for the DOM  Through the use of prototypical inheritance, JavaScript provides developers with a mechanism for creating  named functions  the JavaScript equivalent of a class  with custom, built-in behavior. Other developers can  then instantiate and use such classes, without being required to understand the inner workings of how they  function. The example shown in Listing 8-6 demonstrates this process.  Listing 8-6.  Prototypal Inheritance in Action     example-prototype index.js   function Dog   { }   Dog.prototype.bark = function   {     console.log 'Dog is barking.' ; };   Dog.prototype.wag = function   {     console.log 'Tail is wagging.' ; };   Dog.prototype.run = function   {     console.log 'Dog is running.' ; };   var dog = new Dog  ; dog.bark  ; dog.wag  ; dog.run  ;  160  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 8   angularJS  This process by which complex behavior is abstracted behind simple interfaces is a fundamental   object-oriented programming concept. In much the same way, Angular directives can be thought of as an  abstraction layer for the DOM, one that provides developers with a mechanism for creating complex web  components that can be used through the use of nothing more than simple HTML markup. Listing 8-7  provides an example that should help to clarify this concept.  Listing 8-7.  Example Demonstrating the Creation of a Simple Angular Directive     example-directive1 public index.html                    Example Directive                                              var app = angular.module 'app', [] ;     app.directive 'newsList', function   {         return {             'restrict': 'E',             'replace': true,             'templateUrl': ' templates news-list.html'         };     } ;              After creating a module for our application, we define a new directive by calling our module’s   directive   method, passing a name and a factory function responsible for returning an object that  describes our new directive to Angular. Several different options may be specified by the object that our  factory function returns, but in this simple example, only three are used:  restrict: Specifies whether this directive should be paired with matching  attributes  A , classes  C , or DOM elements  E  that Angular finds  or any  combination of the three . In this example, a value of E specifies that Angular  should only pair our directive with DOM elements whose tag names match.   We could have easily specified all three by passing AEC.  161  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 8   angularJS  replace: A value of true indicates that our component should completely  replace the DOM element that it has been paired with. A value of false would  allow us to create a directive that simply augments an existing DOM element in  some way, instead of completely replacing it with something else.  templateUrl: The markup that Angular finds at this URL will represent our  directive once it has been inserted into the DOM. It is also possible to pass in the  contents of a template directly through the use of the template option.     Note   In regard to the name of our new directive, note the use of camelCase formatting when we created  it within angular and the use of dash-delimited formatting when we referenced it within htMl. this difference  is due to the case-insensitive nature of htMl markup. as angular parses our htMl, it will automatically resolve  these differences in naming conventions for us.  Now when we load our application in the browser, Angular will automatically pair our newly defined   directive with any matching DOM elements that it finds. As a result, all instances of the   tag will  be replaced with the element shown in Figure 8-2.  Figure 8-2.  Our newly defined directive  162  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 8   angularJS  The basic example that we’ve just covered did little more than replace a custom DOM element with   a different template  we’ll build on this example by adding our own custom logic in the next section .  However, you should already be starting to notice the power and convenience that Angular directives  afford developers. The ability to inject complex components into an application through the use of simple  tags such as the one seen in Listing 8-7 provides developers with a convenient mechanism for abstracting  complex functionality behind simple facades that are much easier to manage.  Taking Control  In the previous section, we stepped through the creation of a simple Angular directive that, in the end, did  little more than replace a custom DOM element with a separate template of our choosing. This is a useful  application of directives in and of itself, but in order to appreciate the full power of directives, we’ll need to  take this example a step further by applying our own custom logic that will allow instances of our directive to  behave in interesting ways. We can do so with the help of scopes and controllers.  Scopes and Prototypal Inheritance Angular scopes can be a bit tricky to grasp at first because they are directly related to one of the more  confusing aspects of JavaScript in general: prototypal inheritance. Newcomers to Angular often find scopes  to be one of its more confusing concepts, but a solid understanding of them is essential to working with the  framework. Before we continue, let’s take a few minutes to explore their purpose and how they work.  Within most “classical” object-oriented languages, inheritance is accomplished through the use of  classes. JavaScript, on the other hand, implements an entirely different inheritance structure known as  prototypal inheritance, in which all inheritance is accomplished through the use of objects and functions.  Listing 8-8 show an example of this process in action.  Listing 8-8.  Example of Prototypal Inheritance, in Which Car Extends Vehicle     example-prototype2 index.js    **  * @class Vehicle  *  var Vehicle = function Vehicle   {     console.log this.constructor.name, 'says: I am a vehicle.' ; };   Vehicle.prototype.start = function   {     console.log '%s has started.', this.constructor.name ; };   Vehicle.prototype.stop = function   {     console.log '%s has stopped.', this.constructor.name ; };    163  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 8   angularJS   **  * @class Car  *  var Car = function Car   {     console.log this.constructor.name, 'says: I am a car.' ;     Vehicle.apply this, arguments ; };   Car.prototype = Object.create Vehicle.prototype ; Car.prototype.constructor = Car;   Car.prototype.honk = function   {     console.log '%s has honked.', this.constructor.name ; };   var vehicle = new Vehicle  ; vehicle.start  ; vehicle.stop  ;   var car = new Car  ; car.start  ; car.honk  ; car.stop  ;    * Result: Vehicle says: I am a vehicle. Vehicle has started. Vehicle has stopped. Car says: I am a car. Car says: I am a vehicle. Car has started. Car has honked. Car has stopped. *   In this example, a Vehicle function is defined. We assign start   and stop   instance methods to it by  augmenting its prototype. Afterward, we define a Car function, only this time, we replace its prototype with  one that inherits from that of Vehicle. Finally, we assign a honk instance method to Car. When running this  example, take note of the fact that new instances of Vehicle can start and stop, while new instances of Car  can start, stop, and honk. This is prototypal inheritance at work.  This is an important concept to grasp—during Angular’s bootstrap phase, a similar process occurs in   which a parent object  referred to as $rootScope  is created and attached to the application’s root element.  Afterward, Angular will continue parsing the DOM in search of directives  Angular refers to this process as  “compilation” . As these directives are encountered, Angular will create new objects which inherit from their  nearest ancestor and assign them to the DOM element each directive is attached to. Angular is, in effect,  creating a special sandbox—in Angular terms, a “scope”—for each component within our application. The  result can be visualized as something like that which is shown in Figure 8-3.  164  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 8   angularJS  Figure 8-3.  A web application with various components created with the help of directives. On the right,  portions of the DOM are highlighted where new scopes have been created  Manipulating Scope with Controllers An Angular controller is nothing more than a function whose sole purpose is to manipulate a scope object,  and it is here that we can begin to add some intelligence to our application’s components. Listing 8-9 shows  an extended version of the example we looked at in Listing 8-7. The only difference is the addition of a  controller property to the object responsible for describing our directive. The contents of the template this  directive uses are shown in Listing 8-10.  Listing 8-9.  Extended Version of Listing 8-7 Example That Adds Custom Behavior to Our New Directive     example-directive2 public index.html                    Example Directive                                              var app = angular.module 'app', [] ;     app.directive 'newsList', function   {         return {             'restrict': 'E',             'replace': true,             'controller': function $scope, $http  {  165  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 8   angularJS                  $http.get ' api news' .then function result  {                     $scope.items = result.data;                 } ;             },             'templateUrl': ' templates news-list.html'         };     } ;              Listing 8-10.  Contents of Our Directive’s Template     example-directive2 public templates news-list.html                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         In Listing 8-9, look specifically at the portion where we assign a function to our directive’s controller  property. Take note of the fact that our controller function receives two arguments: $scope and $http. For  the moment, don’t concern yourself with how these arguments came to be passed to our controller—we’ll  discuss that in the upcoming section on services. For now, the important thing to realize is that within our  controller, the $scope variable refers to the object that Angular automatically created for us when it first  encountered our directive in the DOM. At this point, our controller has the opportunity to alter that object  and, as a result, to see those changes reflected in the DOM due to Angular’s support for two-way data  binding.  Two-Way Data Binding Data binding describes Angular’s ability to link a template with a JavaScript object  i.e., a scope , allowing  the template to reference properties within the scope that are then rendered to the browser. Figure 8-4  illustrates this process.  166  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 8   angularJS  Figure 8-4.  Process by which data binding allows Angular applications to render data that is referenced  within a scope object  Angular’s support for data binding doesn’t stop with this one-way process by which data referenced  within a scope is displayed within a view. The framework also provides directives that enable the inverse  effect, allowing a directive’s scope to update as changes occur within its view  e.g., when a form field’s value  changes . When Angular’s implementation of data binding is described as “two-way,” this is what is being  referred to.   the topic of two-way data binding will be discussed in greater detail later in the chapter in the      Note  “Creating Complex Forms” section.  In Listing 8-9, our controller uses Angular’s $http service to fetch an array from our API that contains  headlines from National Public Radio and The Onion. It then assigns that array to the items property of our  directive’s $scope object. To see how this information gets reflected within the DOM, direct your attention to  the ng-repeat directive shown in Listing 8-10. This core Angular directive allows us to iterate over our array  from within our template, creating new  ...  elements for each item it contains.  Finally, Angular’s built-in ng-src and ng-bind directives allow us to dynamically assign image URLs and  textual content to the appropriate elements within our template.  The final result after having loaded this application in the browser can be seen in Figure 8-5.  167  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 8   angularJS  Figure 8-5.  Our application after having been loaded in the browser  Loose Coupling Through Services and Dependency Injection  In the previous section, you were introduced to the basic process by which Angular applications are  organized as a series of nested scopes, which can be manipulated by controllers and referenced by  templates via two-way data binding. Using only these concepts, it is possible to build fairly simple  applications  as demonstrated by some of the examples included in this chapter , but without planning,  attempts to build anything more complex will quickly run into growing pains. In this section, we’ll discover  how services can support developers in building loosely coupled Angular applications that are designed to  accommodate growth.  Dependency Injection Before we dive into services, it’s important that we take a minute to talk about dependency injection, a  concept that is fairly new to the world of client-side frameworks and one that is relied on heavily by Angular.  First, take a look at Listing 8-11, which shows a very basic Node.js application with a single dependency,   the fs module. In this example, our module has the responsibility of retrieving the fs module via the  require   method.  168  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 8   angularJS  Listing 8-11.  Node.js Application That Depends on the fs Module  var fs = require 'fs' ; fs.readFile '~ data.txt', 'utf8', function err, contents  {     if  err  throw new Error err ;     console.log contents ; } ;  The pattern that we see here, in which a module “requires” a dependency, intuitively makes sense. A   module needs another component, so it goes out and gets it. The concept of dependency injection, however,  flips this concept on its head. Listing 8-12 shows a simple example of dependency injection in action within  Angular.  Listing 8-12.  Dependency Injection in Action Within Angular  var app = angular.module 'app', [] ; app.controller 'myController', function $http  {     $http.get ' api news' .then function result  {         console.log result ;     } ; } ;  Frameworks such as Angular that implement dependency injection prescribe a common pattern by  which modules can register themselves with a central point of control. In other words, as an application  is initialized, modules are given the opportunity to say, “This is my name, and this is where you can find  me.” Afterward and throughout the execution of that program, modules that are loaded can reference their  dependencies simply by specifying them as arguments to their constructor function  or class . The order in  which they are specified makes no difference.  Refer back to Listing 8-12. In this example, we create a new app module to represent our application.  Next, we create a controller named myController within our application’s module, passing a constructor  function that will be called whenever a new instance is needed. Take note of the $http argument that is  passed into our controller’s constructor; this is an example of dependency injection at work. The $http  dependency that our controller refers to is a module included within Angular’s core codebase. During our  application’s bootstrap phase, Angular registered this module in the form of a service—the same type of  service that you’re about to learn how to create for yourself.   By convention, core services, apIs, and properties provided by angular are prefixed with $. to prevent      Note  possible collisions, it is best if you avoid following this convention within your own code.  Thin Controllers and Fat Services ake another look at Listing 8-9, which demonstrates the process by which controllers can be used to add  intelligence to an application’s directives. In this example, our controller creates an AJAX request that  returns an array of news headlines from our API. While that works, this example doesn’t address the very  real and foreseeable need to share this information throughout our application.  169  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 8   angularJS  While we could have other interested components duplicate this AJAX request themselves, that  wouldn’t be ideal for a number of reasons. We would be in a much better position if we could instead  abstract the logic for gathering these headlines into a centralized API that could be reused throughout our  application. Doing so would provide us with a number of benefits, including the ability to change the URL at  which this information is fetched in a single location, unbeknownst to consumers of the API.  As we’ll see in a moment, Angular services provide us with the tools we need to accomplish this goal.  Services provide us with a mechanism for creating well-defined interfaces that can be shared and reused  throughout an application. When the bulk of an Angular application’s logic is structured in this way, we can  begin to see controllers for what they really are: little more than a thin layer of glue responsible for binding  scopes with services in ways that make the most sense for a particular view.  Within Angular, three broad categories of service types  one of which is confusingly named “service”    exist: factories, services, and providers. Let’s take a look at each of them.  Factories The example shown in Listing 8-13 builds on Listing 8-9 by moving the logic required for fetching our  headlines into a factory.  Listing 8-13.  Angular headlines Factory That Provides an API for Fetching News Headlines     example-directive3 public index.html                    Example Directive                                              var app = angular.module 'app', [] ;     app.directive 'newsList', function   {         return {             'restrict': 'E',             'replace': true,             'controller': function $scope, headlines  {                 headlines.fetch  .then function items  {                     $scope.items = items;                 } ;             },             'templateUrl': ' templates news-list.html'         };     } ;     app.factory 'headlines', function $http  {         return {  170  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 8   angularJS              'fetch': function   {                 return $http.get ' api news' .then function result  {                     return result.data;                 } ;             }         };     } ;              In Listing 8-13, the headlines factory returns an object with a fetch   method that, when called, will   query our API for headlines and return them in the form of a promise.  In most Angular applications, factories are by far the most commonly used type of service. The first time   a factory is referenced as a dependency, Angular will invoke the factory’s function and return the result to  the requestor. Subsequent references to the service will receive the same result that was originally returned  the first time the service was referenced. In other words, factories can be thought of as singletons, in that  they are never invoked more than once.  Services The example shown in Listing 8-14 builds on Listing 8-9 by moving the logic required for fetching our  headlines into a service.  Listing 8-14.  Angular headlines Service That Provides an API for Fetching News Headlines     example-directive4 public index.html                    Example Directive                                              var app = angular.module 'app', [] ;     app.directive 'newsList', function   {         return {             'restrict': 'E',             'replace': true,             'controller': function $scope, headlines  {                 headlines.fetch  .then function items  {                     $scope.items = items;  171  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 8   angularJS                  } ;             },             'templateUrl': ' templates news-list.html'         };     } ;     app.service 'headlines', function $http  {         this.fetch = function   {             return $http.get ' api news' .then function result  {                 return result.data;             } ;         };     } ;              Within Angular, services function almost identically to factories, with one key difference. While factory   functions are simply invoked, service functions are called as constructors via the new keyword, allowing  them to be defined in the form of a class that is instantiated. Which you choose to use largely depends on  style preferences, as the same end result can be achieved with both.  In this example, instead of returning an object as we did within our factory, we assign a fetch   method   to this, the object ultimately returned by our service’s constructor function.  Providers The example shown in Listing 8-15 builds on Listing 8-9 by moving the logic required for fetching our  headlines into a provider.  Listing 8-15.  Angular headlines Provider That Provides an API for Fetching News Headlines     example-directive5 public index.html                    Example Directive                                              var app = angular.module 'app', [] ;     app.directive 'newsList', function   {         return {             'restrict': 'E',  172  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 8   angularJS              'replace': true,             'controller': function $scope, headlines  {                 headlines.fetch  .then function items  {                     $scope.items = items;                 } ;             },             'templateUrl': ' templates news-list.html'         };     } ;     app.config function headlinesProvider  {         headlinesProvider.limit = 10;     } ;     app.provider 'headlines', function   {         this.$get = function $http  {             var self = this;             return {                 'fetch': function   {                     return $http.get ' api news', {                         'params': {                             'limit': self.limit  20                         }                     } .then function result  {                         return result.data;                     } ;                 }             };         };     } ;              Unlike factories and services, which are fully responsible for determining their own settings, Angular   providers allow developers to configure them during their parent module’s configuration phase. In this way,  providers can be thought of as configurable factories. In this example, we define a headlines provider that  functions identically to the factory we created in Listing 8-13, only this time, the fetch   method passes a  configurable limit parameter to our API that allows it to specify a limit for the number of results it will receive.  In Listing 8-15, we define a factory function at this.$get within our provider. When the headlines   provider is referenced as a dependency, Angular will invoke this function and return its result to the  requestor, much like it did with our factory in Listing 8-13. In contrast, notice how our provider’s fetch    method is able to reference a limit property that was defined within the module’s config block.  Creating Routes  So-called “single-page applications” built with frameworks such as Angular provide their users with fluid  experiences that are more akin to that of traditional desktop applications. They do so by preloading all  or  most  of the various resources they require  e.g., scripts, stylesheets, etc.  within a single, up-front page load.  Subsequent requests for different URLs are then intercepted and processed via background AJAX requests,  rather than requiring a full refresh of the page. In this section, you’ll learn how to manage such requests with  the help of Angular’s ngRoute module.  173  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 8   angularJS  Listing 8-16 builds on the example that was previously shown in Listing 8-13. This time, however, we  have added two routes to our application that allow users to navigate to sections labeled “Dashboard” and  “News Headlines.” Only after the user navigates to the   headlines route will our newsList directive be  injected into the page. The following steps are taken to achieve this goal:              1.  Define a configuration block that will be executed during our application’s   bootstrap phase. Within this function, we reference the $routeProvider service  provided by Angular’s angular-route package, which must be installed in  addition to Angular’s core library.  2.  Define an array, routes, within which objects are placed that define the various   routes to be made available by our application. In this example, each object’s  route property defines the location at which the route will be loaded, while the  config property allows us to specify a controller function and template to be  loaded at the appropriate time.  3.   Iterate through each entry of the routes array and pass the appropriate  properties to the when   method made available by the $routeProvider service.  This approach provides us with a simple method by which multiple routes can  be defined. Alternatively, we could have made two separate, explicit calls to the  $routeProvider.when   method without using an array.  4.  Utilize the $routeProvider.otherwise   method to define a default route to be  loaded in the event that no route  or an invalid route  is referenced by the user.   Listing 8-16.  Angular Application That Defines Two Routes, dashboard and headlines     example-router1 public index.html                    Routing Example                                                            var app = angular.module 'app', ['ngRoute', 'newsList'] ;     app.config function $routeProvider  {         var routes = [             {                 'route': ' dashboard',                 'config': {  174  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 8   angularJS                      'templateUrl': ' templates dashboard.html'                 }             },             {                 'route': ' headlines',                 'config': {                     'controller': function $log  {                         $log.debug 'Welcome to the headlines route.' ;                     },                     'templateUrl': ' templates headlines.html'                 }             }         ];         routes.forEach function route  {             $routeProvider.when route.route, route.config ;         } ;         $routeProvider.otherwise {             'redirectTo': ' dashboard'    Our default route         } ;     } ;              Route Parameters In practice, most of the routes that exist within a typical Angular application are designed to serve up  dynamic content that varies based on the value of one or more parameters that each route expects. The  example shown in Listing 8-17 demonstrates how this can be accomplished.  Listing 8-17.  Angular Application with Routes That Vary Their Content Based on the Value of an Expected  Parameter     example-router2 public index.html                    Routing Example                              175  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 8   angularJS                          var app = angular.module 'app', ['ngRoute'] ;     app.config function $routeProvider  {         var routes = [{             'route': ' dashboard',             'config': {                 'templateUrl': ' templates dashboard.html',                 'controller': function $scope, $http  {                     return $http.get ' api animals' .then function result  {                         $scope.animals = result.data;                     } ;                 },             }         },         {             'route': ' animals :animalID',             'config': {                 'templateUrl': ' templates animal.html',                 'controller': function $scope, $route, $http  {                     $http.get ' api animals ' + $route.current.params.animalID . then function result  {                         $scope.animal = result.data;                     } ;                 }             }         }];         routes.forEach function route  {             $routeProvider.when route.route, route.config ;         } ;         $routeProvider.otherwise {             'redirectTo': ' dashboard'    Our default route         } ;     } ;              Route Resolutions If done correctly, single-page applications can provide their users with an experience that is substantially  improved over that of their standard counterparts. That said, these improvements don’t come without a cost.  Coordinating the various API calls that occur throughout a single-page application’s life cycle can be quite  challenging. Before we move on, let’s touch on a particularly useful feature provided by Angular’s ngRoute  module that can help us tame some of this complexity: resolutions.  Resolutions allow us to define one or more steps that must take place before a transition to a specific   route can occur. If any of the resolutions defined for a route happen to return promises, the transition to the  desired route will complete only after each of them has been resolved. The example shown in Listing 8-18  shows route resolutions in action.  176  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 8   angularJS  Listing 8-18.  Route Resolutions in Action     example-router3 public index.html                    Routing Example                                                     var app = angular.module 'app', ['ngRoute'] ;     app.config function $routeProvider  {         $routeProvider.when ' dashboard', {             'templateUrl': ' templates dashboard.html',             'controller': function $scope, animals, colors  {                 $scope.animals = animals;                 $scope.colors = colors;             },             'resolve': {                 'animals': function $http  {                     return $http.get ' api animals' .then function result  {                         return result.data;                     } ;                 },                 'colors': function $http  {                     return $http.get ' api colors' .then function result  {                         return result.data;                     } ;                 }             }         } ;         $routeProvider.otherwise {             'redirectTo': ' dashboard'    Our default route         } ;     } ;              177  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 8   angularJS  In this example, a single route is defined that displays a list of animals and colors after making two   corresponding calls to an API to fetch this information. Rather than request this information directly  from within our route’s controller, we create requests within the route’s resolve object. As a result, when  our route’s controller function is called, we can know with certainty that the requests have already been  completed.  Creating Complex Forms  HTML forms can be frustratingly difficult to manage. A major concern is validation, the process by which  users are made aware of problems  e.g., a required field that has not been filled out  and guided to their  resolution. In addition, complex forms frequently require additional logic that allows them to vary their  content based on the user’s answers to previous questions. Throughout the next several pages, we’ll take a  look at a few examples that demonstrate how Angular can help simplify some of these challenges.  Validation Well-designed HTML forms give careful consideration to user experience. They don’t assume that users  fully understand what is being asked of them. They also go out of their way to notify users when problems  exist, along with the steps that are required to resolve them. Fortunately, Angular’s declarative syntax allows  developers to easily create forms that abide by these rules.  Listing 8-19 shows the HTML for our first example, while Listing 8-20 shows the accompanying   controller.  Listing 8-19.  HTML Form That Implements Validation and Displays Dynamic Feedback to the User     example-form1 public index.html                    Example Form                                              <div ng-class="{                 'has-error': !myForm.first_name.$pristine && !myForm.first_name.$valid,                 'has-success': !myForm.first_name.$pristine && myForm.first_name.$valid             }">                  First Name                  <input                     type="text"                     name="first_name"                     ng-model="model.first_name"                     class="form-control"  178  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 8   angularJS                      ng-minlength="3"                     ng-maxlength="15"                     ng-required="true">                 <p ng-show="                     !myForm.first_name.$pristine &&                     myForm.first_name.$error.required">                     First name is required.                                   <p ng-show="                     !myForm.first_name.$pristine &&                     myForm.first_name.$error.minlength">                     First name must be at least 3 characters long.                                   <p ng-show="                     !myForm.first_name.$pristine &&                     myForm.first_name.$error.maxlength">                     First name can have no more than 15 characters.                                               <div ng-class="{                 'has-error': !myForm.last_name.$pristine && !myForm.last_name.$valid,                 'has-success': !myForm.last_name.$pristine && myForm.last_name.$valid             }">                  Last Name                  <input                     type="text"                     name="last_name"                     ng-model="model.last_name"                     class="form-control"                     ng-minlength="3"                     ng-maxlength="15"                     ng-required="true">                 <p ng-show="                     !myForm.last_name.$pristine &&                     myForm.last_name.$error.required">                     Last name is required.                                   <p ng-show="                     !myForm.last_name.$pristine &&                     myForm.last_name.$error.minlength">                     Last name must be at least 3 characters long.                                   <p ng-show="                     !myForm.last_name.$pristine &&                     myForm.last_name.$error.maxlength">                     Last name can have no more than 15 characters.                                    179  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 8   angularJS                                                       Submit                   Reset                                                                          Listing 8-20.  Controller That Has Been Attached to the Document’s   Element     example-form1 public app index.js   var app = angular.module 'app', [] ; app.controller 'formController', function $scope, $http, $log  {       $scope.formClass = null;     $scope.model = {};       $http.get ' api model' .then function result  {         $scope.model = result.data;     } ;       $scope.submit = function   {         if  !$scope.myForm.$valid  return;         $http.post ' api model', {             'model': $scope.model         } .then function   {             alert 'Form submitted.' ;         } .catch function err  {             alert err ;         } ;     };       $scope.reset = function   {         $scope.model = {};         $http.post ' api model', {             'model': $scope.model         } ;     };   180  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 8   angularJS       **      * Angular's built-in `$watch  ` method  available within every controller       * enables us to watch for and respond to changes that occur within variables      * defined at the `$scope` level. Here we save the contents of our a form as      * a JSON string to `$scope.output`, which is referenced by our template.      *      $scope.$watch 'model', function   {         $scope.output = angular.toJson $scope.model, 4 ;     }, true ;   } ;  As Angular compiles our application, it will apply a built-in form directive to the   element   contained within our template. This directive will create a new instance of a special controller,  FormController, that Angular reserves for managing form instances. Finally, based on the value of our  form’s name attribute  in this case, myForm , Angular will assign a reference to the newly created instance of  FormController to the form’s parent scope, allowing our controller to interact with our newly created form  at $scope.myForm.  Instances of FormController provide a number of useful properties and methods, which you can see   referenced throughout Listing 8-19 and Listing 8-20. For instance, note how we are able to dynamically  enable or disable our form’s submit button with the help of the ng-disabled directive. In this example,  we’ve set this directive to reference our form’s $invalid property, which will always return TRUE or FALSE to  indicate whether any of the inputs contained within our form are in an invalid state.  Listing 8-19 also applies additional built-in Angular directives  ng-minlength, ng-maxlength, and   ng-required  to implement some simple validation rules within our form. Directly below each of these  inputs, our template references various properties on the myForm object to determine what, if any, errors  currently exist. Based on this information, it can then hide or show the appropriate feedback to the user.  Note the use of the ng-model directive in Listing 8-19 on each of our form’s input fields. This directive    which is specifically designed to be used with form controls  allows us to implement two-way data binding,  a concept that was briefly mentioned earlier in the chapter. As the values entered within each of these fields  is changed, so too will our scope be updated, at the properties referenced by ng-model. Thanks to two-way  data binding, the inverse effect also holds. If our controller were to modify a value referenced by ng-model,  the matching form input would also update accordingly. It’s important to note that the ng-model directive  is the preferred method by which we can determine a form’s input values. Within Angular, an input’s name  attribute is used solely for purposes of validation.

The example that is included with this chapter includes a preview of  our scope’s model object that will automatically update as data is entered into the form  Figure 8-7.  As the user enters their information, the form dynamically displays the appropriate feedback,  based on the information that has been submitted. Here we notify the user that the “First Name” field should  be at least three characters long  182  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 8   angularJS  Figure 8-8.  Our form in its final state, after the user has entered all of their information  Conditional Logic Forms often require additional logic to determine under what circumstances certain questions or other  information should be presented. A commonly encountered scenario would involve a form that asks a user  for their e-mail address only after they have selected “Email” as their preferred method of contact. Our  next example, shown in Listing 8-21, will build on the previous one by demonstrating how such logic can  be implemented through the use of the ng-if directive. Figure 8-9 and Figure 8-10 show the end result, as  rendered within the browser.  Listing 8-21.

Once added, each entry also provides a link that allows the user to  remove it.  185  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 8   angularJS  Listing 8-22.

Note how we are able to reference {{$index}} within the scope created by ng-repeat to determine  our current position within the array. Using this information, we assign a unique name to each entry for  validation purposes.  Our template provides the user with a global “Add Pet” link at the top of the section that, when clicked,   calls the addPet   method that has been defined within our controller. Doing so appends an empty object to  our scope’s model.pets array. As our ng-repeat directive iterates over each entry, we also provide the user  with a link for removal. Clicking this link passes the current entry from our model.pets array to our scope’s  removePet   method, which removes it from the array.

Our final example, as presented to the user  Summary  At the start of this chapter, we took a moment to compare the traditional, “imperative” approach to  development with the “declarative” approach favored by Angular. While each approach has its pros and  cons, it’s hard to deny that Angular’s approach is particularly well suited to solving problems associated with  form development. This is not a coincidence.  Over time, Angular has slowly evolved into a framework capable of supporting large applications, but   that was not its original intent. Angular’s original focus was in fact on form development, as one of the   co-creators behind Angular, Miško Hevery, readily admits. This is an important fact to be aware of, because  it speaks to the types of projects that Angular is particularly well suited for  as well as those for which more  appropriate alternatives may exist .  Angular has attracted a tremendous amount of commentary, mostly positive, since its initial release.   The framework’s implementation of directives and dependency injection has had a drastic impact on  the landscape of client-side development and has raised great questions as to what developers should be  expecting from similar frameworks.  188  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 8   angularJS  That said, the number of developers with valid criticisms of the framework has been steadily increasing   for some time. The bulk of this criticism revolves around performance concerns related to Angular’s use  of so-called “dirty checking” as part of its implementation of two-way data binding. This criticism is fair,  because Angular’s implementation of two-way data binding is inefficient. This author’s experience, however,  is that Angular’s performance is more than adequate for the vast majority of use cases for which it was  designed. At the time of this book’s publication, a major rewrite  version 2.0  was also underway, which  should address many, if not all, of these concerns.  If you are currently wondering whether Angular is a good fit for your project, there is no simple “yes”  or “no” answer; it depends entirely upon your specific needs. Generally speaking, however, I am a big fan.  Web-based applications are growing more complex and feature-rich by the day. Developers can only create  and maintain such applications when they have tools that allow them to abstract complexity behind simple  interfaces. Through the use of tools such as directives, Angular extends this well-understood concept to the  DOM in very exciting ways.

But as many well-known and respected  organizations will attest, the benefits afforded by JavaScript as a server-side language have already had a  tremendous impact on the manner in which they develop and deploy software. Among the many accolades  for Node, Michael Yormark, Project Manager at Dow Jones, has proclaimed “The simple truth is Node has  reinvented the way we create websites. Developers build critical functionality in days, not weeks.”    https:  www.joyent.com blog the-node-firm-and-joyent-offer-node-js-training   Kiran Prasad, Director of Mobile Engineering at LinkedIn, has stated “On the server side, our entire  mobile software stack is completely built in Node. One reason was scale. The second is Node showed us  huge performance gains.”  https:  nodejs.org download docs v0.6.7    Node is certainly generating some rather large waves in the development community, especially when   you consider its relatively young age. All that said, however, let’s be clear: the platform is far from perfect.  JavaScript is beautifully expressive and flexible, but it’s also flexible in a way that is easily abused. While  Node-based projects enjoy rapid development cycles and impressive performance gains, they frequently  suffer at the hands of an overall lack of convention both within the language itself and throughout the  development community as a whole. While this problem may not be obvious within small, centralized  development teams, it can quickly rear its head as teams grow in size and distribution—just ask Jeff Harrell,  Director of Engineering at PayPal  www.paypal-engineering.com 2013 11  :  We  especially  liked  the  ubiquity  of  Express,  but  found  it  didn’t  scale  well  in  multiple  development  teams.  Express  is  non-prescriptive  and  allows  you  to  set  up  a  server  in  whatever  way  you  see  fit.  This  is  great  for  flexibility,  but  bad  for  consistency  in  large  teams... Over time we saw patterns emerge as more teams picked up node.js and turned  those into Kraken.js; it’s not a framework in itself, but a convention layer on top of express  that allows it to scale to larger development organizations. We wanted our engineers to  focus on building their applications and not just focus on setting up their environments.  191  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 9   KraKen  This chapter will introduce you to Kraken, a secure and scalable layer for Express-based applications   brought to you by the developers at PayPal. Topics covered within this chapter include  Structured route registration  Environment-aware configuration   	  	 Configuration-based middleware registration  	  	  	  	  Internationalization and localization  Enhanced security techniques  The Dust template engine   Kraken builds on the already firm foundation of express, the minimalist web framework for node      Note  whose apI has become the de facto standard for frameworks in this category. as a result, this chapter assumes  the reader already has a basic, working familiarity with express. portions of this chapter also discuss concepts  covered in this book’s chapters on Grunt, Yeoman, and Knex Bookshelf. If you are unfamiliar with these subjects,  you may wish to read those chapters before you continue.  Environment-Aware Configuration  As applications are developed, tested, staged, and deployed, they naturally progress through a series  of corresponding environments, each requiring its own unique set of configuration rules. For example,  consider Figure 9-1, which illustrates the process by which an application moves through a continuous  integration and delivery deployment pipeline.  Figure 9-1.  Application that requires unique settings based on its environment  As the application in Figure 9-1 progresses through each environment, the settings that tell it how  to connect to the various external services on which it relies must change accordingly. Kraken’s confit  library provides developers with a standard convention for accomplishing this goal by offering a simple,  environment-aware configuration layer for Node applications.  Confit operates by loading a default JSON configuration file  typically named config.json . Confit then   attempts to load an additional configuration file based on the value of the NODE_ENV environment variable.  If an environment-specific configuration file is found, any settings it specifies are recursively merged with  those defined within the default configuration.  192  www.it-ebooks.info   This chapter’s confit-simple project provides a simple application that relies on confit for   determining its configuration. Listing 9-1 demonstrates the process by which confit is initialized, while  Listing 9-2 shows the contents of the project’s  config folder, from which confit is instructed to search for  configuration files.  Chapter 9   KraKen  Listing 9-1.  Initializing confit     confit-simple index.js   var confit = require 'confit' ; var prettyjson = require 'prettyjson' ; var path = require 'path' ; var basedir = path.join __dirname, 'config' ;   confit basedir .create function err, config  {     if  err  {         console.log err ;         process.exit  ;     }     console.log prettyjson.render {         'email': config.get 'email' ,         'cache': config.get 'cache' ,         'database': config.get 'database'      }  ; } ;  Listing 9-2.

In contrast, the default configuration provides connection settings for  a Redis cache server under the nested cache:redis property, while both of the environment-specific  configurations provide overriding information for this property.  Notice also that the default configuration file includes a comment above the email property.   Comments, which are not part of the JSON specification, would normally result in an error being thrown  if we attempted to use Node’s require   method to parse the contents of this file. Confit, however, will  strip out such comments before attempting to parse the file, allowing us to embed comments within our  configuration as needed.  194  www.it-ebooks.info   Listing 9-3 shows the output that is logged to the console when the project is run with the NODE_ENV   environment variable set to development.  Listing 9-3.  Running the confit-simple Project in development Mode  Chapter 9   KraKen  $ export NODE_ENV=development && node index   email:   hostname: email.mydomain.com   username: user   password: pass   from:     My Application   cache:   redis:     hostname: localhost     password: redis database:   postgresql:     hostname: localhost     username: postgres     password: postgres     database: myapp     Note   In Listing 9-3, $ export NODE_ENV=development is run from the terminal to set the value of the  NODE_ENV environment variable. this command applies only to Unix and Unix-like systems  including OS X .  Windows users will instead need to run $ set NODE_ENV=development. It’s also important to remember  that if the NODE_ENV environment variable is not set, confit will assume the application is running in the  development environment.  As you can see in Listing 9-3, confit compiled our project’s configuration object by merging the   contents of the config development.json environment configuration file with the default config config.json   file, giving priority to any settings specified in development.json. As a result, our configuration object  inherited the email settings that only exist in config.json, along with the cache and database settings  defined within the configuration file for the development environment. In Listing 9-1, these settings are  accessed through the use of the configuration object’s get   method.   In addition to accessing top-level configuration settings  e.g., database, as shown in Listing 9-1 ,      Note  our configuration object’s get   method can also be used to access deeply nested configuration settings using:   as a delimiter. For example, we could have referenced the project’s postgresql settings directly with   config.get 'database:postgresql' .  In Listing 9-4, we run the confit-simple project again, only this time we set the NODE_ENV environment   variable with a value of production. As expected, the output shows that our configuration object inherited  the email property from config.json, while also inheriting the cache and database properties from  production.json.  195  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 9   KraKen  Listing 9-4.  Running the confit-simple Project in production Mode  $ export NODE_ENV=production && node index   email:   hostname: email.mydomain.com   username: user   password: pass   from:     My Application   cache:   redis:     hostname: redis.myapp.com     password: redis database:   postgresql:     hostname: db.myapp.com     username: postgres     password: super-secret-password     database: myapp  Shortstop Handlers Confit is designed for processing JSON configuration files, as previous examples have shown. As a  configuration format, JSON is easy to work with, but it can occasionally leave a bit to be desired in terms  of flexibility. Confit helpfully makes up for this shortcoming with support for plugins that it refers to as  “shortstop handlers.” By way of an example, consider Listing 9-5, in which the two shortstop handlers  included within confit’s core library, import and config, are used.  Listing 9-5.  Demonstrating the Use of the import and config Shortstop Handlers     confit-shortstop config config.json   {        The `import` handler allows us to set a property's value to the contents        of the specified JSON configuration file.     "app": "import:. app",        The `config` handler allows us to set a property's value to that of the        referenced property. Note the use of the `.` character as a delimiter,        in this instance.     "something_else": "config:app.base_url" }      confit-shortstop config app.json   {        The title of the application     "title": "My Demo Application",        The base URL at which the web client can be reached     "base_url": "https:  myapp.com",        The base URL at which the API can be reached     "base_api_url": "https:  api.myapp.com" }  196  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 9   KraKen  Listing 9-6 shows the output that is printed to the console when this chapter’s confit-shortstop   project is run. In this example, the import shortstop handler has allowed us to populate the app property  with the contents of a separate JSON file, making it possible for us to break down particularly large  configuration files into smaller and more easily manageable components. The config handler has allowed  us to set a configuration value by referencing a preexisting value in another section.  Listing 9-6.  Output of This Chapter’s confit-shortstop Project  $ node index.js   app:   title:        My Demo Application   base_url:     https:  myapp.com   base_api_url: https:  api.myapp.com something_else: https:  myapp.com  While confit itself only includes support for the two shortstop handlers that we’ve just covered  import   and config , several additional handlers that are quite useful can be found in the shortstop-handlers  module. Let’s take a look at four examples.  The main script  index.js  from this chapter’s confit-shortstop-extras project is shown in   Listing 9-7. This script largely mirrors the one we’ve already seen in Listing 9-1, with a few minor differences.  In this example, additional handlers are imported from the shortstop-handlers module. Also, instead  of instantiating confit by passing the path to our project’s config folder  basedir , we pass an object of  options. Within this object, we continue to specify a value for basedir, but we also pass a protocols object,  providing confit with references to the additional shortstop handlers we’d like to use.  Listing 9-7.  index.js Script from the confit-shortstop-extras Project     confit-shortstop-extras index.js   var confit = require 'confit' ; var handlers = require 'shortstop-handlers' ; var path = require 'path' ; var basedir = path.join __dirname, 'config' ; var prettyjson = require 'prettyjson' ;   confit {     'basedir': basedir,     'protocols': {            The `file` handler allows us to set a property's value to the contents            of an external  non-JSON  file.

Figure 9-2.  Series of Express middleware calls  At each step of this process, the active middleware function has the ability to   	 Modify the incoming request object  	 Modify the outgoing response object  	  	 Close the request-response cycle  	 Call the next middleware function in the series  Execute additional code  By way of an example, consider Listing 9-10, which shows a simple Express application that relies   on three middleware modules: morgan, cookie-parser, and ratelimit-middleware. As this application  processes incoming HTTP requests, the following steps occur:  1.  The morgan module logs the request to the console.  2.  The cookie-parser module parses data from the request’s Cookie header and   assigns it to the request object’s cookies property.  3.  The ratelimit-middleware module rate-limits clients that attempt to access the   application too frequently.  4.  Finally, the appropriate route handler is called.              200  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 9   KraKen  Listing 9-10.  Express Application That Relies on Three Middleware Modules     middleware1 index.js   var express = require 'express' ;    Logs incoming requests var morgan = require 'morgan' ;    Populates `req.cookies` with data parsed from the `Cookie` header var cookieParser = require 'cookie-parser' ;    Configurable API rate-limiter var rateLimit = require 'ratelimit-middleware' ;   var app = express  ; app.use morgan 'combined'  ; app.use cookieParser   ; app.use rateLimit {     'burst': 10,     'rate': 0.5,     'ip': true }  ;   app.get ' animals', function req, res, next  {     res.send ['squirrels', 'aardvarks', 'zebras', 'emus'] ; } ;   app.listen 7000 ;  This approach provides developers with a considerable degree of flexibility, allowing them to execute   their own logic at any point during the request-response cycle. It also allows Express to maintain a relatively  small footprint by delegating responsibility for performing nonessential tasks to third-party middleware  modules. But as flexible as this approach is, it can also prove troublesome to manage as applications and the  teams that develop them grow in size and complexity.  Kraken’s meddleware module simplifies middleware management by providing a configuration-  based middleware registration process for Express applications. In doing so, it provides developers with a  standardized approach for specifying which middleware modules an Express application should rely on,  in what order they should be loaded, and the options that should be passed to each. Listing 9-11 shows an  updated version of the previous example, in which the meddleware module manages the registration of all  middleware functions.  Listing 9-11.  Configuration-based Middleware Registration with the meddleware Module     middleware2 index.js   var express = require 'express' ; var confit = require 'confit' ; var meddleware = require 'meddleware' ; var app = express  ; var path = require 'path' ;    201  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 9   KraKen  confit path.join __dirname, 'config'  .create function err, config  {     app.use meddleware config.get 'middleware'   ;     app.get ' animals', function req, res, next  {         res.send ['squirrels', 'aardvarks', 'zebras', 'emus'] ;     } ;     app.listen 7000 ; } ;      middleware2 config config.json   {     "middleware": {         "morgan": {                Toggles the middleware module on   off             "enabled": true,                Specifies the order in which middleware should be registered             "priority": 10,             "module": {                    The name of an installed module  or path to a module file                  "name": "morgan",                    Arguments to be passed to the module's factory function                 "arguments": ["combined"]             }         },         "cookieParser": {             "enabled": true,             "priority": 20,             "module": {                 "name": "cookie-parser"             }         },         "rateLimit": {             "enabled": true,             "priority": 30,             "module": {                 "name": "ratelimit-middleware",                 "arguments": [{                     "burst": 10,                     "rate": 0.5,                     "ip": true                 }]             }         }     } }  With the help of Kraken’s meddleware module, all aspects of third-party middleware management  within this application have been moved from code to standardized configuration files. The result is an  application that is not only more organized, but also easier to understand and modify.  202  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 9   KraKen  Event Notifications As middleware functions are registered with Express via the meddleware module, corresponding events are  emitted by the application, providing developers with an easy method for determining what middleware  functions are being loaded and in what order  see Listing 9-12 .  Listing 9-12.  Events Are Emitted As Middleware s Registered via the meddleware Module  var express = require 'express' ; var confit = require 'confit' ; var meddleware = require 'meddleware' ; var app = express  ; var path = require 'path' ;   confit path.join __dirname, 'config'  .create function err, config  {          Listening to all middleware registrations     app.on 'middleware:before', function data  {         console.log 'Registering middleware: %s', data.config.name ;     } ;          Listening for a specific middleware registration event     app.on 'middleware:before:cookieParser', function data  {         console.log 'Registering middleware: %s', data.config.name ;     } ;       app.on 'middleware:after', function data  {         console.log 'Registered middleware: %s', data.config.name ;     } ;       app.on 'middleware:after:cookieParser', function data  {         console.log 'Registered middleware: %s', data.config.name ;     } ;       app.use meddleware config.get 'middleware'   ;       app.get ' animals', function req, res, next  {         res.send ['squirrels', 'aardvarks', 'zebras', 'emus'] ;     } ;       app.listen 7000 ;   } ;  Structured Route Registration  In the previous section, you learned how Kraken’s meddleware module can simplify middleware function  registration by moving the logic required for loading and configuring those functions into standardized  JSON configuration files. In much the same way, Kraken’s enrouten module applies the same concept to  bring structure where there often is none to be found—Express routes.  203  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 9   KraKen  Simple Express applications with a small number of routes can often make due with a single module   in which every available route is defined. However, as applications gradually grow in depth and complexity,  such an organizational structure  or lack thereof  can quickly become unwieldy. Enrouten solves this  problem by providing three approaches with which Express routes can be defined in a consistent,  structured fashion.  Index Configuration Using enrouten’s index configuration option, the path to a single module can be specified. This module will  then be loaded and passed an Express Router instance that has been mounted to the root path. This option  provides developers with the simplest method for defining routes, as it does not enforce any specific type of  organizational structure. While this option provides a good starting point for new applications, care must  be taken not to abuse it. This option is often used in combination with enrouten’s directory and routes  configuration options, which we will cover shortly.  Listing 9-13 shows a simple Express application whose routes are configured with the help of confit,  meddleware, and enrouten, along with the accompanying confit configuration file. Listing 9-14 shows the  contents of the module that is passed to enrouten’s index option. Subsequent examples within this section  will build on this example.  Listing 9-13.

When set, enrouten will  recursively scan the contents of the specified folder, searching for modules that export a function accepting  a single argument. For each module it finds, enrouten will pass an Express Router instance that has been  mounted to a path predetermined by that module’s location within the directory structure—a “convention  over configuration” approach.  205  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 9   KraKen  Listing 9-15.

Based on this module’s location within the  routes  folder, the URLs for each route that it defines will be prefixed with  api v1 accounts.  Figure 9-3.

The  api v1 accounts Controller     enrouten-directory routes api v1 accounts index.js   var _ = require 'lodash' ; var path = require 'path' ;   module.exports = function router  {       var accounts = require path.join APPROOT, 'models', 'accounts'  ;        **      * @route  api v1 accounts      *      router.route ' '          .get function req, res, next  {             res.send accounts ;         } ;    206  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 9   KraKen       **      * @route  api v1 accounts :account_id      *      router.route ' :account_id'          .get function req, res, next  {         var account = _.findWhere accounts, {             'id': parseInt req.params.account_id, 10          } ;         if  !account  return next new Error 'Account not found'  ;             res.send account ;         } ;   };  Routes Configuration Enrouten’s directory configuration option provides an approach that favors “convention over  configuration” by automatically determining the structure of an application’s API based on the layout of  a specified folder. This approach provides a quick and easy method for structuring Express routes in an  organized and consistent way. However, complex applications may eventually come to find this approach to  be rather confining.  Applications with APIs that feature a number of complex, deeply nested routes will likely find greater   benefit from enrouten’s routes configuration option, which allows developers to create completely  separate modules for each of the application’s routes. API endpoints, methods, handlers, and route-specific  middleware are then specified within configuration files—an organized approach that allows for the greatest  degree of flexibility, at the expense of being slightly more verbose.  Listing 9-17 shows an excerpt from the configuration file for this chapter’s enrouten-routes project.   Here we pass an array of objects to enrouten’s routes configuration option, the entries of which describe the  various routes to be made available by Express. Note that in addition to specifying a route, HTTP method,  and handler, each entry also has the option of specifying an array of route-specific middleware functions.  As a result, this application is able to apply a middleware function responsible for authorizing incoming  requests on a route-by-route basis. As shown in Listing 9-17, the auth middleware function is not applied to  the route at which users initially sign in, allowing them to sign in before making subsequent requests.  Listing 9-17.

The module exports a single function, which accepts the standard req,  res, next Express route handler signature.  Many popular JavaScript template engines  e.g., Mustache and Handlebars  tout themselves as being  “logic-less”—an attribute that describes their ability to help developers maintain a clear separation of  concerns between an application’s business logic and its presentation layer. When properly maintained, this  separation makes it possible for significant changes to occur within the interface that users are presented  with, while requiring minimal  if any  accompanying changes behind the scenes  and vice versa .  So-called “logic-less” template engines accomplish this goal by enforcing a strict set of rules that   prevents developers from creating what is often referred to as “spaghetti code,” a tangled mess that combines  code with presentation in a way that is hard to grasp and even harder to unravel. Anyone who has ever had  to deal with a PHP script resembling that shown in Listing 9-19 will immediately grasp the importance of  maintaining a layer of separation between these two concerns.  208  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 9   KraKen  Listing 9-19.  Spaghetti Code, an Unmaintainable Mess  <?php   print "   "; $result = mysql_query "SELECT * FROM settings"  or die mysql_error   ; print $result[0]["title"] . "    "; print "   First Name  Last Name    "; $users = mysql_query "SELECT * FROM users"  or die mysql_error   ; while  $row = mysql_fetch_assoc $users   {    print "  " . $row["first_name"] . "  " . $row["last_name"] . "  "; } print "    ";   ?>  Logic-less template engines attempt to prevent developers from creating spaghetti code by banning the  use of logic within an application’s views. Such templates are typically capable of referencing values within a  provided payload of information, iterating through arrays, and toggling specific portions of their content on  and off based on simple boolean logic.  Unfortunately, this rather heavy-handed approach often brings about the very problems it hoped to   prevent, albeit in an unexpected way. Although logic-less template engines such as Handlebars prevent the  use of logic within templates themselves, they do not negate the need for that logic to exist in the first place.  The logic required for preparing data for template use must exist somewhere, and more often than not, the  use of logic-less template engines results in presentation-related logic spilling over into the business layer. Dust, which is the JavaScript template engine favored by Kraken, seeks to solve this problem by taking   an approach that is better thought of as “less-logic” rather than strictly “logic-less.” By allowing developers to  embed slightly more advanced logic within their templates in the form of “helpers,” Dust allows presentation  logic to remain where it belongs, in the presentation layer, rather than the business layer.  Context and References When using Dust templates, two primary components come into play: the template itself and an  optional   object literal containing any data to be referenced from within the template. In Listing 9-20, this process is  demonstrated by an Express application that has specified Dust as its rendering engine. Note the use of the  adaro module in this example. The adaro module serves as a convenient wrapper for Dust, abstracting away  some additional setup that would otherwise be necessary to integrate Dust with Express. It also includes  some convenient helper functions by default that we will be covering later in the chapter.  Listing 9-20.  Express Application Using Dust As Its Rendering Engine     dust-simple index.js   var express = require 'express' ; var adaro = require 'adaro' ; var app = express  ;    **  * By default, Dust will cache the contents of an application's templates as they are  * loaded.

Within this template,  data is referenced by wrapping the desired key within a single pair of curly brackets.

The simplest templates have a single context that references the outermost level  of the JSON object that was passed. For example, consider the template shown in Listing 9-21, in which two  references are used, {report_name} and {misc.total_population}. Dust processes these references by  searching for matching properties  starting at the outermost level  within the object shown in Listing 9-20.  Dust sections provide a convenient method by which additional contexts can be created, allowing  a template to access nested properties without requiring references that start at the outermost level. For  example, consider Listing 9-22, in which a new context, {misc}...{ misc}, is created, allowing nested  properties to be accessed using a shorter syntax.  Listing 9-22.  Creating a New Dust Section     Template  {report_name}  {misc}  Total Population: {total_population}  { misc}      Rendered Output  Information About North America   Total Population: 565000000   Iteration In the previous example, a new Dust section  and corresponding context  was created. As a result, the  contents of the new section received direct access to the properties of the object literal that was referenced.  In much the same way, Dust sections can also be used to iterate through the entries of an array. Listing 9-23  demonstrates this process by creating a new section that references the countries array. Unlike the section  from the previous example, which was applied only once, the {countries} ... { countries} section will  be applied multiple times, once for each entry within the array that it references.  Listing 9-23.  Iterating Through an Array with Sections     Template {countries} {! The current position within the iteration can be referenced at `$idx` !} {! The size of the object through which we are looping can be referenced at `$len` !}        {name}       {population}       {capital.name}       {capital.population}    { countries}      Rendered Output        United States       319999999   212  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 9   KraKen       Washington D.C.       660000           Mexico       118000000       Mexico City       9000000           Canada       35000000       Ottawa       880000        Template       {languages} {.} { languages}        Rendered Output        English       Spanish     Listing 9-24 demonstrates the process by which a template can loop through an array whose entries are   primitive data types  i.e., not objects . For each iteration, the value itself can be directly referenced via the  {.} syntax.  Listing 9-24.  Iterating Through an Array Containing Primitive Data Types  Conditionality Dust provides built-in support for conditionally rendering content, based on whether a simple truth test is  passed. The template shown in Listing 9-25 demonstrates this concept by rendering the text “Yes” or “No”  based on whether each country’s english property references a “truthy” value.  Listing 9-25.  Applying Conditionality Within a Dust Template     Template {countries}        {name}       {?english}Yes{:else}No{ english}      {!         The opposite logic can be applied as shown below:          {^english}No{:else}Yes{ english}      !}    213  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 9   KraKen  { countries}      Rendered Output        United States       Yes           Mexico       No           Canada       Yes      When applying conditionality within a template, it is important to understand the rules that Dust      Note  will apply as it determines the “truthiness” of a property. empty strings, boolean false, empty arrays, null, and  undefined are all considered to be false. the number 0, empty objects, and string-based representations for  “0”, “null”, “undefined”, and “false” are all considered to be true.  Partials One of Dust’s most powerful features, partials, allows developers to include templates within other templates.  As a result, complex documents can be broken down into smaller components  i.e., “partials”  that are easier  to manage and reuse. A simple example that demonstrates this process is shown in Listing 9-26.  Listing 9-26.  Dust Template That References an External Template  i.e., “Partial”      Main Template  {report_name}   Total Population: {misc.total_population}  {>"countries" } {!     In this example, an external template - `countries` - is included by a parent     template which references it by name  using a string literal that is specified     within the template itself . Alternatively, the name of the external template     could have been derived from a value held within the template's context, using     Dust's support for "dynamic" partials. To do so, we would have wrapped the     `countries` string in a pair of curly brackets, as shown here:     {>"{countries}" } !}      "countries" template {countries}        {name}   214  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 9   KraKen       {population}       {capital.name}       {capital.population}    { countries}      Rendered Output  Information About North America   Total Population: 565000000         United States       Yes           Mexico       No           Canada       Yes     Blocks Consider a commonly encountered scenario in which a complex web application consisting of multiple  pages is created. Each of these pages displays a unique set of content, while at the same time sharing  common elements, such as headers and footers, with the other pages. With the help of Dust blocks,  developers can define these shared elements in a single location. Afterward, templates that wish to inherit  from them can, while also retaining the ability to overwrite their content when necessary.  Let’s take a look at an example that should help to clarify this point. Listing 9-27 shows the content   of a Dust template that defines the overall layout of a site. In this instance, a default page title is specified,  {+title}App{ title}, along with an empty placeholder for body content.  Listing 9-27.  Dust Block from Which Other Templates Can Inherit     dust-blocks views shared base.dust                                {+title}App{ title}                {+bodyContent }      215  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 9   KraKen  Listing 9-28 shows the content of a Dust template that inherits from the example presented in Listing 9-27.    It does so by first embedding the parent template within itself as a partial  {>"shared base" } . Next, it  injects content into the {+bodyContent } placeholder that was defined, {<bodyContent}...{ bodyContent}.  In this instance, our template chooses not to overwrite the default page title that was specified in our   parent template.  Filters Dust includes several built-in filters that allow a template to modify a value before it is rendered. By way  of an example, consider the fact that Dust will automatically HTML escape any values referenced within a  template. In other words, if a context were to contain a content key with a value matching that shown here:  While the behavior that we see here is typically desired, it is not uncommon to run into situations in   which this behavior needs to be disabled. This can be accomplished through the use of a filter:  In this example, the s filter disables auto-escaping for the referenced value. Table 9-1 contains a list of   Listing 9-28.  Dust Template Inheriting from a Block      dust-blocks views main.dust   {>"shared base" }   {<bodyContent}      Hello, world!  { bodyContent}   doBadThings  ;   Dust would automatically render this value as  &lt;script&gt;doBadThings  &lt; script&gt;  {contents}  the built-in filters provided by Dust.

In this example, a custom formatTS  filter is created. When applied, this filter will convert a referenced timestamp to a human-readable format   e.g., Jul. 4, 1776 .  Chapter 9   KraKen  Listing 9-29.  Defining a Custom Dust Filter     dust-filters index.js   var express = require 'express' ; var adaro = require 'adaro' ; var app = express  ; var moment = require 'moment' ;   app.engine 'dust', adaro.dust {     'cache': false,     'helpers': [         function dust  {             dust.filters.formatTS = function ts  {                 return moment ts, 'X' .format 'MMM.

In this way,  a Dust context can be thought of as more than a simple payload of raw information, but rather as a view  model, a mediator between an application’s business logic and its views, capable of formatting information  in the most appropriate manner along the way.  This feature is demonstrated by the example shown in Listing 9-30, in which an application presents   the user with a table of servers. Each entry displays a name, along with a message indicating whether  each server is online. A header displays the overall health of the system, which is generated by the  systemStatus   context helper. Note that the template is able to reference our context helper just as it would  any other type of value  e.g., object literals, arrays, numbers, strings .  Listing 9-30.  Dust Context Helper     dust-context-helpers1 index.js  excerpt    app.all ' ', function req, res, next  {     res.render 'main', {         'servers': [             { 'name': 'Web Server', 'online': true },             { 'name': 'Database Server', 'online': true },             { 'name': 'Email Server', 'online': false }         ],         'systemStatus': function chunk, context, bodies, params  {             var offlineServers = _.filter this.servers, { 'online': false } ;             return offlineServers.length ? 'Bad' : 'Good';         }     } ; } ;      dust-context-helpers1 views main.dust  excerpt     System Status: {systemStatus}           Server  Online                  {servers}                                {name}                   {?online}Yes{:else}No{ online}                        { servers}          As shown in this example, every Dust context helper receives four arguments: chunk, context, bodies,   and params. Let’s take a look at a few examples that demonstrate their usage.  218  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 9   KraKen  chunk A context helper’s chunk argument provides it with access to the current portion of the template being  rendered—referred to by Dust as a “chunk.” By way of an example, consider Listing 9-31, in which a  context helper is paired with default content that is defined within the template. In this example, the  systemStatus   context helper can choose to override the chunk’s default content, “Unknown,” with its own  value by calling the chunk.write   method. The helper can indicate that it has chosen to do so by returning  chunk as its value.  Listing 9-31.  Dust Context Helper Paired with Default Content     dust-context-helpers2 index.js  excerpt    app.all ' ', function req, res, next  {     res.render 'main', {         'servers': [             { 'name': 'Web Server', 'online': true },             { 'name': 'Database Server', 'online': true },             { 'name': 'Email Server', 'online': false }         ],         'systemStatus': function chunk, context, bodies, params  {             if  !this.servers.length  return;             if  _.filter this.servers, { 'online': false } .length  {                 return chunk.write 'Bad' ;             } else {                 return chunk.write 'Good' ;             }         }     } ; } ;      dust-context-helpers2 views main.dust  excerpt     System Status: {systemStatus}Unknown{ systemStatus}   context The context argument provides context helpers with convenient access to the active section of the context,  as determined by the template. The template shown in Listing 9-32 demonstrates this by referencing the  isOnline   context helper once for every server it has been passed. Each time, the isOnline   helper  fetches the value of the active section’s online property via context.get  .  Listing 9-32.

Instead of forcing developers to concatenate strings in an unwieldy fashion, Dust allows such  content to remain where it belongs—in the template—available as options from which a context helper can  choose to render.  Listing 9-33 demonstrates this by passing four different bodies of content to the description   context  helper. The helper’s bodies argument provides it with references to this content, which it can then choose to  render by passing the appropriate value to chunk.render  .  Listing 9-33.

The example shown in Listing 9-34  demonstrates this by passing each server’s uptime property to the formatUptime   context helper. In this  example, the helper converts the provided value, params.value, into a more easily readable form before  writing it out to the chunk.  Listing 9-34.

In this example, the parseLocation   helper receives a string in which context properties are referenced:  value="{name} lives in {location}". In order for these references to be correctly interpreted, the  parameter must first be evaluated with the help of Dust’s helpers.tap   method.  222  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 9   KraKen  Listing 9-35.

They allow a context object to serve as  a view model—an intelligent bridge between an application’s business logic and its user interface, capable  of fetching information and formatting it appropriately for a specific use case before passing it along to one  or more views for rendering. But as useful as this is, we’ve really only begun to scratch the surface in terms of  how these helper functions can be applied to powerful effect.  In addition to returning data directly, Dust helper functions are also capable of returning data   asynchronously, a process that is demonstrated by the example shown in Listing 9-36. Here we create two  context helpers, cars   and trucks  . The former returns an array, while the latter returns a promise that  resolves to an array. From the template’s perspective, both of these functions are consumed identically.  223  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 9   KraKen  Listing 9-36.  Helper Functions Can Return Promises     dust-promise1 index.js  excerpt    app.get ' ', function req, res, next  {     res.render 'main', {         'cars': function chunk, context, bodies, params  {             return ['Nissan Maxima', 'Toyota Corolla', 'Volkswagen Jetta'];         },         'trucks': function chunk, context, bodies, params  {             return new Promise function resolve, reject  {                 resolve ['Chevrolet Colorado', 'GMC Canyon', 'Toyota Tacoma'] ;             } ;         }     } ; } ;      dust-promise1 views main.dust  excerpt     Cars   {cars} {.} { cars}   Trucks   {trucks} {.} { trucks}   Dust also provides a convenient method for conditionally displaying content, in the event that a   promise is rejected. This process is demonstrated by Listing 9-37.  Listing 9-37.  Handling Rejected Promises     dust-promise2 index.js  excerpt    app.get ' ', function req, res, next  {     res.render 'main', {         'cars': function chunk, context, bodies, params  {             return ['Nissan Maxima', 'Toyota Corolla', 'Volkswagen Jetta'];         },         'trucks': function chunk, context, bodies, params  {             return new Promise function resolve, reject  {                 reject 'Unable to fetch trucks.' ;             } ;         }     } ; } ;      dust-promise2 views main.dust  excerpt     Cars   {cars} {.} { cars}   Trucks   {trucks}      {.}      {:error}     An error occurred. We were unable to get a list of trucks. { trucks}   224  www.it-ebooks.info   Having the ability to feed information to a template in the form of promises is useful for a number  of reasons, but things begin to get much more interesting when this functionality is paired with Dust’s  streaming interface. To better understand this, consider Listing 9-38, which largely mirrors our previous  example. In this instance, however, we take advantage of Dust’s streaming interface to push portions of our  template down to the client as they are rendered, rather than waiting for the entire process to complete.  Chapter 9   KraKen  Listing 9-38.  Streaming a Template to the Client As Data Becomes Available     dust-promise2 index.js   var Promise = require 'bluebird' ; var express = require 'express' ; var adaro = require 'adaro' ; var app = express  ; var engine = adaro.dust  ; var dust = engine.dust; app.engine 'dust', engine ; app.set 'view engine', 'dust' ; app.use ' ', express.static '. public'  ;   app.get ' ', function req, res, next  {     dust.stream 'views main', {         'cars': ['Nissan Maxima', 'Toyota Corolla', 'Volkswagen Jetta'],         'trucks': function chunk, context, bodies, params  {             return new Promise function resolve, reject  {                 setTimeout function   {                     resolve ['Chevrolet Colorado', 'GMC Canyon', 'Toyota Tacoma'] ;                 }, 4000 ;             } ;         }     } .pipe res ; } ;   app.listen 8000 ;  Depending on the complexity of the template in question, the impact this approach can have on user   experience can often be dramatic. Rather than forcing users to wait for an entire page to load before they can  proceed, this approach allows us to push content down to the client as it becomes available. As a result, the  delay that users perceive when accessing an application can often be reduced significantly.  Dust Helpers In the previous section, we explored how context objects can be extended to include logic that is relevant to  a specific view through the use of context helpers. In a similar manner, Dust allows helper functions to be  defined at a global level, making them available to all templates without being explicitly defined within their  contexts. Dust comes packaged with a number of such helpers. By taking advantage of them, developers can  more easily solve many of the challenges that are often encountered when working with stricter, logic-less  template solutions.  225  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 9   KraKen  examples.  Listing 9-39 shows an excerpt of the JSON data that will be referenced by the rest of this section’s   Listing 9-39.  Excerpt of the JSON Data Passed to a Dust Template     dust-logic1 people.json  excerpt    [{     "name": "Joe", "location": "Chicago", "age": 27,     "education": "high_school", "employed": false, "job_title": null }, {     "name": "Mary", "location": "Denver", "age": 35,     "education": "college", "employed": true, "job_title": "Chef" }]  Logic Helpers Listing 9-40 demonstrates the usage of a Dust logic helper, @eq, with which we can perform a strict  comparison between two specified values, key and value. In this example, the first value, job_title,  references a property within the current context. The second value, "Chef", is defined as a literal value from  within the template.  Listing 9-40.  Using a Dust Logic Helper to Conditionally Display Content     dust-logic1 views main.dust  excerpt    {people}     {@eq key=job_title value="Chef"}          {name} is a chef. This person definitely knows how to cook.          {:else}          {name} is not a chef. This person may or may not know how to cook.      { eq} { people}  Knowing this, imagine a scenario in which we want to perform a strict equality check between two   numbers, one of which is referenced as a context property, while the other is specified as a literal from within  the template. In order to do so, we must cast our literal value to the appropriate type, as shown in Listing 9-41.  Listing 9-41.  Casting a Literal Value to the Desired Type  {people}     {@eq key=age value="27" type="number"}          {name} is 27 years old.      { eq} { people}  Dust provides a number of logic helpers with which simple comparisons can be made. Their names and   descriptions are listed in Table 9-2.  226  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 9   KraKen  Table 9-2.  Logic Helpers Provided by Dust  Logic Helper  Description  @eq  @ne  @gt  @lt  @gte  @lte  Strictly equal to Not strictly equal to Greater than Less than Greater than or equal to  Less than or equal to  Switch Statements The frequently used @select helper provides a method by which we can mimic switch  ...  statements,  making it possible for a template to specify multiple variations of content based on a specified value  see  Listing 9-42 .  Listing 9-42.  Mimicking a switch Statement with the @select Helper  {@gte key=age value=retirement_age}      {name} has reached retirement age.      {:else}                   {@select key=job_title}             {@eq value="Chef"}Probably went to culinary school, too.{ eq}             {@eq value="Professor"}Smarty pants.{ eq}             {@eq value="Accountant"}Good with numbers.{ eq}             {@eq value="Astronaut"}Not afraid of heights.{ eq}             {@eq value="Pilot"}Travels frequently.{ eq}             {@eq value="Stunt Double"}Fearless.{ eq}             {! @none serves as a `default` case !}             {@none}Not sure what I think.{ none}         { select}           { gte}  Iteration Helpers Dust provides three useful helpers for tackling problems that are frequently encountered when dealing  with iteration. For example, Listing 9-43 demonstrates the use of the @sep helper, with which we can define  content that will be rendered for every iteration except the last.  Listing 9-43.  Ignoring Content During a Loop’s Last Iteration with @sep     dust-logic1 views main.dust  excerpt  {people}{name}{@sep}, { sep}{ people}      output Joe, Mary, Wilson, Steve, Laura, Tim, Katie, Craig, Ryan  227  www.it-ebooks.info   Dust provides a total of three helpers for tackling iteration challenges. These are listed in Table 9-3.  Chapter 9   KraKen  Table 9-3.  Iteration Helpers  Iteration Helper  Description  @sep  @first  @last  Renders content for every iteration, except the last Renders content only for the first iteration  Renders content only for the last iteration  Mathematical Expressions Using Dust’s @math helper, templates can adjust their content based on the result of a mathematical  expression. Such adjustments can take place in one of two ways. The first is demonstrated in Listing 9-44,  in which the result of a mathematical expression is referenced directly within a template. The second is  demonstrated in Listing 9-45, in which content is conditionally rendered based on the result of a call to the   @math helper.  Listing 9-44.  Directly Referencing the Result of a Mathematical Expression     dust-logic1 views main.dust  excerpt    {people}     {@lt key=age value=retirement_age}          {name} will have reached retirement age in         {@math key=retirement_age method="subtract" operand=age  } year s .      { lt} { people}  Listing 9-45.  Conditionally Rendering Content Based on the Result of a Call to the @math Helper     dust-logic1 views main.dust  excerpt    {people}     {@lt key=age value=retirement_age}         {@math key=retirement_age method="subtract" operand=age}             {@lte value=10}{name} will reach retirement age fairly soon.{ lte}             {@lte value=20}{name} has quite a ways to go before they can retire.{ lte}             {@default}{name} shouldn't even think about retiring.{ default}         { math}     { lt} { people}  The various “methods” supported by Dust’s @math helper include: add, subtract, multiply, divide,   mod, abs, floor, and ceil.  228  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 9   KraKen  Context Dump Useful during development, Dust’s @contextDump helper allows you to quickly render the current context  object  in JSON format , providing insight into the values Dust sees within the section in which it is called.  An example of its usage is shown here:  {people} {@contextDump  } { people}  Custom Helpers Earlier in the chapter, you learned how to create context helpers with which context objects can be extended  to include custom functionality. In the same way, custom Dust helpers can also be created at the global level.  Listing 9-46 provides a demonstration of how this can be applied.  Listing 9-46.  Creating and Using a Custom Dust Helper     dust-logic1 index.js  excerpt    dust.helpers.inRange = function chunk, context, bodies, params  {     if  params.key >= params.lower && params.key <= params.upper  {         return chunk.render bodies.block, context ;     } else {         return chunk;     } }      dust-logic1 views main.dust  excerpt    {people}     {@gte key=age value=20}         {@lte key=age value=29} This person is in their 20's. { lte}     { gte}     {@inRange key=age lower=20 upper=29} This person is in their 20's. { inRange} { people}  In this example’s template, a loop is created in which we iterate through each person defined within   the context. For each person, a message is displayed if they happen to fall within the twenty-something age  bracket. First, this message is displayed using a combination of preexisting logic helpers, @gte and @lt. Next,  the message is displayed again, using a custom @inRange helper that has been defined at the global level.  Now that you are familiar with many of the fundamental components that Kraken relies on, let’s move   forward with creating our first real Kraken application.  229  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 9   KraKen  Let’s Get Kraken In this book’s first section on development tools, we covered four useful utilities that help manage many  of the tasks associated with web development - among them: Bower, Grunt, and Yeoman. Kraken relies on  each of these tools, along with a Yeoman generator that will assist us in building out the initial structure of  our project. If you have not already done so, you should install these modules globally via npm, as shown  here:  $ npm install -g yo generator-kraken bower grunt-cli  Creating a new Kraken project with Yeoman is an interactive process. In this example, we pass the   generator a name for our new project  app , at which point it begins to prompt us with questions. Figure 9-4  shows the steps that were taken to create this chapter’s app project.  Figure 9-4.  Creating a Kraken application using the Yeoman generator  Once you have answered these questions, the generator will create the project’s initial file structure and   begin installing the necessary dependencies. Afterward, you should find a new app folder containing the  contents of the project, which should resemble that shown in Figure 9-5.  230  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 9   KraKen  Figure 9-5.  Initial file structure for the app project  Kraken’s Yeoman generator has automated the process of creating a new Express application that is   organized using modules that were previously covered in this chapter. We can immediately launch the  project in its current state as shown in Listing 9-47. Afterward, the project can be accessed at a local address   see Figure 9-6 .  Listing 9-47.  Launching the Project for the First Time  $ npm start   > app@0.1.0 start  Users tim temp app > node server.js   Server listening on http:  localhost:8000 Application ready to serve requests. Environment: development  231  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 9   KraKen  Figure 9-6.  Viewing the Project in the Browser for the First Time  As you can see, our project has been preconfigured  with the help of confit and meddleware  to use a   number of helpful middleware modules  e.g., cookieParser, session, etc. . For some additional insight into  how all of this comes together, Listing 9-48 shows the contents of the project’s index.js script.  Listing 9-48.  Contents of Our New Project’s index.js Script     app index.js   var express = require 'express' ; var kraken = require 'kraken-js' ;   var options, app;    *  * Create and configure application. Also exports application instance for use by tests.  * See https:  github.com krakenjs kraken-jsoptions for additional configuration options.  *  options = {     onconfig: function  config, next  {          *          * Add any additional config setup or overrides here. `config` is an initialized          * `confit`  https:  github.com krakenjs confit   configuration object.          *          next null, config ;     } };   app = module.exports = express  ;   app.use kraken options  ; app.on 'start', function    {     console.log 'Application ready to serve requests.' ;     console.log 'Environment: %s', app.kraken.get 'env:env'  ; } ;  The kraken-js module, which we see here, is nothing more than a standard Express middleware library.  However, instead of simply augmenting Express with some small bit of additional functionality, Kraken takes  responsibility for configuring a complete Express application. It will do so with the help of many other modules,  including those that have already been covered in this chapter: confit, meddleware, enrouten, and adaro.  232  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 9   KraKen  As shown in Listing 9-48, Kraken is passed a configuration object containing an onconfig   callback  function, which will be called after Kraken has taken care of initializing confit for us. Here we can provide  any last-minute overrides that we may not want to define directly within the project’s JSON configuration  files. In this example, no such overrides are made.  Controllers, Models, and Tests In this chapter’s “Structured Route Organization” section, we discovered how enrouten can help bring  order to the often haphazard manner in which Express routes are defined. By default, a new Kraken project  is set up to use enrouten’s directory configuration option, allowing it to recursively scan the contents of a  specified folder, searching for modules that export a function accepting a single argument  i.e., router . For  each module it finds  referred to as a “controller” , enrouten will pass an Express Router instance that has  been mounted to a path predetermined by that module’s location within the directory structure. We can see  this process in action by looking at the default controller that Kraken has created for our project, shown in  Listing 9-49.  Listing 9-49.  Our Project’s Default Controller     app controllers index.js   var IndexModel = require '.. models index' ;   module.exports = function  router  {       var model = new IndexModel  ;        **      * The default route served for us when we access the app at: http:  localhost:8000      *      router.get ' ', function  req, res  {         res.render 'index', model ;     } ;   };  In addition to creating a default controller for our project, Kraken has also taken care of creating a   corresponding model, IndexModel, which you can see referenced in Listing 9-49. We will discuss Kraken’s  relationship with models shortly, but first, let’s walk through the process of creating a new controller of  our own.  Chapter 3, which covered Yeoman, demonstrated that generators have the ability to provide   subcommands capable of providing developers with functionality whose usefulness extends well beyond the  initial creation of a project. Kraken’s Yeoman generator takes advantage of this by providing a controller  subcommand, with which new controllers can quickly be created. By way of an example, let’s create a new  controller that will be responsible for managing a collection of RSS feeds:  $ yo kraken:controller feeds  233  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 9   KraKen  automatically created for us:  After specifying our desired path, feeds, to the generator’s controller subcommand, five new files are   controllers feeds.js: Controller  models feeds.js: Model  test feeds.js: Test suite   	  	  	  	  	  public templates feeds.dust: Dust template  locales US en feeds.properties: Internationalization settings  For the moment, let’s place our focus on the first three files listed here, starting with the model. We’ll   take a look at the accompanying Dust template and internalization settings file in the next section.  The Model Listing 9-50 shows the initial state of our project’s new feeds model. If you were expecting something  sophisticated, you will likely be disappointed. As you can see, this file serves as little more than a generic  stub that we are expected to replace with our own persistence layer.  Listing 9-50.  Initial Contents of the feeds Model     models feeds.js   module.exports = function FeedsModel   {     return {         name: 'feeds'     }; };  Unlike many other “full-stack” frameworks that attempt to provide developers with tools that address  every conceivable need  including data persistence , Kraken takes a minimalistic approach that does not  attempt to reinvent the wheel. This approach recognizes that developers already have access to a wide  variety of well-supported libraries for managing data persistence, two of which are covered by this book:  Knex Bookshelf and Mongoose.  By way of an example, let’s update this module so that it exports a Bookshelf model capable of fetching   and storing information within a feeds table stored in a SQLite database. Listing 9-51 shows the updated  contents of the feeds model.  Listing 9-51.  Updated feeds Model That Uses Knex Bookshelf     models feeds.js   var bookshelf = require '.. lib bookshelf' ; var Promise = require 'bluebird' ; var feedRead = require 'feed-read' ;   var Feed = bookshelf.Model.extend {     'tableName': 'feeds',     'getArticles': function   {  234  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 9   KraKen          var self = this;         return Promise.fromNode function callback  {             feedRead self.get 'url' , callback ;         } ;     } } ;   module.exports = Feed;   the updated model shown in Listing 9-51 assumes that you already familiar with the Knex and      Note  Bookshelf libraries, along with the steps necessary to configure them. If that is not the case, you may want to  read Chapter 12. regardless, this chapter’s app project provides a fully functioning demonstration of the code  shown here.  The Controller Listing 9-52 shows the initial contents of our project’s new feeds controller. As with the original controller  that accompanied our project, this controller references a corresponding model that Kraken has  conveniently created for us, which we have already seen.  Listing 9-52.  Initial Contents of the feeds Controller     controllers feeds.js   var FeedsModel = require '.. models feeds' ;    **  * @url http:  localhost:8000 feeds  *  module.exports = function  router  {     var model = new FeedsModel  ;     router.get ' ', function  req, res  {     } ; };  In its default state, the feeds controller accomplishes very little. Let’s update this controller to include   a few additional routes that will allow clients to interact with our application’s Feed model. The updated  version of the feeds controller is shown in Listing 9-53.  Listing 9-53.  Updated feeds Controller  var Feed = require '.. models feeds' ;   module.exports = function router  {       router.param 'feed_id', function req, res, next, id  {         Feed.where {             'id': id         } .fetch {  235  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 9   KraKen              'require': true         } .then function feed  {             req.feed = feed;             next  ;         } .catch next ;     } ;        **      * @url http:  localhost:8000 feeds      *      router.route ' '          .get function req, res, next  {             return Feed.where {}                  .fetchAll                   .then function feeds  {                     if  req.accepts 'html'   {                         return res.render 'feeds', {                             'feeds': feeds.toJSON                           } ;                     } else if  req.accepts 'json'   {                         return res.send feeds ;                     } else {                         throw new Error 'Unknown `Accept` value: ' + req.headers.accept ;                     }                   }                  .catch next ;         } ;        **      * @url http:  localhost:8000 feeds :feed_id      *      router.route ' :feed_id'          .get function req, res, next  {             res.send req.feed ;         } ;        **      * @url http:  localhost:8000 feeds :feed_id articles      *      router.route ' :feed_id articles'          .get function req, res, next  {             req.feed.getArticles                   .then function articles  {                     res.send articles ;                 }                  .catch next ;         } ;   };  236  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 9   KraKen  With these updates in place, clients now have the ability to  List feeds   	  	  	  Fetch information regarding a specific feed  Fetch articles from a specific feed  In the next section, we will take a look at the test suite that Kraken has created for this portion of our   application. With this test suite, we can verify that the routes we have defined work as expected.  The Test Suite Listing 9-54 shows the initial contents of the test suite that Kraken has created for our new controller. Here  we see a single test, which is defined with the help of SuperTest, which is an extension of SuperAgent, a  simple library for making HTTP requests.  Listing 9-54.  Test Suite for the feeds Controller     test feeds.js   var kraken = require 'kraken-js' ; var express = require 'express' ; var request = require 'supertest' ;   describe ' feeds', function   {       var app, mock;       beforeEach function done  {         app = express  ;         app.on 'start', done ;         app.use kraken {             'basedir': process.cwd           }  ;         mock = app.listen 1337 ;     } ;       afterEach function  done  {         mock.close done ;     } ;       it 'should say "hello"', function done  {         request mock              .get ' feeds'              .expect 200              .expect 'Content-Type',  html               .expect  "name": "index"               .end function  err, res  {                 done err ;             } ;     } ;   } ;  237  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 9   KraKen  assertions are made:  In this example, a GET request is made to our application’s  feeds endpoint, and the following    	  	  	  The server should respond with an HTTP status code of 200.  The server should respond with a Content-Type header containing the string html.  The body of the response should contain the string "name": "index".  Given the recent updates that we have made to our new controller, these assertions no longer apply.   Let’s replace them with a few tests that are relevant. Listing 9-55 shows the updated contents of the test suite.  Listing 9-55.  Updated Contents of the feeds Test Suite     test feeds index.js   var assert = require 'assert' ; var kraken = require 'kraken-js' ; var express = require 'express' ; var request = require 'supertest' ;   describe ' feeds', function   {       var app, mock;       beforeEach function done  {         app = express  ;         app.on 'start', done ;         app.use kraken {'basedir': process.cwd  }  ;         mock = app.listen 1337 ;     } ;       afterEach function done  {         mock.close done ;     } ;       it 'should return a collection of feeds', function done  {         request mock              .get ' feeds'              .expect 'Content-Type',  json               .expect 200              .end function err, res  {                 if  err  return done err ;                 assert res.body instanceof Array, 'Expected an array' ;                 done  ;             } ;     } ;    238  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 9   KraKen      it 'should return a single feed', function done  {         request mock              .get ' feeds 1'              .expect 'Content-Type',  json               .expect 200              .end function err, res  {                 if  err  return done err ;                 assert.equal typeof res.body.id, 'number',                       'Expected a numeric `id` property' ;                 done  ;             } ;     } ;       it 'should return articles for a specific feed', function done  {         request mock              .get ' feeds 1 articles'              .expect 'Content-Type',  json               .expect 200              .end function err, res  {                 if  err  return done err ;                 assert res.body instanceof Array, 'Expected an array' ;                 done  ;             } ;     } ;   } ;  Our updated test suite now contains three tests designed to verify that each of our new controller’s   routes are functioning correctly. Consider the first test, for instance, which will make a GET request to our  application’s  feeds endpoint and make the following assertions:   	  	  	  The server should respond with an HTTP status code of 200.  The server should respond with a Content-Type header containing the string json.  The server should return one or more results in the form of an array.   recall that our application’s Feed model was created with the help of the Knex and       Note  Bookshelf libraries. the data that you see referenced in this project originates from a Knex “seed” file    seeds developments 00-feeds.js  with which we can populate our database with sample data. at any   point, this project’s SQLite database can be reset to its initial state by running $ grunt reset-db from the  command line. If these concepts are unfamiliar to you, you may want to read Chapter 12.  239  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 9   KraKen  Figure 9-7 shows the output that is printed to the console when our project’s test Grunt task is called.  Figure 9-7.  Running the test suite  Internationalization and Localization Kraken provides built-in support for creating applications that are capable of adapting themselves to meet  the unique needs of multiple languages and regions, an important requirement for most products that hope  to see widespread use across multiple, diverse markets. In this section we’ll take a look at the two steps by  which this is accomplished, internationalization and localization, and how they can be applied within the  context of a Kraken application whose templates are generated on the server.  Internationalization  frequently shortened to i18n  refers to the act of developing applications that  are capable of supporting multiple regions and dialects. In practice, this is accomplished by avoiding the  direct use of locale-specific words, phrases, and symbols  e.g., currency symbols  within an application’s  templates. Placeholders are instead used, which are later populated at the moment a template is requested,  based on the location or settings of the user who is making the request. By way of an example, consider  the Dust template that is shown in Listing 9-56, which is responsible for rendering the home page of this  chapter’s app project.  Listing 9-56.  Dust Template for the Home Page of app Project     app public templates index.dust   {>"layouts master"  }   {<body}                                {@pre type="content" key="greeting"  }                        240  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 9   KraKen                                                       {@pre type="content" key="email_address"  }                                                                                 {@pre type="content" key="password"  }                                                                                {@pre type="content" key="submit"  }                                                     { body}  The basic semantics at work here should be familiar, based on material that was previously covered in   this chapter’s section on Dust. As you can see, instead of directly embedding content, this template relies  on a special Dust helper provided by Kraken, @pre, with which we can reference content that is stored in  separate, locale-specific content files. The corresponding content files for this particular template are shown  in Listing 9-57.  Listing 9-57.  Corresponding Content Files for the Dust Template Shown in Listing 9-56     app locales US en index.properties  Comments are supported greeting=Welcome to Feed Reader submit=Submit email_address=Email Address password=Password      app locales ES es index.properties greeting=Bienvenida al Feed Reader submit=Presentar email_address=Correo Electrónico password=Contraseña   take note of the location of this example’s template, public templates index.dust, and the      Note  location of its corresponding content property files, locales US en index.properties and locales ES es  index.properties. Kraken is configured to pair Dust templates with content property files such as these on a  one-to-one basis, by matching them based on their paths and filenames.  241  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 9   KraKen  In contrast to internationalization  i18n , which is primarily concerned with the creation of applications   that are capable of supporting the injection of localized content, localization  l10n  refers to the process  by which locale- and dialect-specific content files, such as those shown in this example, are created. The  controller shown in Listing 9-58 demonstrates how Kraken helps developers brings these concepts together  to provide users with content that is tailored to meet their specific needs.  Listing 9-58.  Serving a Locale-Specific Version of the Home Page     app controllers index.js   module.exports = function  router  {        **      * The default route served for us when we access the app      * at http:  localhost:8000      *      router.get ' ', function  req, res  {         res.locals.context = { 'locality': { 'language': 'es', 'country': 'ES' } };         res.render 'index' ;     } ;   };  This example is an updated version of the controller that we originally saw in Listing 9-49, which is  responsible for rendering our application’s home page. Here we specify the country and language to be  used for locating content files by assigning them to the locals.context property of the incoming Express  response object. If no such value is specified, Kraken’s default behavior is to use US English. The English and  Spanish versions of the rendered template are shown in Figure 9-8 and Figure 9-9, respectively.  Figure 9-8.  English version of the application’s home page  242  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 9   KraKen  Figure 9-9.  Spanish version of the application’s home page  Detecting Locality The example shown in Listing 9-58 demonstrates the process by which specific regional settings can be  manually assigned to an incoming request. What it does not demonstrate, however, is the process by which a  user’s desired localization settings can be automatically detected.  Listing 9-59 demonstrates a simple method for determining locality based on the value of the accept-  language HTTP request header. In this example, we have removed the logic for determining a user’s locality  from our route and placed it in a more appropriate location - a middleware function that will be called for  every incoming request.  Listing 9-59.  Detecting Locality Based on the Value of the accept-language HTTP Request Header     app lib middleware locale.js   var acceptLanguage = require 'accept-language' ;    **  * Express middleware function that automatically determines locality based on the value  * of the `accept-language` header.  *  module.exports = function   {       return function req, res, next  {         var locale = acceptLanguage.parse req.headers['accept-language'] ;         res.locals.context = {             'locality': { 'language': locale[0].language, 'country': locale[0].region }         };         next  ;     };   };    243  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 9   KraKen     app config config.json  excerpt    "middleware":{     "locale": {         "module": {          "name": "path:. lib middleware locale"         },         "enabled": true     } }   While helpful, the accept-language http request header does not always reflect the desired      Note  localization settings of the user making the request. always be sure to provide users with a method for manually  specifying such settings on their own  e.g., as part of a “Settings” page .  Security Given Kraken’s origins at PayPal, a worldwide online payments processor, it should come as no surprise  that the framework focuses heavily on security. Kraken does so with the help of Lusca, a library that extends  Express with a number of enhanced security techniques, as suggested by the Open Web Application Security  Project  OWASP . These extensions are provided in the form of multiple, independently configurable  middleware modules. In this section, we will briefly examine two ways in which Kraken can help secure  Express against commonly encountered attacks.   this material should by no means be considered exhaustive. It is merely intended to serve as a      Note  starting point for implementing security within the context of a Kraken express application. readers with a hand  in implementing security on the Web are highly encouraged to delve further into this topic by reading a few of  the many great books that are devoted entirely to this subject.  Defending Against Cross-Site Request Forgery Attacks To understand the basic premise behind cross-site request forgery  CSRF  attacks, it is important  to understand the method by which most web applications authenticate their users: cookie-based  authentication. This process is illustrated in Figure 9-10.  244  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 9   KraKen  Figure 9-10.  Cookie-based authentication  In a typical scenario, a user will submit their credentials to a web application, which will then compare  them with those it has on file. Assuming the credentials are valid, the server will then create a new session— essentially, a record representing the user’s successful sign-in attempt. A unique identifier belonging to  this session is then transmitted to the user in the form of a cookie, which is automatically stored by the  user’s browser. Subsequent requests to the application made by the browser will automatically attach the  information stored in this cookie, allowing the application to look up the matching session record. As a  result, the application has the ability to verify the user’s identity without requiring the user to resubmit their  username and password along with every request.  A CSRF attack takes advantage of the trusted relationship  i.e., session  that exists between an  application and a user’s browser, by tricking that user into submitting an unintended request to the  application. Let’s take a look at an example that should help explain how this works. Figure 9-11 illustrates  the process by which a user signs into a trusted application—in this case, the csrf-server project that is  included with this chapter’s source code.  Figure 9-11.  Signing into a trusted application  245  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 9   KraKen  Figure 9-12 shows the welcome screen that the user is presented with after successfully signing into   the application. Here we see some basic information about the user, including their name and when their  account was created.  Figure 9-12.  Successful sign-in attempt  At this point, imagine a scenario in which the user leaves the application  without signing out  and visits  another site, which, unbeknownst to the user, has malicious intent  see Figure 9-13 . A copy of this malicious  site can be found in this chapter’s csrf-attack project. In this example, the malicious site lures the user into  clicking a button with the tempting promise of free candy and butterflies.  Figure 9-13.  Malicious web site attempting to convince the user to click a button  Listing 9-60 shows an excerpt from the HTML for this malicious site, which should help explain what is  going to happen when the user clicks this button. As you can see, clicking the button will trigger the creation  of a POST request to the original application’s  transfer-funds route.  246  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 9   KraKen  Listing 9-60.  Malicious Web Form     csrf-attack views index.dust  excerpt                    Click Here for Free Candy and Butterflies          After clicking the button, instead of receiving the free candy and butterflies that they were promised, the   user is greeted with a message indicating that all of the funds have been transferred out of their account, as  shown in Figure 9-14.  Figure 9-14.  Successful CSRF attack  Several different steps can be taken to defend against attacks of this nature. The method by which   Kraken defends against them is referred to as the “synchronizer token pattern.” In this approach, a random  string is generated for each incoming request, which the client can subsequently access as part of a  template’s context or via a response header. Importantly, this string is not stored as a cookie. The next  POST, PUT, PATCH, or DELETE request made by the client must include this string, which the server will  then compare with the one it previously generated. The request will only be allowed to proceed if a match  is made.  Let’s take a look at how this works in practice. Figure 9-15 shows the sign-in page for this chapter’s app   project. Refer back to Listing 9-56 to see the underlying HTML for this page.  247  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 9   KraKen  Figure 9-15.  Sign-in page for this chapter’s app project  In its current state, any attempt to sign-in using this form will result in the error shown in Figure 9-16.   Here we see an error message from Kraken warning us of a missing “CSRF token.”  Figure 9-16.  Kraken’s “CSRF token missing” Error  This error can be resolved with the addition of a single, hidden input to our application’s login form.   Listing 9-61 shows an excerpt from our application’s updated Dust template, along with an excerpt from the  rendered output.  248  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 9   KraKen  Listing 9-61.  Inserting a Hidden _csrf Field into the Sign-In Form     app public templates index.dust  excerpt                         Rendered output                    Here we create a hidden input with the name _csrf, the value for which Lusca has automatically   passed to our template’s context under a property with the same name. The value that we see rendered in  this example, OERRGi9AGNPEYnNWj8skkfL9f0JIWJp3uKK8g=, is a random hash that Lusca has generated for  us  i.e., the “synchronizer token” . When we submit this form, Lusca will verify that this value matches the  one it previously gave us. If they match, the request is allowed to proceed. Otherwise, an error is thrown.  This approach allows applications to defend against CSRF attacks by requiring additional, identifying  information that is not stored as part of a cookie, making it much more difficult for attackers to trick users  into performing unintended actions.  Configuring Content Security Policy Headers Lusca provides developers with a convenient mechanism for configuring an application’s Content Security  Policy  CSP . These rules provide instructions to supporting browsers regarding the locations from which  various resources  e.g., scripts, stylesheets, images, etc.  can be loaded. When defined, these rules are  conveyed to browsers in the form of the Content-Security-Policy response header.  By way of an example, see Listing 9-62, in which Lusca’s csp middleware module is provided with a   configuration object specifying that only images may be loaded from any domain. All other resources must  originate from the application’s domain.  Listing 9-62.  Configuring an Application’s Content Security Policy  app.use lusca {     'csp': {     'default-src': '\'self\'',     'img-src': '*'     } } ;   For a full list of the various options that can be configured via the Content-Security-Policy      Note  header, visit the Open Web application Security project  OWaSp  at https:  owasp.org.  249  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 9   KraKen  Summary  The Node community is heavily influenced by the so-called “Unix philosophy,” which promotes  among  other things  the creation of small, tightly focused modules that are designed to do one thing well. This  approach has allowed Node to thrive as a development platform by fostering a large ecosystem of open  source modules. PayPal has taken this philosophy to heart by structuring Kraken not as a single, monolithic  framework, but rather as a collection of modules that extends and provides structure to Express-based  applications. By taking this approach, PayPal has managed to contribute several modules to the Node  ecosystem from which developers can benefit, regardless of whether they choose to use Kraken as a whole.

Brooks  There is no shortage of Node.js web servers. Express Connect, Kraken, and Sails are all popular choices.  Mach is a relatively young project in this space, though its predecessor, Strata.js, enjoyed a strong following  for several years. Mach was created by Michael Jackson, a former Twitter developer, with a few explicit  principles in mind:   	 HTTP requests are seamlessly passed to JavaScript functions.  	  A promise-oriented interface allows HTTP responses to be asynchronously deferred.  HTTP errors may also be propagated through promise chains.  See Chapter 14 for a  detailed description of how promises work.    	  Requests and responses can both take advantage of Node.js streams, so that large  amounts of data may be sent and received in chunks.   	 Composable middleware easily expands Mach’s core capabilities.  The choice of which web server to use—indeed, the choice of any library, framework, or programming  language in general—should be driven by a project’s particular use cases. And while Mach has much to offer  for any web-based application, it can also be an HTTP client and proxy, route requests to virtual hosts  like  Apache and nginx , and rewrite URLs  like Apache’s mode_rewrite module . Mach functions as a Node.js  module, but some of its features can be used in the browser as well, making its use case surface area even wider.  Chapter Examples  This chapter contains a number of runnable examples included with the chapter’s sample code. Where  applicable, code listings refer to their corresponding file s  with a comment at the top of the listing, as shown  in Listing 10-1.  Listing 10-1.  Not a Real Example     example-000 no-such-file.js console.log 'this is not a real example' ;  251  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 10   MaCh  Most examples in this chapter launch a Node.js web server. Unless otherwise specified, assume that the  server may be launched by running the JavaScript file referred to in each listing. For example, the command  in Listing 10-2 will run the index.js file, launching the Mach web server in the example-001 directory.  Listing 10-2.  Launching an Example Web Server  example-001$ node index.js >> mach web server started on node 0.10.33 >> Listening on 0.0.0.0:8080, use CTRL+C to stop  Installation  Mach is a Node.js module that may be installed with the Node.js package manager, npm. The examples in this  chapter also use the Q promise library and a handful of other npm modules. All are listed as dependencies  in the example code’s package.json file, so simply running npm install in the example code directory will  download and install each module:  code mach$ npm install  Mach, the Web Server  The Mach web server is superficially similar to many other web servers, taking inspiration from proven  patterns and designs, and only reinventing the wheel when it has something significant to offer. Creating  routes to handle HTTP requests in a Mach web server is a fairly straightforward process, and should be  familiar to developers who have used other REST-oriented web servers like Express  JavaScript , Sinatra   Ruby , Nancy  .NET , and so forth.  After importing Mach as an application dependency, Mach application stacks are created by calling   mach.stack  . This is the first step to servicing HTTP requests. Listing 10-3 assigns the stack to the app  variable.  Listing 10-3.  Creating the Application Stack     example-001 index.js 'use strict'; var mach = require 'mach' ;    ... load other modules ...      create a stack var app = mach.stack  ;      ...  Each Mach application is called a “stack” because each HTTP connection will travel through layers  of middleware—small bits of composable functionality—which may manipulate the request before it is  delivered to a route, and the response before it is delivered to a calling client. Middleware may also create  other side-effects that are important to the web server environment.  Mach itself comes with common web server middleware, which will be covered in the next section. The  web server in Listing 10-4 uses a piece of middleware, mach.logger, to print HTTP diagnostic information to  the terminal when the web server is receiving requests.  252  www.it-ebooks.info   Listing 10-4.  Adding Middleware to the Application Stack  Chapter 10   MaCh  A route is simply a function paired with a particular HTTP method and URL pattern that will handle   HTTP requests when they are received by the server. Routes are typically added to an application stack last,  after middleware, so that middleware have a chance to parse request information before, and manipulate  response information after, a route has an opportunity to interact with each.  The application stack exposes function methods mapped to standard HTTP request methods, as shown   in Listing 10-5. Routes are attached to the stack by invoking the appropriate method, followed by a URL  pattern and a route callback. When a route is matched to an incoming request, it will receive a connection   typically abbreviated as conn  with which it may respond to the request.     example-001 index.js 'use strict'; var mach = require 'mach' ;    ... load other modules ...      create a stack var app = mach.stack  ;      add some middleware app.use mach.logger ;      ...  Listing 10-5.  Adding HTTP Routes to the Application Stack     example-001 index.js      add some routes   app.get ' book', function  conn  { *...* } ;   app.get ' book :id', function  conn  { *...* } ;   app.delete ' book :id', function  conn  { *...* } ;   app.post ' book', function  conn  { *...* } ;   app.put ' book :id', function  conn  { *...* } ;   app.get ' author', function  conn  { *...* } ;   app.get ' library', function  conn  { *...* } ;   app.get ' ', function  conn  { *...* } ;      ...  When all middleware and routes have been attached to an application stack, the web server is ready   to listen for requests. Passing the application stack to Mach.serve   creates an HTTP listener to service  requests at the default HTTP scheme, host, and port: http:  localhost:5000. Additional options may  be added to change this default behavior. In Listing 10-6 a new port number  8080  is passed as a second  argument to Mach.serve   to force the HTTP listener to service that port.  253  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 10   MaCh  Listing 10-6.  Serving Up the Application Stack on Port 8080     example-001 index.js      serve the stack on a port mach.serve app, 8080 ;    or mach.serve app, {port: 8080} ;  If more options are necessary, they may be passed to Mach.serve   as an options hash instead. The   keys and values are described in Table 10-1. The examples in this chapter will make use of the port number  shorthand for convenience.  Table 10-1.  Mach Server Options  Option Property  Description  host  port  socket  quiet  timeout  key  cert  Listen for connections to this hostname, only. No restriction by default. Listen for connections on this port. Defaults to 5000. Listen for connections via Unix socket. Host and port are ignored. true to suppress startup and shutdown messages. Defaults to false. Duration to wait after receiving SIGINT or SIGTERM signals before forcibly closing  connections and terminating. Private key for SSL connections  HTTPS .  Public X509 certificate for SSL connections  HTTPS .  HTTP Routes Mach routes can handle requests from the most common HTTP methods, and even some uncommon ones:  PUT  POST   	 GET  	  	  	 DELETE  	 HEAD  	 OPTIONS  	  TRACE  The HTTP GET route in Listing 10-7 looks up all books in a fake database and delivers the records to the   client as an array of JSON objects.  Listing 10-7.  Anatomy of a Route     example-001 index.js app.get ' book', function  conn  {    *    * 1. Routes return promises. Q can adapt the callback-    * driven database module so that its result  or error     * is passed through a promise chain. The makeNodeResolver    254  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 10   MaCh     * method will provide a callback to feed the deferred.    *    var deferred = Q.defer  ;   db.books.all deferred.makeNodeResolver   ;    *    * 2. Adding handlers to the promise chain by calling    * promise.then      *    return deferred.promise.then function  books  {      *      * 3. The Connection.json   method returns a promise.      * The HTTP status code will be sent as an HTTP header      * in the response, and the array of books will be      * serialized as JSON.      *      return conn.json 200, books ;   }, function  err  {      *      * 4. An HTTP 500 will be delivered to the client on      * error. The error's message will be used in the      * serialized JSON response.      *      return conn.json 500, {error: err.message} ;   } ; } ;  Several things happen in this route that will be common to nearly every route created. First, a deferred is created that will eventually generate a promise to be returned from the route.  Refer   to Chapter 14 for a detailed explanation of how promises work, specifically how values and errors can be  passed along a promise chain.  Here the Q promise library creates a deferred, then creates a special callback  with makeNodeResolver  . This callback is passed directly to the database.books.all   method, and will  feed any value or error generated to the promise chain.  Second, two handlers are attached to the deferred’s promise: a handler to receive the book data that needs   to be returned to client, and a handler to receive any error from the database should the record fetch fail.  Third, each handler turns its respective data into an HTTP response by calling conn.json   with an   HTTP status and a payload. This method is syntactic sugar that encapsulates the conn.send   method   which will be covered in detail later , setting the appropriate Content-Type header, serializing the JSON  object, and returning a promise to be passed along the promise chain. When this promise is resolved, the  actual HTTP response will be sent.  In a terminal session the curl HTTP utility can make an HTTP GET request to the  book route. The   response body contains serialized book data in JSON form:  example-001$ curl -X GET http:  localhost:8080 book [{"id":1,"title":"God Emperor of Dune","author":"Frank Herbert"... }]  In the terminal session running the Mach server, the mach.logger middleware writes the request details   for GET  book to standard output:  example-001$ node index.js >> mach web server started on node 0.12.0 >> Listening on :::8080, use CTRL+C to stop  ::1 - - [17 Mar 2015 19:58:07] "GET  book HTTP 1.1" 200 - 0.002  255  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 10   MaCh  URL Parameters URL parameters are segments of a URL path that represent application data, such as unique identifiers.  It is common to see REST URLs written in patterns similar to      <entity- particular>. The code in Listing 10-8 defines a route for fetching a specific book by its identifier. The actual  parameter, :id, is identified by a colon prefix. A route may have any number of parameters, but each must  have a unique name and must be an entire URL segment.  Parameters will be available to the route as properties on the conn.params object. Each property name   will be the URL parameter name without the colon prefix. All property values are also parsed by Mach as  strings. Because IDs are numeric in the database, this parameter is converted using the Number function  before it is consumed by the database query.  Listing 10-8.  REST Route with a Single URL Parameter     example-001 index.js app.get ' book :id', function  conn  {   var id = Number conn.params.id ;   var deferred = Q.defer  ;   db.book.findByID id, deferred.makeNodeResolver   ;   return deferred.promise.then function  book  {     if  !book  {       return conn.json 404 ;     }     return conn.json 200, book ;   }, function  err  {     return conn.json 500, {error: err.message} ;   } ; } ;  Unlike the general  book route in Listing 10-8, this route searches for a specific entity that may or may  not exist in the database. If the database operation succeeds but the fetched book object is null, no record  for that ID exists, and the route resolves with an empty HTTP 404 response.  Query Strings and Request Bodies While Mach parses URL parameters automatically and makes them available on the conn.params object,  the getParams   method must be invoked to parse the query string and the request body. Because request  bodies are streamed, parsing is not performed automatically, by default. It remains up to the developer to  decide if, and when, the parsing should occur.  If this sounds tedious, don’t worry: the params middleware,  covered later, can automate this process.   In Listing 10-9 the  author route accepts a query parameter, genre, and then delivers a JSON array of  authors who write books in that genre. The connection’s getParams   method returns a promise, passing  a parsed params object to the resolution callback. Each property on the params object will be a named  parameter from the URL, query string, or request body.  Listing 10-9.  Extracting Values from a Query String     example-001 index.js app.get ' author', function  conn  {   return conn.getParams  .then function  params  {     var deferred = Q.defer  ;     db.author.findByGenre params.genre, deferred.makeNodeResolver   ;  256  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 10   MaCh      return deferred.promise.then function  authors  {       return conn.json 200, authors ;     }, function  err  {       return conn.json 500, {error: err.message} ;     } ;   } ; } ;  The curl command in Listing 10-10 sends the Horror genre parameter to the server, and the response   contains a single author record with a matching entry in the genres array.  Listing 10-10.  Using cURL to Send a Request with a Query String  example-001$ curl -X GET http:  localhost:8080 author?genre=Horror [{"id":6,"name":"Dan Simmons","website":"http:  www.dansimmons.com ",  "genres":["Science Fiction","Fantasy","Literature","Horror"]}]  The getParams   method has two other useful features. It accepts a single object argument where   keys represent whitelisted parameters to be parsed, and the values represent the parsing function for each  parameter. When the request body is parsed in Listing 10-11, any body parameter not specified in the  whitelist will be ignored. The primitive JavaScript functions String, Number, and Date all parse strings and  return deserialized objects. When the params object is passed to the promise’s resolution callback, each  property will be correctly typed. Custom functions may be used to deserialize request body parameters with  proprietary data formats as well.  Once the parameters have been parsed, a new book record is created in the database, then serialized   and returned to the client in the response body.  Listing 10-11.  Extracting Values from a Request Body     example-001 index.js app.post ' book', function  conn  {   return conn.getParams {     title: String,     author: String,     seriesTitle: String,     seriesPosition: Number,     publisher: String,     publicationDate: Date   } .then function  params  {     var book = Book.fromParams params ;     var deferred = Q.defer  ;     db.book.save book, deferred.makeNodeResolver   ;     return deferred.promise.then function  result  {       return conn.json result.isNew ? 201 : 200, book ;     }, function  err  {       return conn.json 500, {error: err.message} ;     } ;   } ; } ;  257  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 10   MaCh  Mach can deserialize request bodies in URL-encoded, multipart, and JSON formats. For other formats,  custom middleware can be added to deserialize the request body before it arrives at a route handler, or the  raw request body stream may be accessed at conn.request.content.  Listing 10-12 shows two curl commands that POST new book data in URL-encoded and JSON formats,   and the output generated from each HTTP response.  Listing 10-12.  Sending a POST Request Body with cURL  example-001$ curl -X POST http:  localhost:8080 book \     -H "Content-Type: application x-www-form-urlencoded" \      -d "title=Leviathan%20Wakes&author=James%20S.A.%20Corey&publisher=Orbit&publication   Date=2011-06-15T05%3A00%3A00.000Z"  {"id":10,"title":"Leviathan Wakes","author":"James S.A. Corey","publisher":"Orbit"...}   example-001$ curl -X POST http:  localhost:8080 book \     -H "Content-Type: application json" \     -d @new-book.json {"id":11,"title":"Ready Player One","author":"Ernest Cline","publisher":"Random House  NY"...}  When parameters from different sources  i.e., URL parameter, query string parameter, body parameter    have the same name, the following resolution scheme applies:           1.  URL parameters always take precedence over query string and request body   parameters.  2.  Query string parameters take precedence over request body parameters.  3.  Nonconflicting request body parameters are included.  Sending Responses So far the routes have only delivered JSON responses, but Mach can stream any valid HTTP response  content to a client.  The lowest-level response method on the Connection object is Connection.send  . This method   accepts an HTTP status code and a stream, buffer, or string to deliver in the response body. Many of the  other response methods  such as json   or html    on the Connection object are merely facades that  manipulate the response by adding appropriate headers before calling send  .  Table 10-2 shows each Mach response method, the type of content generally passed to each, and the   default values each method uses  if any  for various HTTP response headers. With the exception of back  ,  an HTTP status code may be specified as the first parameter to each of these methods, followed by the  response body content. While the status code is an optional parameter, the examples in this chapter always  explicitly set it.  258  www.it-ebooks.info   Table 10-2.  Mach Response Methods  Method  Payload  Connection.send    Connection.redirect    Connection.back    Connection.text    Connection.html    Connection.json    Connection.file    Stream, buffer, or string Location Location Text string HTML string JSON object or string  File content  stream, buffer,  string, or path   Chapter 10   MaCh  Response Header Defaults   none   302 Redirect Location:  302 Redirect Location:  Content-Type: text plain  Content-Type: text html  Content-Type: application json  Content-Type is set if an appropriate MIME  type can be determined by the file extension. Content-Length is set if a specified size is  passed to file   in an options hash, or if the  payload is a file path that can Node.js can  resolve and stat to determine file size.  The redirect   and back   methods do not deliver a response body, but instead manipulate the   Location header in the response to direct the client to another page. The file   method accepts either file  content  in the form of a stream, buffer, or string  or a file path that is then read into a stream, and delivers  the content of the file to the client.  Perhaps the most common response a web server will deliver to web browsers is an HTML response.   HTML pages are rarely stored as complete files anymore, however; developers break up HTML into reusable  components, mix markup with templating languages, and bind templates to dynamic data to create valid HTML.  In Listing 10-13, the swig templating library compiles two swig templates into functions, library     to display a user’s book library  and err500    to display any server errors . When the route handles an  incoming request, it loads book data from the database and binds that data to the library.swig template  using the library   function. This produces a valid HTML string, which is then passed as the response body  to conn.html  . If an error occurs during this process, the err500   function does the same with the error  template and the error message.  Listing 10-13.  Sending an HTML Response     example-001 index.js var swig = require 'swig' ;    ...   var library = swig.compileFile '. library.swig' ; var err500 = swig.compileFile '. err500.swig' ;   app.get ' library', function  conn  {   var deferred = Q.defer  ;   db.book.all deferred.makeNodeResolver   ;   return deferred.promise.then function  books  {     return conn.html 200, library {books: books}  ;   }, function  err  {     return conn.html 500, err500 {err: err.message}  ;   } ; } ;  259  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 10   MaCh  The advantage of using conn.html   over conn.send   in Listing 10-13 is purely one of convenience, as  html   will set the appropriate Content-Type: text html header automatically. The conn.text   method  would do likewise with the text plain content type.  For content types that Mach does not wrap, headers can be set manually before conn.send   is called.  For example, the route in Listing 10-14 delivers library data as XML instead of HTML by explicitly setting a  Content-Type: application xml header on the connection’s response before the promise is returned from  the route. The book data is then serialized as an XML string before being sent to the client.  Listing 10-14.  Setting the Content-Type Header Manually     example-001 index.js var xmlify = require '. xmlify' ;    ...   app.get ' library.xml', function  conn  {   var deferred = Q.defer  ;   db.book.all deferred.makeNodeResolver   ;   conn.response.setHeader 'Content-Type', 'application xml' ;   return deferred.promise.then function  books  {     return conn.send 200, xmlify 'books', data  ;   }, function  err  {     return conn.send 500, xmlify 'err', err.message  ;   } ; } ;  Not all response methods send content. The conn.redirect   method will send a Location header to   the HTTP client with a URL that it should follow, presumably because the content requested is no longer  available at the given route. The conn.back   method, in contrast, merely directs the client back to its  referer. An optional URL parameter acts as a fallback, in the event that the request’s Referer header is blank   e.g., the user typed the address directly into the browser’s URL bar .  Listing 10-15 shows a simple redirect from the root of the web application to the  library route.  Listing 10-15.  Sending a Redirect Response     example-001 index.js    ...   app.get ' ', function  conn  {   return conn.redirect ' library' ; } ;   	  	  	  location  request  response  260  Making Connections By now it should be obvious that the Connection object is the locus of all communication with a client. It  holds technical details about each HTTP request and response, and gives middleware and routes the means  to interact with and manipulate HTTP responses.  A Connection object has several properties of import to both middleware and routes:  www.it-ebooks.info   Location The Connection.location property contains information about the URL target of the connection’s request.  Table 10-3 shows the properties and data it contains.  Chapter 10   MaCh  Table 10-3.  Connection Location Data  Location Property Description  href  The full URL.  Example  http:  user:pass@webapp.com:8080   admin dashboard. htmlnews?showWelcome=1 http:, https: user:pass  webapp.com:8080  webapp.com  8080  ?showWelcome=1  showWelcome=1   admin dashboard.htmlnews  The URL scheme with trailing colon. URL authentication credentials    if provided . Full URL host, including any nonstandard   port number  e.g., not 80 or 443 . URL hostname. URL host port. URL path without query string. URL query string with the question   mark prefix. URL query string without the question   mark prefix.  query  URL query string parsed as an object hash.  {showWelcome: 1}  If the location object’s API looks familiar, it’s because Mach takes some inspiration here from the   window.location object in modern web browsers.  A few Connection properties act as helpful facades for combining Location and header data, shown in   Table 10-4.  Location Property Facades on the Connection Object  Connection Property  Description  Example  Location.pathname + Location. search. Value of the Authorization header,   or Location.auth.   admin dashboard. htmlnews?showWelcome=1  user:pass  true if Location.protocol is   “https:”, otherwise false.  true  protocol  auth  host  hostname  port  pathname  search  queryString  Table 10-4.  path  auth  isSSL  261  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 10   MaCh  Request and Response Messages Connections expose request and response properties, which are both instances of Message, an internal  Mach type that encapsulates HTTP message plumbing.  Message Headers The example in Listing 10-14 illustrates how to set a single header on the response message by using conn. response.setHeader  . The response message also exposes an addHeader   method that performs the  same function as Message.setHeader  , but with a caveat. If a header is set, it will overwrite any previous  header key value pair with the same name. If a header is added, Mach assumes that it should be appended  to any preexisting header with the same name, effectively creating a multivalue header.  To fetch a specific header, call Message.getHeader   with the desired header name. The value will be   returned if the header is present in the message.  Headers may be manipulated en masse through the Message.headers property, which gets and sets the   internal header hash, the keys of which are header names  such as Content-Type  with associated header values.  Message Cookies HTTP requests and responses carry cookie values to and from HTTP servers. These cookies are key  value pairs that are stored in Cookie and Set-Cookie headers, respectively. Mach messages parse these  cookie values and expose them as an object hash via the Message.cookies property, while the Message. getCookie   and Message.setCookie   methods behave like their header-oriented counterparts.  Message Content Request and response bodies exist as streams in each object’s Message.content property. These streams  may be piped through other transformation streams, or replaced on each Message object entirely. If a  string is used instead of a stream when setting the content property value, it will be converted to a stream  automatically.  Several Message methods provide alternative access to its content stream. The Message.  bufferContent   method will read the stream into a memory buffer and return a promise for the result.  When the promise resolves, the buffer will be available for consumption by calling code. An optional length  parameter may be passed to restrict the amount of data read into the buffer. If the actual buffer length is  exceeded, the promise will fail. This method is useful when consuming code needs to deal with a request or  response body as a whole. If a Message has been buffered, its isBuffered property will return true.  The Message.stringifyContent   method returns a promise for the string value of the content.   Optional length and encoding arguments may be supplied to limit the amount of data converted and to  encode it appropriately. Like Message.bufferContent  , if a maximum length is supplied and the string  exceeds that length, the promise will fail.  The Connection.getParams   method calls the Message.parseContent   method under the hood,   but this method may also be called directly, perhaps in middleware if necessary. It applies the appropriate  parser to the message content based on media type  e.g., URL-encoded  and returns a promise for the  parsed result string. It also accepts a maximum length parameter.  Common Middleware Mach comes bundled with a number of common middleware modules that encapsulate fairly standard web  server functionality, though a web server can operate without using a single piece of middleware. They are  all optional and may be added as needed.  262  www.it-ebooks.info   Each example in this chapter has used the mach.logger middleware to write HTTP request response   output to the terminal while a Mach web server is running. Listing 10-16 shows this piece of middleware  being attached to the application stack by passing it to the app.use   method.  Chapter 10   MaCh  Listing 10-16.  mach.logger Middleware     example-002 index.js      add some middleware app.use mach.logger ;      add some routes...  Under the hood, middleware are simply functions with a specific signature. This concept will be   examined in depth later, but in general, the app.use   method will accept the middleware function first  followed by optional configuration parameters.  The order in which middleware is added to a Mach application is important, as each middleware may  modify the request and response. Some middleware, like Mach.file, may prevent the connection from ever  reaching other middleware or a route handler at all.  When the web server receives a request, it passes it through middleware in an upstream fashion. Each   middleware handles the request in succession, passing it along until the chain is terminated by a piece of  middleware, handled by a route, or generates an error if it cannot be properly handled. Once the request  is handled, however, the connection passes back through the middleware chain going downstream, giving  each middleware a chance to evaluate the response. The diagram in Figure 10-1 illustrates, crudely, how  middleware is evaluated relative to request and response flow.   Figure 10-1.  Order in which Mach middleware evaluates requests and responses  The impact that middleware order can have on an application will become more apparent as more   middleware are added to examples.  What Manner of Content Is This? The Mach.contentType and Mach.charset middleware are two very simple functions that automatically  adjust the Content-Type response header if it is missing altogether, or does not specify a charset value.  These can be useful if routes serve homogeneous content  such as XML data  with Message.send  . Instead  of manipulating the Content-Type header in each route, a global override can be specified in middleware.  Both middleware are added to the application stack in Listing 10-17.  263  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 10   MaCh  Listing 10-17.  Setting Default Header Values with Mach.contentType and Mach.charset     example-002 index.js    ...   app.use mach.charset ; app.use mach.contentType, 'application xml' ;      ...  By default, Mach.charset uses the utf-8 encoding, which is sufficient for most purposes. An alternative  encoding may be specified with a second string parameter passed to app.use  . Mach.contentType will use  text html by default, but in this case the alternative application xml value is specified instead.  As stated, the order in which middleware is added to the application stack is important. In this case,   Mach.charset is added before Mach.contentType, which may seem counterintuitive considering that a  charset value is part of the Content-Type header value  implying that the header value needs to be set first .  Recall, though, that responses pass through middleware in a “downstream” direction. And since the content  type and character set of a response cannot be determined until after a route has added content to the  response, these middleware will perform their work in reverse order.  The curl command in Listing 10-18 shows a simple route that streams an XML file from disk without   specifying a Content-Type header in the route. The verbose curl request output shows that the Content- Type header has been set with the default content type and character set specified by Mach middleware.  Listing 10-18.  Automatically Setting XML Content Headers     example-002 index.js    ... app.use mach.charset ; app.use mach.contentType, 'application xml' ;   var insultsFilePath = path.join __dirname, 'insults.xml' ; app.get ' insults', function  conn  {   conn.send 200, fs.createReadStream insultsFilePath  ; } ;   example-002$ curl -v -X GET http:  localhost:8080 insults * Hostname was NOT found in DNS cache *   Trying ::1... * Connected to localhost  ::1  port 8080  0  > GET  insults HTTP 1.1 > User-Agent: curl 7.37.1 > Host: localhost:8080 > Accept: * * > < HTTP 1.1 200 OK < Content-Type: application xml;charset=utf-8 < Date: Sat, 28 Mar 2015 18:05:13 GMT < Connection: keep-alive < Transfer-Encoding: chunked  264  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 10   MaCh  <              Too bad they're all fabricated.               Is that your face? I thought it was your backside!               Your odor alone makes me aggravated, agitated, and infuriated!         My Kingdom for a File The Mach.file middleware serves static files  e.g., .html, .css, .js  from a physical directory on disk. When  a request enters the application stack pipeline, Mach.file attempts to match the request URL pathname to  a path on disk, and if the match is successful, Mach.file streams the static file content to the connection  response. If no static file matches the request path, the connection is passed to the next middleware  or route . Using Mach.file middleware is simply a matter of attaching the middleware function to the application   stack and specifying the directory from which static file content will be served. In Listing 10-19 an options  hash is passed to app.use   as a second argument. This object contains the few options used to configure  Mach.file, including the required root directory option. In this example the example-003 public directory  is specified.  Listing 10-19.  Mach.file Middleware     example-003 index.js var path = require 'path' ;    ...   var publicDir = path.join __dirname, 'public' ; app.use mach.file, {   root: publicDir      ...other options... } ;      routes     Tip  Because root is the only required option for Mach.file, the directory path string may be used as the  second argument to app.use   in lieu of the options hash.  The directory tree in Listing 10-20 shows the static content that will be served from the example-003  public directory. Mach treats this directory as part of the web server root, so static files and directories will  all have URLs relative to    e.g., http:  localhost:8080 styles index.css .  265  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 10   MaCh  Listing 10-20.  Content of the Public Directory ├── images  │   ├── bat-cat.jpg  │    ├── computing.gif  │    ├── llama.gif  │   ├── no-idea.jpg  │    └── swine.gif ├── index.html ├── scripts  │    └── index.js └── styles       └── index.css  Since static file content is read-only, Mach.file will only service requests with the HTTP methods GET   and HEAD. It will also reject requests that attempt to access a file path outside of the specified static file  directory, sending a 403 Forbidden response back to the client.  After launching the web server, a browser may be pointed at http:  localhost:8080 index.html.   Mach will serve the static index.html page and its assets, all magnificently depicted in Figure 10-2.   Figure 10-2.  Serving a static HTML page with Mach.file  266  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 10   MaCh  You may have noticed that the index.html file is explicitly included in the URL. It is common practice   to map an index.html  or some equivalent “default” .html file  to the web server root, or some other nested  directory path. If the file name is removed from the URL, however, the Mach.file middleware will generate  a 404 Not Found response. To change this behavior and serve an index file automatically, an index property  may be added to the options hash. If this property is “truthy,” Mach.file will automatically search for an  index.html file at any terminating segment in a URL path, including the application root. If more granular  control is required, this property may also contain an array of file names for which to search, prioritized by  array order. Listing 10-21 shows this property and its possible values.  Listing 10-21.  The Mach.file index Option Searches for Index Files at Directory Paths     example-003 index.js    ...   app.use mach.file, {   root: publicDir,   index: true     or, index: ['index.html', 'index.htm', ...] } ;  After the index option has been added and the web server restarted, visiting http:  localhost:8080   will automatically serve the index.html file to the browser.  The Mach.file middleware can also generate directory listings for directories with no index file. The   autoIndex option in Listing 10-22 activates this feature.  Listing 10-22.  The Mach.file autoIndex Option Creates a Directory Listing for Directories   Without Index Files     example-003 index.js    ...   app.use mach.file, {   root: publicDir,   autoIndex: true } ;  Browsing to http:  localhost:8080 images displays a directory listing of all images, their sizes, MIME   types, and last modified timestamps, shown in Figure 10-3.   267  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 10   MaCh  Figure 10-3.  Auto-indexing the images directory  Each image file name is a hyperlink to the image itself, while the Parent Directory hyperlink directs   the browser to the parent URL segment, in this case, the website root. If both the index and autoIndex  options are used together, any index page identified with the index option takes precedence and will be  displayed instead of a directory listing.  Zip It Modern browsers automatically request compressed resources from a web server by issuing an Accept- Encoding: gzip header with each request. Compression can dramatically reduce response size, improving  the speed and bandwidth required to fulfill each HTTP request. In exchange, a minor compression cost is  paid by the server and a decompression cost is paid by the browser.  Mach’s gzip middleware automatically compresses any response with the following Content-Type headers:  Response bodies are compressed with the Node.js zlib module, and the following headers are set on   text *  application javascript  application json  compressed response:   Content-Encoding: gzip   	  	  	   	  	  	  268  Content-Length: [compressed content length]  Vary: Accept-Encoding  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 10   MaCh     Tip  the Vary header tells any intermediary http cache that variations of this response should be cached  according to a particular header, in this case, Accept-Encoding. If Browser-a requests an uncompressed  response and Browser-B requests a compressed response for the same URL, http caches will store both  responses instead of storing only the first.  The code in Listing 10-23 introduces the Mach.gzip middleware before setting up a static file server.   When a response travels upstream, Mach.gzip will evaluate the request headers to see if Accept-Encoding:  gzip is present, then evaluate the response headers to determine if the Content-Type is a candidate for  compression. If both conditions are true, the response body will be compressed, as the curl request in  Listing 10-23 demonstrates.  Listing 10-23.  Mach.gzip Compresses Response Bodies     example-004 index.js    ...   app.use mach.gzip ;   var publicDir = path.join __dirname, 'public' ; app.use mach.file, {   root: publicDir,   index: true } ;   example-004$ curl -X GET -H "Accept-Encoding: gzip" -v http:  localhost:8080 index.html * Hostname was NOT found in DNS cache *   Trying ::1... * Connected to localhost  ::1  port 8080  0  > GET  index.html HTTP 1.1 > User-Agent: curl 7.37.1 > Host: localhost:8080 > Accept: * * > Accept-Encoding: gzip > < HTTP 1.1 200 OK < Content-Type: text html < Last-Modified: Tue, 31 Mar 2015 13:52:50 GMT < Content-Encoding: gzip < Vary: Accept-Encoding < Date: Tue, 31 Mar 2015 14:14:09 GMT < Connection: keep-alive < Transfer-Encoding: chunked < H       tvu {      y        vM Fy^            =[ :$R  Z    6  Y  Ť4XsF  p1    g ?

The technical details of each option are beyond the scope of this chapter. Refer  to the Node.js zlib documentation for more details.  Look at That Body Earlier, in Listing 10-11, the Connection.getParams   method was used to parse and extract data from query  strings and POST request bodies. Performing this step within individual routes can quickly become tedious,  however. The Mach.params middleware relieves the developer of this responsibility, parsing query strings  and request body data automatically, affixing data to Connection.params  where URL parameter data lives   before the connection is passed to a route.  In Listing 10-24, when data is POSTed to the route, the POST body parameters are appended to the   conn.params object. This object is then added as a database record. Output from the curl command shows  that the Mach.params middleware performed as expected.  Listing 10-24.  Parsing a Request Body Automatically with Mach.params     example-005 index.js    ...      Mach.params app.use mach.params ;   app.post ' hero', function  conn  {   var deferred = Q.defer  ;   db.hero.save conn.params, deferred.makeNodeResolver   ;   return deferred.promise.then function  result  {     return conn.json 201, result ;   }, function  err  {     return conn.json 500, {err: err.message} ;   } ; } ;    example-005$ curl -X POST http:  localhost:8080 hero \   -H "Content-Type: application x-www-form-urlencoded" \   -d "name=Minsc&race=Human&class=Ranger&subclass=Berserker&alignment=Neutral%20 Good&companion=Boo" {"id":6,"isNew":true}   remember, UrL parameters will always take precedence over query string and request body      Tip  parameters. If a naming conflict exists between any parameter source, Mach favors UrL parameters first, then  query string parameters, and finally request body parameters.  To verify that the POSTed data was in fact added to the database, a request may be sent to the route  in Listing 10-25 with two query string parameters, skip and take. These parameters allow clients to page  through what might conceivably be a large collection of heroes by defining an offset  skip  from which to  start, and the quantity  take  of heroes to load from that offset. Because Mach.params handles both request  bodies and query strings, there is no need to parse them manually.  270  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 10   MaCh  The two following curl requests can be used to query records 1–3 and 4–6 respectively. The POSTed   hero, Minsc, is the last hero in the last page of data.  Listing 10-25.  Parsing a Query String Automatically with Mach.params params     example-005 index.js    ...      Mach.params app.use mach.params ;      ...   app.get ' hero' *?skip=&take=* , function  conn  {   var skip = Number conn.params.skip  0 ,     take = Number conn.params.take  0 ;   var deferred = Q.defer  ;   db.hero.page skip, take, deferred.makeNodeResolver   ;   return deferred.promise.then function  heroes  {     return conn.json 200, heroes ;   }, function  err  {     return conn.json 500, {err: err.message} ;   }  } ;   example-005$ curl -X GET http:  localhost:8080 hero?skip=0\&take=3 [{"id":1,"name":"Dynaheir"...},{"id":2,"name":"Imoen"...},{"id":3,"name":"Khalid"...}]   example-005$ curl -X GET http:  localhost:8080 hero?skip=3\&take=3 [{"id":4,"name":"Xan"...},{"id":5,"name":"Edwin"...},{"id":6,"name":"Minsc"...}]  Who Goes There? Identifying and tracking users in web applications is a topic unto itself. Mach provides basic authentication  support for simple security use cases, and persistent session support that can accomodate many more. The Mach.basicAuth middleware is added to the application stack like all other middleware, and   requires a simple validation function as its only parameter. This function takes two arguments, username  and password, both parsed from the authentication credentials sent along with the request. The validation  function may return one of three values:  The username of a validated user  A “falsy” value if validation fails   	  	  	  A promise that will be resolved with the username of a validated user, or rejected  with a falsy value  The web server in Listing 10-26 will serve an index.html file to any authenticated user. The Mach.  basicAuth middleware will intercept each request and query the database for any provided credentials.  The db.user.byCredential   method returns a promise that will be resolved with the authenticated user  or rejected with an error. If resolved, the username is returned and propagated through the promise chain,  finally being set as the value of Connection.remoteUser. If an error occurs, a Boolean false is returned,  sending a 401 Unauthorized response to the client with the appropriate WWW-Authenticate header value.  271  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 10   MaCh  Listing 10-26.  Securing Routes with Basic Authentication     example-006 index.js    ...      Mach.basicAuth app.use mach.basicAuth, function  username, password  {   return db.user.byCredential username, password .then function  user  {     return user.username;   }, function   *err*   {     return false;   } ; } ;   var indexPath = path.join __dirname, 'index.html' ;   app.get ' ', function  conn  {   return conn.html 200, fs.createReadStream indexPath  ; } ;  When the server is running and a user attempts to visit http:  localhost:8080, he will be prompted   for credentials in response to the Basic Authentication challenge. Figure 10-4 shows the modal window that  Chrome displays.  Figure 10-4.  A browser prompts the user for credentials when Basic Authentication fails  272  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 10   MaCh  The Velocity of an Unladen Session Once a user has been authenticated, it is typical to track user-specific data in a server session. Adding the  Mach.session middleware to the application stack enables session cookie support automatically. The only  configuration property required on the Mach.session options object is a secret session key that will be used to  encrypt session data. Listing 10-27 shows session middleware added to the stack before any routes are defined.  Listing 10-27.  Adding Session Middleware to the Application Stack     example-007 index.js    ...   var sessionSecret = 'c94ac0cf8f3b89bf9987d1901863f562592b477b450c26751a5d6964cbdce9eb085  c013d5bd48c7b4ea64a6300c2df97825b9c8b677c352a46d12b8cc5879554';      Mach.session app.use mach.session, {   secret: sessionSecret } ;   var quizView = swig.compileFile '. quiz.swig' ;   app.get ' ', function  conn  {   return conn.html 200, quizView conn.session  ; } ;      ...  The route in Listing 10-27 sends an HTML quiz to the browser, shown in Listing 10-28. This quiz is a  swig template that interpolates the name, quest, and colour properties of the session object as values for  each input. The first time this route is accessed, the session object will be empty, and so these inputs will  have no values.  Listing 10-28.  A Perplexing Quiz  What Will Be Your Answers?     Questions, three.             What... is your name?                           What... is your quest?                           What... is your favourite colour?                       273  www.it-ebooks.info   When the form is POSTed to the  questions three route, shown in Listing 10-29, the form values are  extracted from the request and the session object, and are used to populate the session object. The user is  then redirected to a success page where he or she is given the option to take the quiz again.  Chapter 10   MaCh               Cross the Bridge of Death               Listing 10-29.  Setting Session Properties in a Route     example-007 index.js    ...   var successView = swig.compileFile '. success.swig' ; var errView = swig.compileFile '. err.swig' ;   app.post ' questions three', function  conn  {   return conn.getParams  .then function  params  {     conn.session.name = params.name;     conn.session.quest = params.quest;     conn.session.colour = params.colour;     return conn.html 201, successView   ;   }, function  err  {     return conn.html 500, errView err  ;   } ; } ;  When the user returns to the quiz page, the fields are automatically populated with the answers last  given to each question. Recall that in Listing 10-28 the session is being bound to the quiz template, and  since values were previously stored on the session object, they are now available to the template as well.  Figure 10-5 shows the prepopulated form values as well as the session cookie used to connect the browser to  the server-side session.  274  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 10   MaCh  Figure 10-5.  Mach session cookie  Since Mach.session uses cookie storage by default, there are a number of additional cookie-specific  option properties that may be set when the middleware is added to the stack, as described in Table 10-5.  Table 10-5.  Mach.session cookie options  Property  Description  name  path  domain  secure  expireAfter  Name of the cookie. Defaults to _session. Cookie path. Defaults to  . Cookie domain. Defaults to null. true to send the cookie over HTTPS only. Defaults to false. Seconds after which the cookie expires. Defaults to 0  never expires .  httpOnly  true to restrict this cookie to HTTP S APIs. Defaults to true.  275  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 10   MaCh  Mach session storage is not limited to cookies, however. It natively supports in-memory and Redis   sessions. To change the middleware’s session storage mechanism, require   the appropriate module from  mach middleware session *. Add a new instance of that module to the session configuration by setting the  store property on the options object. Listing 10-30 shows how the default cookie session store can easily be  replaced with a Redis session store.  Listing 10-30.  Using Redis As a Session Store     example-008 index.js    ...   var RedisStore = require 'mach lib middleware session RedisStore' ;      Mach.session app.use mach.session, {  store: new RedisStore {url: 'redis:  127.0.0.1:6379'}  } ;      ...  The MODified Squad Mach’s modified middleware can inform HTTP clients when a requested resource has not been modified  since the last request for that resource, simply by using standard HTTP headers. There are two resource  modification scenarios that Mach.modified can handle before delivering a response.  ETag and If-None-Match Web servers may identify a particular version of a requested resource by including some kind of version  identifier  commonly a message digest  in a response’s ETag header. This identifier can be sent back to the  server in the If-None-Match request header on subsequent requests for the same resource. If the resource  has not changed—that is, if its version identifier has not changed—the web server may respond with a  304 Not Modified response, omitting the actual resource from the response body. When this happens, the  client knows that the resource has not changed, and that it must continue to use the data it received from  its previous request. The code in Listing 10-31 shows how a digest of each book object is being added as the  ETag response header in each book route.  Listing 10-31.  Adding the ETag Header to Each Book Response     example-009 index.js var jsonHash = require '. json-hash' ;    ...   app.use mach.modified ;   app.get ' book :id', function  conn  {   var id = Number conn.params.id ;   var deferred = Q.defer  ;   db.book.findByID id, deferred.makeNodeResolver   ;   return deferred.promise.then function  book  {  276  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 10   MaCh      if  !book  {       return conn.json 404 ;     }     conn.response.setHeader 'ETag', jsonHash book  ;     return conn.json 200, book ;   }, function  err  {     return conn.json 500, {error: err.message} ;   } ; } ;   app.put ' book :id', function  conn  {     var book = Book.fromParams conn.params ;     var deferred = Q.defer  ;     db.book.save book, deferred.makeNodeResolver   ;     return deferred.promise.then function  result  {       conn.response.setHeader 'ETag', jsonHash book  ;       return conn.json result.isNew ? 201 : 200, book ;     }, function  err  {       return conn.json 500, {error: err.message} ;     } ; } ;  The first curl request in Listing 10-32 fetches a single book, Dune by Frank Herbert. The ETag header   in the response shows the message digest cf0fdc372106caa588f794467a17e893, and the response body  contains the serialized JSON book data.  The ETag message digest may vary based on your operating system.  For each curl command, use the ETag you receive in the HTTP response headers for further comparison.   The second curl request uses the same URL but also includes an If-None-Match header with the ETag   value sent in the previous response. Because the book entity has not changed on the server  and thus its  message digest remains the same , Mach sends a 304 Not Modified response with no response body.  Listing 10-32.  Using ETag and If-None-Match Headers to Test for Content Modification  example-009$ curl -v -X GET http:  localhost:8080 book 1 ... < HTTP 1.1 200 OK < ETag: cf0fdc372106caa588f794467a17e893 < Content-Type: application json < Date: Mon, 06 Apr 2015 01:39:11 GMT < Connection: keep-alive < Transfer-Encoding: chunked < {"id":1,"title":"God Emperor of Dune","author":"Frank Herbert"...}   example-009$ curl -v -H "If-None-Match: cf0fdc372106caa588f794467a17e893" -X GET http:   localhost:8080 book 1 ... < HTTP 1.1 304 Not Modified < ETag: cf0fdc372106caa588f794467a17e893 < Content-Type: application json < Content-Length: 0 < Date: Mon, 06 Apr 2015 01:39:31 GMT < Connection: keep-alive <  277  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 10   MaCh  In Listing 10-33, the first curl request performs an HTTP PUT that assigns Frank Herbert’s full name to  the book Dune. The second curl request is identical to the second request in Listing 10-32, but this time the  server responds with an HTTP 200 OK because the message digest is different, reflecting the updated book  resource. Subsequent fetches would use the newer message digest in the response’s ETag header.  Listing 10-33.  Updated ETag Header Passes the If-None-Match Check  example-009$ curl -X PUT http:  localhost:8080 book 1 \      -H "Content-Type: application x-www-form-urlencoded" \       -d "title=God%20Emperor%20of%20Dune&author=Franklin%20Patrick%20  Herbert&publisher=Victor%20Gollancz&publicationDate=2003-03-13T06:00:00.000Z&series  Title=Dune%20Chronicles&seriesPosition=4"  {"id":1,"title":"God Emperor of Dune","author":"Franklin Patrick Herbert"...}   example-009$ curl -v -H "If-None-Match: cf0fdc372106caa588f794467a17e893" -X GET http:   localhost:8080 book 1 ... < HTTP 1.1 200 OK < ETag: 2595cd82c364b04473358bb2d0153774 < Content-Type: application json < Date: Mon, 06 Apr 2015 01:54:33 GMT < Connection: keep-alive < Transfer-Encoding: chunked < {"id":1,"title":"God Emperor of Dune","author":"Franklin Patrick Herbert"...}  Last-Modified and If-Modified-Since The Last-Modified response header is analogous to the ETag header mentioned in the previous section, but  instead of a version identifier it contains a timestamp indicating the last time the resource changed. When  an HTTP client makes a request, it may supply the timestamp in an If-Modified-Since header, which is  then compared to the resource’s timestamp on the server. The web server will deliver only newer versions of  the resource; otherwise, it will issue a 304 Not Modified response, indicating that the client should depend  on the previous resource as the unmodified resource will not be included in the response body.  The code in Listing 10-34 uses the lastModified timestamp on each author record to set the Last-  Modified header value in each response. This timestamp is changed automatically by the database when an  author record is updated.  Listing 10-34.  Adding the Last-Modified Header to Each Author Response     example-009 index.js   app.get ' author :id', function  conn  {   var id = Number conn.params.id ;   var deferred = Q.defer  ;   db.author.findByID id, deferred.makeNodeResolver   ;   return deferred.promise.then function  author  {     if  !author  {       return conn.json 404 ;     }  278  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 10   MaCh      conn.response.setHeader 'Last-Modified', author.lastModified ;     return conn.json 200, author ;   }, function  err  {     return conn.json 500, {error: err.message} ;   } ; } ;   app.put ' author :id', function  conn  {   var author = Author.fromParams conn.params ;   var deferred = Q.defer  ;   db.author.save author, deferred.makeNodeResolver   ;   return deferred.promise.then function  result  {     conn.response.setHeader 'Last-Modified', author.lastModified ;     return conn.json result.isNew ? 201 : 200, author ;   }, function  err  {     return conn.json 500, {error: err.message} ;   } ; } ;  In Listing 10-35, the first curl request fetches the author Hugh Howey, and the response informs the   client that the last time Hugh’s record was modified was on 2015-04-06T00:26:30.744Z. In the second  request, this ISO date string is used as the value of the If-Modified-Since header, in response to which  Mach sends a 304 Not Modified Response.  Listing 10-35.  Using Last-Modified and If-Modified-Since Headers to Test for Content Modification  example-009$ curl -v -X GET http:  localhost:8080 author 1 ... < HTTP 1.1 200 OK < Last-Modified: 2015-04-06T00:26:30.744Z < Content-Type: application json < Date: Mon, 06 Apr 2015 01:41:31 GMT < Connection: keep-alive < Transfer-Encoding: chunked < {"id":1,"name":"Hugh Howey","website":"http:  www.hughhowey.com"...}   example-009$ curl -v -H "If-Modified-Since: 2015-04-06T00:26:30.744Z" -X GET   http:  localhost:8080 author 1 ... < HTTP 1.1 304 Not Modified < Last-Modified: 2015-04-06T00:26:30.744Z < Content-Type: application json < Content-Length: 0 < Date: Mon, 06 Apr 2015 01:42:27 GMT < Connection: keep-alive <  Predictably, once the record has been updated  and thus, its lastModified date changed , Mach’s   response will now contain the updated JSON data in the response body, as well as a new Last-Modified  response header. Listing 10-36 shows this exchange with two curl requests.  279  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 10   MaCh  Listing 10-36.

While not as complex as tools like  Apache’s mod_rewrite module, Mach.rewrite is both simple and flexible enough to handle common rewrite  use cases.  Two required parameters must be supplied when Mach.rewrite is added to the application stack:   	   	  A regular expression object  or string that will be cast to a regular expression object   that matches incoming request URLs  A route path to which the request will be silently forwarded  Consider a use case in which an author migrates his blog from a PHP-based system to a Node.js system  running Mach. Search engines have already indexed his valuable contributions to the world, and so his URLs  are solidified in perpetuity. By setting up a rewrite rule with Mach.rewrite, he can ensure that his old URLs  are still made available to the outside world while mapping them to his new routing scheme.  The Mach.rewrite middleware in Listing 10-37 uses a complicated regular expression object to   establish capture groups for parameters that will act as URL parameter inputs for the new blog post route:  year, month, day, and slug. After the regular expression, a string representing the rewritten URL route is  defined with placeholders for each of the extracted capture groups, in positional order. Under the hood  Mach.rewrite uses the String.prototype.replace   method to interpolate the extracted values.  Listing 10-37.  Rewriting a URL with Parameters     example-010 index.js   var blogView = swig.compileFile path.join __dirname, 'blog.swig'  ; var errView = swig.compileFile path.join __dirname, 'err.swig'  ;   app.use    mach.rewrite,      converts:  index.php blog 2015-04-02 bacon-ipsum-dolor-amet   new RegExp '\ index\.php\ blog\  [\\d]{4} - [\\d]{2} - [\\d]{2} \  [^\ ]+ ' ,  280  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 10   MaCh       into:  blog 2015 04 02 bacon-ipsum-dolor-amet   ' blog $1 $2 $3 $4'  ;      :year=$1, :month=$2, :day=$3, :slug=$4 app.get ' blog :year :month :day :slug', function  conn  {   var year = Number conn.params.year  0 ,     month = Number conn.params.month  0 ,     day = Number conn.params.day  0 ,     slug = conn.params.slug  '';   var deferred = Q.defer  ;   db.posts.find year, month, day, slug, deferred.makeNodeResolver   ;   return deferred.promise.then function  post  {     if  post  {       return conn.html 200, blogView {posts: [post]}  ;     }     return conn.html 404, errView {message: 'I haven\t written that yet.'}     }, function  err  {     return conn.html 500, errView err  ;   } ; } ;  To an HTTP client, such as the web browser shown in Figure 10-6  or a search engine bot , rewritten  URLs are still completely valid, though internally they are morphed into something different. This differs  from HTTP redirects or forwards where the client is responsible for interpreting response headers and then  loading another page. In this case the client is none the wiser.  Figure 10-6.  Rewritten URLs appear unmodified to the HTTP client   281  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 10   MaCh  The rewrite rule in Listing 10-38 performs the same exact work, but uses a simple string instead of  a regular expression for the request URL match because it captures no parameters. Be aware that Mach. rewrite will auto-escape any string before converting it to a regular expression. If you escape these strings  yourself, they will become doubly escaped and your match rule will fail.  Listing 10-38.  Rewriting a URL with No Parameters     example-010 index.js   app.use    mach.rewrite,   ' index.php blog',   ' blog'  ;   app.get ' blog', function  conn  {   var deferred = Q.defer  ;   db.posts.all deferred.makeNodeResolver   ;   return deferred.promise.then function  posts  {     return conn.html 200, blogView {posts: posts}  ;   }, function  err  {     return conn.html 500, errView err  ;   } ; } ;  The Hosts with the Most Mach.mapper is unique in that it performs its own manner of routing on top of Mach’s normal routing  mechanism. Up to this point it has been assumed that route paths exist for a single host  localhost  and  are all relative to that host’s name. The Mach.mapper middleware changes this paradigm by introducing a  middleware filter that can route requests by both hostname and URL pathname, in much the same spirit as  Apache’s virtual hosts, though with a much lighter footprint.  To demonstrate how Mach’s mapping feature works, execute the echo commands in Listing 10-39 to add   two aliases to the  etc hosts file on your computer. Because  etc hosts is protected on Unix-like systems,  the sudo command is used to elevate permissions.

The cat command will output the content   of  etc hosts to the terminal so you can verify that the entries have been added.  Listing 10-39.

It begins like any normal Mach   web server: an application stack is created, a few bits of middleware are added, and then things diverge a  bit. Two additional independent application stacks—atreidesApp and harkonnenApp—are also created, and  each of these stacks is assigned a route. In fact, all of the application stacks are given the same route, GET   about.  Listing 10-41.  Mach.mapper Middleware Maps Apps to Hostnames     example-011 index.js    ...   var app = mach.stack  ;   app.use mach.logger ; app.use mach.params ; app.use mach.file, path.join __dirname, 'public'  ;   var atreidesApp = mach.stack  ;   atreidesApp.get ' about', function  conn  {   var pagePath = path.join __dirname, 'atreides.html' ;   return conn.html 200, fs.createReadStream pagePath  ; } ;   var harkonnenApp = mach.stack  ;   harkonnenApp.get ' about', function  conn  {   var pagePath = path.join __dirname, 'harkonnen.html' ;   return conn.html 200, fs.createReadStream pagePath  ; } ;   app.use mach.mapper, {   'http:  house-atreides.org ': atreidesApp,   'http:  house-harkonnen.org ': harkonnenApp } ;    283  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 10   MaCh  app.get ' about', function  conn  {   var pagePath = path.join __dirname, 'about.html' ;   return conn.html 200, fs.createReadStream pagePath  ; } ;  It is clear from examining the body of each route function that these apps all render different HTML   pages when invoked. These routes can all coexist because the Mach.mapper middleware maps the  atreidesApp application stack to the hose-atreides.org hostname and the harkonnenApp to the house- harkonnen.org hostname in its options hash. When requests are received by the web server, they are passed  through the Mach.mapper middleware where the Connection.hostname property is evaluated. If it matches  any key on the mapping options object, the connection is passed to the application stack associated with  that key for further processing. This has several interesting consequences:   	   	   	   	   	  Application stacks that vary by hostname may have the same routes, such as GET   about.  Since middleware are attached directly to application stacks, each stack may have  different middleware.  Any middleware added to the hosting application stack before Mach.mapper will be  applied to all application stacks that Mach.mapper manages.  Any routes added to the hosting application stack before Mach.mapper will be  evaluated before Mach.mapper has a chance to do hostname-based routing.  Because the hostname is not evaluated without Mach.mapper, routes on the hosting  application stack with the same URL pathname value would resolve, regardless of  hostname.  Any routes added to the hosting application stack after Mach.mapper will act as  “fall-through” routes. If no mapped application stack can handle a request for the  connection’s hostname, these routes will then be evaluated.     Tip  When adding a host to Mach.mapper, the protocol matters but the port number does not, so the port  number may be safely omitted. Mach only listens on one port. hostname keys should always end with a   trailing slash.  Run the web server, then launch a web browser and navigate to the URL http:  localhost:8080  about. This will open the page shown in Figure 10-7, which comes from the  about route defined on the  hosting application stack. This route handled the request because the hostname, localhost, did not match  any hostname in the Mach.mapper configuration.  284  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 10   MaCh  Figure 10-7.  The  about route from localhost  The page source in Listing 10-42 reveals that the two hyperlink anchors, one for House Atreides and   one for House Harkonnen, both link to different hosts. Clicking on either link will render the page from the  mapped routes defined by Mach.mapper. Note that, though the port number is immaterial when declaring  mapped application stacks, they must be included in the page hyperlinks or the browser will attempt to use  port 80 automatically.  Listing 10-42.  Anchors on the Default  about Page Link to Different Hosts   Great Houses of Arrakis       House Atreides         House Harkonnen     Figure 10-8 shows the House Atreides “about” page, fully rendered. Figure 10-9 shows the House   Harkonnen “about” page.  285  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 10   MaCh  Figure 10-8.  The  about route from house-atreides.org  Figure 10-9.  The  about route from house-harkonnen.org  286  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 10   MaCh  Looking at the source code for both “about” pages reveals something interesting. Images referenced on   both pages, such as the src attribute in Listing 10-43, do not specify a hostname prefix.  Listing 10-43.  Images Do Not Have Hostname Prefixes     This is possible because the Mach.file middleware, which exposes the example-011 public directory  as a static resource directory, was added to the hosting application stack before Mach.mapper, thus affecting  all application stacks upstream. All static resources—images, fonts, scripts, and so on—can be stored in  the same location, available to all application stacks regardless of hostname. Each application stack can, of  course, use an alternative Mach.file middleware to expose different static asset directories if needed.  Custom Middleware Creating custom Mach middleware is relatively straightforward. There are generally three “layers” involved  when creating custom middleware:           1.  A top-level function that is responsible for capturing an “app” and any options   that are passed to the middleware via app.use  . This layer returns...  2.   3.   a function that will receive an incoming request connection. This function  may do one of two things. It may manipulate the connection directly and  send a response without passing the connection through the remainder of the  application stack  an authentication failure, for example , or...  it may send the request downstream and then handle the response when the  application stack’s promise chain has resolved.  The middleware in Listing 10-44 shows all three stages at work.  Listing 10-44.  Custom Middleware Module That Adds an API Version Header to the Response     example-012 api-version.js 'use strict';      layer 1 function apiVersion app, options  {      layer 2   return function  conn  {        layer 3     return conn.call app .then function    {       conn.response.headers['X-API-Version'] = options.version;     } ;   }; }   module.exports = apiVersion;  The top-level function, apiVersion  ,is exposed via module.exports. It will be passed to app.use     when the middleware is attached to an application stack. It captures the application instance and the  options object  layer 1 , holding both in a closure for further processing. When a request is received, the   287  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 10   MaCh  returned function  layer 2  receives the connection object and makes a decision. This particular middleware  is only concerned with adding an “API version” header to the response, so at this point it invokes the  Connection.call   method, passing the app itself as the sole argument.  At this point some disambiguation is necessary. In Mach, the “application stack” created by invoking   Mach.stack   is a function that accepts a connection and returns the value of Connection.call  . This  process is identical to what a Mach middleware function does. In fact, this is nearly identical to what a route  does: both Connection.call   and all routes return promise objects that exist as a single promise chain!  The practical implication of this similitude is that the “app” a Mach middleware function receives may   be either another piece of downstream middleware or a route, depending on the order of middleware routes  added to the application stack. By passing the app object to conn.call  , then, the custom middleware  propagates the connection to everything downstream, whatever that may be. When the promise returned  by conn.call   resolves  layer 3 , all downstream middleware and or a route have already dealt with the  connection object and the custom middleware may decide what, if anything, it must do with the response.  In Listing 10-44, the API version number is assigned to the custom X-API-Version header on the   response object once the response is moving upstream again. Had this middleware been designed to modify  the request before passing it downstream, it would have done so before invoking conn.call  .  Custom middleware are attached to the application stack in the same manner as Mach’s native   middleware, as shown in Listing 10-45. In this example the apiVersion middleware will receive an options  object with the version number 1.2, which will be added to each response as a custom header value.  Note that Mach.gzip is added to the stack after apiVersion, which means that the “app” argument that  the apiVersion middleware receives will be the middleware function for Mach.gzip, since it exists just  downstream in the stack.  Listing 10-45.  Adding Custom Middleware to the Application Stack     example-012 index.js var apiVersion = require '. api-version' ;      create a stack var app = mach.stack  ;      custom middleware app.use apiVersion, {version: '1.2'} ;      out-of-the-box middleware app.use mach.gzip ;   app.get ' numbers', function  conn  {   return conn.json 200, [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42] ; } ;  Listing 10-46.  API Version Middleware Response Header  example-012$ curl -v -X GET http:  localhost:8080 numbers * Hostname was NOT found in DNS cache *   Trying ::1... * Connected to localhost  ::1  port 8080  0  > GET  numbers HTTP 1.1 > User-Agent: curl 7.37.1  288  www.it-ebooks.info  When the web server is queried in Listing 10-46, the X-API-Version header may be seen in the detailed   response.   Chapter 10   MaCh  > Host: localhost:8080 > Accept: * * > < HTTP 1.1 200 OK < Content-Type: application json < X-API-Version: 1.2 < Date: Fri, 10 Apr 2015 01:41:42 GMT < Connection: keep-alive < Transfer-Encoding: chunked < [4,8,15,16,23,42]  Mach, the HTTP Client  Mach is much more than an HTTP server. Its internal architecture allows it to play multiple roles in multiple  environments. In fact, an examination of the Mach source code reveals that the portions of Mach that are  server-specific are implemented as extensions. This means that Mach’s core objects, such as Connection,  Location, and Message, can span multiple use cases.  The code in Listing 10-47 resembles the web server examples presented so far. A Mach application stack   is created to service HTTP requests, file middleware is added to serve static content from example-013  public, and a single route, GET  mach tags, is registered with the stack. The code within this route, however,  takes advantage of Mach’s HTTP client features to send a GET request for all of Mach’s repository tags to the  Github API.  Listing 10-47.  Mach As Both Server and Client     example-013 index.js var app = mach.stack  ; app.use mach.logger ; app.use mach.file, {   root: path.join __dirname, 'public' ,   index: true } ;   app.get ' releases', function  conn  {   function addUserAgent conn  {     conn.request.setHeader 'User-Agent', 'nicholascloud mach' ;   }   return mach.get 'https:  api.github.com repos mjackson mach tags', addUserAgent ;  } .then function  conn  {     var tags = [];     JSON.parse conn.responseText .forEach function  tagData  {       tags.push tagData.name ;     } ;     return tags.sort semver.rcompare ;   } .then function  tags  {     return conn.json 200, tags ;   }, function  err  {     return conn.json 500, {err: err.message} ;   } ; } ;  289  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 10   MaCh  Mach’s HTTP client methods look much like Mach’s routing methods, but they exist on the Mach   module itself, not on an application stack. Mach can issue requests for any standard HTTP method.  In Listing 10-47 the Mach.get   method receives the request URL as its first parameter and an optional   function to modify the connection’s request before it has been sent as its second. This request connects  to the Github API and fetches tag information for the mjackson mach repository. Because the Github API  requires a User-Agent header in all incoming requests, the addUserAgent   function modifies the outgoing  request by adding my own source code fork as the agent  per Github’s guidelines .  Like other parts of the Mach API, the Mach.get   method returns a promise. If the promise resolves, its  value will be the connection object with a response message property. If rejected, an error will be passed to  the failure callback.  The Github JSON data exists as a string at the Connection.responseText property  or as the stream  at Connection.response.content . Once this data is deserialized, the tag names are extracted, sorted in  descending order, and then passed along the promise chain.  When the web server is queried with curl in Listing 10-48, all of Mach’s release tags are delivered as a   JSON array.  Listing 10-48.  Fetching Mach Releases with cURL  example-013$ curl http:  localhost:8080 releases ["v1.3.4","v1.3.3","v1.3.2","v1.3.1","v1.3.0"...]  This JSON data is consumed by the HTML page in Listing 10-49. Notice that it also uses Mach.get    to connect to the local web server. Because Mach’s environment-dependent features are implemented as  extensions, Mach can be useful in both server and browser code.     Note  Because Mach is a Node.js module, it can be used by any CommonJS module loader, such as  Browserify or Webpack. all other uses, such as the plain script inclusion shown in Listing 10-49, should use the  global Mach build from the Mach Github repository.  Browse to http:  localhost:8080 to see a list of links to all Mach releases.  Listing 10-49.  Mach.get   in the Browser     Mach Releases   Git you one!           function  mach, document  {   var href = 'https:  github.com mjackson mach releases tag :tag';   var ul = document.querySelector 'tags' ;     mach.get ' releases' .then function  conn  {     var tags = JSON.parse conn.responseText ;     tags.forEach function  tag  {       var li = document.createElement 'li' ;  290  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 10   MaCh        var a = document.createElement 'a' ;       a.innerHTML = tag;       a.setAttribute 'href', href.replace ':tag', tag  ;       a.setAttribute 'target', '_blank' ;       li.appendChild a ;       ul.appendChild li ;     } ;   } ; } window.mach, window.document      Mach, the HTTP Proxy  While technically middleware, Mach’s HTTP proxy functionality can be used by itself to create a full HTTP  proxy server, or integrated with an existing application stack to proxy certain routes. This can be a useful  tool for migrating web applications piecemeal while still proxying calls to a legacy web application, or for  avoiding same-origin concerns in the browser by proxying calls to an external or third-party service through  the web application itself.  The code in Listing 10-50 creates a simple Mach application that serves both a root application route   and static files from the public directory. After the route declaration, a proxy application is created by calling  Mach.proxy   with the HTTP scheme, hostname, and port of another server. For this example, when the web  application is run it will listen for some requests on port 8080 while proxying other requests to another web  server running on port 8090. This proxy application stack becomes the middleware options argument for  Mach.proxy when both are passed to app.use  .  Listing 10-50.  Proxying Requests to Another Web Server     example-014 web.js var app = mach.stack  ; app.use mach.logger ; app.use mach.file, path.join __dirname, 'public'  ;   app.get ' ', function  conn  {   var pagePath = path.join __dirname, 'index.html' ;   return conn.html 200, fs.createReadStream pagePath  ; } ;   var apiProxy = mach.createProxy 'http:  localhost:8090' ;   app.use mach.proxy, apiProxy ;   mach.serve app, 8080 ;  Typically middleware are added to an application stack before routes so that they have a chance to   examine the request and interrupt the middleware promise chain if some condition isn’t met, or modify the  request and pass it along for further processing. Unfortunately, Mach.proxy is fairly dumb, which means   291  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 10   MaCh  that it does not discriminate among requests; any request that passes through Mach.proxy will be sent to  the proxy server. If an application uses a mix of local and proxied routes, there are two ways to deal with this  “limitation”:   	  Add the proxy middleware after application routes have been added. This ensures  that if an application route can handle a request, it will handle it, stopping the  propagation of the connection before it reaches Mach.proxy. This is the approach  taken in Listing 10-50.   	 Wrap the proxy middleware in a lightweight custom middleware function that   discriminates among and only forwards certain requests to the proxy. Because it  filters requests, the custom middleware can be added to the stack before any routes.  This alternative approach is illustrated in Listing 10-51.  Listing 10-51.  Wrapping a Proxy Application in Custom Middleware     example-014 web2.js var apiProxy = mach.createProxy 'http:  localhost:8090' ;   app.use function  app  {   return function  conn  {     if  conn.location.pathname.indexOf ' api'  !== 0  {          not an API method, call the app stack normally       return conn.call app ;     }        API method, call the proxy app stack     return conn.call apiProxy ;   }; } ;   app.get ' ', function  conn  {  *...*  } ;  The simulated API server that receives proxy requests is, to no one’s surprise, another Mach server. It  exposes two regular JSON routes, shown in Listing 10-52: one to fetch a tallied list of votes and another to  submit a single vote.  Listing 10-52.  API Server’s Routes     example-014 api.js var votes = require '. votes' ;    ...   app.get ' api vote', function  conn  {   var tallies = {};   var voteCount = votes.length;   votes.forEach function  vote  {     var tally = tallies[vote]  {       count: 0,       percent: 0.0     };     tally.count += 1;     tally.percent = Number  tally.count   voteCount * 100 .toFixed 2  ;  292  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 10   MaCh      tallies[vote] = tally;     return tallies;   } ;   return conn.json 200, tallies ; } ;   app.post ' api vote', function  conn  {   console.log conn.params ;   var vote = conn.params.vote  '';   if  !vote  {     return conn.json 400, {err: 'Empty vote submitted.'} ;   }   votes.push vote ;   return conn.json 201, {count: 1} ; } ;   mach.serve app, 8090 ;     Note  to run example-014, both web.js  or web2.js  and api.js must be launched with Node.js. the web  server will listen for http requests on port 8080, and the apI server will listen on port 8090.  The web server renders an HTML page as the user interface for a small voting application. Though it is  common knowledge that “you don’t vote for kings,” the peasantry is still fond of popularity contests and this  web application indulges them. Figure 10-10 shows the rendered page at http:  localhost:8080.  Figure 10-10.  Voting for a new monarch  293  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 10   MaCh  When the form is submitted, an event handler finds the checked option value and sends a request   to the web server with the vote data. The sendVote   method in Listing 10-53 makes an AJAX request to   POST  api data on the web server, which is then proxied to the API server where the vote is recorded.  Once the submission is complete, the getTallies   function in Listing 10-53 queries the web server   at GET  api vote to fetch the vote tallies. Again, this request is proxied and the JSON data is returned to the  client.  Listing 10-53.  Submitting a Vote     example-014 index.html var formPoll = document.querySelector 'poll' ;    ...   function sendVote vote  {   function serializeVote conn  {     conn.request.setHeader 'Content-Type', 'application json' ;     conn.request.content = JSON.stringify {       vote: vote     } ;   }   return mach.post ' api vote', serializeVote ; }   function getTallies   {   return mach.get ' api vote' .then function  conn  {     return JSON.parse conn.responseText ;   } ; }   formPoll.addEventListener 'submit', function  e  {      ...   var vote = checkbox.value;   sendVote vote .then function    {        ...     return getTallies  .then function  tallies  {          show tally data...     } ;   } .catch function  error  {     showError error.err  error.message  'The night is dark and full of errors.' ;   } ; } ;  The web page displays the proxied tally data, shown in Figure 10-11, once the response has been   received and parsed.  294  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 10   MaCh  Figure 10-11.  Tallies are displayed when a vote is submitted   If errors occur during a proxied request—for example, if the API server is offline—they will be returned to   the client as HTTP request errors. Because these errors will be infrastructure related and not application related,  it may be wise to handle them in a custom middleware wrapper and deliver more meaningful errors instead.  Summary  While Mach certainly isn’t the only, or even the most popular, Node.js web server available, it has a strong  simplicity and terse API that make it flexible. Its core architecture ensures that its common components are  available everywhere while its environment-specific components are loaded as extensions.  A suite of common middleware that plugs into a promise-based API makes request and response chains   easy to tap and manipulate. Custom middleware is simple to write when more functionality is required.  Request and response messages build on Node’s native streams by parsing request queries and bodies   on-demand, and delivering response content to clients in chunks. This ensures that the lowest possible  memory and processing overhead are used during HTTP operations. Request and response content may  also be piped, converted to buffers for in-memory manipulation, parsed by various format handlers, and  converted to strings with varied encodings.  Beyond Mach’s role as an HTTP server, it can fulfill several other important HTTP-related roles:  Rewriting request URLs   	  	 Mapping requests to virtual hosts  	  	  Sending HTTP client requests  Acting as an HTTP proxy  Mach’s fresh ideas are worthy additions to the Node.js web server pantheon.  295  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 11  Mongoose  The human mind gets used to strangeness very quickly if [strangeness] does not exhibit  interesting behavior.  —Dan Simmons  MongoDB is a popular cross-platform document database, often lumped into the “NoSQL” classification  with other nonrelational data stores such as CouchDB, Cassandra, RavenDB, and so forth. It is a popular  choice for data storage among Node.js developers because its “records” are stored as plain JSON objects,  and its query interface and stored functions are written in plain JavaScript.  Storing, accessing, and manipulating data in MongoDB is not terribly complex, but Node.js libraries   such as Mongoose can help application developers map MongoDB documents onto application objects that  have definite schemas, validations, and behavior—all concepts that are not  by design  parts of MongoDB.  Mongoose implements the query interface native to MongoDB, but also gives developers a composable,  fluent interface that simplifies portions of the query API.  Though MongoDB is not the direct subject of this chapter, it is necessary to establish a few basic   concepts about how MongoDB works before delving into Mongoose. If you’re familiar MongoDB already,  feel free to skip the next section.  Basic MongoDB Concepts  A relational database server hosts database schemas  sometimes just called databases , which encapsulate  related entities like tables, views, stored procedures, functions, etc. Database tables in turn contain tuples   also known as rows or records . A tuple is composed of a number of fields, each containing a value of a  predetermined data type. The tuple is one-dimensional, and its definition  the data types its fields can hold  is  determined at the table level. All tuples within a table, then, share the same structure, though their individual  field values may differ. The names and data types of a tuple’s fields are referred to as the tuple’s schema.  MongoDB has a superficially similar data hierarchy, as shown in Table 11-1.  297  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 11   Mongoose  Table 11-1.  Understanding MongoDB by Analogy to Relational Database Systems  MongoDB  Server Database Collection Document  Property  Table 11-2 defines the key terms that describe Mongoose components and how they relate to each  other. The code in Listing 11-1 shows how these terms are appear in code. This chapter will cover each  in detail but because many of them are closely related, you might wish to refer back to this section as the  chapter progresses.  Table 11-2.  Mongoose Terms and Definitions  Definition  Defines the data types, constraints, defaults, validations, and so forth for the properties of a  document instance; enforced at the application level Constructor function that creates or fetches document instances Instance object created or fetched by a Mongoose model; will have Mongoose-specific  properties and methods as well as data properties  JSON object  Plain JavaScript object that contains only the data properties from a document  RDBMS  Server Schema Table Tuple  Field  Term  Schema  Model Document  Listing 11-1.  Mongoose Terms and Definitions in Code     albumSchema is a schema var albumSchema = mongoose.Schema { *...* } ;      Album is a model var Album = mongoose.model 'Album', albumSchema ;      Album is a model Album.findById  *...* , function  err, album  {      album is a document   console.log album ; } ;      Album is a model Album.findById  *...*     .lean true    .exec function  err, album  {        album is a JSON object  because of `lean true `      console.log album ;   } ;    298  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 11   Mongoose     Album is a model Album.findById  *...*     .exec function  err, album  {        album is a document        toObject   returns a JSON object     console.log album.toObject   ;   } ;  Unlike RDBMS tuples, MongoDB documents are not one-dimensional. They are complete JSON objects   that may contain other objects or arrays. In fact, documents within the same collection need not even have  the same properties, because MongoDB collections are actually schemaless. A MongoDB collection can hold  document objects of any shape or size  within MongoDB’s storage limits . In practice, though, collections  tend to hold documents of similar “shape,” though some may have optional properties, or may contain  properties that represent some arbitrary data. But in general, applications usually assume that data exists in  particular “shapes,” so although MongoDB does not enforce document schemas, applications often do.  By default, MongoDB documents are automatically assigned a surrogate primary key called _id. This   key has a special type  MongoDB’s ObjectId type  and is used as MongoDB’s primary collection index.  MongoDB can use a different field as a primary key if directed. Additional fields can be added to secondary  indexes within a collection, either as simple or compound keys.  MongoDB does not support the notion of foreign keys, a strong feature of RDBMS databases. Instead,  MongoDB relies on the power of nested documents to store data associations. Consider the classic trinity  of all RDBMS examples: customer, postal address, and shopping cart order. In an RDBMS system, there  would likely be foreign keys from the postal address to the customer  to identify residency , and from the  order to one or more postal addresses  to identify shipping and billing addresses . In a MongoDB customer  document, however, it would be sufficient to simply store the postal address as a nested object in the  customer document as well as the order document. Consider Listing 11-2.  Listing 11-2.  Duplication Sometimes Acceptable in MongoDB     customer {   "_id": 1001,   "name": "...",   "postalAddress" {     "street": "...",     "city": "...",     "state": "...",     "zip": "..."   } }      order {   "_id": 2001,   "customer": 1001,   "items": [     {"sku": 3001, "qty": 2}   ],  299  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 11   Mongoose    "shippingAddress" {     "street": "...",     "city": "...",     "state": "...",     "zip": "..."   } }  business point of view:  There are any number of reasons why this “violation” of referential integrity might be acceptable from a    	   	   	   	  Perhaps orders are never altered. If there is a mistake in an order—for example, the  shipping address is wrong—the entire order gets re-created to offset the faulty order.  The correct shipping address gets added to the new order.  If a customer changes a postal address, old orders won’t be updated with the new  address, so there’s no data integrity issue at stake.   	 Maybe changing a postal address always happens within the customer domain,   never in the order domain.  Perhaps a customer can override a shipping address with a “temporary” address   shipping a gift  that should not be added to the customer record.  If different postal metrics are derived from orders than from customers  e.g., a  C-level executive wants to know how many orders were shipped to Missouri last  month regardless of who actually lives in Missouri this month , that data is already  segregated.   	 Maybe disk space is cheap and the velocity gained by not enforcing referential   integrity outweighs any potential cost.  While foreign keys and referential integrity are critical to RDBMS databases, strong MongoDB   document design can often render the issue moot.  Finally, though MongoDB’s query API may look a bit daunting to SQL practitioners, it quickly becomes   obvious that, for the most part, looking for data involves the same concepts: selecting  find , filtering   where , applying compound conditions  and, or, in , aggregating  group , paging  skip, limit , and so on.  How queries are composed and executed differs mostly in syntax.  A Simple Mongoose Example  Mongoose is a library for Node.js applications. To develop with Mongoose  and follow the examples in this  chapter , you need to install Node.js and MongoDB on your platform of choice. The default installation  procedure and configuration for both should be sufficient to run this chapter’s example code.     Note  this chapter assumes that you are familiar with node.js applications and modules, and that you know  how to install them with npm. a working knowledge of MongoDB will be very helpful, but it is not required, since  interaction with MongoDB will mostly occur through Mongoose in the chapter examples. some examples will  demonstrate how to query MongoDB directly to verify the results of Mongoose operations.  300  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 11   Mongoose  This section demonstrates basic Mongoose concepts that will be explored in detail later in this chapter.   This example involves three steps:           1.  Create a basic Mongoose schema that reflects the structured data in a JSON file.  2.  Read the JSON file and import the data into MongoDB with a Mongoose model.  3.  Run a basic web server that will use a Mongoose model to fetch data from   MongoDB and deliver it to a web browser.  The first line of each listing that follows will show the file path in which the example code may be found.   Subsequent examples will indicate whether a particular example file should be executed with Node.js in a  terminal.  Creating a Mongoose Schema for JSON Data Mongoose documents represent the domain data in an application. For this chapter’s example application,  a JSON file of music albums defines the initial set of data to be added to MongoDB. Listing 11-3 shows the  structure of example-001 albums.json: an array of album objects, each containing information about the  composer, title, publication year, track list, and so forth.  Listing 11-3.  Album JSON Data File     example-001 albums.json [   {     "composer": "Kerry Muzzey",     "title": "Renaissance",     "price": 4.95,     "releaseDate": "2014-01-13T06:00:00.000Z",     "inPublication": true,     "genre": ["Classical", "Trailer Music", "Soundtrack"],     "tracks": [       {         "title": "The Looking Glass",         "duration": {           "m": 3,           "s": 20         }       }         additional tracks...     ]   }     additional albums... ]  Mongoose is an object data mapper  ODM , so at the heart of Mongoose data access are model functions  that can be used to query the MongoDB collections they represent. A Mongoose model must have a name by  which it can be referred, and a schema that enforces the shape of the data it will access and manipulate. The  code in Listing 11-4 creates an album schema that closely matches the JSON data in example-001 albums. json. Schemas will be covered in detail later, but it should be apparent that a schema defines the properties  and their data types for a given Mongoose model. Finally, a model function is created by pairing a name   “Album”  with a schema. This model function is assigned to module.exports in the example-001 album- model.js file so that it can be imported into other modules as needed in a Node.js application.  301  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 11   Mongoose     Tip  a Mongoose schema defines the data structure for a model. the model function provides the query  interface for working with stored document data. a model must have a name and a schema.  Listing 11-4.  Mongoose Album Schema and Model     example-001 album-model.js 'use strict'; var mongoose = require 'mongoose' ;   var albumSchema = mongoose.Schema {   composer: String,   title: String,   price: Number,   releaseDate: Date,   inPublication: Boolean,   genre: [String],   tracks: [     {       title: String,       duration: {         m: Number,         s: Number       }     }   ] } ;   var Album = mongoose.model 'Album', albumSchema ;   module.exports = Album;  Importing Data with Mongoose Now that the Album schema and model are defined, a Node.js script can read the data from albums.json and  use the Album model to create documents in MongoDB. The import script needs to do three things:           1.  Connect to a running MongoDB server with Mongoose  2.  Read and parse the contents of the albums.json file.  3.  Use the Album model to create documents in MongoDB.  Mongoose connects to MongoDB with a URI that identifies the protocol, server, and database that   Mongoose will use. In Listing 11-5 the URI simply points to the local MongoDB instance: mongodb:   localhost music. Mongoose will proactively create the database if it does not already exist on the MongoDB  instance, so there is no need to do so manually. If the MongoDB connection fails, Mongoose will raise an  error event, and if it succeeds, Mongoose will raise an open event. Listing 11-5 demonstrates how both  events are handled with callback functions. Once the open event is emitted, the albums.json file is read and  parsed, and the array of albums is passed to the Album.create   method of the Album model. This creates  the album documents in MongoDB, which may then be queried with the Album model later.  302  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 11   Mongoose  Listing 11-5.  Importing Album Data with Mongoose     example-001 import-albums.js 'use strict'; var mongoose = require 'mongoose' ; var Album = require '. album-model' ; var file2json = require '. file2json' ; var fs = require 'fs' ; var path = require 'path' ;      connect to the "music" database on localhost;    the database will be automatically created    if it does not exist mongoose.connect 'mongodb:  localhost music' ; var db = mongoose.connection;   db.on 'error', function  err  {   console.error err ;   process.exit 1 ; } ;   db.once 'open', function importAlbums   {   var albumsFile = path.join __dirname, 'albums.json' ;   file2json albumsFile, 'utf8', function  err, albums  {     if  err  {       console.error err ;       return process.exit 1 ;     }       console.log 'creating %d albums', albums.length ;          use the model to create albums in bulk;        the collection will be automatically created        if it does not exist     Album.create albums, function  err  {       if  err  {         console.error err ;         return process.exit 1 ;       }       process.exit 0 ;     } ;   } ; } ;  Before running the script, MongoDB needs to be running locally. Some MongoDB installations will   configure MongoDB to start automatically, but others leave that decision to users. To determine if MongoDB  is running, simply execute the mongo command in your terminal. You should see output similar to Listing 11-6  if MongoDB is running. You may kill the process at any time by pressing Ctrl+c.  303  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 11   Mongoose  Listing 11-6.  MongoDB Terminal Client, mongo  $ mongo MongoDB shell version: 2.6.7 connecting to: test >  Listing 11-7.  Starting mongod Manually.   $ mongod -f  usr local etc mongod.conf  Listing 11-8.  Running the Import Script  example-001$ node import-albums.js creating 3 albums  If you receive an error, start the MongoDB server manually by executing mongod -f followed by the  location of the default MongoDB configuration file. The location of this file varies by system, so you may  need to consult the MongoDB installation documentation. On OS X systems with a Homebrew MongoDB  installation, for example, the configuration file may be found at  usr local etc mongod.conf. Listing 11-7  shows how to start the daemon manually with this configuration file path.  Once the mongod server has been started, you can run the example-001 import-albums.js script with  Node.js. Listing 11-8 shows the output that will be displayed when the script has imported documents into  MongoDB.  In Listing 11-9 the mongo terminal client is launched, followed by a series of commands  after each >   prompt  to verify that the music database and albums collection have been created. The show dbs command  displays all databases hosted by the running MongoDB instance. To see the collections in a database, first  switch to that database context by issuing the use   command, where   is the name of the database  you are targeting. Next, execute show collections to see a list of collections owned by the database—in this  case, albums and system.indexes  a collection that MongoDB manages .  Listing 11-9.  Verifying Album Data Has Been Added to MongoDB  $ mongo MongoDB shell version: 2.6.7 connecting to: test > show dbs admin      empty  local     0.078GB music     0.078GB > use music switched to db music > show collections albums system.indexes >  304  With the music database selected, you can issue a few basic queries to see the album data added   during the import. Within a database context, the database collections are accessed through the db object.  Collections exist as properties of the db object, and operations performed against collections are methods on  each collection object, respectively. To see the number of records within the albums collection, for example,   www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 11   Mongoose  the db.albums.count   method can be invoked on the collection, as shown in Listing 11-10. Likewise,  to query album records, the db.albums.find   method can be used with criteria  “where” clause  and  projection  “select” clause  arguments to control what data is returned.  Listing 11-10.  Querying Album Data in the albums Collection  > db.albums.count   3 > db.albums.find {}, {composer: 1}  { "_id" : ObjectId "54c537ca46a13e0f4cebda82" , "composer" : "Kerry Muzzey" } { "_id" : ObjectId "54c537ca46a13e0f4cebda88" , "composer" : "Audiomachine" } { "_id" : ObjectId "54c537ca46a13e0f4cebdaa3" , "composer" : "Jessica Curry" }  Because the criteria argument  the first object passed to db.albums.find    is empty in Listing 11-10,   all records are returned. The projection object, however, specifies a single property to be returned by the  query: composer. All other properties are excluded except for _id, which is returned by default and will  always be included unless the projection parameter specifies otherwise.  Querying Data with Mongoose Once the album data has been loaded into MongoDB, you can use the same model from Listing 11-4 to  query that data.  The code in Listing 11-11 uses the Node.js http module to create a rudimentary web server that can   receive HTTP requests and return JSON data in response. In this example the web server returns the same  response for any URL query  to keep things simple . When a request is received, the Album Mongoose model  is used to query MongoDB for album documents. Its find   function is invoked with a criteria argument,  a projection argument, and a callback. With the exception of the callback, this syntax is identical to the db. albums.find   method used in Listing 11-10 to examine album documents.  Listing 11-11.  Querying MongoDB with Mongoose     example-001 http-server.js 'use strict'; var mongoose = require 'mongoose' ; var Album = require '. album-model' ; var http = require 'http' ; var url = require 'url' ;    *  * The http server will handle requests and responses  *  var server = http.createServer function  req, res  {   Album.find {}, {composer: 1}, function  err, albums  {     var statusCode = err ? 500 : 200;     var payload = err ? err : albums;     res.writeHead statusCode, {'Content-Type': 'application json'} ;     res.write JSON.stringify payload, null, '  '  ;     res.end  ;   } ; } ;    305  www.it-ebooks.info   In Listing 11-12, the web server is launched from the example-001 directory with the command node   http-server.js. Pressing Ctrl+c will stop the server.  The album data fetched from MongoDB may now be viewed in a web browser by navigating to    http:  localhost:8080, or by issuing the curl terminal command as shown in Listing 11-13.  Chapter 11   Mongoose   *  * Connect to the MongoDB instance and report  * errors if any occur.  *  mongoose.connect 'mongodb:  localhost music' ; var db = mongoose.connection;   db.on 'error', function  err  {   console.error err ;   process.exit 1 ; } ;   db.once 'open', function    {    *    * The MongoDB connection is open, start    * listening for HTTP requests.    *    server.listen 8080 ;   console.log 'listening on port 8080' ; } ;  Listing 11-12.

Working with Schemas  Mongoose schemas are simple objects that describe the structure of and data types in a MongoDB  document. While MongoDB itself is schemaless, Mongoose enforces schemas for documents at the  application level. Schemas are defined by invoking the Mongoose module’s Schema   function, passing it an  object hash where the keys represent document properties and the values represent the data type for each  property. The return value is an object of type Schema with additional helper properties and functions for  expanding or augmenting the schema’s definition.  Data Types For scalar properties, Mongoose uses the native JavaScript data types String, Boolean, Number, and Date,  shown in Listing 11-14.  Listing 11-14.  Primitive Types in a Mongoose Schema     example-001 album-model.js var albumSchema = mongoose.Schema {   composer: String,   title: String,   price: Number,   releaseDate: Date,   inPublication: Boolean      other properties... } ;  Properties that are object literals or arrays use the literal notation for each type  {} and [] . Nested  object literals are written inline, using the same Mongoose schema types for their own properties. Array  types contain only one element, which defines the type of object that will occupy the array. This type can be  any valid Mongoose data type, including an object literal defined inline as the first element of the array. In  Listing 11-15, genre is declared as an array of strings while tracks is declared as an array of object literals.  307  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 11   Mongoose  Listing 11-15.  Complex Types in a Mongoose Schema     example-001 album-model.js var albumSchema = mongoose.Schema {      ...other properties   genre: [String],   tracks: [     {       title: String,       duration: {         m: Number,         s: Number       }     }   ] } ;  Mongoose itself provides two special object types: ObjectId and Mixed. When a document is created in MongoDB, it is assigned an _id property that serves as a unique   identifier for the record. This property uses MongoDB’s own ObjectId data type. Mongoose exposes this  type via mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId. This type is rarely used directly. When querying a document by  ID, for example, the string representation of the identifier is typically used.     Note  When a schema property holds arbitrary data  remember, MongoDB is schemaless , it may be  declared with the type mongoose.Schema.Types.Mixed. If a property is marked as Mixed, Mongoose will not  track changes made against it. When Mongoose persists a document, it creates a query internally that only adds  or updates properties that have changed, and since a Mixed property is not tracked, the application must inform  Mongoose when it has changed. Documents created by Mongoose models expose a markModified path   method that will force Mongoose to consider the property identified by the path argument as dirty.  setting a Mongoose schema property to an empty object literal  one with no properties  will cause Mongoose to  treat it as Mixed.  Finally, because Mongoose is a Node.js library, it takes advantage of Node’s Buffer type to store large   blocks of binary data such as image, audio, or video assets. Because binary data can be quite large, many  applications store URL references to binary assets located on a content delivery network such as Amazon’s  Simple Storage Service  S3  instead of storing binaries in a data store such as MongoDB. Use cases differ  across applications, however, and Mongoose schemas are flexible enough to support either approach.  Nested Schemas Mongoose schemas may be nested; that is, a schema may reference another schema as a property type.  This can be particularly useful if larger schemas share common custom data types, such as customer and  order schemas sharing a postal address data type. In Listing 11-16 the album track schema is declared  independent of the album schema, and gets assigned as the data type for the albumSchema.tracks property.  308  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 11   Mongoose  Default Property Values Adding sensible default values to schema properties instructs Mongoose to fill in missing data when a  document is created. This is useful for document properties that aren’t optional but typically hold some  known value.  In Listing 11-17 the m and s properties  minute and second  of the album schema default to zero   because it is entirely possible that a track would be less than one minute long, or be exactly X minutes and  zero seconds. The releaseDate property in the album schema also has a default value: the function Date. now. When a default value is a function, Mongoose will invoke the function, cast its return value to the type  of the property, and then assign that value to the property.  Listing 11-16.  Nested Mongoose Schemas     breaking apart schemas... var trackSchema = mongoose.Schema {   title: String,   duration: {     m: Number,     s: Number   } } ;   var albumSchema = mongoose.Schema {      ...   tracks: [trackSchema] } ;  Listing 11-17.  Default Property Values     adding default property values... var trackSchema = mongoose.Schema {      ...   duration: {     m: {type: Number, default: 0},     s: {type: Number, default: 0}   } } ;   var albumSchema = mongoose.Schema {      ...   price: {type: Number, default: 0.0},   releaseDate: {type: Date, default: Date.now},      ... } ;  Adding a default to a property requires that the type assignment look a bit different. Notice that    m: Number has become m: {type: Number, default: 0}. Normally, assigning an object hash to a property  would cause the property to have a Mixed or object type, but the presence of the type property in the object  literal short-circuits that process and tells Mongoose that the other key value pairs in the hash are property  settings.  309  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 11   Mongoose  Required Properties The required attribute may be used on the type definition of nonoptional properties. When a document is  saved, any missing property that the document schema requires will raise a validation error, which will be  passed to the save operation’s callback. Album composers, album titles, track titles, and even track duration  objects are all required in Listing 11-18.  Listing 11-18.  Required Properties     adding required attributes var trackSchema = mongoose.Schema {   title: {type: String, required: true},   duration: {     required: true,     type: {       m: {type: Number, default: 0},       s: {type: Number, default: 0}     }   } } ;   var albumSchema = mongoose.Schema {   composer: {type: String, required: true},   title: {type: String, required: true},      ... } ;  If a string is used in place of a boolean value for a required attribute, the string will be used as the error   message if a validation error is raised, as shown in Listing 11-19.  Document validation will be covered shortly.   Listing 11-19.  Custom Error Message for a Required Property  var trackSchema = mongoose.Schema {   title: {type: String, required: 'Missing track title!'},      ... } ;  Secondary Indexes Mongoose documents automatically acquire an indexed _id property when saved to MongoDB. Secondary  indexes can be added to a schema, however, to enhance performance when querying against other fields.  MongoDB supports both simple  single field  and compound  multifield  indexes. In Listing 11-20 the   following indexes are added to the track and album schemas:  Track title  simple   Album composer  simple   Album title  simple   Album title + album composer  compound   Album genre  simple    	  	  	  	  	  310  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 11   Mongoose  Listing 11-20.  Adding Secondary Indexes to Schemas     adding secondary indexes... var trackSchema = mongoose.Schema {   title: {type: String, required: true, index: true},      ... } ;   var albumSchema = mongoose.Schema {   composer: {type: String, required: true, index: true},   title: {type: String, required: true, index: true},      ...   genre: {type: [String], index: true},      ... } ;   albumSchema.index {composer: 1, title: 1} ;  Simple indexes are added at the property level by appending an index field to a property type   declaration and setting it to true. Compound indexes, on the other hand, must be defined for the schema  as a whole using the Schema.index   method. The object passed to index   contains property names that  correspond to the schema properties to be indexed, and a numeric value that may be either 1 or -1.  MongoDB sorts indexes in either ascending or descending order. Compound indexes are defined   with a numeric value instead of a boolean value  like simple indexes  to indicate the order in which each  field should be indexed. For simple indexes, the order doesn’t matter because MongoDB can search either  way. But for compound indexes, the order is very important because it limits the kind of sort operations  MongoDB can perform when a query uses a compound index. The MongoDB documentation covers  compound indexing strategies in depth.  In Listing 11-20 a compound index for composer and title is added to the album schema in addition to   simple indexes for both fields. It is entirely likely that a user will search for an album by composer, title, or both.  Schema Validation Mongoose will enforce schema validation rules when documents are persisted. A validation rule is a  function defined for a particular schema property that evaluates the property’s value and returns a boolean  value to indicate validity. Listing 11-21 demonstrates how to attach a property validator to a schema object.  Listing 11-21.  Validating Schema Properties     adding schema validation... var trackSchema = mongoose.Schema { *...* } ;   var albumSchema = mongoose.Schema {      ...   tracks: [trackSchema] } ;   albumSchema.path 'tracks' .validate function  tracks  {   return tracks.length > 0; }, 'Album has no tracks.' ;  311  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 11   Mongoose  The schema’s path   method returns an instance of SchemaType, an object that encapsulates the   definition of a schema’s property—in this case, the tracks property, which is an array of track objects for  the album. The SchemaType.validate   method attaches a validation function to the schema’s property.  The first argument is the actual validation function, which receives, as its only argument, the value to be  validated. The second argument to validate   is the message that will be used if a validation error is raised.  When an album document is saved, this function will be executed as part of the Mongoose validation   process, evaluating the tracks property to ensure that the album has at least one track.  Validation rules may also be attached to schema properties as part of the property definition. The   tracks definition in Listing 11-22 includes the validate property. The value of this property is a two- element array  a tuple  where the validation function is element 0 and the error message is element 1.  Listing 11-22.  Declaring Property Validators Inline  function validateTrackLength  tracks  {   return tracks.length > 0; }   var albumSchema = mongoose.Schema {      ...   tracks: {     type: [trackSchema],     validate: [validateTrackLength, 'Album has no tracks.']   } } ;  While the Mongoose validation process is itself asynchronous, simple validation functions, like those   in Listing 11-22, are synchronous. For most cases synchronous validation is perfectly acceptable, but for  other cases asynchronous validators might be required. An asynchronous validation function accepts a  second argument—a callback called respond  by convention —that will be invoked when the asynchronous  validation has completed. A true or false value is passed to respond to indicate successful or failed  validation, respectively. Listing 11-23 shows how the validation function for album tracks could be made  asynchronous.  Listing 11-23.

Console Output when Schema Validation Fails  example-002$ node import-albums.js creating 3 albums { [ValidationError: Validation failed]   message: 'Validation failed',   name: 'ValidationError',   errors:    { tracks:       { [ValidatorError: Album has no tracks.]         message: 'Album has no tracks.',         name: 'ValidatorError',         path: 'tracks',         type: 'user defined',         value: [] } } }  Validation occurs whenever documents are persisted; that is, whenever Model.create   is called, or the   save   method is called on a document instance. If validation fails, an error is passed as the first argument  to a callback for each of these methods.  Documents will be discussed in detail later.   If the import process is run again, the validator will trigger in example-002 import-albums.js when   Album.create   is called to create new Mongoose documents from the incomplete JSON data. The console  output in Listing 11-25 shows the serialized ValidationError that is raised, and the ValidatorError for the  tracks property present in its errors collection.  After breaking apart the album and track schemas and adding default property values, required   attributes, secondary indexes, and validation, the album schema has changed quite a bit from the simple  schema in example-001. Listing 11-26 shows the more robust version.  313  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 11   Mongoose  Listing 11-26.  More Robust Album Schema     example-002 album.js 'use strict'; var mongoose = require 'mongoose' ;   var trackSchema = mongoose.Schema {   title: {type: String, required: true, index: true},   duration: {     required: true,     type: {       m: {type: Number, default: 0},       s: {type: Number, default: 0}     }   } } ;   var albumSchema = mongoose.Schema {   composer: {type: String, required: true, index: true},   title: {type: String, required: true, index: true},   price: {type: Number, default: 0.0},   releaseDate: {type: Date, default: Date.now},   inPublication: Boolean,   genre: {type: [String], index: true},   tracks: [trackSchema] } ;   albumSchema.index {composer: 1, title: 1} ;   albumSchema.path 'tracks' .validate function  tracks  {   return tracks.length > 0; }, 'Album has no tracks.' ;   var Album = mongoose.model 'Album', albumSchema ;   module.exports = Album;  Schema References Though MongoDB is a relationless data store, relationships between documents in collections can be  created through informal references that act as foreign keys. The integrity enforcement and resolution of  these foreign keys to objects is left entirely to the application, of course. Mongoose builds these informal  relationships through population references—links between schemas that enable automatic eager loading   and manual lazy loading  of document graphs. To expand on the music application example, it is very likely  that users will create their own personal album libraries. Because album documents can be large, it might  be best to avoid duplicating album data in each library document. Instead, references will be created from  library documents to individual albums, a kind of many-to-many relationship. When libraries are loaded by  Mongoose, these references can be resolved so that full library object graphs are returned populated with  album documents.  314  www.it-ebooks.info   To keep things simple, a single library is defined in example-003 library.json. This library, shown  in Listing 11-27, references albums by composer and title. Each album will need to be dereferenced to a  document ID in a corresponding MongoDB album document when the data is imported.  Chapter 11   Mongoose  Listing 11-27.  Library JSON Data     example-003 library.json {   "owner": "Nicholas Cloud",   "albums": [     {       "composer": "Kerry Muzzey",       "title": "Renaissance"     },     {       "composer": "Audiomachine",       "title": "Tree of Life"     },     {       "composer": "Jessica Curry",       "title": "Dear Esther"     }   ] }  The library import script is similar to the album import script, as shown in Listing 11-28, but it  performs one additional important step. After the library.json file is read and turned into a plain  JavaScript object, the album data is resolved to the actual album document objects imported in  example-001 import-albums.js.  Listing 11-28.  Importing Library Data into MongoDB     example-003 import-library.js 'use strict'; var mongoose = require 'mongoose' ; var Album = require '. album-model' ; var Library = require '. library-model' ; var file2json = require '. file2json' ; var fs = require 'fs' ; var path = require 'path' ;   function handleError err  {   console.error err ;   process.exit 1 ; }   function resolveAlbums libraryJSON, cb  {    *    * [3] use a compound $or criteria to look up multiple    * album documents    *   315  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 11   Mongoose    var albumCriteria = {     $or: libraryJSON.albums   };     Album.find albumCriteria, cb ; }   mongoose.connect 'mongodb:  localhost music' ; var db = mongoose.connection; db.on 'error', handleError ; db.once 'open', function importLibrary    {      *    * [1] read the library.json file data and convert it to    * a normal JS object    *    var libraryFile = path.join __dirname, 'library.json' ;   file2json libraryFile, 'utf8', function  err, libraryJSON  {     if  err  return handleError err ;        *      * [2] look up album documents that match each composer title      * in the library JSON data      *      resolveAlbums libraryJSON, function  err, albumDocuments  {       if  err  return handleError err ;         console.log 'creating library' ;          *        * [4] assign the album documents to the library object        *        libraryJSON.albums = albumDocuments;          *        * [5] then create a library document from the JSON data and        * save the document        *        var libraryDocument = new Library libraryJSON ;               libraryDocument.save function  err  {         if  err  return handleError err ;         process.exit 0 ;       } ;     } ;     } ; } ;  316  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 11   Mongoose  Each step in the import flow is annotated in Listing 11-28, but several steps involve concepts that have   not yet been introduced.  In step [3] a compound $or criteria object is created to filter MongoDB album documents by composer   and title. The $or criteria property is covered later in the chapter, but for now it is sufficient to understand  that MongoDB will examine all documents in the albums collection and determine if the document matches  any of the composer title pairs in the $or array, shown in Listing 11-29. Since all three albums previously  imported match at least one of the pairs in this criteria, they will all be returned as results.  Listing 11-29.  Library Import $or Criteria  { $or:    [ { composer: 'Kerry Muzzey', title: 'Renaissance' },      { composer: 'Audiomachine', title: 'Tree of Life' },      { composer: 'Jessica Curry', title: 'Dear Esther' } ] }  In step [4] the found album documents are assigned to the libraryJSON.albums property, replacing the  existing array of composer title data. When the library document is saved, Mongoose will enforce the library  schema in Listing 11-30. Unlike previous property descriptions, the albums property is a reference property  that will hold an array of ObjectIds as defined by the type attribute. The ref attribute tells Mongoose that  this field can also be populated with album documents during a query  if specified , or when a library  document is saved.  Listing 11-30.  Library Schema     example-003 library-model.js 'use strict'; var mongoose = require 'mongoose' ;   var librarySchema = mongoose.Schema {   owner: String,   albums: [{type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Album'}] } ;   var Library = mongoose.model 'Library', librarySchema ;   module.exports = Library;  Mongoose documents may all be cast to their ObjectIds. Mongoose is smart enough to perform   this cast automatically, so adding album documents to the albums property will pass the schema check.  Alternatively, the import script could pluck the _id property from each album document and place it into  the albums array instead. The result would be identical.  Finally, in step [5] an individual document instance is created by invoking the Library constructor  and passing in the raw JSON data to assign to each document property. Documents may also be created  with no constructor argument, assigning data to each property on the instance imperatively, but using the  constructor argument shorthand is common. After the document has been created, its save   method is  invoked with a callback that is passed an error if the persistence process fails. This differs from the album  import script in which multiple album documents were created in MongoDB at once by using the model’s  static create   function. Listing 11-31 demonstrates the difference.  317  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 11   Mongoose  Listing 11-31.  Creating a Single Document and Multiple Documents     create a single document var libraryDocument = new Library plainJSONLibrary ; libraryDocument.save function  err  {...} ;      create multiple documents at once Albums.create arrayOfJSONAlbums, function  err  {...} ;  In Listing 11-32, the library import script is run exactly as the album import script was run.  Listing 11-32.  Running the Library Import Script  example-003$ node import-library.js creating library  Once the import has completed, the library data may be verified with the mongo terminal client. The   output in Listing 11-33 reveals that Mongoose did indeed satisfy the library schema by casting each album  object to its identifier.  The next section, Working with Models and Documents, will examine how schema  reference properties can be used to eagerly load referenced documents.   Listing 11-33.  Verifying the Library Import in MongoDB  example-003$ mongo MongoDB shell version: 2.6.7 connecting to: test   > use music switched to db music   > db.libraries.find   { "_id" : ObjectId "54ed1dfdb11e8ae7252af342" , "owner" : "Nicholas Cloud", "albums" :   [ ObjectId "54ed1dcb6fb525ba25529bd1" , ObjectId "54ed1dcb6fb525ba25529bd7" ,   ObjectId "54ed1dcb6fb525ba25529bf2"  ], "__v" : 0 }  Schema Middleware Mongoose raises events on a schema object whenever particular MongoDB documents are validated, saved,  or removed from a document collection. Events are raised before and after each one of these operations.  Subscriptions to these events are assigned with a schema’s pre   and post   methods, respectively. A  subscription is simply a function, or middleware that receives arguments related to each event. Post-event  middleware simply observes the document after the event is complete, but pre-event middleware may  actually interrupt the document life cycle before an event is completely processed.  In Listing 11-34, a duration object has been added to the library schema, identical to the duration  object in each album track. This object, however, will hold the computed total length of the library as a  whole. A pre-event middleware function is attached to the library schema for the save event. Before the  library is saved, this function will iterate over each album and each track to sum the lengths of all tracks, then  assign the calculated values to properties on the duration object. The middleware function receives a single  argument, the callback function next  . When the duration summation has completed, next   is invoked to  trigger any additional middleware functions attached to the schema.  318  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 11   Mongoose  Listing 11-34.  Pre-save Middleware     example-004 library-model.js 'use strict'; var mongoose = require 'mongoose' ;   var librarySchema = mongoose.Schema {   owner: String,   albums: [{type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Album'}],   duration: {     h: {type: Number, default: 0},     m: {type: Number, default: 0}   } } ;   librarySchema.pre 'save', function  next  {   var hours = 0, mins = 0;    *    * iterate over all albums and add hours    * and minutes    *    this.albums.forEach function  album  {     album.tracks.forEach function  track  {       hours += track.duration.h;       mins += track.duration.m;     } ;   } ;    *    * divide total mins by 60 seconds and    * add that to hours, then assign remaining    * minutes back to mins    *    hours +=  mins   60 ;   mins =  mins % 60 ;   this.duration = {h: hours, m: mins};   next  ; } ;   var Library = mongoose.model 'Library', librarySchema ;   module.exports = Library;  Pre-event middleware can execute in a synchronous or asynchronous manner. The code in Listing 11-34  is synchronous, which means that other middleware functions will be scheduled only after the duration  summation has been completed. To change this behavior and schedule them all immediately, one after  the next, the schema’s pre   method is called with an additional boolean argument that flags the handler  function as asynchronous middleware.  The middleware function itself also receives an additional parameter, the done   function callback   shown in Listing 11-35. In synchronous middleware, control is passed to the next middleware function when  a previous middleware function has finished and invoked next  . This is still the case with asynchronous   319  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 11   Mongoose  middleware, but the done   function must also be invoked when the asynchronous operation has finished  during a future event loop turn. The order of execution in Listing 11-35 is  1.   2.            Schedule the duration summation process for the next event loop pass.  Invoke next   to pass control to the next piece of middleware.  3.  At some future point in time, signal that this middleware operation is complete   by invoking done  .  Listing 11-35.  Asynchronous Pre-save Middleware     example-005 library-model.js    ... librarySchema.pre 'save', true, function  next, done  {     var hours = 0, mins = 0;   process.nextTick function    {                   1      *      * iterate over all albums and add hours      * and minutes      *      this.albums.forEach function  album  {       album.tracks.forEach function  track  {         hours += track.duration.h;         mins += track.duration.m;       } ;     } ;      *      * divide total mins by 60 seconds and      * add that to hours, then assign remaining      * minutes back to mins      *      hours +=  mins   60 ;     mins =  mins % 60 ;     this.duration = {h: hours, m: mins};     done  ;                                        3   } ;     next  ;                                          2 } ;   var Library = mongoose.model 'Library', librarySchema ;   module.exports = Library;  If an error is raised in a synchronous, pre-event middleware function, it should be passed as the only  argument to next  . Errors raised during asynchronous functions, however, should be passed to done    instead. Any error passed to these callbacks will cause the operation that triggered the event to fail, and will be  delivered to the final operation callback  for example, the callback passed to a document’s save   method . Post-event middleware functions receive no control flow arguments, but instead receive a copy of the   document as it stands after the event’s operation has completed.  320  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 11   Mongoose  Working with Models and Documents  A Mongoose model is a constructor function that creates document instances. These instances conform to  a Mongoose schema and expose a collection of methods for document persistence. Models are associated  with MongoDB collections. In fact, when a Mongoose document is saved, the collection to which it  corresponds will be created if it does not already exist. By convention, models are named in the singular  form of the noun they represent  e.g., Album , but collections are named in the plural form  e.g., albums .  A model constructor function is created by invoking mongoose.model   with a model name and  a model schema. All documents created with this constructor function, either directly in user code or  indirectly when Mongoose executes queries and returns document instances, will conform to the model’s  schema. Listing 11-36 shows the code responsible for creating the Album constructor function used by the  import scripts to create album documents in MongoDB.  Listing 11-36.  Album Model     example-006 album-model.js     ...schema definition...   var Album = mongoose.model 'Album', albumSchema ;   module.exports = Album;  When a Mongoose model is registered with the mongoose.model   function, Mongoose can then   resolve that model by name when referenced in relationship properties. This technique was used earlier to  create a reference between the library schema and the Album model, as shown in Listing 11-37.  Listing 11-37.  Library Schema References Album Model     example-006 library-model.js      ... var librarySchema = mongoose.Schema {      ...   albums: [{type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Album'}],      ... } ;  New documents can be created with a model constructor function, or fetched from a MongoDB data   store with model query methods. Each document can save or remove itself from a MongoDB collection. This  is very similar to the ActiveRecord data access pattern commonly used in RDBMS libraries. In Listing 11-38,  a new album document instance is created with the Album constructor function. Album data is assigned to  each property  with the appropriate data types  defined by the album schema. Finally, the save   method  is called on the document, and its callback is invoked when the associated document has been created in  MongoDB.  Listing 11-38.  Creating and Saving a New Document Instance     example-006 add-album-instance.js 'use strict'; var mongoose = require 'mongoose' ; var Album = require '. album-model' ;    321  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 11   Mongoose  function handleError err  {   console.error err ;   process.exit 1 ; }   mongoose.connect 'mongodb:  localhost music' ; var db = mongoose.connection; db.on 'error', handleError ; db.once 'open', function addAlbumInstance   {     var album = new Album  ;   album.composer = 'nervous_testpilot';   album.title = 'Frozen Synapse';   album.price =  8.99;   album.releaseDate = new Date 2012, 8, 6 ;   album.inPublication = true;   album.genre = ['Dance', 'DJ Electronica', 'Soundtrack'];   album.tracks = [     {       title: 'Welcome to Markov Geist',       duration: {m: 1, s: 14}     },        ...additional tracks...   ];     album.save function  err  {     if  err  return handleError err ;     console.log 'album saved', album ;     process.exit 0 ;   } ; } ;  The script output shows the document data after the album has been saved:  example-006$ node add-album-instance.js album saved { __v: 0,   inPublication: true,   title: 'Frozen Synapse',   composer: 'nervous_testpilot',   _id: 54f117e4a27cc5375e156c6d... }  MongoDB can be queried to verify that the document was, in fact, created in the albums collection, as   shown in Listing 11-39.  Listing 11-39.  Verifying the Mongoose Document Has Been Created in MongoDB  example-006$ mongo MongoDB shell version: 2.6.7 connecting to: test > use music switched to db music > db.albums.find {composer: 'nervous_testpilot'}, {_id: 1, composer: 1, title: 1}  { "_id" : ObjectId "54f117e4a27cc5375e156c6d" , "title" : "Frozen Synapse",   "composer" : "nervous_testpilot" }  322  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 11   Mongoose  Document instance properties may also be set by passing an object hash directly to the model   constructor. This can be particularly useful when document data already exists in a plain JavaScript object,  such as a deserialized JSON web request body, or JSON data parsed from a flat file. Listing 11-40 adapts the  previous example to load the new album data from a JSON file, then uses the Album model constructor to  create a document from the new JSON data. Since the JSON data conforms to the album schema  or, in the  case of the releaseDate date string, can be converted directly to the property type Date , the album instance  will be persisted without errors.  Listing 11-40.  Alternative Way to Create a Document with Property Data     example-007 add-album-instance-alt.js 'use strict'; var mongoose = require 'mongoose' ; var Album = require '. album-model' ; var file2json = require '. file2json' ; var path = require 'path' ;   function handleError err  {   console.error err ;   process.exit 1 ; }   mongoose.connect 'mongodb:  localhost music' ; var db = mongoose.connection; db.on 'error', handleError ; db.once 'open', function addAlbumInstance   {     var albumFile = path.join __dirname, 'album.json' ;   file2json albumFile, 'utf8', function  err, albumJSON  {     var album = new Album albumJSON ;     album.save function  err  {       if  err  return handleError err ;       console.log 'album saved', album ;       process.exit 0 ;     } ;   } ;   } ;  Document Instance Methods Documents are more than just data: they may also include custom behavior. When document instances  are created, Mongoose creates a prototype chain with copies of functions defined on the schema object’s  methods property. Document methods defined in this way may access particular document instances with  the this keyword.  Listing 11-41 shows two instance methods defined on the album schema: one to find the next album  track given the previous track’s title, and another that will find similar albums based on shared genres. The  findSimilar   method uses query syntax that will be covered later in the section Working with Queries,  but for now you simply need to know that it effectively finds albums that have genres that overlap with the  instance album and that do not share the same _id as the instance album  so the instance itself is excluded  from the list .  323  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 11   Mongoose  Listing 11-41.  Defining Document Instance Methods in a Schema     example-008 album-model.js      ... var albumSchema = mongoose.Schema { *...* } ;   albumSchema.methods.nextTrack = function  previousTrackTitle  {   var i = 0, len = this.tracks.length;   for  i; i < len; i += 1  {     if  this.tracks[i].title !== previousTrackTitle  {       continue;     }        return the next track, or, if this is the last track,        return the first track     return this.tracks[i + 1]  this.tracks[0];   }   throw new Error 'unable to find track ' + previousTrackTitle ; };   albumSchema.methods.findSimilar = function  cb  {   var criteria = {     _id: {$ne: this._id},     genre: {$in: this.genre}   };   this.model 'Album' .find criteria      .exec cb ; };   var Album = mongoose.model 'Album', albumSchema ;   module.exports = Album;  Listing 11-42.  Using Document Instance Methods     example-008 index01.js 'use strict'; var mongoose = require 'mongoose' ; var Album = require '. album-model' ;   function handleError err  {   console.error err ;   process.exit 1 ; }    324  www.it-ebooks.info  The script in Listing 11-42 loads the album titled Renaissance, then calls album.nextTrack   to   determine which track follows “Fall from Grace.” Then it calls album.findSimilar   to load albums related  to Renaissance and prints their titles and genres to the terminal. The output reveals that there is, indeed,  overlapping genres for each album, and that the instance album itself is not included in the results.   Chapter 11   Mongoose  mongoose.connect 'mongodb:  localhost music' ; var db = mongoose.connection; db.on 'error', handleError ; db.once 'open', function    {   Album.findOne {title: 'Renaissance'}      .exec function  err, album  {       if  err  return handleError err ;         var nextTrack = album.nextTrack 'Fall from Grace' ;       console.log 'next track:', nextTrack.title ;         album.findSimilar function  err, albums  {         if  err  return handleError err ;         console.log 'this album:', album.title, album.genre ;         albums.forEach function  album  {           console.log 'similar album:', album.title, album.genre ;         } ;         process.exit 0 ;       } ;     } ; } ;    example-008$ node index01.js next track: Fall from Grace  Choir Version  this album: Renaissance ["Classical","Trailer Music","Soundtrack"] similar album: Tree of Life ["Classical","Trailer Music"] similar album: Dear Esther ["Classical","Video Game Soundtrack"] similar album: Frozen Synapse ["Dance","Electronica","Soundtrack"]  Document Virtuals Like instance methods, virtual getter and setter properties can be added to documents via the schema. These  virtual properties act like normal data properties but are not persisted when the document is saved. They are  useful for computing and returning values based on document data, or for parsing data that contains, or can  be converted to, values for other document properties.  A virtual getter and setter have been added to the album schema in Listing 11-43 that define a   property, composerInverse, that will get the inversed version of a composer’s name  “last, first”  and set the  composer’s name correctly  “first last”  given an inverse form.  Listing 11-43.  Virtual Document Properties     example-08 album-model.js   var albumSchema = mongoose.Schema { *...* } ;      ... albumSchema.virtual 'composerInverse' .get function    {   var parts = this.composer.split ' ' ;   first last   if  parts.length === 1  {     return this.composer;   }  325  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 11   Mongoose    return [parts[1], parts[0]].join ', ' ;   last, first } ;   albumSchema.virtual 'composerInverse' .set function  inverse  {   var parts = inverse.split ', ' ;   last, first   if  parts.length === 1  {     this.composer = inverse;   }   this.composer = [parts[1], parts[0]].join ' ' ;   first last } ;    ...  The string argument passed to the Schema.virtual   method defines the document path where  the property will reside once a document instance is created. Document virtuals may be assigned to  subdocuments and nested objects as well by specifying the full path starting at the root document. For  example, if the value of the composer property was an object with firstName and lastName properties, the  virtual might live at composer.inverse instead.  The script and subsequent output in Listing 11-44 shows the composerInverse property in action.  Listing 11-44.  Getting and Setting a Virtual Property     example-008 index02.js 'use strict'; var mongoose = require 'mongoose' ; var Album = require '. album-model' ;   function handleError err  {   console.error err ;   process.exit 1 ; }   mongoose.connect 'mongodb:  localhost music' ; var db = mongoose.connection; db.on 'error', handleError ; db.once 'open', function    {   Album.find {} .exec function  err, albums  {     if  err  return handleError err ;       albums.forEach function  album  {       console.log 'album.composer:', album.composer ;       var inverse = album.composerInverse;       console.log 'album.composerInverse:', inverse ;       album.composerInverse = inverse;       console.log 'album.composer:', album.composer ;       console.log  *newline*  ;     } ;       process.exit 0 ;   } ; } ;     326  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 11   Mongoose  example-008$ node index02.js album.composer: Kerry Muzzey album.composerInverse: Muzzey, Kerry album.composer: Kerry Muzzey   album.composer: Audiomachine album.composerInverse: Audiomachine album.composer:  Audiomachine   album.composer: Jessica Curry album.composerInverse: Curry, Jessica album.composer: Jessica Curry   album.composer: nervous_testpilot album.composerInverse: nervous_testpilot album.composer:  nervous_testpilot  Static Model Methods Static methods may also be added to models  not document instances , and are commonly used to  encapsulate complicated criteria construction when querying against a collection. The inPriceRange    method in Listing 11-45 is attached to the album schema’s statics property. It receives two numeric  arguments that represent the lower and upper bounds of a price range, and finds albums that are priced  within that range, inclusively.  Listing 11-45.  Adding a Static Method to a Model     example-009 album-model.js   var albumSchema = mongoose.Schema { *...* } ;      ... albumSchema.statics.inPriceRange = function  lower, upper, cb  {   var criteria = {     price: {$gte: lower, $lte: upper}   };   this.find criteria      .exec cb ; };    ...  When the album model is later created from the schema, any method on statics will be bound to the  model. While the value of this in instance methods is the document itself, the value of the this keyword in  static methods is the model constructor function  e.g., Album . Any function that can be called on the model,  such as find   and create  , may be accessed in a static method.  The script in Listing 11-46 receives two prices as command-line arguments and then finds albums   within the range of those prices. The inPriceRange   method is called on the Album model, just as any other  static method. Encapsulating queries in this manner can be a good way to maintain separate concerns, as  query logic is isolated to models and won’t pollute other portions of the application.  327  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 11   Mongoose  Listing 11-46.  Using Static Model Methods   example-009 index.js  'use strict'; var mongoose = require 'mongoose' ; var Album = require '. album-model' ;   var lower = Number process.argv[2]  0 ; var upper = Number process.argv[3]  lower + 1 ;   console.log 'finding albums between $%s and $%s', lower.toFixed 2 , upper.toFixed 2  ;   function handleError err  {   console.error err ;   process.exit 1 ; }   mongoose.connect 'mongodb:  localhost music' ; var db = mongoose.connection; db.on 'error', handleError ; db.once 'open', function    {   Album.inPriceRange lower, upper, function  err, albums  {     if  err  return handleError err ;     console.log 'found albums:', albums.length ;     albums.forEach function  album  {       console.log album.title, '$' + album.price.toFixed 2  ;     } ;     process.exit 0 ;   } ; } ;    example-009$ node index.js 5.00 10.00 finding albums between $5.00 and $10.00 found albums: 3 Tree of Life $9.49 Dear Esther $6.99 Frozen Synapse $8.99   example-009$ node index.js 9.00 10.00 finding albums between $9.00 and $10.00 found albums: 1 Tree of Life $9.49   example-009$ node index.js 20.00 finding albums between $20.00 and $21.00 found albums: 0     Note  the query examples in the next section do not use static model methods for encapsulation. this is  done to simplify each example, though in a real maintainable application, it might be considered bad practice.  328  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 11   Mongoose  Working with Queries  Mongoose queries are plain objects composed of zero or more properties that specify the parameters of the  query.  An empty query object matches everything.  Properties on these criteria objects share MongoDB’s  native query syntax. Models expose several different query methods that use criteria objects in order to filter  and return Mongoose documents.  For the following examples a web server provides access to MongoDB data via Mongoose models.  To start the web server, ensure that your MongoDB instance is running and then execute the command  in Listing 11-47 in each example directory.  A comment at the top of each code example reveals which  directory it lives in.  The script output will inform you that the web server is running on port 8080. All  interactions with the web server will be demonstrated with the cURL terminal utility available for most  platforms, though each example could be run with any standard HTTP client.  Listing 11-47.  Starting the Web Server in Example 10  example-XYZ$ node index.js listening on port 8080  Model.find   Basic CRUD operations may be conveniently mapped to corresponding Mongoose model functions with  very little effort. The route in Listing 11-48, for example, is a general route that uses Album.find   to locate  album documents that contain properties matching those in the criteria object. The criteria object gets  composer and title parameters from the URL query string if they have been sent as part of the request. If  one or both of these parameters are set on the criteria object, Mongoose will return only documents that  have matching properties  similar to a where clause in traditional SQL . If no parameters are sent, the criteria  object will remain empty and Mongoose will find all album documents.  Listing 11-48.  Finding Albums That Match a Given Criteria     example-010 album-routes.js    **  * GET  album ?composer={string}&title={string}   * @param req  * @param cb  *  routes.GET['^\ album ?:\\?.+ ?$'] = function  req, cb  {   cb = httpd.asJSON cb ;   var criteria = {};   if  req.query.composer  {     criteria.composer = req.query.composer;   }   if  req.query.title  {     criteria.title = req.query.title;   }  329  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 11   Mongoose    Album.find criteria      .sort {composer: 1, title: 1}      .lean true      .exec function  err, albums  {       if  err  return cb 500, err ;       cb 200, albums ;     } ; };  The Album.find   method will return a Mongoose Query object that exposes additional methods for   manipulating the results of the find operation.     Note  Model methods can be invoked in several ways. the first, shown in Listing 11-48, returns a Query  object with a fluent interface that allows query options to be chained together until the Query.exec   method is  called. the second method avoids the Query object altogether. If a callback is passed as the last argument to a  model’s query method  e.g., find {}, function    {...}   the underlying query will be executed immediately  and the error or result passed to the callback. For simple queries, the second method is more terse.  The first Query directive is Query.sort  , which accepts an object that uses MongoDB’s sorting   notation. The properties in this object tell MongoDB which properties in the document should be used for  sorts, and in which direction each sort should be ordered  1 for ascending, -1 for descending . When the  results in Listing 11-48 are fetched, they will be ordered first by composer, then by album title.  After Query.sort  , the Query.lean   method is invoked to instruct Mongoose to deliver plain JSON   objects instead of Mongoose documents as results. By default, Mongoose will always fetch documents,  which carry Mongoose-specific properties and methods for validating, persisting, and otherwise managing  document objects. Since this route  and most routes in this file  simply serialize results and return them to the  client, it is preferable to fetch them as Plain Old JavaScript Objects  or JSON objects  populated only with data.  Once a query has been prepared, its exec   method is passed a callback to receive either an error or  data from the Album.find   operation. The results will be an array of album objects that match whatever  criteria  if any  was used to perform the query.  Several curl commands are shown in Listing 11-49 with various query string parameters. In each case   the output is a serialized JSON array delivered from the web API.     Note  the following examples use MongoDB identifiers that were generated on my computer. these  identifiers will differ on your computer. You may use the mongo terminal client to discover the identifiers  assigned to your MongoDB documents, as demonstrated in previous examples.  Listing 11-49.  Using curl to Find Albums with Various Criteria  example-010$ curl -X GET http:  localhost:8080 album?composer=Kerry%20Muzzey [{"_id":"54ed1dcb6fb525ba25529bd1","composer":"Kerry Muzzey","title":"Renaissance"... ]   example-010$ curl -X GET http:  localhost:8080 album?title=Dear%20Esther [{"_id":"54ed1dcb6fb525ba25529bf2","composer":"Jessica Curry","title":"Dear Esther"... ]    330  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 11   Mongoose  example-010$ curl -X GET   "http:  localhost:8080 album?composer=Audiomachine&title=Tree%20of%20Life" [{"_id":"54ed1dcb6fb525ba25529bd7","composer":"Audiomachine","title":"Tree of Life"... ]  Model.findById    While Album.find   will always fetch an array of documents  even if its criteria specifies a unique identifier ,  Album.findById   will only find a single document that matches a given identifier, if any exist. The route  in Listing 11-50 fetches a single album by albumID—a parameter passed as the last URL segment instead of  the query string. The lean   method is again invoked on the returned Query to eliminate the unnecessary  properties and methods in a full Mongoose document instance.  Listing 11-50.  Finding a Single Album That Matches a Given Criteria     example-010 album-routes.js    **  * GET  album {id}  * @param req  * @param cb  *  routes.GET['^\ album\  [a-z0-9]+ $'] = function  req, cb  {   cb = httpd.asJSON cb ;   var albumID = req.params[0];   Album.findById albumID      .lean true      .exec function  err, album  {       if  err  return cb 500, err ;       cb 200, album ;     } ; };    example-010$ curl -X GET http:  localhost:8080 album 54f3a4df056601726f867685 {"_id":"54f3a4df056601726f867685","composer":"nervous_testpilot","title":"Frozen Synapse"... }  Earlier an additional album was created by the import script example-007 add-album-instance-alt.js,    in which a deserialized JSON object was passed to the Album constructor to create an album instance.  Listing 11-51 demonstrates the same process within an HTTP POST route. The body of the request is  serialized album data that is first converted to a JSON object, then passed to the Album model constructor.  Once the document instance has been created, the save   method validates the data  with rules defined in  the album schema  and creates the new MongoDB document.  Listing 11-51.  Creating a New Album Document     example-010 album-routes.js    **  * POST  album  * @param req  * @param cb  *   331  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 11   Mongoose  routes.POST['^\ album$'] = function  req, cb  {   console.log req.body ;   cb = httpd.asJSON cb ;   var albumJSON = req.body;   var album = new Album albumJSON ;   album.save function  err  {     if  err  return cb 500, err ;     cb 201, album.toObject   ;   } ; };  If validation fails, or if the album otherwise cannot be created, an error will be passed to the final   callback and delivered to the client as an HTTP 500 Internal Server Error. If the album document is  created, the data is passed back to the client as serialized JSON. Unlike previous routes where Query.lean    was used to ensure that only data is serialized, the album document returns its own data in JSON format  when its toObject   method is called. This is the manual equivalent of the process that lean   performs in  a query chain.  The curl request in Listing 11-52 reads the content of example-010 new-album.json and sets it as the   request body. The Content-Type informs the web server to deserialize the payload accordingly.  Listing 11-52.  Creating a New Album with a curl Request  example-010$ curl -X POST http:  localhost:8080 album \ > -d @new-album.json \ > -H "Content-Type: application json" {"_id":"54f66ed2fa4af12b43fee49b","composer":"Aphelion","title":"Memento"... }  The album data in example-010 new-album.json lacks a releaseDate property, a condition that did   not cause the schema validation to fail on import because releaseDate is not required. Indeed, releaseDate  defaults to Date.now, and if queried with the mongo client, will be exactly that. Unfortunately, the album  was not, in fact, released today, so it is necessary to create another route to update the newly minted album  document.  Model.findByIdAndUpdate    An album instance may be updated in a number of ways. The Album.findById   method could fetch the  document, its properties could be set with updated data, then it could be saved back to the data store. Or the  Album.findByIdAndUpdate   method could be used to do all of that at once and return the newly updated  album document, the exact approach taken in Listing 11-53.  Listing 11-53.  Finding and Updating an Album by ID     example-010 album-routes.js  **  * PUT  album {id}  * @param req  * @param cb  *  routes.PUT['^\ album\  [a-z0-9]+ $'] = function  req, cb  {   cb = httpd.asJSON cb ;   var albumID = req.params[0];   var updatedFields = req.body;  332  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 11   Mongoose    Album.findByIdAndUpdate albumID, updatedFields      .lean true      .exec function  err, album  {       if  err  return cb 500, err ;       cb 200, album ;     } ; };  Like Listing 11-51, a serialized JSON object is sent in the body of an HTTP request. This request is a PUT   request, however, and includes the album identifier in the URL. The only data sent in the request body are  the properties to be updated. It is unnecessary to send the full document across the wire because Mongoose  will apply the deltas appropriately. Once the request body is deserialized, the album ID and updated fields  are passed to findByIdAndUpdate  . If the update operation succeeds, the updated document will be passed  to the final query callback, assuming no errors occur.  The curl command in Listing 11-54 creates a PUT request with a simple JSON payload that specifies a  new value for releaseDate. When the request finishes, the printed response shows the updated album data.  Listing 11-54.  Finding and Updating an Album by ID with curl  example-010$ curl -X PUT http:  localhost:8080 album 54f66ed2fa4af12b43fee49b \ > -d '{"releaseDate": "2013-08-15T05:00:00.000Z"}' \ > -H "Content-Type: application json" {"_id":"54f66ed2fa4af12b43fee49b"..."releaseDate":"2013-08-15T05:00:00.000Z"... }  Model.findByIdAndRemove    To remove a document from MongoDB, the DELETE route uses the Album.findByIdAndRemove   method  to look up the MongoDB document and then remove it from the albums collection. The removed album is  passed to the final callback in Listing 11-55 if the operation is successful.  Listing 11-55.  Finding and Removing an Album by ID     example-010 album-routes.js    **  * DELETE  album {id}  * @param req  * @param cb  *  routes.DELETE['^\ album\  [a-z0-9]+ $'] = function  req, cb  {   cb = httpd.asJSON cb ;   var albumID = req.params[0];   Album.findByIdAndRemove albumID      .lean true      .exec function  err, album  {       if  err  return cb 500, err ;       cb 200, album ;     } ; };    example-010$ curl -X DELETE http:  localhost:8080 album 54f3aa9447429f44763f2603 {"_id":"54f66ed2fa4af12b43fee49b","composer":"Aphelion","title":"Memento"... }  333  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 11   Mongoose  A document instance also has a remove   method that can be invoked much like its save   method.  In Listing 11-56 an album instance is fetched by ID. Query.lean   is not called this time because it is the  document, not its plain JSON representation, that will possess a remove   method. Once the instance is  fetched, remove   is called with a callback that will receive an error on failure, or a copy of the removed  document instance if successful.  Listing 11-56.  Removing a Document Instance  Album.findById albumID    .exec function  err, albumInstance  {     albumInstance.remove function  err, removedAlbum  {          album has been removed     } ;   } ;  Model.count    Another useful model method is count  , which receives the same type of criteria objects as the find*    methods, but returns a simple record count instead of full objects. The HTTP route in Listing 11-57 uses the  same query parameters as the general album search and returns the result count in the HTTP response.  Listing 11-57.  Counting Albums That Match Criteria     example-011 album-routes.js    **  * GET  album count ?composer={string}&title={string}   * @param req  * @param cb  *  routes.GET['^\ album\ count ?:\\?.+ ?$'] = function  req, cb  {   cb = httpd.asJSON cb ;   var criteria = {};   if  req.query.composer  {     criteria.composer = req.query.composer;   }   if  req.query.title  {     criteria.title = req.query.title;   }   Album.count criteria      .exec function  err, count  {       if  err  return cb 500, err ;       cb 200, count ;     } ; };    example-011$ curl -X GET http:  localhost:8080 album count 4   example-011$ curl -X GET http:  localhost:8080 album count?composer=Jessica%20Curry 1  334  www.it-ebooks.info   Query.Populate    Earlier, in Listing 11-28, a script was used to add a music library to MongoDB. The library schema defined an  array property, albums, that contained references to album documents, show in Listing 11-58.  Chapter 11   Mongoose  Listing 11-58.  Album References in the Library Schema  var librarySchema = mongoose.Schema {      ...   albums: [{type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Album'}],      ... } ;  Mongoose documents with foreign references can be fetched with or without resolving those references   to other document objects. The route in Listing 11-59 fetches a library by ID, then calls the Query. populate   method to eagerly fetch the associated albums for the library. Mongoose is smart enough to  know that, even though albums is technically an array, the objects it contains actually refer to other album  documents.  Listing 11-59.  Populating Albums with a Library Model     example-011 library-routes.js    **  * GET  library  id   * @param req  * @param cb  *  routes.GET['^\ library\  [a-z0-9]+ $'] = function  req, cb  {   cb = httpd.asJSON cb ;   var libraryID = req.params[0];   Library.findById libraryID      .populate 'albums'      .lean true      .exec function  err, library  {       if  err  return cb 500, err ;       if  !library  return cb 404, {         message: 'no library found for ID ' + libraryID       } ;       cb 200, library ;     } ; }  Figure 11-1 shows a formatted version of the HTTP response. Each album in the albums collection has   been fully dereferenced. Because Query.lean   was also called in the query chain, Mongoose converted the  library and album data into plain JSON objects.  335  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 11   Mongoose  Figure 11-1.  Library population results  Finding Documents with Query Operators At this point the album and library routes consist of basic CRUD operations  create, read, update, and  delete  that form the basis of many web APIs, but more could be done to make the API robust. MongoDB  supports a number of helpful query operators that serve to filter data in specific ways.  The $lt and $gt Operators The $lt and $gt operators can be used to find documents with values that are less than  $lt  or greater than   $gt  some value. The route in Listing 11-60 allows clients to search for albums that have been released on,  before, or after a specific date that is passed to the route as a query parameter.  Listing 11-60.  Finding Albums by Release Date     example-011 album-routes.js    **  * GET  album released MM-DD-YYYY  * GET  album released MM-DD-YYYY before  * GET  album released MM-DD-YYYY after  * @param req  * @param cb  *   336  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 11   Mongoose  routes.GET['^\ album\ released\  [\\d]{2}-[\\d]{2}-[\\d]{4}  ?:\  beforeafter  ?$'] =  function  req, cb  {   cb = httpd.asJSON cb ;   var date = req.params[0];   var when = req.params[1];     var criteria = {releaseDate: {}};   if  when === 'before'  {     criteria.releaseDate.$lt = new Date date ;   } else if  when === 'after'  {     criteria.releaseDate.$gt = new Date date ;   } else {     when = null;     criteria.releaseDate = new Date date ;   }     Album.find criteria      .select 'composer title releaseDate'      .lean true      .exec function  err, albums  {       if  err  return cb 500, err ;       if  albums.length === 0  {         return cb 404, {           message: 'no albums ' +  when  'on'  + ' release date ' + date         } ;       }       cb 200, albums ;     } ; };  To find albums released on a specific date, a normal criteria object is used to map the date value to the   If searching for albums before or after the date, however, the criteria object uses the $lt or $gt operator,   releaseDate property:  {releaseDate: new Date ... }  respectively:  {releaseDate: {$lt: new Date ... } }      or   {releaseDate: {$gt: new Date ... } }  To find albums that were released before, and up to, a specific date, the $lte  “less than or equal”    operator could be used. Likewise, the $gte operator would find albums released from a specific date onward.  To find all albums that were released on any date but the date provided, the $ne  “not equal”  operator  would filter accordingly. Its inverse, $eq, if used alone is functionally equivalent to setting the releaseDate  value on the criteria object directly.  To keep the response small, the Query.select   method is invoked before the query is executed. This   method limits the properties returned from each result object. In this case, the query selects only the composer,  title, and releaseDate properties, all included in a space-separated string. All other properties are ignored.  337  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 11   Mongoose  Listing 11-61 shows the filtered JSON data returned for each kind of release date query.  Listing 11-61.  Using curl to Find Albums by Release Date  example-011$ curl -X GET http:  localhost:8080 album released 01-01-2013 {"message":"no albums on release date 01-01-2013"}   example-011$ curl -X GET http:  localhost:8080 album released 01-01-2013 before [{"_id":"54ed1dcb6fb525ba25529bf2","composer":"Jessica Curry","title":"Dear  Esther","releaseDate":"2012-02-14T06:00:00.000Z"},{"_id":"54f3a4df056601726f867685",  "composer":"nervous_testpilot","title":"Frozen Synapse","releaseDate":"2012-09- 06T05:00:00.000Z"}]   example-011$ curl -X GET http:  localhost:8080 album released 01-01-2013 after [{"_id":"54ed1dcb6fb525ba25529bd1","composer":"Kerry Muzzey","title":"Renaissance",  "releaseDate":"2014-01-13T06:00:00.000Z"},{"_id":"54ed1dcb6fb525ba25529bd7","composer":  "Audiomachine","title":"Tree of Life","releaseDate":"2013-07-16T05:00:00.000Z"}]  Notice that, even though the Query.select   filter did not specify the _id property for inclusion, it  is still present in each response. To omit this property, a negation needs to be added to the select string.  Prefixing the _id property with a minus sign will prevent it from being selected:  Album.find ...    .select '-_id composer title releaseDate'       ...   the _id property is the only property that may be specified for exclusion when an inclusive select      Note   one that specifies the properties to be fetched  is performed. otherwise, excluded and included properties may  not be mixed. a query is either selecting only specific properties or excluding only specific properties, but not  both. If any property in a Query.select   string is negated  except for _id , all specified properties must be  negated or an error will be raised.  The $in and $nin Operators It is often helpful to select documents with property values that match some subset of possibilities. The  $in operator  and its inverse, $nin  tests a document property value against each element in an array. The  document fulfills the criteria if its property matches at least one of the elements in the array. To find albums  from two composers, for example, the criteria object in Listing 11-62 might be used.  Listing 11-62.  Using the $in Query Operator to Filter by Composer  {composer: {$in: ['Kerry Muzzey', 'Jessica Curry']}}  The $nin operator does the exact opposite: it will match only if the property value is not included in the   specified set.  338  www.it-ebooks.info   Both $in and $nin work for properties with scalar values  like strings, numbers, dates, etc. , but they   can also be used to search within collections. The web route in Listing 11-63 accepts a music genre as a URL  parameter and returns related genres in the HTTP response.  Chapter 11   Mongoose  Listing 11-63.  Using the $in Query Operator to Filter by Genre     example-011 album-routes.js    **  * GET  album genre  genre  related  * @param req  * @param cb  *  routes.GET['^\ album\ genre\  [a-zA-Z]+  related$'] = function  req, cb  {   cb = httpd.asJSON cb ;   var principalGenre = req.params[0];   var criteria = {     genre: {$in: [principalGenre]}   };   Album.find criteria      .lean true      .select '-_id genre'      .exec function  err, albums  {       if  err  return cb 500, err ;       var relatedGenres = [];       albums.forEach function  album  {         album.genre.forEach function  albumGenre  {              don't include the principal genre           if  albumGenre === principalGenre  return;              ensure duplicates are ignored           if  relatedGenres.indexOf albumGenre  < 0  {             relatedGenres.push albumGenre ;           }         } ;       } ;       cb 200, {genre: principalGenre, related: relatedGenres} ;     } ; };    example-011$ curl -X GET http:  localhost:8080 album genre Dance related {"genre":"Dance","related":["Electronica","Soundtrack"]}  To determine what constitutes a “related” genre, the criteria object selects albums that have the   principal genre as an element in each document’s genre array. It then compiles a list of all other genres that  have been assigned to albums in the result set and returns that list to the client. Though Album.genre is an  array, MongoDB knows to traverse it for values that match the elements in the $in operator. The Query. select   method excludes the _id property and includes only the genre property, since it alone contains  the data in which this route is interested.  The $in operator is useful for finding elements in arrays of scalar values, but a different approach  is needed when searching arrays of complex objects. Each subdocument in Album.tracks has its own  properties and values, for example. To search for albums with tracks that meet some criteria, properties   339  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 11   Mongoose  for tracks can be referenced with their full property paths, starting from the album itself. In Listing 11-64,  albums will be fetched that posses any track with a title property that matches the value for tracks.title  in the criteria object.  Listing 11-64.  Using a Subdocument Path in a Criteria Object     example-012 album-routes.js  **  * GET  album ?composer={string}&title={string}&track={string}   * @param req  * @param cb  *  routes.GET['^\ album ?:\\?.+ ?$'] = function  req, cb  {   cb = httpd.asJSON cb ;   var criteria = {};      ...   if  req.query.track  {     criteria['tracks.title'] = req.query.track;   }      ...   Album.find criteria      .lean true      .exec function  err, albums  {       if  err  return cb 500, err ;       cb 200, albums ;     } ; };    example-012$ curl -X GET http:  localhost:8080 album?track=The%20Looking%20Glass [{"_id":"54ed1dcb6fb525ba25529bd1","composer":"Kerry Muzzey","title":"Renaissance"... }  The $and and $or Operators Simple criteria objects can query a property by using normal object notation. For example, to find an album  that is in publication, the simple criteria object in Listing 11-65 would be sufficient.  Listing 11-65.  Simple Criteria Object  Album.find {inPublication: true}, function  err, albums  { *...* } ;  This approach is insufficient for complicated, compound queries, however, such as the pseudo-query in   Listing 11-66.  Listing 11-66.  Painful Pseudo-Query   select albums that          are in publication and were released within the last two years  or      are categorized as classical and priced between $9 and $10         340  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 11   Mongoose  Fortunately, the $and and $or operators can be used to construct a criteria object that will produce the   desired set of albums. Both operators accept an array of criteria objects that may contain simple queries,  or complex queries that also contain $and, $or, or any other valid query operators. The $and operator  performs a logical AND operation using each criteria object in its array, selecting only documents that match  all specified criteria. In contrast, the $or operator performs a logical OR operation, selecting documents that  match any of its criteria.  In Listing 11-67, the album recommendations route composes a criteria object that uses both  compound operators. Note that whereas the keys in simple criteria objects are property names, in  compound criteria objects the keys are the compound operators followed by arrays of simple and or  complex criteria objects.  Listing 11-67.  Using $and and $or to Find Album Recommendations     example-012 album-routes.js  **  * GET  album recommended  * @param req  * @param cb  *  routes.GET['^\ album\ recommended$'] = function  req, cb  {   cb = httpd.asJSON cb ;   var nowMS = Date.now  ;   var twoYearsMS =  365 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 * 2 ;   var twoYearsAgo = new Date nowMS - twoYearsMS ;     var criteria = {     $or: [          match all of these conditions...       { $and: [{inPublication: true}, {releaseDate: {$gt: twoYearsAgo}}] },          OR          match all of these conditions...       { $and: [{genre: {$in: ['Classical']}}, {price: {$gte: 5, $lte: 10}}] }     ]   };     Album.find criteria      .lean true      .select '-_id -tracks'      .exec function  err, albums  {       if  err  return cb 500, err ;       cb 200, albums ;     } ; };    example-012$ curl -X GET http:  localhost:8080 album recommended [{"composer":"Kerry Muzzey","title":"Renaissance","price":4.95... },  {"composer":"Audiomachine","title":"Tree of Life","price":9.49... },  {"composer":"Jessica Curry","title":"Dear Esther","price":6.99... }]  341  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 11   Mongoose  The $regex Operator Often, searching for documents that match a precise text field query yields suboptimal results. Regular  expressions can be used to broaden these searches so that documents are selected with fields that resemble  a particular query parameter. In SQL-based languages, the like operator can be used for this purpose, but  MongoDB favors regular expressions. The $regex operator adds a regular expression to a criteria object  property, selecting documents that match the regular expression and excluding those that do not. It is often  paired with the $options operator which may contain any valid regular expression flag such as i  case- insensitive . The route in Listing 11-68 accepts a query parameter, owner, which is converted to a regular  expression and applied against the owner property of every library document.  Listing 11-68.  Finding a Library with a Regular Expression     example-012 library-routes.js  **  * GET  library?  * @param req  * @param cb  *  routes.GET['^\ library ?:\\?.+ ?$'] = function  req, cb  {   cb = httpd.asJSON cb ;   var criteria = {};   if  req.query.owner  {     criteria.owner = {       $regex: '^.*' + req.query.owner + '.*$',       $options: 'i'     }   } else {     return cb 404, {message: 'please specify an owner'} ;   }   Library.find criteria      .populate 'albums'      .exec function  err, libraries  {       if  err  return cb 500, err ;       cb 200, libraries ;     } ; };  The criteria object specifies the property against which the regular expression will be applied, and an   object that includes both the expression  the $regex property  and any options to apply while matching  the  $options property . In Listing 11-69 the curl command uses the owner cloud is as a query string parameter.  Since the regular expression in Listing 11-68 above surrounds the query parameter with the regular  expression wildcard .*, and since the regular expression options specify the case-insensitive option i, the  route will return the only library in MongoDB, owned by Nicholas Cloud. Listing 11-69 shows the curl  command and HTTP response output.  Listing 11-69.  Finding a Library by Owner with cURL   curl -X GET http:  localhost:8080 library?owner=cloud [{"_id":"54ed249312c06b3726d3abcd","owner":"Nicholas Cloud"... ]  342  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 11   Mongoose  Advanced Query Operators There are many more MongoDB operators that may be used in Mongoose queries, and while an in-depth  analysis of each warrants many more pages, Table 11-3 provides a high-level overview of additional  advanced query operators.  Table 11-3.  Additional Advanced Query Operators  Operator  Description  $not, $nor  $exists  $type  $mod  $all  $size  Negative logical operators that combine query clauses and select documents that match  accordingly Selects documents where the specified property exists  remember, MongoDB documents  are technically schemaless  Selects documents where the specified property is of a given type Selects documents where a modulo operator on a specified field returns a specified result   e.g., select all albums where the price is divisible evenly by 3.00  Selects documents with an array property that contains all specified elements Selects documents with an array property of a given size  $elemMatch  Selects documents where a subdocument in an array matches more than one condition  Summary  MongoDB is schemaless and extremely flexible by design, but application developers often add constraints  on data in application code to enforce business rules, ensure data integrity, conform to existing application  abstractions, or achieve any number of other goals. Mongoose recognizes and embraces this reality, and  rests snugly between application code and the data store.  Mongoose schemas add constraints to otherwise free-form data. They define the shape and validity   of the data to be stored, enforce constraints, create relationships between documents, and expose the  document life cycle via middleware.  Models provide a full but extensible query interface. Criteria objects that conform to MongoDB query   syntax are used to find specific data. Chainable query methods give developers control over the property  selection, reference population, and whether full documents or plain JSON objects are retrieved. Custom  static methods that encapsulate complicated criteria objects and more involved queries can be added to  models to keep application concerns properly segregated.  Finally, Mongoose documents can be extended with custom instance methods that contain domain   logic, and custom getters and setters that aid in computed property manipulation.  343  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 12  Knex and Bookshelf  The report of my death was an exaggeration.  —Samuel Langhorne Clemens  Mark Twain   In this chapter, we will explore two libraries that work together to ease many of the difficulties that Node.js  developers often encounter when working with relational databases. The first, Knex, provides a flexible and  consistent interface for interacting with several well-known SQL platforms such as MySQL and PostgreSQL.  The second, Bookshelf, builds on this foundation by providing developers with a powerful object-relational  mapping  ORM  library that simplifies the process of modeling the entities that comprise an application’s  data structure, along with the various relationships that exist between them. Readers who are familiar with  Backbone.js and its emphasis on structuring data within Models and Collections will quickly find themselves  at home with Bookshelf, as the library follows many of the same patterns and provides many of the same APIs.  In this chapter, you will learn how to do the following:   	 Create SQL queries with the Knex query builder  	 Create complex database interactions without resorting to nested callback functions,   with the help of promises  Ensure the integrity of your application’s data through the use of transactions   	  	 Manage changes to your database’s schema with the help of Knex migration scripts  	  	 Define one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships between   Bootstrap your database with sample data using Knex seed scripts   	 Use eager loading to efficiently retrieve complex object graphs based on Bookshelf   Bookshelf models  relationships     Note  Most of the examples in this chapter make heavy use of the promise-based and Underscore-inspired  APIs that both Bookshelf and Knex provide. As a result, readers who are unfamiliar with either of these concepts  are encouraged to first read Chapter 17, which covers Q, and 19, which covers Underscore and Lo-Dash.  345  www.it-ebooks.info   ChAPter 12   Knex AnD BooKsheLf  Knex  Knex provides a database abstraction layer  DBAL  for MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, and SQLite3, a unified  interface through which developers can interact with each of these Structured Query Language  SQL   databases without having to concern themselves with minor variations in syntax and response format that  exist between each platform. Applications backed by such relational databases can benefit from a number of  Knex features, including these:  A promise-based interface that allows for cleaner control of asynchronous processes   	  	  	 Unified interfaces through which queries and schemas for each supported platform   A stream interface for efficiently piping data through an application as needed  can be created   	  Transaction support  the following:  In addition to the library itself, Knex also provides a command-line utility with which developers can do    	 Create, implement, and  when necessary  revert database migrations, scripted  schema changes that can then be committed with an application’s source code  	 Create database “seed” scripts, a consistent method by which an application’s  database can be populated with sample data for local development and testing  Each of these subjects will be covered in more detail throughout this chapter.  Installing the Command-Line Utility Before going any further, you should ensure that you have installed the command-line utility provided by  Knex. Available as an npm package, the installation process is shown in Listing 12-1.  Listing 12-1.  Installing the knex Command-Line Utility via npm  $ npm install -g knex$ knex --version Knex CLI version:  0.7.3  Adding Knex to Your Project In addition to installing the knex command-line utility, you will also need to add the knex npm module as a  local dependency within each project in which you intend to use it, along with a supported database library,  as shown in Listing 12-2.  Listing 12-2.  Installing Knex and a Supported Database Library As a Local Project Dependency via npm  $ npm install knex --save  Supported database libraries include  be sure to --save : $ npm install mysql $ npm install mariasql $ npm install pg $ npm install sqlite3  346  www.it-ebooks.info   ChAPter 12   Knex AnD BooKsheLf     Note  sQLite implements a self-contained, serverless database within a single file on your disk and requires  no additional tools. If you don’t have access to a database server such as MysQL at the moment, the sqlite3  library will provide you with a quick and easy way to begin experimenting with Knex without requiring additional  setup. The examples referenced throughout this chapter will use this library.  Configuring Knex With your dependencies now in place, all that remains is to initialize Knex within your project. Listing 12-3  shows what that process looks like if you happen to be using MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MariaDB, while   Listing 12-4 shows how to initialize Knex for use with SQLite3.  Listing 12-3.  Initializing Knex for Use with MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MariaDB  Substitute mysql for pg or  mariasql As Needed    var knex = require 'knex'  {     'client': 'mysql',     'connection': {         'host': '127.0.0.1',         'user': 'user',         'password': 'password',         'database': 'database'     },     'debug': false    Set this to true to enable debugging for all queries } ;  Listing 12-4.  Initializing Knex for Use with SQLite3     example-sqlite-starter lib db.js   var knex = require 'knex'  {     'client': 'sqlite3',     'connection': {         'filename': 'db.sqlite'     } } ;  As you can see, the configuration settings required for SQLite3 are quite a bit simpler than those   required for other, more full-featured solutions. Instead of providing connection settings, we simply provide  the name of a file  db.sqlite  in which SQLite will store its data.  The SQL Query Builder The primary focus of Knex is on providing developers with a unified interface through which they can  interact with multiple, SQL-based databases without having to worry about minor variations in syntax and  response format that exist between each of them. To that end, Knex provides a number of methods, most of  which fall into one of two categories: query builder methods and interface methods.  347  www.it-ebooks.info   ChAPter 12   Knex AnD BooKsheLf  Query Builder Methods Query builder methods are those that aid developers in the creation of SQL queries. Examples of such  methods include select  , from  , where  , limit  , and groupBy  . At last count, Knex provides more  than 40 such methods, with which platform-agnostic queries can be created. Listing 12-5 shows a simple  SQL query, along with an example demonstrating how such a query can be created using Knex.  Listing 12-5.  Example Demonstrating the Creation of a Simple SQL Query Using Knex     example-sqlite-starter example1.js    SELECT id, name, postal_code FROM cities;knex.select 'id', 'name', 'postal_code' . from 'cities' ;  While the example shown in Listing 12-5 demonstrates the basic method by which SQL queries can   be created with Knex, it does little to convey the true value of the library. That value should start to become  more apparent as we take a look at the various interface methods that Knex provides. It is with these  methods that we can begin to submit our queries and process their resulting data.  Interface Methods Knex provides a number of interface methods that allow us to submit and process our queries in several  convenient ways. In this section, we’ll take a look at two of the most useful approaches that are available to us.  Promises The event-driven nature of JavaScript makes it well suited for efficiently handling complex, asynchronous  tasks. Traditionally, JavaScript developers have managed asynchronous control flow through the use of  callback functions, as shown in Listing 12-6.  Listing 12-6.  Simple Callback Function  var request = require 'request' ; request {     'url': 'http:  mysite.com',     'method': 'GET' }, function err, response  {     if  err  throw new Error err ;     console.log response ; } ;  Callback functions allow us to defer the execution of a particular sequence of code until the appropriate   time. Such functions are easy to understand and implement. Unfortunately, they are also very difficult  to manage as applications grow in complexity. Imagine a scenario in which additional asynchronous  processes must run after the initial response is received in Listing 12-6. To do so would require the use of  additional, nested callback functions. As additional asynchronous steps are added to this code, we begin to  experience what many developers refer to as “callback hell” or the “pyramid of doom,” terms that describe  the unmaintainable mass of spaghetti code that frequently results from such an approach.  Fortunately, JavaScript promises provide developers with a convenient solution to this problem—a   solution that Knex makes extensive use of through its promise-based interface for submitting and processing  queries. Listing 12-7 shows this API in action.  348  www.it-ebooks.info   ChAPter 12   Knex AnD BooKsheLf  Listing 12-7.  Demonstration of the Promise-Based API Provided by Knex     example-sqlite-starter example2.js   knex.pluck 'id' .from 'cities' .where 'state_id', '=', 1      .then function cityIds  {         return knex.select 'id', 'first_name', 'last_name' .from 'users'          .whereIn 'city_id', cityIds ;     }      .then function users  {         return [             users,             knex.select '*' .from 'bookmarks' .whereIn 'user_id', _.pluck users, 'id'           ];     }      .spread function users, bookmarks  {         _.each users, function user  {             user.bookmarks = _.filter bookmarks, function bookmark  {                 return bookmark.user_id = user.id;         } ;     } ;     console.log JSON.stringify users, null, 4  ;     }      .catch function err  {         console.log err ;     } ;  In this example, three queries are submitted in succession:  1.  Cities within a particular state are selected.  2.  Users who live within the returned cities are selected.  3.  Bookmarks for each of the returned users are selected.           After our final query has returned, we then attach each bookmark to the appropriate user and display   the result, which you can see in Listing 12-8.  Listing 12-8.  Data Logged to the Console As a Result of the Code in Listing 12-7  [     {         "id": 1,         "first_name": "Steve",         "last_name": "Taylor",         "bookmarks": [             {                 "id": 1,                 "url": "http:  reddit.com",                 "label": "Reddit",                 "user_id": 1,                 "created_at": "2015-03-12 12:09:35"             },  349  www.it-ebooks.info   ChAPter 12   Knex AnD BooKsheLf              {                 "id": 2,                 "url": "http:  www.theverge.com",                 "label": "The Verge",                 "user_id": 1,                 "created_at": "2015-03-12 12:09:35"             }         ]     } ]  Thanks to the promise-based interface provided by Knex, at no point does our code ever reach beyond   one level of indentation, thereby ensuring that our application remains easy to follow. More importantly,  should an error occur at any point during this process, it would be conveniently caught and handled by our  final catch statement.     Note  Javascript promises are a powerful tool for writing complex, asynchronous code in a manner that is  easy to follow and maintain. If you are unfamiliar with this concept, you are encouraged to skip to Chapter 17  and read about the Q promise library for more in-depth information on this subject.  Streams One of the biggest benefits to writing applications with Node.js is the platform’s ability to execute I O- intensive procedures in a very efficient manner. Unlike synchronous languages such as PHP, Python,  or Ruby, Node.js is capable of handling thousands of simultaneous connections within a single thread,  allowing developers to write applications capable of meeting enormous demands, while using minimal  resources. Node.js provides several important tools for accomplishing this feat, one of the most important of  which is streams.  Before we take a look at streams, let’s examine another example of a traditional JavaScript callback   function, as shown in Listing 12-9.  Listing 12-9.  JavaScript Callback Function That Accepts the Contents of a Loaded File  var fs = require 'fs' ; fs.readFile 'data.txt', 'utf8', function err, data  {     if  err  throw new Error err ;     console.log data ; } ;  In this example, we use the readFile   method of the native fs library available within Node.js to read  the contents of a file. Once that data is loaded into memory  in its entirety , it is then passed to our callback  function for further processing. This approach is simple and easily understood. However, it’s not very  efficient, as our application must first load the entire contents of the file into memory before passing it back  to us. This isn’t a terrible problem for smaller files, but larger files may begin to cause issues, depending on  the resources available to the server that happens to be running this application.  Node.js streams resolve this issue by piping data through one or more functions in multiple, smaller   chunks. By doing so, streams allow developers to avoid dedicating large portions of a server’s available  resources for any single request. The example shown in Listing 12-10 accomplishes the same goal of our  previous example, without loading the contents of the entire file into memory all at once.  350  www.it-ebooks.info   Listing 12-10.  Pair of Node.js Streams Working Together to Efficiently Load and Display   the Contents of a File  ChAPter 12   Knex AnD BooKsheLf     example-read-file-stream index.js   var fs = require 'fs' ; var Writable = require 'stream' .Writable; var stream = fs.createReadStream 'data.txt' ; var out = Writable  ; out._write = function chunk, enc, next  {     console.log chunk.toString   ;     next  ; }; stream.pipe out ;  Streams are a relatively underutilized feature of Node.js, which is unfortunate, as they happen to be   one of the more powerful aspects of the platform. Fortunately, Knex provides a streaming interface for  consuming query results that allows us to take advantage of these benefits, as shown in Listing 12-11.  Listing 12-11.  Processing the Results of a Query via the Streaming Interface Provided by Knex  var Writable = require 'stream' .Writable; var ws = Writable  ; ws._write = function chunk, enc, next  {     console.dir chunk ;     next  ; }; var stream = knex.select '*' .from 'users' .stream  ; stream.pipe ws ;  In this example, the results of our query on the users table  which could be quite large for some   applications  are streamed in smaller chunks to our writable stream, instead of being passed along in their  entirety. This approach can also be paired with the library’s promise interface to create a more robust  implementation, as shown in Listing 12-12.  Listing 12-12.  Combining the Streaming and Promise-Based Interfaces Provided by Knex for Better   Error Handling  var Writable = require 'stream' .Writable; var ws = Writable  ; ws._write = function chunk, enc, next  {     console.dir chunk ;     next  ; }; knex.select '*' .from 'users' .stream function stream  {     stream.pipe ws ; } .then function   {     console.log 'Done.' ; } .catch function err  {     console.log err ; } ;  351  www.it-ebooks.info   ChAPter 12   Knex AnD BooKsheLf  In this example, we combine the power of the streaming and promise-based interfaces provided by   Knex. When a callback function is passed to the library’s stream   method, that callback function receives  the generated promise as opposed to being returned directly. Instead, a promise is returned, which is  resolved once the stream is complete.     Note  the streaming interface provided by Knex is compatible with MysQL, PostgresQL, and MariaDB  databases. sQLite3 is not currently supported.  Transactions One of the biggest benefits to using ACID-compliant, relational databases lies in their ability to group  multiple queries into a single unit of work  i.e., a “transaction”  that will either succeed or fail as a whole. In  other words, should a single query within the transaction fail, any changes that may have occurred as a result  of previously run queries within the transaction would be reverted.  By way of an example, consider a financial transaction that occurs at your bank. Suppose you wanted to   send $25 to your cousin on her birthday. Those funds would first have to be withdrawn from your account  and then inserted into your cousin’s account. Imagine a scenario in which the application enabling that  exchange of funds were to crash for any number of reasons  e.g., a faulty line of code or a larger system  failure  after those funds were removed from your account, but before they were inserted into your cousin’s  account. Without the safety net provided by transactions, those funds would have essentially vanished into  thin air. Transactions allow developers to ensure that such processes only ever happen in full—never leaving  data in an inconsistent state.   the acronym ACID  Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability  refers to a set of properties that      Note  describe database transactions. Atomicity refers to the fact that such transactions can either succeed in their  entirety or fail as a whole. such transactions are said to be “atomic.”  Previous examples within this chapter have demonstrated the process of creating and submitting   database queries with Knex. Before we continue, let’s review another example that does not take advantage  of transactions. Afterward, we’ll update this example to take advantage of the peace of mind that  transactions provide.  In the example shown in Listing 12-13, a moveFunds   function is declared that, when called, uses the   knex object to move the specified amount of funds from one account to another. This function returns a  promise that is either resolved or rejected once this process completes, depending on the success or failure  of the call. A glaring error exists here—can you spot it?  Listing 12-13.  moveFunds   Function Demonstrating the Process of Moving Funds from One Account to  Another Without the Security of Transactions     example-financial bad.js    **  * Moves the specified amount of funds from sourceAccountID to destAccountID  *  var moveFunds = function sourceAccountID, destAccountID, amount  {    352  www.it-ebooks.info   ChAPter 12   Knex AnD BooKsheLf      return knex.select 'funds' .from 'accounts'          .where 'id', sourceAccountID          .first function result  {             if  !result  {                 throw new Error 'Unable to locate funds for source account' ;             }             if  result.funds < amount  {                 throw new Error 'Not enough funds are available in account' ;             }             return knex 'accounts' .where 'id', sourceAccountID .update {                     'funds': result.funds - amount             } ;         } .then function   {             return knex.select 'funds' .from 'accounts'                  .where 'id', destAccountID ;         } .first function result  {             if  !result  {                 throw new Error 'Unable to locate funds for destination account' ;             }             return knex 'accounts' .where 'id', destAccountID .update {                     'funds': result.funds + amount                 } ;         } ;   };    * Move $25 from account 1 to account 2. *  moveFunds 1, 2, 25 .then function result  {     console.log 'Transaction succeeded.', result ; } .catch function err  {     console.log 'Transaction failed!', err ; } ;  In this example, the following steps are required to accomplish the goal of moving funds from a source   account to a destination account:                    1.  The total funds currently available within the source account are determined.  2.   If insufficient funds are available to complete the process, an error is thrown.  3.  The funds to be transferred are deducted from the source account.  4.  The total funds currently available within the destination account are   determined.  5.   If the destination account cannot be found, an error is thrown.  6.  The funds to be transferred are added to the destination account.  If you haven’t spotted the mistake already, a glaring problem presents itself at step 5. In the event that  the destination account cannot be found, an error is thrown, but at this point the funds to be moved have  already been deducted from the source account! We could attempt to solve this problem in a number of  ways. We could catch the error within our code and then credit the funds back to the source account, but this  would still not account for unforeseen errors that could arise due to network problems or in the event that  our application server were to lose power and completely crash in the middle of this process.  353  www.it-ebooks.info   ChAPter 12   Knex AnD BooKsheLf  It is at this point that the power of database transactions starts to become evident. In Listing 12-14, our   moveFunds   function is refactored to wrap this entire procedure into a single, “atomic” transaction that  will either succeed or fail as a whole. Note the creation of the trx object, from which our transaction-aware  queries are built.  Listing 12-14.  Transaction-Aware Implementation of Listing 12-13     example-financial index.js    **  * Moves the specified amount of funds from sourceAccountID to destAccountID  *  var moveFunds = function sourceAccountID, destAccountID, amount  {       return knex.transaction function trx  {           return trx.first 'funds'              .from 'accounts'              .where 'id', sourceAccountID              .then function result  {                 if  !result  {                     throw new Error 'Unable to locate funds for source account' ;                 }                 if  result.funds < amount  {                     throw new Error 'Not enough funds are available in account' ;                 }                 return trx 'accounts' .where 'id', sourceAccountID                      .update {                         'funds': result.funds - amount                     } ;             }              .then function   {                 return trx.first 'funds'                      .from 'accounts'                      .where 'id', destAccountID ;             }              .then function result  {                 if  !result  {                     throw new Error 'Unable to locate funds for destination account' ;                 }                 return trx 'accounts' .where 'id', destAccountID                      .update {                         'funds': result.funds + amount                     } ;             } ;       } ;   };    354  www.it-ebooks.info   ChAPter 12   Knex AnD BooKsheLf   * Move $25 from account 1 to account 2. *  displayAccounts       .then function   {         return moveFunds 1, 2, 25 ;     } .then function   {         console.log 'Transaction succeeded.' ;     } .catch function err  {         console.log 'Transaction failed!', err ;     } ;  As you can see, the transaction-aware example shown in Listing 12-14 largely resembles that shown   in Listing 12-13, but it does differ in one important way. Instead of creating our query by calling builder  methods directly on the knex object, we first initiate a transaction by calling knex.transaction  . The callback  function that we provide is then passed a “transaction-aware” stand-in  trx  from which we then begin to  create our series of queries. From this point forward, any queries that we create from the trx object will either  succeed or fail as a whole. The knex.transaction   method returns a promise that will be resolved or rejected  once the transaction as a whole is complete, allowing us to easily integrate this transaction into an even  larger series of promise-based actions.  Migration Scripts Just as an application’s source code is destined to change over time, so too is the structure of the information  that it stores. As such changes are made, it is important that they be implemented in a way that can be  repeated, shared, rolled back when necessary, and tracked over time. Database migration scripts provide  developers with a convenient pattern for accomplishing this goal.  A Knex migration script is composed of two functions, up and down, as shown in Listing 12-15. The   script’s up function is responsible for modifying a database’s structure in some desired way  e.g., creating  a table, adding a column , while its down function is responsible for restoring the database’s structure to its  previous state.  Listing 12-15.  Knex Migration Script with up Function Creating a New Table and down Function   Dropping the Table     example-sqlite-starter migrations 20150311082640_states.js   exports.up = function knex, Promise  {     return knex.schema.createTable 'states', function table  {         table.increments  .unsigned  .primary  .notNullable  ;         table.string 'name' .notNullable  ;         table.timestamp 'created_at' .defaultTo knex.fn.now   .notNullable  ;     } ; };   exports.down = function knex, Promise  {     return knex.schema.dropTable 'states' ; };  355  www.it-ebooks.info   ChAPter 12   Knex AnD BooKsheLf  Configuring Your Project for Migrations The Knex command-line utility provides developers with simple tools for creating and managing migration  scripts. To get started, you’ll first need to create a special configuration file by running the following  command within the root folder of your project:  $ knex init  After running this command, a file  knexfile.js  will be created with contents similar to those shown   in Listing 12-16. You should alter the contents of this file as needed. Whenever a Knex migration script is  run, Knex will determine its connection settings based on the contents of this file and the value of the   NODE_ENVIRONMENT environment variable.     Note  on os x and Linux, environment variables are set from the terminal by running export  ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE=value. the command to be used within the Windows command line is set  ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE=value.  Listing 12-16.  knexfile.js     example-sqlite-starter knexfile.js   module.exports = {       'development': {         'client': 'sqlite3',             'connection': {                 'filename': '. db.sqlite'          }         },         'seeds': {             'directory': '. seeds'         }     },     'staging': {         'client': 'postgresql',             'connection': {                 'database': 'my_db',             'user': 'username',             'password': 'password'          },          'pool': {             'min': 2,             'max': 10             }         }     } };  356  www.it-ebooks.info   ChAPter 12   Knex AnD BooKsheLf  Creating Your First Migration With our Knex configuration file now in place, we can move forward with the creation of our first migration  script. The command for doing so is shown here:  $ knex migrate:make users_table  When creating your own migrations, substitute the users_table portion of the command with a term   that describes the change your migration implements. After running this command, Knex will create a  migration script for you that resembles the one shown in Listing 12-17.  Listing 12-17.  New Knex Migration Script  exports.up = function knex, Promise  { };   exports.down = function knex, Promise  { };  . ├── knexfile.js └── migrations     └── 20141203074309_users_table.js  After creating your first migration script, your project’s file structure should resemble that shown in   Listing 12-18.  Listing 12-18.  Excerpt of Project’s File Structure After Creating First Migration     Note  Knex migration scripts are stored in a migrations folder at the root level of a project. If this directory  does not exist, Knex will create it for you. Knex automatically prepends a timestamp to the file name of  migration scripts, as shown in Listing 12-18. this ensures that a project’s migrations are always sorted by the  order in which they were created.  It is now up to us to modify the up and down functions within our newly created migration script. Let’s   take a look at two alternative approaches.  Defining Schema Updates with Schema Builder Methods In addition to providing methods for constructing queries, Knex also provides methods for defining a  database’s underlying structure  schema . With the help of these “schema builder” methods, developers can  create platform-agnostic blueprints that describe the various tables, columns, indexes, and relationships  that make up a database. These blueprints can then be applied to any supported platform to generate the  desired database. The migration script shown in Listing 12-15 shows the Knex schema builder in action,  while Listing 12-19 shows the query generated by the script’s up method.  357  www.it-ebooks.info   ChAPter 12   Knex AnD BooKsheLf  Listing 12-19.  SQL Query Generated Through Use of Schema Builder Methods, As Shown in Listing 12-15     example-raw-migration migrations 20150312083058_states.js   CREATE TABLE states     id integer PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT NOT NULL,   name varchar 255  NOT NULL,   created_at datetime NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP   ;  Schema builder methods are useful, in that they allow developers to easily define schemas in a way  that can be applied to each of the platforms supported by Knex. They also require a minimal amount of  knowledge regarding raw SQL queries, making it possible for developers with little experience working  directly with SQL databases to get up and running quickly. That said, schema builder methods are also  limiting. To provide a generic interface for defining database schemas that work across multiple platforms,  Knex must make certain decisions for you—a fact that you may not be comfortable with. Developers with  more experience working directly with SQL databases may wish to bypass the schema builder methods  entirely, opting instead to craft their own SQL queries. This is easily accomplished, as we are about to see.  Defining Schema Updates with Raw SQL Queries In Listing 12-20, we see a Knex migration script that creates a new users table through the use of raw SQL  queries. This is accomplished through the use of the knex.schema.raw   method. When called, this method  returns a promise that will be either resolved or rejected, depending on the success or failure of the query  that it receives.  Listing 12-20.  Knex Migration Script Defined with Raw SQL Queries     example-raw-migration migrations 20150312083058_states.js   var multiline = require 'multiline' ;   exports.up = function knex, Promise  {       var sql = multiline.stripIndent function   { *         CREATE TABLE states               id integer PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT NOT NULL,             name varchar 255  NOT NULL,             created_at datetime NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP           ;     * } ;     return knex.schema.raw sql ;   };   exports.down = function knex, Promise  {     return knex.schema.raw 'DROP TABLE states;' ; };  358  www.it-ebooks.info   ChAPter 12   Knex AnD BooKsheLf     Note  the example shown in Listing 12-20 makes use of an additional library that is unrelated to Knex:  multiline. the multiline library is quite useful because it allows us to define large chunks of text that span  multiple lines without requiring that each line end with a continuation character.  Running Knex Migrations With our newly created migration script now defined and ready for use, our only remaining task is to run  the migration, bringing our database up to date with our desired changes. The command for doing so is  shown here:  $ knex migrate:latest  This command will instruct Knex to run all available migration scripts that have not yet been run, in the  order in which they were created. Once complete, our database will have been brought fully up to date with  our desired changes. If you’re curious as to how Knex keeps track of which migrations have and have not been  run, the answer lies in the knex_migrations table that Knex automatically creates for itself  see Figure 12-1 .  Within this table, Knex maintains a running list of which migrations have been implemented. The name of  this table can be changed by modifying the configuration file we created via the knex init command.  Figure 12-1.  The knex_migrations table used by Knex to track which migration scripts have already been  applied to your database  Reverting Knex Migrations The act of running Knex migration scripts is not a one-way street. They can also be undone, which is  particularly important during development. The command for doing so is as follows:  $ knex migrate:rollback  359  www.it-ebooks.info   ChAPter 12   Knex AnD BooKsheLf  This command will instruct Knex to revert all migration scripts that were run as a result of the most   recent execution of knex migrate:latest. To verify the status of your database in regard to your migration  scripts, you can run the following command to determine your database’s current migration version:  $ knex migrate:currentVersion  Seed Scripts In the previous section, you learned how Knex migration scripts can empower you to script changes to a  database’s structure—scripts that can be shared with others, reverted when necessary, and tracked within  version control. Knex seed scripts serve a similar purpose, but with a focus on data rather than structure.  Seed scripts provide a consistent way in which to specify how a newly created database can be filled with  sample data, to get a new development environment up and running. Listing 12-21 shows the contents of a  seed script included with one of this chapter’s example projects.  Listing 12-21.  Simple Knex Seed Script That Removes All Existing Records from the states Table and  Inserts Two New Ones     example-sqlite-starter seeds 01-states.js   exports.seed = function knex, Promise  {       return Promise.join          knex 'states' .del  ,         knex 'states' .insert [             {                 'id': 1,                 'name': 'Georgia'             },             {                 'id': 2,                 'name': 'Tennessee'             }         ] ;      ; };  Creating Seed Scripts You can instruct Knex to create a new seed script using the following command:  $ knex seed:make users  By default, Knex saves newly created seed scripts to the seeds folder at the root path of your project.    You can customize this folder by modifying the contents of the your project’s knexfile.js configuration file   see Listing 12-16 .  Running Seed Scripts After creating seed scripts for your application, you can populate your database with them by running this  command:  $ knex seed:run  360  www.it-ebooks.info   ChAPter 12   Knex AnD BooKsheLf     Note  seed scripts are always run in alphabetical order. If the order in which your seeds are run is  important, take care to name them appropriately to ensure they run in the desired order.  Bookshelf  Bookshelf builds on the foundation laid by Knex to provide a flexible ORM library that simplifies the process  of creating classes  “models”  to represent the various objects that make up an application. This section  explores the various ways in which developers can use Bookshelf to accomplish the following:   	 Create classes  “models”  to represent the various tables used within an    application’s database  Extend models with custom behavior unique to the needs of their application   	  	 Define complex relationships between models  one-to-one, one-to-many,    many-to-many    	  Easily navigate through the various relationships that exist between models without  resorting to complex SQL queries, with the help of “eager loading”  Developers who are familiar with Backbone will quickly find themselves at home with Bookshelf, as   it follows many of the same patterns and implements many of the same APIs. You could easily describe  Bookshelf as “Backbone for the server,” and you wouldn’t be far off base.  What Is an Object-Relational Mapper? Relational databases store information as a series of rows within one or more tables, each table having one  or more columns that describe the various attributes of the records they contain—just as you might go  about structuring information within a spreadsheet. In most applications, separate tables are created to  represent each type of available entity  e.g., “Account”, “User”, “Comment” . The various relationships that  exist between each of these entities are then defined through the use of “foreign key” columns, as shown in  Figure 12-2.  Figure 12-2.  Here, the relationship between users and accounts  an account has one or more users, users  belong to accounts  is described via the account_id foreign key column within the users table.   361  www.it-ebooks.info   ChAPter 12   Knex AnD BooKsheLf  This approach to storing information is powerful and serves as the predominant method by which  applications store data, for many good reasons  all of which extend well beyond the scope of this book .  Unfortunately, this approach is also at odds with the object-oriented approach with which most applications  tend to view data.  Object-relational mapping  ORM  tools such as Bookshelf allow developers to interact with the flat  tables of information stored within relational databases as a series of interconnected objects, with which  they can interact and navigate through to achieve some desired goal. In effect, ORM libraries provide  developers with a “virtual object database” that allows them to more easily interact with the flat records  contained within relational database tables.  Creating Your First Bookshelf Model A Bookshelf model can be thought of as a class that, when instantiated, represents a record within a  database. In their simplest form, Bookshelf models serve as data containers, providing built-in functionality  for getting and setting attribute  i.e., column  values and for creating, updating, and destroying records. As  we’ll soon see, however, Bookshelf models become much more useful when we extend them with our own  custom methods and define the relationships that exist between them.  Bookshelf models are defined via the bookshelf.Model.extend   method, as shown in Listing 12-22. In   this simple example, a User model is defined whose records will be persisted to our database’s users table.  Listing 12-22.  Simple Bookshelf Model That Represents an Application’s Users     example-bookshelf1 lib user.js   var knex = require '. db' ; var bookshelf = require 'bookshelf'  knex ;   var User = bookshelf.Model.extend {     'tableName': 'users',     'idAttribute': 'id'    The primary key for our table. Defaults to: 'id' } ;   module.exports = User;  Creating New Instances In Listing 12-23, a new instance of the User model is created, modified, and then saved to the database.  Listing 12-23.  Saving a New Instance of User to the Database     example-bookshelf1 create.js   var User = require '. lib user' ; var user = new User  ;   user.set {     'first_name': 'Steve',     'last_name': 'Taylor',     'email': 'steve.taylor@mydomain.com' } ;    362  www.it-ebooks.info   ChAPter 12   Knex AnD BooKsheLf     Individual attributes can also be set as shown below    user.set 'first_name', 'Steve' ;   user.save  .then function user  {        user has been saved     console.log 'User saved', user.toJSON   ;      *     {       first_name: 'Steve',       last_name: 'Taylor',       email: 'steve.taylor@mydomain.com',       id: 1     }     *  } ;  Bookshelf provides a convenient forge   method that allows us to simplify this example just a bit,   as shown in Listing 12-24. This method does nothing more than create and return a new instance of User  behind the scenes for us, allowing us to forego the use of the new keyword.  Listing 12-24.  Creating a New Instance of the User Model via the forge   Method     example-bookshelf1 forge.js   User.forge {     'id': 1,     'first_name': 'John' } .fetch  .then function user  {        * An object containing every attribute   value for     this model can be retrieved via the 'toJSON' method. *      console.log user.toJSON   ; } ;  Fetching Instances Instances of the User model can be retrieved in a similar manner. In Listing 12-25, a new instance of User is  created with a value of 1 for its id attribute. When fetch   is called, Bookshelf will use any attributes set on  the model to build the query used to fetch the desired record. In this example, the query used will be  SELECT * FROM users WHERE 'id' = 1;  Listing 12-25.  Retrieving an Instance of the User Model from the Database     example-bookshelf1 fetch.js   User.where {     'id': 1 } .fetch  .then function user  {        Individual attributes get be retrieved with the get method        console.log 'first_name', user.get 'first_name'  ;     console.log user.toJSON   ; } ;  363  www.it-ebooks.info   ChAPter 12   Knex AnD BooKsheLf  Destroying Instances Just as model instances can be saved, they can also be deleted via the destroy   method, as shown in  Listing 12-26.  Listing 12-26.  Deleting an Instance of the User Model     example-bookshelf1 destroy.js   User.where {     'id': 1 } .fetch  .then function user  {     return user.destroy  ; } .then function   {     console.log 'User destroyed.' ; } ;  In this example, destroy is called as an instance method on user. We could, however, instruct   Bookshelf to simply seek out and destroy the record without first fetching the instance ourselves, as shown in  Listing 12-27.  Listing 12-27.  Instructing Bookshelf to Destroy the Specified Record  User.where {     'id': 1 } .destroy  .then function   {     console.log 'User destroyed.' ; } ;  Fetching Multiple Models  Collections   In addition to retrieving a single instance of our model via the fetch   method, we can also retrieve multiple  instances via the fetchAll   method, as shown in Listing 12-28.  Listing 12-28.  Fetching All Instances of User with a Value of John for first_name     example-bookshelf1 fetch-collection.js   User.where {     'last_name': 'Doe' } .fetchAll  .then function users  {     console.log JSON.stringify users.toJSON  , null, 4  ;      *     [{         "id": 3,         "first_name": "John",         "last_name": "Doe",         "email": "john.doe@mydomain.com"     },  364  www.it-ebooks.info   ChAPter 12   Knex AnD BooKsheLf      {         "id": 4,         "first_name": "Jane",         "last_name": "Doe",         "email": "jane.doe@mydomain.com"     }]     *  } ;  In this example, our call to fetchAll   returns a promise that resolves to a collection of multiple users.   This collection provides a number of built-in methods specifically designed for interacting with multiple  models. Given Bookshelf’s strong focus on following Backbone patterns, most of the same methods available  within Backbone collections are also available here. Listing 12-29 demonstrates a few common use cases.  Listing 12-29.  Commonly Used Bookshelf Collection Methods   * Iterate through a collection *  users.each function user, index  {     console.log user, index ; } ;    * Create an array composed of models matching more specific criteria *  users = users.filter function user, index  {     if  user.get 'last_name'  === 'Smith'  return true; } ;    * A simpler method for filtering models, when a function call is not needed *  users = users.where {     'last_name': 'Smith' } ;    * Return the first entry matching the specified criteria *  var johnSmith = users.find function user  {     if  user.get 'last_name'  === 'Smith'  return true; } ;    * Returns an array containing the first name of every user *  var firstNames = users.pluck 'first_name' ;  Extending with Custom Behavior In their simplest state, Bookshelf models do little more than serve as containers for records within a  database, providing built-in methods for reading and writing attribute values and performing save or destroy  operations. While this is useful, Bookshelf models begin to reach their full potential only when we begin to  extend them with their own unique behavior as befitting the needs of our application.  An example of such behavior is demonstrated in Listing 12-30. Here, we update the User model seen   in previous examples to include a sendEmail    method. Doing so allows us to abstract away the complexity  involved with sending e-mail to registered users of our application.  365  www.it-ebooks.info   ChAPter 12   Knex AnD BooKsheLf  Listing 12-30.  Extending the User Model with a Method for Sending Outbound E-mails from Our  Application  var Promise = require 'bluebird' ; var Handlebars = require 'handlebars' ;   var User = bookshelf.Model.extend {     'tableName': 'users',      **      * Sends an e-mail to the user. Requires an `options` object      * with values for `subject` and `message`. These values will be      * compiled as Handlebars templates, passed this user's attributes,      * and the result s  will be used to generate the outgoing message.      *      'sendEmail': function options  {         var self = this;         return Promise.resolve  .then function   {                 var subject = Handlebars.compile options.subject  self.toJSON   ;                 var message = Handlebars.compile options.message  self.toJSON   ;                Use your e-mail library of choice here, along with the                appropriate connection settings.     } ;     } } ;   User.where {     'id': 1 } .fetch  .then function user  {     return user.sendEmail {         'subject': 'Welcome, {{first_name}}',         'message': 'We are happy to have you on board, {{first_name}} {{last_name}}.'     } ; } ;  In addition to those methods inherited from Backbone, Bookshelf collections also provide several   methods of their own. Listing 12-31 demonstrates the use of the invokeThen   method, allowing us to easily  invoke methods on each of the models contained within the collection.  Listing 12-31.  Invoking an Imagined sendEmail    Method on Each Model Contained Within a Collection     example-bookshelf1 invoke-then.js   User.where {     'last_name': 'Doe' } .fetchAll  .then function users  {     return users.invokeThen 'sendEmail', {         'subject': 'Congratulations on having such a great name, {{first_name}}.',         'message': '{{first_name}} really is a great name. Seriously - way to go.'     } ; } .then function users  {     console.log '%s users were complimented on their name.', users.length ; } ;  366  www.it-ebooks.info   ChAPter 12   Knex AnD BooKsheLf  The invokeThen   method demonstrated in this example returns a promise of its own, which will be  resolved only after all the calls to sendEmail   on our collection’s models have themselves been resolved.  This pattern also provides us with a convenient method for interacting with multiple models simultaneously.  Performing Validation Those familiar with Backbone will find Bookshelf’s event system quite familiar. In regard to validation, of  particular interest are the saving and destroying events emitted by Bookshelf. By tapping into these events,  Bookshelf models can be customized with unique behavior to either allow or deny these actions, based on  some desired criteria. Listing 12-32 shows an example in which users with an e-mail address containing the  string “hotmail.com” are prevented from being saved to the database.  Listing 12-32.  Demonstration of Bookshelf’s Event System, Which Allows for Implementation of Custom  Validation Rules     example-bookshelf1 lib user.js   var User = bookshelf.Model.extend {     'tableName': 'users',     'initialize': function   {         this.on 'saving', this._validateSave ;     },     '_validateSave': function   {         var self = this;         return Promise.resolve  .then function   {             if  self.get 'email' .indexOf 'hotmail.com'  >= 0  {             throw new Error 'Hotmail email addresses are not allowed.' ;             }         } ;     } } ;  To prevent calls to save or destroy from succeeding, simply tap into the model’s saving or destroying   events, passing a reference to your own custom validation functions. If an error is thrown, the call will be  prevented. Asynchronous validation is also possible through the use of promises. In Listing 12-33, a custom  validation function returns a promise that is ultimately rejected.  Listing 12-33.  Custom Validation Function That Returns a Promise      example-bookshelf1 validation.js   User.forge {     'first_name': 'Jane',     'last_name': 'Doe',     'email': 'jane.doe@hotmail.com' } .save  .then function   {     console.log 'Saved.' ; } .catch function err  {      * Our call to `save` will result in an error, due to this user's     hotmail.com e-mail address. *      console.log err ; } ;  367  www.it-ebooks.info   ChAPter 12   Knex AnD BooKsheLf  Customizing the Export Process Previous examples have shown the use of the toJSON   method, which  by default  returns an object  containing every available attribute value for the model on which it is called  or for every available model,  if called on a collection . Should you wish to customize the data returned by this method, you can do so by  overriding the toJSON   method, as shown in Listing 12-34.  Listing 12-34.  Customizing the Data Returned by Our Model’s toJSON   Method  var User = bookshelf.Model.extend {     'tableName': 'users',     'toJSON': function   {         var data = bookshelf.Model.prototype.toJSON.call this ;         data.middle_name = 'Danger';      return data;     } } ;  Within this example’s overridden toJSON   method, we first call the prototype’s toJSON   method,  giving us the data that this method would have originally returned, had it not been overwritten. We then  strip out the data we wish to hide, add some additional information of our own, and return it.  A common scenario in which this pattern is often seen involves the use of a User model, within which  sensitive password information is held. Modifying the model’s toJSON   method to automatically strip out  such information, as shown in Listing 12-34, helps to prevent this information from unintentionally leaking  out over an API request.  Defining Class Properties Bookshelf’s extend   method, which we’ve seen in previous examples, accepts two parameters:   	  	  An object of instance properties to be inherited by created instances of the model  An object of class properties to be assigned directly to the model  Previous examples within this chapter have demonstrated the process of assigning instance properties  via extend  , but we have yet to look at an example demonstrating the use of class properties. Listing 12-35  shows class properties in action.  Listing 12-35.  Defining the getRecent   Class Method on the User Model     example-bookshelf1 lib user.js   var User = bookshelf.Model.extend {     'tableName': 'users' }, {        **      * Returns a collection containing users who have signed in      * within the last 24 hours.      *      'getRecent': function   {         return User.where 'last_signin', '>=', knex.raw "date 'now', '-1 day' "  .fetch  ;         }   } ;   368  www.it-ebooks.info   ChAPter 12   Knex AnD BooKsheLf     example-bookshelf1 static.js   User.getRecent  .then function users  {     console.log '%s users have signed in within the past 24 hours.', users.length ;     console.log JSON.stringify users.toJSON  , null, 4  ; } ;  Class-level properties provide a convenient location in which we can define various helper methods   related to the model in question. In this contrived example, the getRecent   method returns a promise that  resolves to a collection containing every user who has signed in within the last 24 hours.  Extending with Subclasses Bookshelf’s extend   method correctly sets up the prototype chain. As a result, in addition to creating  models that inherit directly from Bookshelf’s Model class, developers can also create models that inherit  from each other, as shown in Listing 12-36.  Listing 12-36.  Creating a Base Model That Extends Directly from Bookshelf’s Model Class, from Which  Other Models Can Also Extend     example-bookshelf-extend lib base.js    **  * This model serves as a base from which all other models  * within our application extend.  *  * @class Base  *  var Base = bookshelf.Model.extend {     'initialize': function   {         this._initEventBroadcasts  ;     },     'foo': function   {         console.log 'bar', this.toJSON   ;     } } ;      example-bookshelf-extend lib user.js    **  * @class User  *  var User = Base.extend {     'tableName': 'users' } ;    369  www.it-ebooks.info   ChAPter 12   Knex AnD BooKsheLf     example-bookshelf-extend index.js   var User = require '. lib user' ; User.where {     'id': 1 } .fetch  .then function user  {     user.foo  ; } ;  Having the ability to create models that extend across multiple levels of inheritance provides some   useful opportunities. Most of the applications in which we use Bookshelf follow the lead shown in   Listing 12-36, in which a Base model is created from which all other models within the application extend.  By following this pattern, we can easily add core functionality to all models within our application simply  by modifying our Base class. In Listing 12-36, the User model  along with every other model that extends  from Base  will inherit the Base model’s foo   method.  Relationships ORM libraries such as Bookshelf provide convenient, object-oriented patterns for interacting with data  stored in flat, relational database tables. With Bookshelf’s help, we can specify the relationships that exist  between our application’s models. For example, an account may have many users, or a user may have many  bookmarks. Once these relationships have been defined, Bookshelf models open up new methods that allow  us to more easily navigate through these relationships.  The table shown in Table 12-1 list some of the more commonly used relationships.  Table 12-1.  Commonly Used Bookshelf Relationships  Association  Relationship Type  Example  One-to-one One-to-one One-to-many One-to-many  hasOne  belongsTo  hasMany  belongsTo  A User has a Profile A Profile has a User An Account has many Users A User belongs to an Account  Many-to-many  belongsToMany  A Book has one or more Authors  In the following sections, you will discover the differences between these relationships, how they are   defined, and how they can best be put to use within an application.  One-to-One A one-to-one association is the simplest form available. As its name suggests, a one-to-one association  specifies that a given model is associated with exactly one other model. That association can take  the form of a hasOne relationship or a belongsTo relationship, based on the direction in which the  association is traversed.  The database schema behind the example that we will soon see is shown in Figure 12-3. In this example,   the profiles table has a user_id foreign key column with which it is related to the users table.  370  www.it-ebooks.info   ChAPter 12   Knex AnD BooKsheLf  Figure 12-3.  The database schema behind our one-to-one relationships  hasOne and belongsTo A hasOne relationship specifies that a model “has one” of another model, while the belongsTo relationship  specifies just the opposite, that it is owned by or “belongs to” another model. In other words, a belongsTo  relationship serves as the inverse of the hasOne relationship. The process by which these relationships are  defined with Bookshelf is shown in Listing 12-37.  Listing 12-37.  Defining the hasOne and belongsTo Bookshelf Relationships     example-bookshelf-relationships1 lib user.js    **  * @class User  *  * A User has one Profile  *  var User = bookshelf.Model.extend {     'tableName': 'users',      **      * Bookshelf relationships are defined as model instance      * methods. Here, we create a 'profile' method that will      * allow us to access this user's profile. This method      * could have been named anything, but in this case -      * 'profile' makes the most sense.      *      'profile': function   {         return this.hasOne Profile ;     } } ;      example-bookshelf-relationships1 lib profile.js    **  * @class Profile  *  * A Profile belongs to one User  *   371  www.it-ebooks.info   ChAPter 12   Knex AnD BooKsheLf  var Profile = bookshelf.Model.extend {     'tableName': 'profiles',     'user': function   {         return this.belongsTo User ;     } } ;  Bookshelf relationships are defined through the use of special instance methods, as shown in Listing 12-37.   With these relationships defined, we can now begin to use them in several convenient ways. For starters, see  Listing 12-38, which demonstrates the process of loading a relationship within a model that has already been  instantiated. The output from running this example is shown in Listing 12-39.  Listing 12-38.  Loading a Relationship on a Model That Has Already Been Instantiated     example-bookshelf-relationships1 index.js   User.where {     'id': 1 } .fetch  .then function user  {     return user.load 'profile' ; } .then function user  {     console.log JSON.stringify user.toJSON  , null, 4  ; } ;  Listing 12-39.  The Resulting Output from Listing 12-38  {     "id": 1,     "first_name": "Steve",     "last_name": "Taylor",     "created_at": "2014-10-02"     "profile": {     "id": 1,     "user_id": 1,     "twitter_handle": "staylor",     "city": "Portland",     "state": "OR",     "created_at": "2014-10-02"     } }  In Listing 12-38, an instance of the User model is retrieved. When fetched, the default behavior of a   Bookshelf model is to retrieve only information about itself, not about its related models. As a result, in this  example we must first load the model’s related Profile via the load   method, which returns a promise that  is resolved once the related model has been fetched. Afterward, we can reference this user’s profile via the  user’s related instance method.  Bookshelf relationships become even more useful when we begin to look at the manner in which they  can be “eagerly loaded,” as shown in Listing 12-40. In this example, we fetch an instance of the User model  as well as its related Profile. We can do so by passing the fetch   method an object of options in which  we specify one or more relationships that we are also interested in. The returned promise resolves to an  instance of User that already has its profile relationship populated.  372  www.it-ebooks.info   Listing 12-40.  Using “Eager Loading” to Fetch Our User, and Its Related Profile, with a Single Call  ChAPter 12   Knex AnD BooKsheLf     example-bookshelf-relationships1 eager.js   User.where {     'id': 1 } .fetch {     'withRelated': ['profile'] } .then function user  {     console.log JSON.stringify user.toJSON  , null, 4  ; } ;  One-to-Many The one-to-many association forms the basis for the most commonly encountered relationships. This  association builds on the simple one-to-one association we just saw, allowing us to instead associate  one model with many other models. These relationships can take the form of a hasMany or a belongsTo  relationship, as we will soon see.  The database schema behind the examples we are about to review is shown in Figure 12-4. In this   example, the users table has an account_id foreign key column with which it is related to the accounts table.  Figure 12-4.  The database schema behind our one-to-many relationships  hasMany and belongsTo A hasMany relationship specifies that a model may have multiple  or none at all  of a particular model. The  belongsTo relationship, which we have already seen in previous examples, is also applicable in one-to-many  associations. The process by which these relationships are defined with Bookshelf is shown in Listing 12-41.  Listing 12-42 demonstrates their usage.  Listing 12-41.  Defining the hasMany and belongsTo Bookshelf Relationships     example-bookshelf-relationships2 lib account.js    **  * @class Account  *  * An Account has one or more instances of User  *   373  www.it-ebooks.info   ChAPter 12   Knex AnD BooKsheLf  var Account = bookshelf.Model.extend {     'tableName': 'accounts',     'users': function   {         return this.hasMany User ;     } } ;      example-bookshelf-relationships2 lib user.js    **  * @class User  *  * A User belongs to an Account  * A User has one Profile  *  User = bookshelf.Model.extend {     'tableName': 'users',     'account': function   {         return this.belongsTo Account ;         },         'profile': function   {             return this.hasOne Profile ;         } } ;      example-bookshelf-relationships2 lib profile.js    **  * @class Profile  *  * A Profile belongs to one User  *  Profile = bookshelf.Model.extend {     'tableName': 'profiles',     'user': function   {         return this.belongsTo User ;     } } ;  Listing 12-42.  Loading an Instance of the Account Model, Along with All of Its Related Users     example-bookshelf-relationships2 index.js   Account.where {     'id': 1 } .fetch {     'withRelated': ['users'] } .then function account  {     console.log JSON.stringify account.toJSON  , null, 4  ; } ;    374  www.it-ebooks.info   ChAPter 12   Knex AnD BooKsheLf  {     "id": 1,     "name": "Acme Company",     "created_at": "2014-10-02",     "users": [     {         "id": 1,         "account_id": 1,            "first_name": "Steve",         "last_name": "Taylor",         "email": "steve.taylor@mydomain.com",         "created_at": "2014-10-02"     },     {         "id": 2,            "account_id": 1,         "first_name": "Sally",         "last_name": "Smith",            "email": "sally.smith@mydomain.com",         "created_at": "2014-10-02"     }     ] }  In Listing 12-42, we see another example of Bookshelf’s “eager loading” functionality, with which   we can fetch a model as well as any of its related models that we also happen to be interested in. The  concept of “eager loading” becomes even more interesting when we discover that we can also load nested  relationships—those that exist deeper within the object s  we wish to fetch. Only when we begin to utilize  Bookshelf’s eager loading functionality can we begin to appreciate the “virtual object database” that it and  similar ORM tools provide. The example shown in Listing 12-43 should help to clarify this concept.  Listing 12-43.  Eagerly Loading an Account, All of Its Users, and the Profile for Each User     example-bookshelf-relationships2 nested-eager.js   Account.where {     'id': 1 } .fetch {     'withRelated': ['users', 'users.profile'] } .then function account  {     console.log JSON.stringify account.toJSON  , null, 4  ; } ;    * {     "id": 1,     "name": "Acme Company",     "created_at": "2014-10-02",     "users": [  375  www.it-ebooks.info   ChAPter 12   Knex AnD BooKsheLf      {         "id": 1,             "account_id": 1,             "first_name": "John",             "last_name": "Doe",             "email": "john.doe@domain.site",             "created_at": "2014-10-02",             "profile": {                 "id": 1,                 "user_id": 1,                 "twitter_handle": "john.doe",                 "city": "Portland",                 "state": "OR",                 "created_at": "2014-10-02"             }         },         {             "id": 2,             "account_id": 1,             "first_name": "Sarah",             "last_name": "Smith",             "email": "sarah.smith@domain.site",             "created_at": "2014-10-02",             "profile": {                 "id": 2,                 "user_id": 2,                 "twitter_handle": "sarah.smith",                 "city": "Asheville",                 "state": "NC",                 "created_at": "2014-10-02"             }            }    ] } *   Many-to-Many Many-to-many associations differ from the one-to-one and one-to-many associations this chapter has  already covered, in that they allow one record to be associated with one or more records of a different  type, and vice versa. To help clarify this point, see Figure 12-5, which illustrates a commonly cited example  involving authors and books.  376  www.it-ebooks.info   ChAPter 12   Knex AnD BooKsheLf  Figure 12-5.  A many-to-many association made possible through the use of a third join table. In this example,  an author can write multiple books, and a book can have multiple authors   A single foreign key column, as seen in previous examples  see Figure 12-5 , would not suffice here.   In order to model this relationship, a third join table  authors_books  is required, in which multiple  relationships for any given record can be stored.  belongsToMany The database schema shown in Figure 12-5 can be modeled with Bookshelf via the belongsToMany  relationship, as shown in Listing 12-44.  Listing 12-44.  Modeling a belongsToMany Relationship with Bookshelf     example-bookshelf-relationships3 lib author.js   var Author = bookshelf.Model.extend {     'tableName': 'authors',     'books': function   {         return this.belongsToMany require '. book'  ;     } } ;      example-bookshelf-relationships3 lib book.js   var Book = bookshelf.Model.extend {     'tableName': 'books',     'authors': function   {         return this.belongsToMany require '. author'  ;     } } ;  It is important to note that when using the belongsToMany relationship, Bookshelf will automatically   make a few assumptions regarding your database schema, unless specifically told otherwise. Bookshelf will  assume the following:   	   	  That a third join table exists, which derives its name from that of the two related  tables, separated by an underscore, and ordered alphabetically. In this example:  authors_books.  That the column names used within your join table are derived from the singular  versions of the two related tables, followed by _id. In this example: author_id   and book_id.  377  www.it-ebooks.info   ChAPter 12   Knex AnD BooKsheLf  If you prefer to follow a different naming convention, you can do so by modifying the call to this.  belongsToMany as shown in Listing 12-45.

Much like Mark Twain’s prematurely reported death in 1897, the death of the relational database is also an  exaggeration.  Relational databases offer a number of compelling features, the vast majority of which lie far outside   the scope of this chapter. Many wonderful books are available that devote themselves entirely to this  subject, and we encourage you to read a few of them before making critical decisions regarding how and  where a project stores its information. That said, a key feature to look for in such systems  and one which  was covered earlier in the chapter  is support for transactions: the process by which multiple queries can  be grouped into a single unit of work that will either succeed or fail as a whole. The examples involving a  financial exchange that we looked at in Listing 12-13 and Listing 12-14 demonstrated the important role this  concept has in mission-critical applications.  The platform-agnostic API provided by Knex, combined with its promise-based interface, transaction  support, and migration manager, provides developers with a convenient tool for interacting with relational  databases. When paired with its sister application, Bookshelf, an ORM that is instantly familiar to those with  prior Backbone experience, a powerful combination is formed that simplifies the process of working with  complex data.

Functionality that was once  the exclusive domain of traditional desktop applications has found a new home in the browser, allowing web  developers to create applications that weren’t even possible just a few short years ago.  However, as web browsers have continued to mature, the fundamental protocol of the Web, HTTP, has  begun to show signs of age. The simple “request-response” pattern of communication that it implements, in  which a client  e.g., a web browser  requests a resource from a server and receives a response in return, no  longer addresses the real-time nature of the problems that many of today’s most innovative web applications  seek to solve. Applications that deal with rapidly changing data  e.g., multiplayer games, social networking  sites, and chat rooms  have a strong need to perform what is often referred to as “data push”—the ability to  initiate communication from the server to the client.  Just as web browsers have matured, so too have the expectations of the people who use them. Web   applications that provide their users with information only when asked for it will quickly find themselves  sidelined by more proactive alternatives that go out of their way to notify users when events of interest to  them occur.  In this chapter, we will be exploring Faye, a library for Node.js and the browser that provides developers   with a robust toolset for building applications that rely on near real-time communication. Topics covered  include   	 HTTP, Bayeux, and WebSockets  	 Communicating through Faye via publish-subscribe  PubSub  channels  	 Developing Faye extensions  	 Managing security  HTTP, Bayeux, and WebSockets  HTTP is referred to as a “request-response” protocol because it allows a client to request a resource from a  server and to receive a response in return. The protocol is also described as “stateless,” in that each of these  message pairs operates independently of the others; no “state”  i.e., memory  is maintained across requests.  This concept is illustrated in Figure 13-1.  381  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 13   Faye  Figure 13-1.  HTTP is a stateless, request-response protocol  HTTP’s greatest strength, the intuitive pattern of communication that it enables, has allowed the    Web to grow into the runaway success that it is today. Unfortunately, the protocol’s simpleness also comes  with a high cost, in that it is woefully inadequate at addressing the bidirectional, asynchronous nature of  event-driven messaging.  By way of an example, imagine a scenario in which multiple users are participating in a chat room   see Figure 13-2 . Each user needs to be notified as soon as other members post new messages, but the  request-response nature of HTTP fails to address how such events originating at the server level are to be  communicated to clients, as shown in Figure 13-3.  Figure 13-2.  An event-driven messaging platform, in which users must be notified as soon as new messages  are posted by fellow participants  382  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 13   Faye  Figure 13-3.  HTTP does not allow a server to initiate communication with a client in this manner  WebSockets Unlike HTTP, the WebSocket Protocol was purposefully designed to allow browsers to establish a   full-duplex  bidirectional , long-lived TCP connection with a remote server  see Figure 13-4 . The protocol  was standardized in 2011  RFC 6455  and now enjoys widespread support among recent versions of most  popular web browsers. As a result, supporting browsers can now communicate with servers in a truly  asynchronous fashion  assuming those servers are configured to support such connections . A simple  example that demonstrates the usage of the WebSocket API is shown in Listing 13-1.  Figure 13-4.  The WebSocket Protocol allows clients to establish a long-lived connection with a remote server,  with which messages may be passed in both directions  Listing 13-1.  Simple Example Demonstrating the Use of the WebSocket API Within the Browser  var connection = new WebSocket 'ws:  domain.com app' ;      The connection has been established connection.onopen = function   {     connection.send 'Hello, world.' ; };      A message has been received from the server connection.onmessage = function e  {     console.log 'Incoming message', e ; };  383  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 13   Faye  With the introduction of the WebSocket Protocol, a new and exciting chapter for the Web was opened, a  chapter in which real-time messaging is possible. It is important to bear in mind, however, that the protocol  does have its limitations—limitations that aren’t necessarily obvious at first glance. These limitations will be  discussed in greater detail in the following section on the Bayeux protocol.  The Bayeux Protocol Long before the arrival of widespread browser support for WebSockets, developers at the Dojo Foundation  worked together to tackle the problem of implementing asynchronous, event-driven messaging over HTTP.  The result was an innovative solution known as the Bayeux protocol that still has important implications to  this day.  Bayeux enables low-latency, event-driven messaging over standard HTTP requests through the use of   a technique known as “long-polling.” Using this approach, a client submits an HTTP request to a remote  server, which then hangs on to that request indefinitely instead of immediately returning a response  as  would occur in a standard HTTP transaction . As the server maintains this open connection, it waits to  be notified of any messages that need to be forwarded to the client. When a message arrives, the server  forwards the message to the client and closes the connection. Afterward, the client immediately establishes  another long-polling connection to the server, at which point the process repeats itself  see Figure 13-5 .  Figure 13-5.  Asynchronous messaging over HTTP, made possible by Bayeux’s use of long-polling  Now that WebSockets enjoy widespread support, you may be wondering why this chapter bothers    to discuss a seemingly outdated concept such as the Bayeux protocol. As it turns out, Bayeux isn’t   nearly as outdated as you might initially think. As wonderful as WebSockets are, they still have their  limitations—limitations that Bayeux happens to be particularly adept at resolving.  Network Challenges Although recent versions of most popular web browsers now include support for WebSockets, a successful  connection between the client and the server is not always guaranteed. The long-lived connections that the  WebSocket Protocol was designed to enable differ significantly from the short-lived, “request-response”  connections that the Web was originally built on, and in order for these connections to function properly,  the various networks and proxy servers that forward information between a client and a server must be  properly configured. It’s not unheard of for improperly configured proxy servers to block such connections  entirely or to drop them without warning when they go unused for any significant amount of time.  Bayeux, the protocol on which the topic of this chapter, Faye, relies, was designed from the beginning   to be very forward thinking. Although Bayeux was originally designed to bring asynchronous messaging  to the Web via long-polling HTTP connections, the protocol also includes support for “upgrading” those  connections to more efficient, modern standards when possible  see Figure 13-6 . As a result of this  behavior, Bayeux-based servers are capable of bringing asynchronous messaging to the Web even when  browser or network limitations attempt to get in the way.  384  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 13   Faye  Figure 13-6.  Bayeux connections are established via HTTP and upgraded when possible  Legacy Browser Support As previously stated, WebSockets now enjoy widespread support among the latest versions of all major  browsers. Depending on the needs of your application, you may need to provide support for browsers that  don’t conform to the latest standards. The Bayeux protocol’s reliance on standard HTTP connections  which  are upgraded, when possible  allows you to do exactly that.  Dropped Connections and Missed Messages The WebSocket Protocol provides no built-in support for detecting what  if any  messages might have been  lost in the event of a service interruption. Bayeux-based servers, on the other hand, are capable of hanging  on to messages in the event of a service interruption. The servers can then forward these messages once the  client is able to successfully reestablish their connection, preventing important messages from being lost in  the process.  A Focus on Channels Rather Than Sockets The WebSocket API provides developers with a simple, clearly defined interface for establishing socket  connections between a client and a server and for sending messages between them  as discussed in  the following section . It does not, however, provide any higher-level abstractions for managing those  interactions. Faye takes an alternative approach, choosing instead to present users with an interface for  interacting via publish-subscribe  PubSub  channels, while completely hiding the inner workings of the  network layer that it operates on top of. As a result, Faye has the ability to transparently support a number of  different connection schemes, without requiring any changes at the application layer.  Getting Started with Faye  Faye consists of two distinct libraries: one for the server  Node.js  and one for the browser. Before we continue,  let’s take a look at the basic steps that are involved in installing and configuring Faye at the server level.  The following example demonstrates the installation of Faye from the command line via npm within an   existing Node.js project:  $ npm install faye --save  385  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 13   Faye  Faye works in conjunction with Node’s built-in http and https modules to create a port capable of   accepting connections. This process is demonstrated in Listing 13-2. In this example, a web server is created  that serves static files from our project’s public folder. A new instance of Faye is then created and attached to  this server, allowing clients to connect to the web server and Faye on the same port.  Listing 13-2.  Initializing Faye Within Node.js     faye-starter lib server.js   var faye = require 'faye' ; var http = require 'http' ; var express = require 'express' ; var app = express  ; var server = http.createServer app ;      Creating a new instance of Faye var bayeux = new faye.NodeAdapter {     'mount': ' faye'    The path at which Faye can be reached } ;      Attaching Faye to the web server instance we have already created bayeux.attach server ;      Serving static files out of our project's ` public` folder app.use ' ', express.static __dirname + ' .. public'  ;      Our web server and Faye are both reachable at port 7000 server.listen 7000 ;  Now that our server is ready to accept connections, we can move on to configuring Faye within the   browser  see Listing 13-3 . We first create a script tag that loads Faye’s client-side library  client.js ,  which is available under the mount path that we specified in Listing 13-2. Next, we create a new client and  configure it to connect to that mount path.  Listing 13-3.  Configuring Faye Within the Browser     faye-starter public index.html                                Faye - Starter Example         386  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 13   Faye                   var client = new Faye.Client 'http:  localhost:7000 faye' ;              PubSub Messaging  Instead of presenting developers with an API for interacting directly with socket connections, Faye  emphasizes the use of publish-subscribe  PubSub  topic channels. To see this process in action, revisit  Listing 13-2  the example in which we configured our server  and append the code shown in Listing 13-4.  With the addition of this code, we instruct our server to publish a random number to the  numbers channel  every two seconds.  Listing 13-4.  Publishing a Message to the  numbers Channel Every Two Seconds     faye-starter lib server.js   setInterval function   {        Pass a topic channel, along with a payload of data     bayeux.getClient  .publish ' numbers', {         'number': Math.floor  Math.random   * 100  + 1      } ; }, 2000 ;  Now revisit the example shown in Listing 13-3, in which we configured Faye for use within the browser.   Listing 13-5 shows an updated version of this example in which we subscribe to the  numbers channel.  As messages are received, their content is appended to the DOM. Note also that when we create this  subscription, we receive an object with a cancel   method that allows us to unsubscribe from this channel  at any time. Before you continue, take a few minutes to see this example in action by running npm start  within the faye-starter folder.  Listing 13-5.  Listening for Messages on the  numbers Channel from Within the Browser     faye-starter public index.html                                Faye - Starter Example         387  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 13   Faye       Cancel Subscription to ` numbers` channel                                       var client = new Faye.Client 'http:  localhost:7000 faye' ;       var subscription = client.subscribe ' numbers', function data  {         console.log 'Incoming message on the ` numbers` channel', data ;         $ 'container' .append ' ' + data.number + ' ' ;     } ;       $ 'cancelbt' .one 'click', function   {         console.log 'Canceling subscription to ` numbers` channel' ;         subscription.cancel  ;     } ;              In Listing 13-4, we saw a demonstration of how messages can be published at the server level. The   process by which clients can publish their own messages works in almost the exact same way. The example  shown in Listing 13-6 demonstrates the sending of a Hello, world message to the  foo channel from a  browser-based client.  Listing 13-6.  Publishing a Message from the Browser  client.publish ' foo', {     'text': 'Hello, world.' } .then function   {        Message was received by server } ;  Wildcard Channels In addition to having the ability to subscribe to messages on a specific channel, Faye clients can also  subscribe to multiple channels by passing a wildcard pattern to the subscribe   method, as shown in  Listing 13-7.  Listing 13-7.  Using Wildcard Syntax to Subscribe to Multiple Channels Matching a Specified Pattern   **  * Subscribes the client to a single channel segment. Messages received  * on any channel that exists directly beneath ` foo` will be logged.  *  client.subscribe ' foo *', function message  {     console.log 'Message received', message ; } ;   388  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 13   Faye   **  * Subscribes the client to *all* channel segments beneath ` foo`.  *  client.subscribe ' foo **', function message  {     console.log 'Message received', message ; } ;  Faye’s support for wildcard channels presents several interesting possibilities, including the creation   of namespaced topic channels devoted to a specific user  or group of users . For example, consider an  application that organizes its users in a manner similar to that shown in Figure 13-7.  Figure 13-7.  An application in which multiple users are grouped under a parent account  In this application, every user belongs to a parent account  which can have multiple users . Given this  structure, it is easy to imagine a scenario in which we might want to publish a message to a specific user, or  to all users within a particular account. With the help of wildcard subscriptions and namespaced channels,  we can easily accomplish this goal.  The faye-security project that is included with this chapter  see Figure 13-8  builds on several   previously covered topics  AngularJS, Knex, and Bookshelf  to create an application that allows registered  users to sign in and test out various aspects of Faye’s functionality—including the use of wildcard  subscriptions and namespaced channels.  389  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 13   Faye  Figure 13-8.  After signing in, users are presented with a view that allows them to manage channel  subscriptions and to publish messages  When this application’s sign-in form is submitted, a request to the server is made that verifies the   username and password that the user provided. If this request is successful, the server returns an object  that contains information about the authorized user, including a token that will be used to authenticate all  future requests. An excerpt from the  login route’s Angular controller  which is responsible for making this  request  is shown in Listing 13-8.  Listing 13-8.  A Token is Returned After a Successful Login Attempt     faye-security public app.js  excerpt    $scope.login = function   {     if  !$scope.loginForm.$valid  return;     $http.post ' api auth', $scope.model      .then function result  {  390  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 13   Faye          $.cookie 'token', result.data.token, { 'path': ' ' } ;         $location.path ' messages' ;     }      .catch function err  {         alert 'Unable to sign in. Please try again.' ;     } ; };  Among other things, the controller for the  messages route will automatically create two wildcard   subscriptions for the user, as shown in Listing 13-9.  Listing 13-9.  Angular Controller for the  messages Route Creates Two Subscriptions Using Faye’s   Wildcard Syntax     faye-security public app.js  excerpt       Subscribe to channels pertaining to the user's account faye.client.subscribe ' accounts ' + me.account_id + ' **' ;    Subscribe to channels pertaining directly to the user faye.client.subscribe ' users ' + me.id + ' **' ;  These subscriptions will allow us to publish messages to everyone within this user’s account  as well as   to the user directly  by directing those messages to channels that are prefixed appropriately. Listing 13-10  shows this process in action.  Listing 13-10.  A Message is Published to Each Available Account Every Ten Seconds by the Server     faye-security lib server.js  excerpt    setInterval function   {     db.models.Account.where {} .fetchAll  .then function accounts  {         accounts.forEach function account  {             bayeux.getClient  .publish _.sprintf ' accounts %s random', account.id , {                 'account': account.toJSON               } ;         } ;     } ; }, 10000 ;  Implementing Security with Extensions By default, Faye places no restrictions on clients in regard to which channels they are allowed to interact  with. This can be problematic, for obvious reasons: without additional safeguards, nothing would prevent  a user from interacting with channels that are intended for other users. Fortunately, we can easily put those  safeguards in place with the help of Faye’s support for extensions.  Faye provides a simple API for creating extensions that can intercept and  optionally  modify messages   as they move between the client and the server. Such extensions can be created both on the server and  within the browser. The process is identical, regardless of where they are created. Listing 13-11 shows a  simple example of a Faye extension.  391  www.it-ebooks.info   Listing 13-11.  Simple Faye Extension That Logs All Incoming and Outgoing Messages to the Console  Chapter 13   Faye  client.addExtension {     'incoming': function message, callback  {         console.log 'Incoming message', message ;         callback message ;     },     'outgoing': function message, callback  {         console.log 'Outgoing message', message ;         callback message ;     } } ;  Now that we have seen what a simple Faye extension looks like, let’s apply this concept to the sample  web application that is included with this chapter. Refer back to Listing 13-9 and take note of the fact that  after a user signs in, a token that allows us to authorize subsequent requests is stored as a cookie within the  user’s browser. Now refer to Listing 13-12, which shows how the application integrates this information into  a Faye extension.  Listing 13-12.  A Faye Extension Is Created That Automatically Appends the User’s Token to All Outgoing  Messages     faye-security public app.js  excerpt    client.addExtension {     'outgoing': function message, callback  {         message.ext = message.ext  {};         message.ext.token = $.cookie 'token' ;         callback message ;     } } ;  With the Faye extension shown in Listing 13-12 in place, all outgoing messages, including subscription   requests, will automatically have the user’s token appended to them. We can use this fact to our advantage by  creating a corresponding extension on the server, as shown in Listing 13-13.  Listing 13-13.  Server-side Faye Extension That Rejects Subscription Requests to Secure Channels when the  Appropriate Credentials Are Not Provided     faye-security lib faye-extensions auth.js   var db = require '.. db' ;   module.exports = function bayeux  {       bayeux.addExtension {           'incoming': function message, callback  {             if  message.channel !== ' meta subscribe'  return callback message ;             var token = message.ext && message.ext.token;             var segments = message.subscription.split ' ' ;  392  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 13   Faye              switch  segments[1]  {                 case 'accounts':                     db.models.User.where {                         'token': token,                         'account_id': segments[2]                     } .fetch {                         'require': true                     } .then function user  {                         return callback message ;                     } .catch function err  {                         message.error = 'Permission denied.';                         return callback message ;                     } ;                 break;                 case 'users':                     db.models.User.where {                         'token': token,                         'id': segments[2]                     } .fetch {                         'require': true                     } .then function user  {                         return callback message ;                     } .catch function   {                         message.error = 'Permission denied.';                         return callback message ;                     } ;                 break;                 default:                     return callback message ;                 break             }         }       } ;   };  When the server receives a message on the  meta subscribe channel, the extension shown in    Listing 13-13 checks to see if the specified channel falls under one of our secure namespaces   accounts or    users . If it does, the extension checks for the presence of a token and uses that information to look up the  corresponding user from the database. If a match is found, the message is allowed to continue on its way.  Otherwise, the subscription is rejected as a result of the error property being assigned to the message.  Summary  In this chapter, you became familiar with a number of concepts that allow you to implement near real-time  communication within browser-based applications. You successfully installed and configured Faye both  on the server and within the browser. You discovered how Faye facilitates the passing of messages between  clients through the use of publish-subscribe topic channels. You then took that concept a step further through  the use of namespaced channels and wildcard subscriptions. You also learned how to extend Faye, allowing  you to monitor, modify, and  optionally  reject messages as they pass between clients and the server.  393  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 13   Faye  In our experience, the best approach for implementing asynchronous, event-driven communication   on the Web involves a plan that takes advantage of WebSockets, has fallback solutions in place, and  provides a convenient layer of abstraction on top that doesn’t force you to think about the network layer.  Faye aligns with these needs quite well by combining the speed and efficiency of WebSockets with the  stability of the Bayeux protocol to create a rock-solid approach to implementing asynchronous, event-driven  communication on the Web.

Hard work isn’t my forte.  —Q, Star Trek: Voyager  JavaScript is an asynchronous language. Developers can instruct the JavaScript runtime, whether in the  browser or on the server, to “schedule” code to be run at a future point in time. This feature is often used  to delay the start of a CPU-intensive or long-running operation, giving an application time to finish its  current tasks before moving on to more labor-intensive ones. This feature is so powerful that traditionally  synchronous languages like Java, C, PHP, and Ruby have followed suit and adopted it. Some languages, like  C, have implemented the asynchronous execution model as a language feature  via the async and await  keywords ; other languages, like PHP, support asynchronicity with external libraries like React  not to be  confused with FaceBoook’s JavaScript library, React . In either case, asynchronous code and synchronous  code are bound to meet.  Q, a JavaScript library that encapsulates asynchronous behavior behind an interface that reads very   much like synchronous code, is the topic of this chapter. Q produces promises, specialized objects that may  be chained together to eliminate nested callbacks, propogate values and errors, and generally manage flow  control in asynchronous code. Before plumbing the depths of Q, however, it is worthwhile to take a small  detour and examine why asynchronous code can be difficult to write and manage.  Timing Is Everything  Synchronous code is fairly simple to read because the computer executes one statement at a time. Return  values that are generated by synchronous code  for example, by a method invocation  are available to calling  code immediately after they are returned. Languages with structured exception handling features provide  try catch finally blocks that can be used to anticipate and deal with errors when they arise, so that trivial   or recoverable  errors don’t prove fatal to an application. But structured exception handling only works with  synchronous code; it behaves like a goto statement that causes code to “jump” to some other point in the  application and resume statement execution at that point.  Asynchronous code behaves a bit differently. In JavaScript, asynchronous code is scheduled to run at   a future point in time  sometimes right after the currently executing code . This breaks the synchronous  model because future code will only run after the current stack unwinds. Return values and errors that are  created in asynchronous code, then, must also be handled in the future, when that code actually runs.  Many languages  JavaScript included  solve this problem with callbacks, functions that are passed   as arguments to asynchronous code that will be invoked once that code has run to handle errors and deal  with “return values.” The Node.js runtime, which relies heavily on JavaScript’s scheduling capabilities,  even specifies a standard signature for all callback functions so that asynchronous errors are handled and  propagated correctly.  395  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 14   Q  Listing 14-1.  Unfortunately, nested asynchronous code can quickly become complex. Consider the example in   Listing 14-1.  Asynchronous Node.js Example     example-001 index.js 'use strict'; var fs = require 'fs' ; var path = require 'path' ; var playerStats = require '. player-stats' ;   function getPlayerStats gamesFilePath, playerID, cb  {      fs.readFile   is asynchronous   fs.readFile gamesFilePath, {encoding: 'utf8'}, function  err, content  {     if  err  {       return cb err ;     }       var games = JSON.parse content ;     var playerGames = games.filter function  game  {       return game.player === playerID;     } ;          playerStats.calcBest   is asynchronous     playerStats.calcBest playerGames, function  err, bestStats  {       if  err  {         return cb err ;       }          playerStats.calcAvg   is asynchronous       playerStats.calcAvg playerGames, function  err, avgStats  {         if  err  {           return cb err ;         }         cb null, {best: bestStats, avg: avgStats} ;       } ;     } ;   } ; }   var gamesFilePath = path.join __dirname, 'games.json' ; getPlayerStats gamesFilePath, 42, function  err, stats  {   if  err  {     console.error err ;     return process.exit 1 ;   }   console.log 'best:', stats.best ;   console.log 'avg: ', stats.avg  } ;  396  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 14   Q  In this example, JavaScript code is scheduled four times:  1.  The declaration and invocation of getPlayerStats    2.  The invocation of fs.readFile    3.  The invocation of playerStats.calcBest    4.  The invocation of playerStats.calcAvg                It is easy to imagine that playerStats might be an external service that is slow to respond to inquiries.   But if this code was synchronous, as in Listing 14-2, everything would be scheduled once. Each function and  method would be invoked in order, all grouped in a try catch block to deal with any synchronous errors,  and stats would be written to the console as received.  Listing 14-2.  Synchronous Node.js Example     example-002 index.js 'use strict'; var fs = require 'fs' ; var path = require 'path' ; var playerStats = require '. player-stats' ;   try {  var gamesFilePath = path.join __dirname, 'games.json' ;       fs.readFileSync   is synchronous   var content = fs.readFileSync gamesFilePath, {encoding: 'utf8'} ;   var games = JSON.parse content ;   var playerGames = games.filter function  game  {     return game.player === 42;   } ;      playerStats.calcBestSync   is synchronous   console.log 'best:', playerStats.calcBestSync playerGames  ;      playerStats.calcAvgSync   is synchronous   console.log 'avg :', playerStats.calcAvgSync playerGames  ; } catch  e  {   console.error e ;   process.exit 1 ; }  This synchronous example is much easier to follow though every statement blocks the flow of execution   until finished. Asynchronous callback-driven code, while alleviating this drawback, still has a number of  significant problems.  First, there is no real canonical standard to which callback signatures must adhere. The Node.js   convention is the most widely adopted, but module authors can  and do  create APIs that do not honor this  standard. Often this happens when a JavaScript module wraps or emulates an existing, non-JavaScript API.  The module author might make a decision to mimic the callback signature pattern of that API over the   Node.js convention for familiarity.  Second, callbacks propagate errors manually. Each callback must inspect the err object and determine   what to do with it or forward it to another callback that will do the same. A lot of boilerplate error-checking  code tends to be the result. In synchronous code, exceptions are propagated up the stack automatically until  handled by a catch block.  It is also easy to miss or improperly handle synchronous errors that occur in asynchronous code. In   Listing 14-3, a try catch block wraps the synchronous JSON.parse call, then propagates either the parsed  JavaScript object when successful, or the caught exception when parsing fails.  397  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 14   Q  Listing 14-3.  Improperly Invoking a Callback Within a try catch Block     example-003 improper-async-error-handling.js 'use strict'; var fs = require 'fs' ; var path = require 'path' ;   function readJSONFile filePath, cb  {   fs.readFile filePath, function  err, buffer  {     try {       var json = JSON.parse buffer.toString   ;       cb null, json ;     } catch  e  {       console.log 'where did this error come from?', e.message ;       cb e ;     }   } ; }   var gamesFilePath = path.join __dirname, 'games.json' ; readJSONFile gamesFilePath, function  err, json  {   if  err  {     return console.error 'parsing json did not succeed : ' ;   }   console.log 'parsing json was successful : ' ;   throw new Error 'should never happen, right?' ; } ;     example-003 proper-async-error-handling.js 'use strict'; var fs = require 'fs' ; var path = require 'path' ;   function readJSONFile filePath, cb  {   fs.readFile filePath, function  err, buffer  {     var json, err;     try {       json = JSON.parse buffer.toString   ;     } catch  e  {       err = e;     }  398  www.it-ebooks.info  Assume that the games.json file exists and has valid JSON data. In this example the callback will be   invoked within the try block, after the data has been parsed. But notice what happens when an exception  is thrown within the callback. This exception will unwind the stack back into the try block and cause the  catch block to trap the exception, invoking the callback a second time with the very same error the callback  generated. This will likely have unintended consequences. The appropriate way to handle this error, as  demonstrated in Listing 14-4, is to avoid invoking the callback in the try catch block altogether.  Listing 14-4.  Improperly Invoking a Callback Within a try catch Block   Chapter 14   Q      if  err  {       console.log 'where did this error come from?', e.message ;       return cb err ;     }     cb null, json ;   } ; }   var gamesFilePath = path.join __dirname, 'games.json' ; readJSONFile gamesFilePath, function  err, json  {   if  err  {     return console.error 'parsing json did not succeed : ' ;   }   console.log 'parsing json was successful : ' ;   throw new Error 'should never happen, right?' ; } ;  Finally, nesting callbacks is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, each callback has access to data  in its own closure and the closures encompassing it; on the other hand, nesting quickly leads to convoluted  and tightly coupled code. The true flow of a program can become obscured, producing an unmaintainable  ecosystem conducive to bugs.  Promises vs. Callbacks  To mitigate the challenges created by asynchronous callbacks, a number of proposals and specifications  were drawn up by members of the JavaScript community, culminating in the Promises A+ specification.   This specification, and the others from which it draws, defines a way to encapsulate asynchronous operations  within a special object called a “promise” that may be combined with other promises to create a kind of  asynchronous chain through which values and errors can be propagated and dealt with as necessary.  A promise, as defined by the Promises A+ spec, represents its asynchronous operation with three states:   pending, fulfilled, and rejected. If we think of this in callback terms, it would correspond to Listing 14-5.  Listing 14-5.  Callback Equivalents to Promise States     invoking the function means the operation is "pending" asyncFunction function asyncCallback  err, asyncData  {   if  err  {        if an error occurred the operation is "rejected"   }      otherwise the operation is "fulfilled" } ;  A promise is also called a “thenable” because it has a then   method that accepts two optional   callbacks: the first to be invoked if the promise’s asynchronous operation is fulfilled, and the second to be  invoked if the operation is rejected. The full signature is displayed in Listing 14-6.  399  www.it-ebooks.info   But wait! Isn’t the whole point of promises to eliminate callbacks? No, the point of promises is to streamline   the process of chaining asynchronous operations together, a process that usually leads developers down the  path of nested callbacks. Notice that a promise’s then   method actually returns a promise, too. This promise  will also be either fulfilled or rejected according to what happens in the original promise’s callbacks. By taking  advantage of this feature, the player stats code can be rewritten in Listing 14-7 to nearly eliminate nesting.  Chapter 14   Q  Listing 14-6.  Thenable Method Signature   **  * @param {Function} [onFulfilled]  * @param {Function} [onRejected]  * @returns {Promise}  *  promise.then onFulfilled, onRejected   Listing 14-7.  Promises Reduce Nesting     example-004 index.js 'use strict'; var fs = require 'fs' ; var path = require 'path' ; var playerStats = require '. player-stats' ; var Q = require 'q' ;   function getPlayerStats gamesFilePath, playerID, cb  {      load   returns a promise   playerStats.load gamesFilePath, playerID      .then function  games  {          Q.all   returns a promise       return Q.all [            calcBest   returns a promise         playerStats.calcBest games ,            calcAvg   returns a promise         playerStats.calcAvg games        ] ;     }      .done function  allStats  {       cb null, {best: allStats[0], avg: allStats[1]} ;     }, function  err  {       cb err ;     } ; }   var gamesFilePath = path.join __dirname, 'games.json' ; getPlayerStats gamesFilePath, 42, function  err, stats  {   if  err  {     console.error err ;     return process.exit 1 ;   }   console.log 'best:', stats.best ;   console.log 'avg: ', stats.avg  } ;  400  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 14   Q  In Listing 14-7, only the final done   invocation receives resolution and rejection callbacks; all other  invocations only receive a resolution callback  the functions from the playerStats module . Thenables  that are called in succession are called promise chains. What happens if one of those intermediate then    invocations generates an error? Unlike the asynchronous callback model, promises will automatically  propagate an error through the promise chain until it is handled  like structured exception handling . There are  specific rules and use cases that can change this behavior, but in general it works exactly as one would expect.  Other interesting aspects of this example will be explained later  like how the return values of   fulfillment and rejection callbacks can affect a promise chain . It should be immediately evident, however,  that promises can reduce callback nesting and automate error propagation, two of the chief problems that  arise from asynchronous JavaScript code.  The Promise of Q  Q is an open source JavaScript library that implements the Promises A+ specification, but it is hardly the  only one available to developers. Several other libraries, like when.js and Bluebird, offer thenables as well, a  fact that is important to note because a stated goal of the spec is to provide “an interoperable base which all  Promises A+ conformant promise implementations can be depended on to provide.” This means that any  promise library that conforms to the specification may be used with any other library that does the same.  Developers aren’t forced to choose among a series of competing candidates. Most promise libraries offer  auxiliary functionality that complements the core thenable interface. Developers are free to choose and mix  promise libraries that solve different problems as needed.  Unfortunately, libraries that don’t conform to the  Promises A+ spec, like jQuery.Deferred, will not integrate this way.   Q is the subject of this chapter for a few strong reasons:   	  	  	   	  It conforms to the Promises A+ spec.  It was written by Kris Kowal, a contributor to the spec.  It enjoys wide adoption and support in the JavaScript community  client- and   server-side .  AngularJS, a popular browser framework backed by Google, borrows heavily from Q.  The rest of this chapter will examine Q’s implementation in light of the case made for promises over   asynchronous, callback-driven code.  Deferreds and Promises While the Promises A+ specification defines how a thenable object behaves, it does not explicitly state  how an asynchronous operation should trigger the callbacks provided to a thenable. It only defines the  rules for representing the state of an asynchronous operation in a promise, and how values and errors are  propagated through promise chains. In practice, many promise libraries use an object called a deferred to  manipulate the state of a promise. Deferreds are usually created first, wired up to handle the resolution of an  asynchronous operation, then generate a promise to be used by calling code later. Listing 14-8 demonstrates  how to create a deferred and return its promise.  401  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 14   Q  Listing 14-8.  Creating a Deferred  var Q = require 'q' ;   function asyncFunc   {      create a deferred   var d = Q.defer  ;          perform some async operation and      manipulate the *deferred*        return the deferred's promise   return d.promise; }      the function returns a thenable! asyncFunc  .then function    {      success :  }, function    {      error :  } ;  In Listing 14-8 Q.defer   is invoked to create a deferred object which will be used to manipulate   the state of the promise in the future, when asynchronous code is actually run  more on this in a bit . The  important thing here is that the deferred owns a promise—one that is returned from asyncFunc  , and  to which callbacks may be attached by calling its then   method. The actual invocation of asyncFunc    and the subscriptions to the state changes for the returned promise are all scheduled together. However  asyncFunc   chooses to resolve or reject its deferred  and thereby change the state of the promise returned   is entirely up to the developer.  Listing 14-9 is a simple implementation of the calcAvg   function from the fictitious playerStats   module mentioned earlier. Using a reduce operation to sum a series of numbers and then divide by  the series length  yielding the average  is a synchronous operation. To make it asynchronous, the code  is wrapped in the Node.js function process.nextTick  , which schedules the code to run on the next  iteration of the event loop.  The same could be accomplished with setTimeout   or setImmediate  .   If the calculation is successful, the promise is put into a resolved state with d.resolve  , which accepts  some value to be passed to any resolution callbacks attached to the promise. Likewise, if an error arises  for  example, the length of the games array is zero, generating a divide-by-zero error , the promise is placed into a  rejected state with d.reject  .  Listing 14-9.  Using a Deferred in the calcAvg   Implementation     example-004 player-stats.js var Q = require 'q' ;   module.exports = {        load: function  gamesFilePath, playerID  {...}          calcBest: function  games  {...},    402  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 14   Q    calcAvg: function  games  {     var stats = {       totalRounds: 0,       avgRoundsWon: 0,       avgRoundsLost: 0     };       var deferred = Q.defer  ;       process.nextTick function    {       if  games.length === 0  {         deferred.reject new Error 'no games'  ;         return;       }         var wins = 0, losses = 0;       games.forEach function  game  {         if  game.rounds === 0  return;         stats.totalRounds += game.rounds;         wins += game.won;         losses += game.lost;       } ;         stats.avgRoundsWon =  wins   stats.totalRounds * 100          .toFixed 2  + '%';       stats.avgRoundsLost =  losses   stats.totalRounds * 100          .toFixed 2  + '%';         deferred.resolve stats ;     } ;       return deferred.promise;   } };     example-005 callbackdb database.js 'use strict';   module.exports = {   customer: {        requires a callback     find: function  criteria, cb  {       cb null, {         id: criteria.id,         name: 'Nicholas Cloud'       } ;     }   } };    Listing 14-10 demonstrates how deferreds and promises can also be used to wrap asynchronous,   callback-driven APIs.  Listing 14-10.  Using a Deferred to Wrap an Asynchronous, Callback-Driven API  403  www.it-ebooks.info   This model of wrapping asynchronous code is so common, in fact, that Q provides a number of  convenience methods to reduce the burden of writing boilerplate code. Q’s deferred objects have a  makeNodeResolver   method that, when invoked, creates a dummy callback that can be passed to any  standard asynchronous callback-based function. When this callback is invoked, however, it simply changes  the state of the deferred with the appropriate value or error, whichever happened to be passed to the  callback. Listing 14-11 shows how a resolver can replace the need for a manually written callback.  Chapter 14   Q     example-005 callbackdb find-customer-callback.js var Q = require 'q' ,   db = require '. database' ;   function loadCustomer customerID  {   var d = Q.defer  ;        db.customer.find   is asynchronous   db.customer.find {id: customerID}, function  err, customer  {     if  err  {       return d.reject err ;     }     d.resolve customer ;   } ;     return d.promise; }   loadCustomer 1001 .then function  customer  {   console.log 'found', customer.id, customer.name ; }, function  err  {   console.error err ; } ;  Listing 14-11.  Making a Node Resolver Callback     example-005 callbackdb database.js 'use strict';   module.exports = {   customer: {        requires a callback     find: function  criteria, cb  {       cb null, {         id: criteria.id,         name: 'Nicholas Cloud'       } ;     }   } };      example-005 callbackdb find-customer-makenoderesolver.js var Q = require 'q' ,   db = require '. database' ;    404  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 14   Q  function loadCustomer customerID  {   var d = Q.defer  ;        db.customer.find   is asynchronous   var deferredCallback = d.makeNodeResolver  ;   db.customer.find {id: customerID}, deferredCallback ;     return d.promise; }   loadCustomer 2001 .then function  customer  {   console.log 'found', customer.id, customer.name ; }, function  err  {   console.error err ; } ;  In this case the client code calling loadCustomer   expects a promise, but the database API expects  a callback, so makeNodeResolver   naturally fits. If the inverse is true—if the client code expected to pass  a callback to the loadCustomer   function but the database actually returned a promise—invoking the  nodeify   method on the database’s promise would invoke the callback appropriately. The promise in  Listing 14-12 is tapped in precisely this manner.  Listing 14-12.  Passing a Traditional Asynchronous Callback to a Promise with nodeify       example-005 promisedb database.js 'use strict'; var Q = require 'q' ;   module.exports = {   customer: {        returns a promise; does not use callbacks     find: function  criteria  {       return Q {         id: criteria.id,         name: 'Nicholas Cloud'       } ;     }   } };      example-005 promisedb find-customer-nodeify.js var Q = require 'q' ,   db = require '. database' ;   function loadCustomer customerID, cb  {        db.customer.find   returns a promise   db.customer.find {id: customerID}      .nodeify cb ;    405  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 14   Q     * equivalent to:    *    * db.customer.find {id: customerID} .then function  customer  {    *   cb null, customer ;    * }, function  err  {    *   cb err ;    * } ;    *  }   loadCustomer 3001, function  err, customer  {   if  err  {     return console.err err ;   }   console.log 'found', customer.id, customer.name ; } ;  Values and Errors Resolving deferreds with simple values or errors usually meets most needs, but there are a number of  promise resolution rules defined by the Promises A+ spec—and Q’s implementation—that give a developer  further control over promise state.  Resolving Deferreds with Promised Values The behavior of deferreds can change depending on what “value” is passed to their resolve   methods. If  the value is a normal object or primitive, it will be passed to the resolution callback attached to the deferred’s  promise as is. If the “value” is another promise, as in Listing 14-13, the state of the second promise will be  essentially “forwarded” to the appropriate callbacks of the first: if the second promise becomes resolved, the  resolution callback of the first will receive its value; if it becomes rejected, the rejection callback of the first  will receive its error.  Listing 14-13.  Resolving a Deferred with a Promise     example-006 index.js 'use strict';   var Q = require 'q' ,   airport = require '. airport' ,   reservation = require '. reservation' ;   function findAvailableSeats departingFlights  {   var d = Q.defer  ;   process.nextTick function    {     var availableSeats = [];     departingFlights.forEach function  flight  {       var openFlightSeats = reservation.findOpenSeats flight ;       availableSeats = availableSeats.concat openFlightSeats ;     } ;  406  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 14   Q         resolve the deferred with an object value     if  availableSeats.length  {       d.resolve availableSeats ;     } else {       d.reject new Error 'sorry, no seats available'  ;     }   } ;   return d.promise; }   function lookupFlights fromAirport, toAirport, departingAt  {   var d = Q.defer  ;   process.nextTick function    {     var departingFlights = airport.findFlights        fromAirport, toAirport, departingAt      ;        resolve the deferred with another promise     d.resolve findAvailableSeats departingFlights  ;   } ;   return d.promise; }   lookupFlights 'STL', 'DFW', '2015-01-10' .then function  seats  {   console.log 'available seats:', seats ; }, function  err  {   console.error 'sorry:', err ; } ;  Because the first deferred ultimately depends on the resolution or rejection of the second promise, it   will remain in a pending state for as long as the second promise is pending as well. Once the second promise  is resolved or rejected, the deferred will follow suit, invoking the appropriate callback.  Forwarding Values, Errors, and Promises in Callbacks Once a resolution or rejection callback receives a value or error, several things can happen. If the end of the  promise chain has been reached  or if there is no other chained promises , usually the client code will do  something with the value or log the error.  Because thenables always return another promise when then   is invoked, however, it is possible to  use resolution and rejection callbacks to manipulate values and errors and then forward them to the new  promise, to be handled by later callbacks.  Manipulating a value is easy enough. Simply alter or transform the value passed to the resolution  callback and return it. In Listing 14-14 an array is manipulated in the resolution callback for a database  promise, and then returned once the values are appropriately filtered.  Listing 14-14.  Returning a Value in a Resolution Callback     example-007 index.js 'use strict'; var db = require '. database' ;    407  www.it-ebooks.info   Resolution callbacks can also forward errors to promises down the chain. If they do, then the next  rejection callback will be invoked with the returned error. In Listing 14-15, if a user submits too many  guesses  for some fictional contest , an error is created and thrown inside a thenable’s resolution callback.  This error will be propagated to the next rejection callback in the promise chain.  Chapter 14   Q  function findPalindromeNames   {      db.customers.find   returns a promise   return db.customer.find  .then function  customers  {        return a filtered array that will be forwarded        to the next resolution callback     return customers.filter function  customer  {          filter customers with palindrome names       var name = customer.name.toLowerCase  ;       var eman = name.split '' .reverse  .join '' ;       return name === eman;     } .map function  customer  {          return only customer names       return customer.name;     } ;   } ; }   findPalindromeNames  .then function  names  {   console.log names ; } ;  Listing 14-15.  Throwing an Error in a Resolution Callback     example-008 index.js 'use strict'; var db = require '. database' ; var MaxGuessError = require '. max-guess-error' ;   var MAX_GUESSES = 5;   function submitGuess userID, guess  {      db.user.find   returns a promise   return db.user.find {id: userID} .then function  user  {     if  user.guesses.length === MAX_GUESSES  {       throw new MaxGuessError MAX_GUESSES ;     }        otherwise update the user...   } ; }   submitGuess 1001, 'Professor Plum' .then function    {      won't get called if there is an error   console.log 'guess submitted' ; }, function  maxGuessError  {      oops, an error occurred!   console.error 'invalid guess' ;   console.error maxGuessError.toString   ; } ;  408  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 14   Q  Recall that, in a traditional asynchronous callback model, thrown exceptions must be manually handled   and accounted for  which means that unpredictable exceptions will often slip past scrutiny . Q handles this  automatically; any exception thrown in a thenable callback will be caught and propagated appropriately,  even though all thenable callbacks are executed asynchronously.  Rejection callbacks follow similar rules, but with a mental twist. They do not receive values; instead,   they receive errors, so a developer might reasonably expect that returning an error from a rejection   callback would trigger the next rejection callback further down the promise chain. But that is incorrect.   In Listing 14-16, the last promise in the chain will be resolved, not rejected, even though an error is returned  from the rejection callback inside submitGuess  .  Listing 14-16.  Returning an Error in a Rejection Callback     example-009 index.js 'use strict'; var db = require '. database' ; var NotFoundError = require '. not-found-error' ;   function submitGuess userID, guess  {      db.user.find   returns a promise   return db.user.find {id: userID} .then function  user  {      *      * database generates an error so this promise      * won't be resolved      *    }, function  err  {     var notFoundError = new NotFoundError userID ;     notFoundError.innerError = err;     return notFoundError;   } ; }   submitGuess 1001, 'Colonel Mustard' .then function  value  {    *    * oops, this promise was resolved, and    * value === notFoundError!    *    console.log 'guess submitted' ;   console.log value ; }, function  notFoundError  {    *    * you expect this promise to get rejected...    * but you are wrong    *    console.error 'an error occurred' ;   console.error notFoundError ; } ;  This seems counterintuitive. If an error is returned from a rejection callback one might reasonably   expect it to propagate, but that isn’t what happens. On second glance, however, this begins to make sense,  because it allows developers to handle errors that do not need to be propagated and still gracefully resolve  the promise chain by returning some value.  If the code in Listing 14-16 is modified to queue guesses when the database becomes unavailable, it   makes sense to resolve the promise chain even when an error is generated, as demonstrated in Listing 14-17.  409  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 14   Q  Listing 14-17.  Muffling an Error in a Rejection Callback     example-010 index.js 'use strict'; var db = require '. database' ; var guessQueue = require '. guess-queue' ;   function submitGuess userID, guess  {      db.user.find   returns a promise   return db.user.find {id: userID} .then function  user  {      *      * database generates an error so this promise      * won't be resolved      *    }, function  err  {     console.error err ;      *      * database is probably offline, queue for future      * processing      *      return guessQueue.enqueue userID, guess ;   } ; }   submitGuess 1001, 'Miss Scarlett' .then function  value  {    *    * guess is queued when the database connection    * fails, so the error is suppressed    *    console.log 'guess submitted' ; }, function  notFoundError  {   console.error 'an error occurred' ;   console.error notFoundError ; } ;  Listing 14-18.  Throwing an Error in a Rejection Callback     example-011 index.js 'use strict'; var db = require '. database' ; var NotFoundError = require '. not-found-error' ;   function submitGuess userID, guess  {      db.user.find   returns a promise   return db.user.find {id: userID} .then function  user  {      *      * database generates an error so this promise      * won't be resolved      *   410  www.it-ebooks.info  Like resolution callbacks, errors must be thrown in rejection callbacks in order to properly set the next   promise’s state to rejected, as demonstrated in Listing 14-18.   Chapter 14   Q    }, function  err  {      *      * error is *thrown*, not returned      *      var notFoundError = new NotFoundError userID ;     notFoundError.innerError = err;     throw notFoundError;   } ; }   submitGuess 1001, 'Mrs. Peacock' .then function  value  {    *    * since error was thrown within the promise    * the promise will not be resolved    *  }, function  notFoundError  {    *    * the promise is rejected, as expected!    *    console.error 'an error occurred' ;   console.error notFoundError ; } ;  Listing 14-19.  Returning Another Promise in a Resolution Callback     example-012 index.js 'use strict'; var db = require '. database' ; var MaxGuessError = require '. max-guess-error' ;   var MAX_GUESSES = 5;   function submitGuess userID, guess  {      db.user.find   returns a promise   return db.user.find {id: userID} .then function  user  {     if  user.guesses.length === MAX_GUESSES  {       throw new MaxGuessError MAX_GUESSES ;     }        otherwise update the user     user.guesses.push guess ;     return db.user.update user ;   } ; }    Just as deferreds can be resolved with other promises, so too can thenable callbacks return promises  that, when resolved or rejected, will affect the state of the callback chain. Promises may be returned from  both resolution and rejection callbacks. In Listing 14-19, a second promise is returned if the database call is  successful, otherwise an exception is thrown.  411  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 14   Q  submitGuess 1001, 'Professor Plum' .then function    {    *    * should be called with the database has    * finished updating the user    *    console.log 'guess submitted' ; }, function  maxGuessError  {   console.error 'invalid guess' ;   console.error maxGuessError.toString   ; } ;  Turning Simple Values into Promises Q can turn any value into a promise, simply by invoking Q as a function with the value as its only argument.  Listing 14-20 wraps a simple string that will be used as the value passed to the next resolution handler in the  promise chain.  Listing 14-20.  Turning a Value into a Promise     example-013 index.js 'use strict'; var Q = require 'q' ;   Q 'khan!' .then function  value  {   console.log value ;   khan! } ;  This may seem trivial but it can be a convenient way to wrap existing, synchronous code with actual   return values into a promise-based API. You can invoke Q without a value, which will create an empty  promise in a resolved state.  Invoking Q with a promise from another library will also wrap that promise in Q’s interface as well. This  can be very helpful when a developer wishes to use Q’s promise methods like nodeify   when dealing with  another promise library that has no equivalent.  Reporting Progress Sometimes asynchronous operations take a long period to complete. During this time it can be helpful  to give some indication of progress to client code, whether as a simple meter  e.g., percentage complete   or to deliver bits of data as they are made available  e.g., events raised by EventEmitter . Q augments the  Promises A+ spec by adding a third callback parameter to then  , shown in Listing 14-21, which can be  used to capture progress events as they occur.  Listing 14-21.  Q’s Thenable Method Signature   **  * @param {Function} [onFulfilled]  * @param {Function} [onRejected]  * @param {Function} [onProgress]  * @returns {Promise}  *  promise.then onFulfilled, onRejected, onProgress   412  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 14   Q  While the Promises A+ specification does not establish a pattern for progress notification, Q still   conforms because its thenables all still support the prescribed then   method signature.  Just as the fulfillment and rejection callbacks are invoked when a deferred is fulfilled or rejected, so too,  the progress callback is invoked when a deferred’s notify   method is called. This method accepts a single  argument, which is then passed to the progress callback. In Listing 14-22, a long-running asynchronous  operation keeps track of how many attempts it makes to do some work  perhaps call an API that is frequently  unresponsive . Each time an attempt is made, a counter is incremented and its value is passed to the  notify   method. The progress callback receives this data immediately. Once the deferred has been  resolved, the promise chain is finished and the final done   callback is invoked.  Listing 14-22.  Notifying the Deferred’s Promise         The UI thread should respond to text field input, even though many DOM elements are  being added.                  function    {     var Q = window.Q;     var output = document.querySelector 'output' ;       function writeOutput msg  {       var pre = document.createElement 'pre' ;       pre.innerHTML = msg;       output.insertBefore pre, output.firstChild ;     }       function longAsync   {       var d = Q.defer  ;         var attempts = 0;         var handle = setInterval function    {            each time the scheduled code runs,            send a notification with the attempt            number         attempts += 1;         d.notify attempts ;         if  attempts === 1200  {           clearInterval handle ;           return d.resolve  ;         }       }, 0 ;         return d.promise;     }    413  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 14   Q         not using the rejection callback, only the        resolution and progress callbacks     longAsync  .then function    {       writeOutput ' done ' ;     }, null, function  attempts  {       writeOutput 'notification: ' + attempts ;     } ;   }   ;    It is important to note that, while any resolution or rejection callbacks attached to a thenable will be   invoked according to what has already happened in a promise chain, only those progress callbacks that are  attached prior to a notification event will actually receive an update. Consider the code in Listing 14-23 and  the resulting console output in Listing 14-24.  Listing 14-23.  Notifying a Deferred’s Promise Before Progress Callback Is Added     example-015 index.js 'use strict'; var Q = require 'q' ;   function brokenPromise   {   var d = Q.defer  ;   process.nextTick function    {     console.log 'scheduled first' ;     d.notify 'notifying' ;     d.resolve 'resolving' ;     console.log 'logging' ;   } ;   return d.promise; }   var promise = brokenPromise  ;   process.nextTick function    {   console.log 'scheduled second' ;   promise.then function  value  {     console.log value ;   }, null, function  progress  {     console.log progress ;   } ; } ;  In Listing 14-23, a deferred is created, then notified and resolved asynchronously. The callbacks are   attached to then   only after the deferred’s methods have been invoked. The console output in Listing 14-24  reflects what happens when the code is run as a Node.js script.  414  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 14   Q  Listing 14-24.  Console Output Without Notification  $ node index.js scheduled first logging scheduled second resolving  The logging statement is displayed before notifying or resolving, as there are no callbacks attached   to the deferred’s promise when the scheduled code in the function brokenPromise   is actually run.  After brokenPromise   is invoked, more code is scheduled to attach a resolution callback and a progress  callback to the promise. When the scheduled code runs, the progress callback is completely ignored, yet  the resolution callback receives its value. Why? Because the progress callback was added in code scheduled  after the deferred’s notify   method was called. Resolutions and rejections are, according to the Promises  A+ spec, guaranteed to propagate when new callbacks are added to a thenable, but Q treats notifications as  “real-time” events that only propagate to callbacks attached at the time of notification.  Everything Ends To further mimic synchronous code conventions, Q provides both catch   and finally   methods that  parallel their respective counterparts in synchronous, structured exception handling.  The catch   method is really an alias for then null, onRejection . Like then  , catch   will not halt   the promise chain, but it does allow developers to deal with errors at arbitrary points in the promise chain.  The code in Listing 14-25 uses catch   to intercept a potential HTTP failure. Because catch   itself returns a  promise, its callback can return any value  or throw another error  to be handled later in the promise chain.  Listing 14-25.  Catching Errors in a Promise Chain     example-016 index.js 'use strict'; var Q = require 'q' ; var api = require '. api' ; var InvalidTeamError = require '. invalid-team-error' ;   function loadTeamRoster teamID  {      api.get   returns a promise   return api.get ' team ' + teamID + ' roster'      .catch function  err  {        *        * throw a meaningful exception rather than        * propagate an HTTP error        *        if  err.statusCode === 404  {         throw new InvalidTeamError teamID ;       }     } ; }    415  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 14   Q  loadTeamRoster 123 .then function  roster  {   console.log roster ; } .catch function  err  {   console.error err.message ; } ;  The finally   method behaves like then   with one caveat: it may not alter any value or error it  receives, though it may return an entirely new promise to be propagated along the promise chain. If it  returns nothing, the original value or error it received will be passed along instead.  The real purpose of the finally   method mirrors the purpose of the finally portion of a try catch   block. It allows code to clean up resources before the thread of execution proceeds. Listing 14-26 shows how  a database connection might be closed using a finally   block. Regardless of whether the connection or  update succeeds, the code in the finally   callback will always run, cleaning up the database handle if it  remains open.  Listing 14-26.  Cleaning Up Resources in a Promise Chain     example-017 index.js 'use strict'; var Q = require 'q' ; var db = require '. database' ;   var user = {   id: 1001,   name: 'Nicholas Cloud',   occupation: 'Code Monkey' };   db.connect  .then function  conn  {   return conn.user.update user      .finally function    {       if  conn.isOpen  {         conn.close  ;       }     } ; } ;  When finally   is called, it does not actually terminate the promise chain. But there will likely be  places in code where you will wish to do so, to handle a final value or error in a series of asynchronous  operations when no further handlers will be added. This can be accomplished in a number of ways. The  obvious way to terminate a chain is to simply discontinue it by ignoring a final promise created by then  .  Unfortunately, that promise may have already been rejected by upstream code in the promise chain. This  means that Q will hold onto any error generated in the promise chain that is not handled in case a   future rejection callback is added. If a promise chain is “terminated” without a rejection callback, as in  Listing 14-27, the error is never reported—it evaporates into the ether—and the resolution callback will  never be executed.  416  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 14   Q  Listing 14-27.  Improperly Terminating a Promise Chain     example-018 index01.js 'use strict'; var Q = require 'q' ;   function crankyFunction   {   var d = Q.defer  ;   process.nextTick function    {     d.reject new Error 'get off my lawn!'  ;   } ;   return d.promise; }      no rejection callback to display the error crankyFunction  .then function  value  {   console.log 'never resolved' ; } ;  Listing 14-28.  Terminating a Promise Chain with done       example-018 index02.js crankyFunction  .done function  value  {     ... } ;  Listing 14-29.  Unhandled Error Thrown by done    $ node index02.js  ... node_modules q q.js:126                     throw e;                           ^ Error: get off my lawn!     at  ... code q example-018 index02.js:7:14     at process._tickCallback  node.js:419:13      at Function.Module.runMain  module.js:499:11      at startup  node.js:119:16      at node.js:906:3  To counter this, promises created by Q also have a done   method, which does not return a promise and   throws any unhandled error in a future turn of the event loop to be addressed by other means. This method  is demonstrated in Listing 14-28.  Even though a rejection callback is not supplied, the JavaScript context will still terminate because   an unhandled error was automatically thrown by Q’s done   method. The console output in Listing 14-29  shows what happens if crankyFunction  ’s promise chain is terminated by a done   method.  417  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 14   Q  Flow Control with Q  Promise chains are a fantastic way to flatten asynchronous, callback-based APIs. They also simulate, in their  own way, the structured exception handling pattern developers become familiar with in synchronous code.  These features simplify flow control in promise-based code, but a bit of creativity can be used to leverage  promises for the following more complex flows in which a number of asynchronous operations can be  “grouped” and treated as a whole:   	   	   	  Sequential flow: Independent asynchronous operations are scheduled and executed,  one at a time, each starting after the preceding completes.  Parallel flow: Independent, asynchronous operations are all scheduled at once and  aggregate all results.  Pipeline flow: Dependent, asynchronous operations are executed, one at a time,   each depending on the values created in a preceding operation.  In each type of flow, the rejection of one operation triggers the failure of the flow in general. The   sequential flow is concerned with side effects and not values  meaning it doesn’t actually fetch or create data  that will be used later , though it could be adapted to aggregate fetched data if necessary. The parallel flow  aggregates data from a number of different asynchronous operations and delivers its results when all are  complete. The pipeline flow passes some data through a series of operations, so at least one operation will  fetch or create data, and there will be some value to handle at the end of the flow.  Sequential Flow The functions in Listing 14-30 represent a series of steps common to web applications. They change a user’s  password. Each is highly simplified, of course, but the three basic steps must be completed sequentially:  1.  Change the actual password.  2.  Notify the user  probably via e-mail  that their password has been changed.  3.  Because our company is a Good Corporate Citizen, it forwards the password on   to the National Security Agency  NSA .           418  Listing 14-30.  Functions Executed in a Sequential Flow     example-019 index.js function changePassword cb  {   process.nextTick function    {     console.log 'changing password...' ;     cb null ;   } ; }   function notifyUser cb  {   process.nextTick function    {     console.log 'notifying user...' ;     var randomFail = Date.now   % 2 === 0;     cb randomFail ? new Error 'fail!'  : null ;   } ; }    www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 14   Q  function sendToNSA cb  {   process.nextTick function    {     console.log 'sending to NSA...' ;     cb null ;   } ; }  Each operation’s function is asynchronous and conforms to the standard Node.js callback pattern. The   changePassword   and sendToNSA   functions will always succeed in the example in Listing 14-30, but to  make things interesting, the notifyUser   function sometimes succeeds and other times fails based on a  calculated value.  To orchestrate these three operations in a sequential promise flow, they are first added to an array of   “steps” in the appropriate execution order. An “empty” promise  lastPromise  is created by invoking Q  without any parameters; it will be the first resolved promise in the sequential promise chain.  In Listing 14-31, the code iterates over the array of steps to encapsulate each step in a promise. For    each iteration, it invokes the then   method on lastPromise and assigns the result—a newly minted  promise—back to the lastPromise variable.  This builds a promise chain within a loop.   Inside each resolution callback, the code transforms the current “step”  one of the functions defined in  Listing 14-30  into a promise by passing it to Q.denodeify  . The same could be accomplished manually by  setting up a deferred and using deferred.makeNodeResolver  , as demonstrated earlier in Listing 14-11,  but Q.denodeify   streamlines this process. The result is a promise that can be returned from the resolution  callback as the next step in the promise chain.  Listing 14-31.  Orchestrating a Sequential Flow with Promises     example-019 index.js var Q = require 'q' ;   var steps = [changePassword, notifyUser, sendToNSA]; var lastPromise = Q  ; steps.forEach function  step  {   lastPromise = lastPromise.then function    {      *      * denodeify and invoke each function step      * to return a promise      *      return Q.denodeify step   ;   } ; } ;   lastPromise.done function    {   console.log 'all done' ; }, function  err  {   console.error err ; } ;  Finally, resolution and rejection callbacks are attached to the last promise created by the loop. When the next scheduled loop executes, the first step will begin. When it resolves, the next promise   in the chain will be invoked, and so on, until the end of the sequential flow is reached. If an error occurs at  any point in the chain, it will immediately cause the final rejection callback to be invoked.  There are no  intermediate rejection callbacks; a sequential flow should fail when any one step fails.  If all steps resolve,  the final resolution callback will output the console message: all done.  419  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 14   Q  Parallel Flow Applications will often fetch data from a variety of sources, then send it to some client as a unified whole.   In Listing 14-32, user data and a list of US states are both fetched at the same time, perhaps for a web page   on which a user may change his or her mailing address.  Listing 14-32.  Functions Executed in a Parallel Flow     example-20 index01.js function getUser id, cb  {   process.nextTick function    {     cb null, {id: id, name: 'nick'} ;   } ; }   function getUSStates cb  {   process.nextTick function    {     cb null, ['MO', 'IL'  *, etc.* ] ;   } ; }  Because these two asynchronous functions have nothing to do with each other, it makes sense that they   should be scheduled at the same time  instead of one waiting for the other to finish . Q’s utility function  all   accepts an array of promises to be scheduled all at once, but since the functions in Listing 14-32 are  not yet promises, they must be converted with one of Q’s function call methods. Because the functions  conform to the Node.js callback signature, the code in Listing 14-33 passes each function to Q.nfcall     node-function-call , which will wrap each in promises, using deferreds to supply the appropriate callbacks.  Because the getUser   function accepts a single data parameter, the user ID must be passed as the second  argument to Q.nfcall   when the getUser   promise is created. Q will bind the user ID as the first  parameter to the getUser   function when it is invoked internally.  Q’s all   function itself returns a promise, which will be resolved with an array of values. The ordinal   position of each value in the array will correspond to the ordinal sequence in which the promises were  ordered in the array passed to Q.all  . In this case, user data will occupy index 0, while the US states array  will occupy index 1.  If an error occurs in any of the promises, the rejection callback on the aggregate promise will be invoked.  Listing 14-33.  Orchestrating a Parallel Flow with Promises     example-20 index01.js var Q = require 'q' ;   Q.all [   Q.nfcall getUser, 123 ,   Q.nfcall getUSStates  ] .then function  results  {   console.log 'user:', results[0] ;   console.log 'states:', results[1] ; }, function  err  {   console.error 'ERR', err ; } ;  Because accessing values in an array is ungainly, a promise may be continued with the spread     method, which operates identically to then  , except that it “explodes” the results array into actual  individual arguments, as shown in Listing 14-34.  420  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 14   Q  Listing 14-34.  Spreading Results     example-20 index02.js var Q = require 'q' ;   Q.all [   Q.nfcall getUser, 123 ,   Q.nfcall getUSStates  ] .spread function  user, states  {   console.log 'user:', user ;   console.log 'states:', states ; }, function  err  {   console.error 'ERR', err ; } ;  Q also provides a companion function, Q.allSettled  , which behaves like Q.all   with a few key   differences. First, it will always invoke the resolution callback of the aggregate promise. Second, each value  will be an object with a state property, which will report the actual state of the promise that created the  value, and one of the following properties that depend on the value of state:   	  	  value, which will contain the data created by the promise if it resolved  reason, which will contain any error created if the promise was rejected  The choice between using Q.all   or Q.allSettled   will depend on the nature of the application   code, but either may be used to create a parallel flow.  Pipeline Flow Pipeline flows are useful when a set of data needs to be transformed according to some sequential rule set.  The difference between a pipeline and the sequential flow covered earlier is that each step in a pipeline passes  data to the next, whereas the sequential flow is concerned primarily with creating a linear series of side effects. The pipeline functions in Listing 14-35 represent a simplified filtering system, perhaps for a recruiting   agency looking to place talent with clients. The loadCandidates   function will “fetch” a list of possible  candidates, and the other functions will be responsible for whittling down the selection based on some  criteria. Notice that filterBySkill   and groupByStates   are actually factory functions. They accept  some configuration parameters  the skill and states desired , then return a function that accepts a Node.js  callback to be used in the pipeline.  Listing 14-35.  Functions Executed in a Pipeline Flow     example-021 index.js function loadCandidates cb  {   console.log 'loadCandidates', arguments ;   process.nextTick function    {     var candidates = [       {name: 'Nick', skills: ['JavaScript', 'PHP'], state: 'MO'},       {name: 'Tim', skills: ['JavaScript', 'PHP'], state: 'TN'}     ];     cb null, candidates ;   } ; }    421  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 14   Q  function filterBySkill skill  {   return function  candidates, cb  {     console.log 'filterBySkill', arguments ;     candidates = candidates.filter function  c  {       return c.skills.indexOf skill  >= 0;     } ;     cb null, candidates ;   }; }   function groupByStates states  {   var grouped = {};   states.forEach function  state  {     grouped[state] = [];   } ;   return function  candidates, cb  {     console.log 'groupByStates', arguments ;     process.nextTick function    {       candidates.forEach function  c  {         if  grouped.hasOwnProperty c.state   {           grouped[c.state].push c ;         }       } ;       cb null, grouped ;     } ;   }; }  The loadCandidates   function is added to the steps array directly, but the filterBySkill   and   groupByStates   functions are invoked with their initialization values.  Like the serial and parallel flows, the pipeline flow uses promise chaining to coordinate the execution   sequence. In Listing 14-36, however, the result created by each step—the value passed to the resolution  callback for each promise—is placed into an array and passed as an argument to the next promise in  the sequence. In the parallel flow example, Q.nfcall   was used to invoke each step; in this example,  Q.nfapply    node-function-apply  is used. Each call mimics its native JavaScript counterpart    Function.prototype.call   and Function.prototype.apply   , which is why an array is used to pass the  result to each step instead of passing the result as a direct argument. This is necessary because the first step  in the pipeline, loadCandidates  , accepts no arguments  other than the callback . Passing an empty array  to Q.nfapply   ensures the function is called properly.  Listing 14-36.  Orchestrating a Pipeline Flow with Promises     example-021 index.js var Q = require 'q' ;   var steps = [   loadCandidates,   filterBySkill 'JavaScript' ,   groupByStates ['MO', 'IL']  ];    422  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 14   Q  var lastPromise = Q  ; steps.forEach function  step  {   lastPromise = lastPromise.then function  result  {     var args = [];     if  result !== undefined  {       args.push result ;     }     return Q.nfapply step, args ;   } ; } ;   lastPromise.done function  grouped  {   console.log 'grouped:', grouped ; }, function  err  {   console.error err ; } ;  When the pipeline has finished, the last value passed to the last asynchronous callback will be the   value passed to the done   resolution callback. Should any asynchronous operation generate an error, the  rejection callback will be invoked instead.  A single value is passed to each callback for each asynchronous function in Listing 14-35. It is possible   to pass more than one value to these callbacks, even though the Promises A+ specification stipulates that  only one value may be passed as a resolution parameter. Q mitigates this discrepancy by packaging up all  values passed to an asynchronous function callback into an array, which it then passes to the promise’s  resolution callback. This array would then need to be passed to Q.nfapply  , as it contains all the data to be  used as arguments to the next function step.  Summary  Callbacks are standard mechanisms to deal with asynchronous code. They provide a control flow  mechanism for developers to “continue” execution after a future turn of the event loop. But callbacks can  quickly become nested, convoluted, and hard to manage.  Using a promise library like Q to encapsulate asynchronous operations, to “flatten” code, can   dramatically improve a code base. Q’s ability to automatically propagate values and errors, to chain callbacks  in an asynchronous manner, report progress during long-running asynchronous operations, and deal with  unhandled errors at the end of a promise chain makes it a powerful tool in any developer’s toolbox.  Q can be used to manage trivial, linear program flows, but with a bit of creativity can also be adapted  to more complex flows. This chapter examined the sequential, parallel, and pipeline flows, but Q’s utility  methods give developers an extra measure of flexibility when orchestrating other flows as well.

Chapter 16 demonstrated how promises can be used to address this problem. This chapter  discusses Async.js, a callback-driven JavaScript library that provides a suite of powerful functions to manage  asynchronous collection manipulation and control flow.  Chapter 16 covered three common flows in which asynchronous code can be problematic: sequential   flow, parallel flow, and pipeline flow. To address these flows with promises, Chapter 16 showed how to adapt  each callback-oriented task with Q’s helper methods so that each could be wrapped conveniently within  a promise. The Async.js library embraces the callback-driven approach to asynchronous programming,  however, but in such a way that many of the downsides presented by callback-driven code  such as nested  callbacks  are avoided.  Many of the Async.js control flow functions follow a similar pattern:        1.  The first argument to each control flow function is typically an array of functions  to be executed as tasks. Task function signatures will vary a bit based on the exact  Async.js control flow function used, but they will always receive a Node.js-style  callback as a last argument.  2.  The last argument to each control flow function is a final callback function  to be executed when all tasks are complete. The final control flow function  also receives a Node.js-style callback and may or may not receive additional  arguments as well.     Note  A Node.js-style callback is simply a callback function that always expects an error as its first  agument. When the callback is invoked, either an error object is passed as its only argument, or null is passed  in for the error value and any further values are passed in as additional arguments.  425  www.it-ebooks.info   ChApter 15   AsyNC.js  Listing 15-1 shows how this pattern is typically applied.  Listing 15-1.  Flow Control Function Pattern  var tasks = [   function   *0..n args, *  cb  { *...* },   function   *0..n args, *  cb  { *...* },   function   *0..n args, *  cb  { *...* } ];   function finalCallback  err, result  { *...* };   async.someFlowControlFunction tasks, finalCallback ;  The rest of the chapter will examine a number of control flow functions, and how they vary, if at all, from   this general pattern. Since all flows organize tasks and handle errors and values in a similar way, it becomes  easier to understand each by contrast.     Note  the meaning of async in Async.js relates to organizing asynchronous operations. the library itself  does not guarantee that task functions execute asynchronously. If a developer uses Async.js with synchronous  functions, each will be executed synchronously. there is one semi-exception to this rule. the async.memoize    function  which has nothing to do with control flow  makes a function cacheable, so that subsequent invocations  won’t actually run the function but will return a cached result instead. Async.js forces each subsequent  invocation to be asynchronous because it assumes that the original function was itself asynchronous.  Sequential Flow  A sequential flow is one in which a series of steps must be executed in order. A step may not start until a  preceding step finishes  except for the first step , and if any step fails, the flow fails as a whole. The functions  in Listing 15-2 are the steps for changing a fictitious user’s password, the same scenario used to introduce  sequential flows in Chapter 16. These steps are slightly different, however.  First, each is wrapped in a factory function that takes some initial data and returns a callback-based   function to be used as a step in the sequential flow.  Second, the first step  the task wrapped in the changePassword   function  actually passes new   credentials to its callback as an operation result. Steps in a sequential flow are not required to generate  results, but if a step does pass a result to its callback, it has no bearing on the other steps in the sequence.  If some  or all  steps rely on results from previous steps, a pipeline flow is needed.  Pipelines are discussed  later in the chapter.   Listing 15-2.  Sequential Steps     example-001 async-series.js 'use strict'; var async = require 'async' ; var userService = require '. user-service' ; var emailService = require '. email-service' ; var nothingToSeeHere = require '. nothing-to-see-here' ;    426  www.it-ebooks.info   ChApter 15   AsyNC.js  function changePassword email, password  {   return function  cb  {     process.nextTick function    {       userService.changePassword email, password, function  err, hash  {            new credentials returned as results         cb null, {email: email, passwordHash: hash} ;       } ;     } ;   }; }   function notifyUser email  {   return function  cb  {     process.nextTick function    {          the email service invokes the callback with          no result       emailService.notifyPasswordChanged email, cb ;     } ;   }; }   function sendToNSA email, password  {   return function  cb  {     process.nextTick function    {          the nothingToSeeHere service invokes the          callback with no result       nothingToSeeHere.snoop email, password, cb ;     } ;   } }  In Listing 15-3, each factory function is executed with its initial data, returning task functions that   are added to a steps array. This array becomes the first argument to async.series  , followed by a final  callback that receives any error generated during the execution of the series, or an array of results populated  by each step in the series. If any results are generated, they are stored according to the order of their  corresponding steps in the steps array. For example, the result from changePassword   will be the first  element in the results array because changePassword   was invoked as the first task.  Listing 15-3.  Sequential Flow     example-001 async-series.js var email = 'user@domain.com'; var password = 'foo!1';   var steps = [     returns function cb    changePassword email, password ,     returns function cb    notifyUser email ,     returns function cb    sendToNSA email, password  ];  427  www.it-ebooks.info   ChApter 15   AsyNC.js  async.series steps, function  err, results  {   if  err  {     return console.error err ;   }   console.log 'new credentials:', results[0] ; } ;  Because these steps are asynchronous, they can’t be invoked one at a time in the same way that   synchronous functions can be called. But Async.js tracks the executing of each step internally, invoking the  next step only when the previous step’s callback has been invoked, thus creating a sequential flow. If any step  in the sequential flow passes an error to its callback, the series will be aborted and the final series callback  will be invoked with that error. When an error is raised the results value will be undefined.  The factory functions used in this chapter are convenient ways to pass initial data to each step, but they  but not necessary. The factories could be eliminated in favor of JavaScript’s native function binding facilities,  as in Listing 15-4, but the code becomes more difficult to read when the steps are actually added to the array.  For simple scenarios in which no initial data or bindings are necessary, anonymous task functions may be  declared directly within the steps array.  It is always a good idea to name your functions and declare them  in a way that promotes readability and maintainability, however.   Listing 15-4.  Series Steps with Argument Binding  function changePassword email, password, cb  { *...* }   function notifyUser email, cb  { *...* }   function sendToNSA email, password, cb  { *...* }   var steps = [   changePassword.bind null, email, password ,   notifyUser.bind null, email ,   sendToNSA.bind null, email, password  ];  For the rest of this chapter we’ll be using factory functions instead of bind  , but developers are free to   choose whatever approach feels most natural to them.  Parallel Flow  Sometimes it is helpful to run independent tasks in parallel and then aggregate results after all tasks  are finished. JavaScript is an asynchronous language, so it has no true parallelism, but scheduling long,  nonblocking operations in succession will release the event loop to handle other operations  like UI updates  in a browser environment, or handling additional requests in a server environment . Multiple asynchronous  tasks can be scheduled in one turn of the event loop, but there is no way to predict at which future turn each  task will complete. This makes it difficult to collect the results from each task and return them to calling  code. Fortunately, the async.parallel   function gives developers the means to do just that.  Listing 15-5 shows two functions that wrap jQuery GET requests. The first fetches user data for a given  userID, and the second fetches a list of U.S. states. It is easy to imagine that these functions may be part of a  user’s profile page on which the user would be able to update personal information such as phone numbers,  postal addresses, and so forth. When the page loads, it makes sense to fetch this information all at once.  These are two different API calls, though, so even if they are scheduled simultaneously, the results need to be  handled at some future point in time.  428  www.it-ebooks.info   ChApter 15   AsyNC.js  Listing 15-5.  Parallel Steps     example-002 views async-parallel.html function getUser userID  {   return function  cb  {     $.get ' user ' + userID .then function  user  {       cb null, user ;     } .fail cb ;   }; }   function getUSStates cb  {   $.get ' us-states' .then function  states  {     cb null, states ;   } .fail cb ; }  In Listing 15-6, Async.js is imported into a fictitious web page with a standard   tag. Tasks   are scheduled using the async.parallel   function, which, like async.series  , accepts an array of task  functions to be executed and a final callback function that will receive an error or the aggregated results.  Parallel tasks are simply functions that accept a single callback argument that should be invoked once the  asynchronous operation within a task function is completed. All callbacks conform to the Node.js callback  convention.  The getUser   function in Listing 15-6 is a factory that accepts a userID argument and returns  a function that accepts a conventional Node.js-style callback. Because getUSStates   has no actual  arguments it need not be wrapped in a factory function but is used directly instead.  Both functions fetch data with jQuery’s AJAX API. AJAX promises pass data from successful AJAX calls  to any callback passed to the promise’s then   method, whereas errors are passed to any callbacks passed  to the promise’s fail   method. Because the signature of a fail   callback accepts a single error argument,  the callback passed to each task from Async.js can also be used as the callback to fail  .  Listing 15-6.  Parallel Flow     User Profile                     First Name                             US States                            function  async, $  {    429  www.it-ebooks.info   ChApter 15   AsyNC.js    function getUser userID  {     return function  cb  {       $.get ' user ' + userID .then function  user  {         cb null, user ;       } .fail cb ;     };   }     function getUSStates cb  {     $.get ' us-states' .then function  states  {       cb null, states ;     } .fail cb ;   }     var userID = 1001;     async.parallel [     getUser userID ,     getUSStates   ], function  err, results  {     if  err  {       return alert err.message ;     }     var user = results[0],       states = results[1];     $ 'first-name' .val user.firstName ;     ...      $ 'us-states' .append states.map function  state  {       return $ '  '          .html state          .attr 'value', state ;     }  ;   } ;   } window.async, window.jQuery  ;    The Async.js library will iterate over each task in the tasks array, scheduling them one after the other.   As each task completes, its data is stored, and once all tasks have finished, the final callback passed to  async.parallel   is invoked.  Results are sorted according to the order of tasks passed to async.parallel  , not the order in which   tasks are actually resolved. If an error occurs in any parallel task, that error will be passed to the final  callback, all unfinished parallel tasks will be ignored once they complete, and the results argument in the  final callback will be undefined.  Pipeline Flow  430  When tasks in a series each depends on a value from a preceding task, a pipeline flow  or waterfall  is  needed. Listing 15-7 represents tasks for a fictitious corporate rewards program in which a user’s age is  calculated  based on date of birth , and if the user’s age meets certain thresholds, the user is awarded a cash  prize.  www.it-ebooks.info   ChApter 15   AsyNC.js  Each function receives some input and then passes some output to its callback. The output of each   function becomes the input for the next function in the series.           1.  The getUser   factory function accepts a userID and returns another function   that, when invoked, looks up a user record. It passes the user record to its  callback.  2.  The calcAge   function accepts a user argument and invokes its callback with   the calculated age of the user.  3.  The reward   function accepts a numeric age argument and invokes its callback   with the selected reward if the age meets certain thresholds.  Listing 15-7.  Waterfall  Pipeline  Steps     example-003 callback-waterfall 'use strict'; var db = require '. database' ;   function getUser userID, cb  {   process.nextTick function    {        pass cb directly to find because        it has the same signature:         err, user      db.users.find {id: userID}, cb ;   } ; }   function calcAge user, cb  {   process.nextTick function    {     var now = Date.now  ,       then = user.birthDate.getTime  ;     var age =  now - then     1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 365 ;     cb null, Math.round age  ;   } ; }   function reward age, cb  {   process.nextTick function    {     switch  age  {       case 25: return cb null, '$100' ;       case 35: return cb null, '$150' ;       case 45: return cb null, '$200' ;       default: return cb null, '$0' ;     }   } ; }  This pipeline would be rather hideous and difficult to maintain if organized with nested callbacks.   If additional steps are ever added to the reward program, the code will need to be teased apart and  restructured to accommodate new steps in the pipeline flow. Trapping errors and propagating them through  callbacks also happens manually. The example code in Listing 15-8 shows how these tasks would be run  without Async.js.  431  www.it-ebooks.info   Fortunately Async.js makes it relatively painless to organize a pipeline flow that is both maintainable  and handles errors gracefully. The code in Listing 15-9 uses async.waterfall   to organize the series of  tasks to be executed, then provides a final callback to capture any error raised by pipeline tasks or to receive  the final reward value if no errors occurr.  ChApter 15   AsyNC.js  Listing 15-8.  A Waterfall of Nested Callbacks     example-003 callback-waterfall function showReward userID, cb  {   getUser userID, function  err, user  {     if  err  {       return cb err ;     }     calcAge user, function  err, age  {       if  err  {         return cb err ;       }       reward age, cb ;     } ;   }  }   showReward 123, function  err, reward  {   if  err  {     return console.error err ;   }   console.log reward ; } ;  Listing 15-9.  Waterfall  Pipeline  Flow     example-003 async-waterfall.js 'use strict'; var async = require 'async' ; var db = require '. database' ;   function getUser userID  {      using a factory function to pass in      the userID argument and return another      function that will match the callback      signature that async.waterfall expects   return function  cb  {     process.nextTick function    {          pass cb directly to find because          it has the same signature:           err, user        db.users.find {id: userID}, cb ;     } ;   }; }    432  www.it-ebooks.info   ChApter 15   AsyNC.js  Like async.series   and async.parallel  , an error passed to a callback in any waterfall task will   immediately halt the pipeline and invoke the final callback with the error.  Reusing a Pipeline Pipelines are so helpful for processing data that async.seq   will take a series of functions, just like async. waterfall  , and combine them into a single, reusable pipeline function that can be called multiple times.  This could be done manually, of course, by using a closure to wrap async.waterfall  , but async.seq   is a  convenience function that saves developers the trouble.  Listing 15-10 shows a series of functions used to process a make-believe cellular phone bill. The   createBill   function accepts a calling plan and creates a bill object with both the plan and the normal  monthly rate. carrierFee   appends a chunk of change to this amount just because the phone company  can. The prorate   function then determines if some amount is to be credited to the user  if the user started  a new plan in the middle of a billing cycle, for example . And finally, govtExtortion   appends a calculated  tax onto the bill before it is delivered.     the calcAge and reward functions    do not change   async.waterfall [   getUser 1000 ,   calcAge,   reward ], function  err, reward  {   if  err  {     return console.error err ;   }   console.log 'reward:', reward ; } ;  Listing 15-10.  Sequence  Pipeline  Steps     example-004 async-seq.js 'use strict'; var async = require 'async' ; var dateUtil = require '. date-util' ;   function createBill plan, cb  {   process.nextTick function    {     var bill = {       plan: plan,       total: plan.billAmt     };     cb null, bill ;   } ; }   function carrierFee bill, cb  {   process.nextTick function    {     bill.total += 10;     cb null, bill ;   } ; }    433  www.it-ebooks.info   Creating a pipeline with async.seq   is very similar to using async.waterfall  , as shown in    Listing 15-11. The primary difference is that async.seq   does not invoke the steps immediately but returns  a pipeline   function that will be used to run the tasks later. The pipeline   function accepts the initial  arguments that will be passed to the first step, eliminating the need for factory functions or binding values to  the first step when the pipeline is defined. Also, unlike most other async functions, async.seq   is variadic   accepts a varying number of arguments . It does not accept an array of tasks like async.waterfall  , but  instead accepts each task function as an argument.  In Listing 15-11 the pipeline   function is created and then invoked with two parameters: a plan   object, which will be passed to createBill  , and a final callback to receive either an error or a final bill  object for the user.  ChApter 15   AsyNC.js  function prorate bill, cb  {   if  !bill.plan.isNew  {     return cb null, bill ;   }   process.nextTick function    {     bill.plan.isNew = false;     var days = dateUtil  .daysInMonth  ;     var amtPerDay = bill.plan.billAmt   days;     var prorateAmt =   bill.plan.billDay - 1  * amtPerDay ;     bill.total -= prorateAmt;     cb null, bill ;   } ; }   function govtExtortion bill, cb  {   process.nextTick function    {     bill.total = bill.total * 1.08;     cb null, bill ;   } ; }  Listing 15-11.  Sequence  Pipeline  Flow     example-004 async-seq.js var pipeline = async.seq    createBill,   carrierFee,   prorate,   govtExtortion  ;   var plan = {   type: 'Lots of Cell Minutes Plan!+',   isNew: true,   billDay: 15,   billAmt: 100 };    434  www.it-ebooks.info   ChApter 15   AsyNC.js  pipeline plan, function  err, bill  {   if  err  {     return console.error err ;   }     bill = govtExtortion prorate carrierFee createBill plan       console.log '$', bill.total.toFixed 2  ; } ;  Loop Flow  Flows that repeat until some condition is met are called loops. Async.js has several looping functions that  help coordinate the asynchronous code to be executed and the conditions to be tested within them.  Looping While Some Condition Remains True The first two functions, async.whilst   and async.doWhilst  , parallel the well-known while and   do while looping constructs in many programming languages. Each loop runs while some condition  evaluates to true. Once the condition evaluates to false, the loops halt.  The async.whilst   and async.doWhilst   functions are nearly identical, except that async.whilst     performs the condition evaluation before any code in the loop is run, whereas async.doWhilst   executes  one iteration of the loop before performing evaluating the condition. Looping code in async.doWhilst    is guaranteed to run at least once, whereas looping code in async.whilst   may not run at all if the initial  condition is false.  Listing 15-12 shows async.whilst   being used to call an API ten times to get a random “winner” for   some contest. Before the loop runs, an array of names is examined to determine if ten winners have already  been selected. This process is repeated until the array has a length of ten. If an error occurs during one of the  API calls within the loop, the async.whilst   flow is terminated and the final callback is invoked with the  error; otherwise the final callback will be invoked once the loop condition evaluates to false.  Listing 15-12.  Looping While Some Condition Remains True     Winners!          function  async, $  {     function pickWinners howMany, cb  {     var winners = [];       async.whilst           condition test:          continue looping until we have enough winners       function    { return winners.length < howMany; },          looping code       function  cb  {         $.get ' employee random' .done function  employee  {           var winner = employee.firstName + ' ' + employee.lastName;  435  www.it-ebooks.info   ChApter 15   AsyNC.js               avoid potential duplicates           if  winners.indexOf winner  < 0  {             winners.push winner ;           }           cb null ;         } .fail function  err  {           cb err ;         } ;       },          final callback       function  err  {            if there is an error just ignore it            and pass back an empty array, otherwise            pass the winners         cb null, err ?

Notice that the order of arguments has changed. The looping function is now the  first argument to async.doWhilst   and the condition test is the second. This structurally mirrors do while  loop syntax.  Listing 15-13.

The code in Listing 15-14 shows how a simple HTTP heartbeat can be created in the browser to test   an API endpoint for availability. The Heartbeat   constructor function creates a loop with async.until    that will execute repeatedly until the value of the _isStopped property is set to true. Heartbeat   exposes  a stop   method that, when invoked sometime after the object is created, will prevent the loop from  continuing. Each turn of the loop makes an HTTP request to the server, and if the request succeeds, the  loop sets the isAvailable property to true; if it fails, isAvailable is set to false. To create a delay between  iterations of the loop, a setTimeout   function wraps the callback invocation within the loop, scheduling  future iterations of the loop to run at a later time  every three seconds in this example .  437  www.it-ebooks.info   ChApter 15   AsyNC.js  Listing 15-14.

Its signature also swaps the order of the test condition function and the looping function.  Retry Loops A common use case for loops is the retry loop, where a task is attempted up to a given number of times. If the  task fails but hasn’t met the retry limit, it is executed again. If the retry limit is met, the task is aborted. The  async.retry   function simplifies this process by handling the retry logic for developers. Setting up a loop is as  simple as specifying a retry limit, a task to execute, and a final callback that will handle errors or receive a result. Listing 15-15 demonstrates a simple API call for reserving a seat at some concert or movie. The available   seats are listed in an array, most preferable to least preferable. The execution limit is the length of the array.  Each time the task runs, it shifts the array, removing the first  most preferable  seat from the collection. If the  reservation fails, it continues this process until there are no more seats left.  Listing 15-15.  Retry Loop            function  async, $  {     var output = document.querySelector 'output' ;     function write   {     var pre = document.createElement 'pre' ;     pre.innerHTML = Array.prototype.join.call arguments, ' ' ;     output.appendChild pre ;   }    439  www.it-ebooks.info   ChApter 15   AsyNC.js    function reserve name, availableSeats  {     console.log availableSeats ;     return function  cb  {       var request = {         name: name,         seat: availableSeats.shift         };       write 'posting reservation', JSON.stringify request  ;       $.post ' reservation', request          .done function  confirmation  {           write 'confirmation', JSON.stringify confirmation  ;           cb null, confirmation ;         } .fail function  err  {           cb err ;         } ;     };   }     var name = 'Nicholas';   var availableSeats = ['15A', '22B', '13J', '32K'];     async.retry      availableSeats.length,     reserve name, availableSeats ,     function  err, confirmation  {       if  err  {         return console.error err ;       }       console.log 'seat reserved:', confirmation ;     }    ; } window.async, window.jQuery  ;    Listing 15-16.  Accumulating Errors in a Retry Loop  function reserve name, availableSeats  {   var errors = [];   return function  cb  {     ...      $.post ' reservation', body        .done function  confirmation  {         cb null, confirmation ;  440  www.it-ebooks.info  Each time the task is run it invokes its callback. If the task succeeds and passes a value to the callback,  the final async.retry   callback is invoked with that value  in this case, confirmation . If an error occurs,  the loop is repeated until it reaches the loop limit. The last error is passed to the final callback; previous  errors are lost unless accumulated manually. Listing 15-16 demonstrates a potential way to accomplish this  by collecting errors in an array, then passing the array itself as the err argument to the callback. If the retry  loop fails, the final callback’s error will be an array of every error generated during each turn of the loop.   ChApter 15   AsyNC.js        } .fail function  err  {         errors.push err ;         cb errors ;       } ;   }; }  Infinite Loops Infinite loops are bad news in synchronous programming because they arrest the CPU and prevent any  other code from executing. But asynchronous infinite loops don’t suffer from this downside because, like all  other code, they are scheduled for future turns of the event loop by the JavaScript scheduler. Other code that  needs to be run can “butt in” and request to be scheduled.  An infinite loop can be scheduled with async.forever  . This function takes a task function as its   first argument and a final callback as its second. The task will continue to run indefinitely unless it passes  an error to its callback. Scheduling asynchronous operations back to back using setTimeout   with a wait  duration of 0 or setImmediate   can create near nonresponsive code in a loop, so it is best to pad each  asynchronous task with a longer wait duration, at least in the hundreds of milliseconds.  The loop in Listing 15-17 makes an HTTP GET request during each turn of the infinite loop, loading  stock information for the user’s dashboard. Each time the GET request succeeds the stock information is  updated and the loop waits for three seconds before executing again. If an error occurs during the loop, the  final callback is invoked with the error and the loop is terminated.  Listing 15-17.  Infinite Loop            function  async, $  {   $stockList = $ 'ulstocks' ;     async.forever function  cb  {     $.get ' dashboard stocks'        .done function  stocks  {            refresh the stock list with new stock            information         $stockList.empty  ;         $stockList.append stocks.map function  stock  {           return $ '  ' .html stock.symbol + ' $' + stock.price ;         }  ;            wait three seconds before continuing         setTimeout function    {           cb null ;         }, 3000 ;       } .fail cb ;   }, function  err  {     console.error err.responseText ;     }  } window.async, window.jQuery  ;    441  www.it-ebooks.info   ChApter 15   AsyNC.js  Batch Flow  The last type of control flow this chapter covers is batching. Batches are created by partitioning some data  into chunks, and then operating on each chunk one at a time. Batches have some threshold that defines how  much data can be put into a chunk. Data added to a batch flow after work has commenced on a chunk is  queued until work is complete, then gets processed in a new chunk.  Asynchronous Queue An asynchronous queue is one way to process items in a batch flow. A queue can be created by calling  async.queue   with two parameters. The first is a task function that will be executed for each data item that  will be added to the queue. The second is a number that represents the maximum number of task workers  that the queue will schedule concurrently to process data. In Listing 15-18 a queue is created to make HTTP  requests for any URL added to the queue. The result of each HTTP request will be added to the results hash  when each request has been completed. The maximum number of HTTP requests that can be running at  any one time is three. If additional URLs are added to the queue while three requests are in progress, they  will be held for future processing. As workers are released  when requests complete  they will be assigned to  queued URLs as needed. There will never be more than three HTTP requests in progress at a given time.  Listing 15-18.  Using Queue for Sequential Batches     example-009 index.js 'use strict'; var async = require 'async' ; var http = require 'http' ;   var MAX_WORKERS = 3; var results = {};   var queue = async.queue function  url, cb  {   results[url] = '';   http.get url, function  res  {     results[url] = res.statusCode + ' Content-Type: ' + res.headers['content-type'];     cb null ;   } .on 'error', function  err  {     cb err ;  } ;  }, MAX_WORKERS ;   var urls = [    9 urls   'http:  www.appendto.com',   'http:  www.nodejs.org',   'http:  www.npmjs.org',   'http:  www.nicholascloud.com',   'http:  www.devlink.net',   'http:  javascriptweekly.com',   'http:  nodeweekly.com',   'http:  www.reddit.com r javascript',   'http:  www.reddit.com r node' ];    442  www.it-ebooks.info   ChApter 15   AsyNC.js  urls.forEach function  url  {   queue.push url, function  err  {     if  err  {       return console.error err ;     }     console.log 'done processing', url ;   } ; } ;  The queue will emit a number of events at certain points in its life cycle. Functions may be assigned  to corresponding event properties on the queue object to handle these events. These event handlers are  optional; the queue will operate correctly with or without them.  The first time the queue has reached the maximum number of active workers, it will invoke any   function assigned to queue.saturated. When the queue is handling all items and no other items are queued,  it will call any function assigned to queue.empty. Finally, when all workers have completed and the queue  is empty, any function assigned to queue.drain will be called. The functions in Listing 15-19 handle each of  these raised events.  Listing 15-19.  Queue Events     example-009 index.js queue.saturated = function    {   console.log 'queue is saturated at ' + queue.length   ; };   queue.empty = function    {   console.log 'queue is empty; last task being handled' ; };   queue.drain = function    {   console.log 'queue is drained; no more tasks to handle' ;   Object.keys results .forEach function  url  {     console.log url, results[url] ;   } ;   process.exit 0 ; };     Note  the empty and drained events differ subtly. When empty is triggered, workers may still be active  though no items remain in the queue. When drained is triggered, all workers have ceased and the queue is  completely empty.  Asynchronous Cargo The async.cargo   function is similar to async.queue   in that it queues up items to be processed by some  task function. They differ, however, in how the work load is divided. async.queue   runs multiple workers  up to a maximum concurrency limit—its saturation point. async.cargo   runs a single worker at a time,  but splits up the queued items to be processed into payloads of a predetermined size. When the worker is  executed, it will be given one payload. When it has completed, it will be given another, until all payloads   443  www.it-ebooks.info   ChApter 15   AsyNC.js  have been processed. The saturation point for cargo, then, is when a full payload is ready to be processed.  Any items added to the cargo after the worker has started will be grouped into the next payload to be  processed.  A cargo is created by supplying the task function as the first argument to async.cargo   and a   maximum payload size as the second. The task function will receive an array of data  with a length up to the  maximum payload size  to be processed and a callback to be invoked once the operation is complete. The code in Listing 15-20 shows how async.cargo   can be used to package a series of database   updates into a fictitious transaction, one payload at a time. The task function iterates over the “update”  objects supplied to it, converting each into an UPDATE query in some imaginary relational data store. Once all  the queries have been added to a transaction, the transaction is committed and the callback is invoked.  Listing 15-20.  Using Cargo for Parallel Batches     example-010 index-01.js 'use strict'; var async = require 'async' ; var db = require 'db' ;   var MAX_PAYLOAD_SIZE = 4; var UPDATE_QUERY = "UPDATE CUSTOMER SET ? = '?' WHERE id = ?;";   var cargo = async.cargo function  updates, cb  {   db.begin function  trx  {     updates.forEach function  update  {       var query = UPDATE_QUERY.replace '?', update.field          .replace '?', update.value          .replace '?', update.id ;       trx.add query ;      trx.commit cb ;  } ;  } ;  }, MAX_PAYLOAD_SIZE ;   var customerUpdates = [    9 updates to be processed in payloads of 4   {id: 1000, field: 'firstName', value: 'Sterling'},   {id: 1001, field: 'phoneNumber', value: '222-333-4444'},   {id: 1002, field: 'email', value: 'archer@goodisis.com'},   {id: 1003, field: 'dob', value: '01 22 1973'},   {id: 1004, field: 'city', value: 'New York'},   {id: 1005, field: 'occupation', value: 'Professional Troll'},   {id: 1006, field: 'twitter', value: '@2cool4school'},   {id: 1007, field: 'ssn', value: '111-22-3333'},   {id: 1008, field: 'email', value: 'urmom@internet.com'},   {id: 1009, field: 'pref', value: 'rememberme=false&colorscheme=dark'} ];   customerUpdates.forEach function  update  {   cargo.push update, function    {     console.log 'done processing', update.id ;   } ; } ;  444  www.it-ebooks.info   The cargo object has the same event properties as the queue object, shown in Listing 15-21. The main   difference is that the cargo’s saturation limit is reached once a maximum number of payload items has been  added, at which point the worker will commence.  Optional function handlers may be assigned to event properties as needed.  ChApter 15   AsyNC.js  Listing 15-21.  Cargo Events     example-010 index-01.js cargo.saturated = function    {   console.log 'cargo is saturated at ' + cargo.length   ; };   cargo.empty = function    {   console.log 'cargo is empty; worker needs tasks' ; };   cargo.drain = function    {   console.log 'cargo is drained; no more tasks to handle' ; };     Note  Both async.queue   and async.cargo   schedule the task function to run in the next immediate  tick of the event loop. If items are added to a queue or cargo synchronously, one after the other, then the  thresholds of each will be applied as expected; the queue will throttle the maximum number of workers, and the  cargo will divide the maximum number of items to be processed. If items are added to each asynchronously,  however—if items are added after the next immediate turn of the event loop—the task functions may be  invoked at less than their maximum capacities.  The code in Listing 15-22 pulls each update out of the customerUpdates array and pushes it to the  cargo, then schedules the next push to happen 500 milliseconds later, in a future turn of the event loop.  Because cargo schedules its task immediately, the UPDATE query will run with one—maybe two—updates  each time, depending on how long it takes for a task to finish and for the next task to be scheduled.  Listing 15-22.  Adding Items to Cargo Asynchronously     example-010 index-02.js  function addUpdateAsync   {   if  !customerUpdates.length  return;   console.log 'adding update' ;   var update = customerUpdates.shift  ;   cargo.push update, function    {     console.log 'done processing', update.id ;   } ;   setTimeout addUpdateAsync, 500 ; }   ;  To guarantee that the maximum thresholds are met for both queue and cargo, push items to each   synchronously.  445  www.it-ebooks.info   ChApter 15   AsyNC.js  Summary  This chapter has covered a number of common synchronous control flows and demonstrated how  Async.js can be used to adapt these patterns for asynchronous code. Table 15-1 shows each flow and the  corresponding Async.js functions that were covered.  Table 15-1.  Flows and Corresponding Async.js Functions  Flow  Async.js Function s   async.series    Sequential Parallel Pipeline Loop  async.parallel   async.waterfall  , async.seq   async.whilst   async.doWhilst  , async.until   async.doUntil   async.retry  , async.forever    Batch  async.queue  , async.cargo    Sequential and parallel flows allow developers to execute multiple independent tasks, then aggregate   results as needed. Pipeline flows can be used to chain tasks together, where the output of each task becomes  the input of a succeeding task. To repeat asynchronous tasks a given number of times, or according to some  condition, looping flows may be used. Finally, batching flows are available to divide data into chunks to be  processed asynchronously, one batch after the next.  By cleverly organizing asynchronous function tasks, coordinating the results of each task, and delivering   errors and or task results to a final callback, Async.js helps developers avoid nested callbacks and brings  traditional synchronous control flow operations into the asynchronous world of JavaScript.  446  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 16  Underscore and Lodash  You must be the kind of [person] who can get things done. But to get things done, you must  love the doing, not the secondary consequences.  —Ayn Rand  JavaScript is a pragmatic utility language, useful in no small part because of its simple APIs and sparse  type system. It is an easy language to learn and master because its surface area is so small. And while this  characteristic lends itself nicely to productivity, sadly it means that JavaScript types have historically lacked  advanced features that would make the language stronger, such as functional iteration constructs native to  collections and hashes.  To fill this gap, Jeremy Ashkenas created a library in 2009 called Underscore.js, a collection of over 100  functions used to manipulate, filter, and transform hashes and collections. Many of these functions, such as  map   and reduce  , embody concepts common to functional languages. Others, like isArguments   and  isUndefined   are specific to JavaScript.  As the presence of Underscore became ubiquities in many web applications, two exciting things   happened. First, the ECMAScript 5 specification was published in the same year. It features a number of  Underscore-like methods on native JavaScript objects such as Array.prototype.map  , Array.prototype. reduce  , and Array.isArray  . While ECMAScript 5  and to a lesser degree ECMAScript 6 and 7  expands  the APIs of several key types, it only includes a fraction of the functionality that Underscore.js provides.  Second, Underscore was forked into a new project called Lodash with the goal of dramatically   improving the performance and expanding its API. Since Lodash implements all of Underscore’s functions  while adding its own, Underscore is a subset of Lodash. All of the corresponding ECMAScript spec functions  are part of Lodash as well. The table in Listing 16-1 shows Underscore and Lodash functions mapped to their  native ECMAScript counterparts.  447  www.it-ebooks.info   Table 16-1.  Underscore and Lodash Functions Compared to Current  and Proposed  Native JavaScript  Implementations  Chapter 16   UndersCore and Lodash  ECMAScript 5  Array.prototype.every    Array.prototype.filter    Array.prototype.forEach    Array.isArray    Object.keys    Array.prototype.map    Array.prototype.reduce    Array.prototype.reduceRight    Array.prototype.some    ECMAScript 6  Array.prototype.find    Array.prototype.findIndex    Array.prototype.keys    ECMAScript 7  Underscore Lodash  all   every   select   filter   each   forEach   isArray    keys    map   inject   foldl   reduce   foldr   reduceRight   some    Underscore Lodash  find    findIndex    keys    Underscore Lodash  Array.prototype.contains    include   contains    Because Underscore and Lodash share an API Lodash can be used as a drop-in replacement for   Underscore. The inverse isn’t necessarily the case, however, because of the extra functionality that Lodash  supplies. For example, while both Underscore and Lodash have a clone   method, only Lodash implements  a cloneDeep   method. Often developers choose Lodash over Underscore because of these extra features,  but the performance benefit is tangible as well. According to a function-by-function performance  benchmark, Lodash is 35% faster on average than Underscore. It achieves this performance gain by favoring  simple loops over native delegation for functions like forEach  , map  , reduce  , and so forth.  This chapter focuses mostly on features of Underscore and Lodash that are not already  or are scheduled   to be  implemented in JavaScript  the functions in Listing 16-1 and Listing 16-2 . Mozilla’s excellent  documentation covers each of the native functions, and the Underscore and Lodash API documentation  covers each of their implementations as well.  But Underscore and Lodash offer a great deal more than just a few handy functions for objects and   collections, several of which will be explored in this chapter.   For brevity, the remainder of this chapter simply refers to Underscore, but understand that, unless      Note  otherwise noted, Underscore and Lodash are interchangeable.  448  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 16   UndersCore and Lodash  Installation and Usage  Underscore may be directly imported as a library in the web browser or any server-side JavaScript  environment, such as Node.js. It has no external dependencies.  You can download the Underscore.js script directly from the Underscore website     http:  underscorejs.org  or install it with a package manager like npm, Bower, or Component.  In the browser, you can include Underscore directly as a script, or load it with an AMD- or CommonJS- compatible module loader  such as RequireJS or Browserify . In Node.js the package is simply required as a  CommonJS module.  Accessing the Underscore object  on which its utility functions live  depends on how the library  is loaded. When Underscore is loaded in the browser with a script tag, the library will attach itself to  window._. For variables created by module loaders in any environment, it is convention to assign the actual  underscore character to the module, as shown in Listing 16-1.  Listing 16-1.  Loading the Underscore Library in a Node.js Module     example-001 index.js 'use strict'; var _ = require 'underscore' ;   console.log _.VERSION ;    1.8.2  All Underscore functions live on the _  “underscore”  object. Because Underscore is a utility library,   it holds no state other than a handful of settings  but we’ll cover more on that later in the chapter . All  functions are idempotent, which means passing a value to any function multiple times will yield the same  result each time. Once the Underscore object is loaded, it may be used immediately.  Underscore’s utility functions operate mostly on collections  arrays and array-like objects, such as   arguments , object literals, and functions. Underscore is most commonly used to filter and transform  data. Many Underscore functions complement each other and can work together to create powerful  combinations. Because this can be so useful, Underscore has built-in support for function chains that create  terse pipelines that apply multiple transformations to data at once.  Aggregation and Indexing  Pieces of data in a collection often share similar schemas, yet have an identifying attribute that makes each  unique. It can be helpful to distinguish these two types of relationships in a set of data—commonality and  individuality—in order to quickly filter and work with a subset of objects that matches aggregation criteria.  Underscore has a number of functions that perform these tasks, but three specific functions can be   tremendously beneficial when working with collections: countBy  , groupBy  , and indexBy  .  countBy   Counting objects that share some characteristic is a common way to generalize data. Given a collection of  URLs, one can imagine some analytic process that determines how many URLs belong to specific top-level  domains  e.g., .com, .org, .edu, etc. . Underscore’s countBy   function is an ideal candidate for this task. It  invokes a callback on each element in an array to determines which category the element fits into  in this  example, which top-level domain the URL occupies . The callback returns some string value that represents  this category. The final result is an object with keys that represent all categories returned from the callback,  and numeric counts representing the number of elements that fall into each category. Listing 16-2 shows a  primitive implementation that yields an object with a count of two .org domains and one .com domain.  449  www.it-ebooks.info   If the items in a collection are objects with properties, and the values for a specific property represent  the data to be counted, an iterator function is not required. The name of the property to be tested may be  used as a substitute. Note that in Listing 16-3 the keys in the final result will be the values for the property  examined on each object.  Chapter 16   UndersCore and Lodash  Listing 16-2.  Counting Elements by Some Criteria     example-002 index.js 'use strict'; var _ = require 'underscore' ;   var urls = [   'http:  underscorejs.org',   'http:  lodash.com',   'http:  ecmascript.org' ];   var counts = _.countBy urls, function byTLD url  {   if  url.indexOf '.com'  >= 0  {     return '.com';   }   if  url.indexOf '.org'  >= 0  {     return '.org';   }   return '?'; } ;   console.log counts ;    { '.org': 2, '.com': 1 }  Listing 16-3.  Counting Elements by Some Property     example-003 index.js 'use strict'; var _ = require 'underscore' ;   var urls = [   {scheme: 'http', host: 'underscorejs', domain: '.org'},   {scheme: 'http', host: 'lodash', domain: '.com'},   {scheme: 'http', host: 'ecmascript', domain: '.org'}, ];   var counts = _.countBy urls, 'domain' ;   console.log counts ;    { '.org': 2, '.com': 1 }  450  www.it-ebooks.info  If one or more objects in the collection lack the property to be tested, the final result object will contain   an undefined key paired with the number of those objects as well.   groupBy   Underscore’s groupBy   function is similar to countBy  , but instead of reducing results to numeric counts,  groupBy   places elements into categorized collections in the result object. The URL objects in Listing 16-4  are each placed into collections for each corresponding top-level domain.  Chapter 16   UndersCore and Lodash  Listing 16-4.  Grouping Elements by Some Property     example-004 index.js 'use strict'; var _ = require 'underscore' ;   var urls = [   {scheme: 'http', host: 'underscorejs', domain: '.org'},   {scheme: 'http', host: 'lodash', domain: '.com'},   {scheme: 'http', host: 'ecmascript', domain: '.org'}, ];   var grouped = _.groupBy urls, 'domain' ;   console.log grouped ;    * {   '.org': [     { scheme: 'http', host: 'underscorejs', domain: '.org' },     { scheme: 'http', host: 'ecmascript', domain: '.org' }   ],   '.com': [     { scheme: 'http', host: 'lodash', domain: '.com' }   ] } *    the groupBy   function may also use an iterator function as its second argument  instead of a      Note  property name  if a greater degree of control is required to categorize elements.  It is worth mentioning that counts may easily be derived from grouped objects by simply querying the   length of each grouped array. It may be advantageous, depending on application context, to prefer grouping  over counting. Listing 16-5 shows how to get the count for a single set of grouped data, as well as a function  for creating an object of counts from groupBy   results.  451  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 16   UndersCore and Lodash  Listing 16-5.  Deriving Counts from Grouped Objects     example-005 index.js 'use strict'; var _ = require 'underscore' ;   var urls = [   {scheme: 'http', host: 'underscorejs', domain: '.org'},   {scheme: 'http', host: 'lodash', domain: '.com'},   {scheme: 'http', host: 'ecmascript', domain: '.org'}, ];   var grouped = _.groupBy urls, 'domain' ; var dotOrgCount = grouped['.org'].length; console.log dotOrgCount ;    2   function toCounts grouped  {   var counts = {};   for  var key in grouped  {     if  grouped.hasOwnProperty key   {       counts[key] = grouped[key].length;     }   }   return counts; }   console.log toCounts grouped  ;    { '.org': 2, '.com': 1 }  indexBy   It can also be useful to identify differences amoung data in a collection, especially if those differences  can serve as unique identifiers. Fishing a single object out of a collection by a known identifier is a pretty  common scenario. Done manually, this would require looping over each element in the collection  perhaps  with a while or for loop  and returning the first that possesses a matching unique identifier.  Imagine an airline website on which a customer selects departure and destination airports. The user   chooses each airport via drop-down menus and is then shown additional data about each airport. This  additional data is loaded from airport objects in an array. The values chosen in each drop-down menu are  the unique airport codes, which are then used by the application to find the full, detailed airport objects.  Fortunately, the developer who created this application used Underscore’s indexBy   function to create   an index object from the airports array, shown in Listing 16-6.  452  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 16   UndersCore and Lodash  Listing 16-6.  Indexing Objects by Property     example-006 index.js 'use strict'; var _ = require 'underscore' ;   var airports = [   {code: 'STL', city: 'St Louis', timeZone: '-6:00'},   {code: 'SEA', city: 'Seattle', timeZone: '-8:00'},   {code: 'JFK', city: 'New York', timeZone: '-5:00'} ];   var selected = 'SEA';   var indexed = _.indexBy airports, 'code' ; console.log indexed ;  * {   STL: {code: 'STL', city: 'St Louis', timeZone: '-6:00'},   SEA: {code: 'SEA', city: 'Seattle', timeZone: '-8:00'},   JFK: {code: 'JFK', city: 'New York', timeZone: '-5:00'} } *    var timeZone = indexed[selected].timeZone; console.log timeZone ;    -8:00  The indexBy   function behaves a bit like groupBy  , except that each object has a unique value for the   indexed property, so the final result is an object whose keys  which must be unique  are the values of each  object for a specified property, and whose values are the objects that posses each property. In Listing 16-6  the keys for the indexed object are each airport code, and the values are the corresponding airport objects. Keeping an indexed object with relatively stable reference data in memory is a fundamental caching   practice. It incurs a one-time performance penalty  the indexing process  to avoid multiple iteration  penalties  having to traverse the array each time an object is needed .  Being Choosy  Developers often extract wanted data, or omit unwanted data, from collections and objects. This might  be done for legibility  when data will be shown to a user , for performance  when data is to be sent over a  network connection , for privacy  when data returned from an object or module’s API should be sparse , or  for some other purpose.  Selecting Data from Collections Underscore has a number of utility functions that select one or more elements from a collection of objects  based on some criteria. In some circumstances this criteria may be a function that evaluates each element  and returns true or false  whether the element “passes” the criteria test . In other circumstances the criteria  may be a bit of data that will be compared to each element  or a part of each element  for equality, the  success or failure of which determines whether the element “matches” the criteria used.  453  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 16   UndersCore and Lodash  filter    The filter   function uses the criteria function approach. Given an array of elements and a function,  filter   applies the function to each element and returns an array consisting only of elements that passed  the criteria test. In Listing 16-7 an array of playing cards is filtered so that only spades are returned.  Listing 16-7.  Filtering an Array with a Criteria Function     example-007 index.js 'use strict'; var _ = require 'underscore' ;   var cards = [   {suite: 'Spades', denomination: 'King'},   {suite: 'Hearts', denomination: '10'},   {suite: 'Clubs', denomination: 'Ace'},   {suite: 'Spades', denomination: 'Ace'}, ];   var filtered = _.filter cards, function  card  {   return card.suite === 'Spades'; } ;   console.log filtered ;  * [   { suite: 'Spades', denomination: 'King' },   { suite: 'Spades', denomination: 'Ace' } ] *   where    The where   function is similar to filter   but uses the comparison criteria approach instead. Its first  argument is an array of objects, but its second argument is a criteria object whose keys and values will  be compared to the keys and values of each element in the array. If an element contains all the keys and  corresponding values in the criteria object  using strict equality , the element will be included in the array  returned by where  .  In Listing 16-8, a set of board game objects is filtered by an object that specifies a minimum player  count and play time. Pandemic is excluded because it does not match the playTime value of the criteria  object, though it does match the minPlayer value.  Listing 16-8.  Filtering an Array by Criteria Comparison     example-008 index.js 'use strict'; var _ = require 'underscore' ;   var boardGames = [   {title: 'Ticket to Ride', minPlayers: 2, playTime: 45},   {title: 'Pandemic', minPlayers: 2, playTime: 60},   {title: 'Munchkin Deluxe', minPlayers: 2, playTime: 45} ];   454  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 16   UndersCore and Lodash  var filtered = _.where boardGames, {   minPlayers: 2,   playTime: 45 } ;   console.log filtered ;  * [   { title: 'Ticket to Ride', minPlayers: 2, playTime: 45 },   { title: 'Munchkin Deluxe', minPlayers: 2, playTime: 45 } ] *   find    and findWhere    The filter   and where   functions always return collections. If no object passes the criteria test each  returns an empty set. A developer could use these functions to find an individual object within a set  e.g.,  by some unique identifier , but would then have to fish that object from the result array by using index  zero. Fortunately, Underscore provides find   and findWhere   functions that complement filter   and  where  . They each return the first object to pass the criteria check or return undefined if no objects in the  set pass. In Listing 16-9 a collection is searched twice for specific entries. Note that even though multiple  items would fulfill the {what: 'Dagger'} criteria object passed to findWhere  , only the first match in the  collection is returned.  Listing 16-9.  Finding a Single Item in a Collection     example-009 index.js 'use strict'; var _ = require 'underscore' ;   var guesses = [   {who: 'Mrs. Peacock', where: 'Lounge', what: 'Revolver'},   {who: 'Professor Plum', where: 'Study', what: 'Dagger'},   {who: 'Miss Scarlet', where: 'Ballroom', what: 'Candlestick'},   {who: 'Reverend Green', where: 'Conservatory', what: 'Dagger'} ];   var result = _.find guesses, function  guess  {   return guess.where === 'Ballroom'; } ;   console.log result ;    { who: 'Miss Scarlet', where: 'Ballroom', what: 'Candlestick' }   result = _.findWhere guesses, {what: 'Dagger'} ;   console.log result ;    { who: 'Professor Plum', where: 'Study', what: 'Dagger' }  455  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 16   UndersCore and Lodash  Selecting Data from Objects The Underscore functions covered up to this point all filter larger collections into focused, smaller ones  or  even a single object  when a portion of data is unnecessary to the application. Objects are also collections of  data, indexed by string keys instead of ordered numbers; and like arrays, filtering data in individual objects  can be quite useful.  pluck    A developer could get a property’s value from each object in a collection by looping over each element and  capturing the desired property value in an array, or by using Array.prototype.map    or Underscore’s  equivalent, map   . But a faster, more convenient option is to use Underscore’s pluck   function, which  takes an array as its first argument and the name of the property to lift from each element as its second. The  pluck   function is used in Listing 16-10 to extract the numbers that landed face-up from a roll of three dice.  These values are then summed  with Array.prototype.reduce    to determine the total value of the roll.  Listing 16-10.  Plucking Properties from Objects in a Collection     example-010 index.js 'use strict'; var _ = require 'underscore' ;   var diceRoll = [   {sides: 6, up: 3},   {sides: 6, up: 1},   {sides: 6, up: 5} ];   var allUps = _.pluck diceRoll, 'up' ;   console.log allUps ;    [ 3, 1, 5 ]   var total = allUps.reduce function  prev, next  {   return prev + next; }, 0 ;   console.log total ;    9  While pluck   is quite useful for selecting individual properties from objects, it only operates on   collections and is not very useful for dealing with individual objects.  values    The ECMAScript 5 specification introduced the keys   function on the Object constructor, a handy utility  for turning the keys of any object literal into an array of strings. Underscore has a corresponding keys    implementation but also has a values   function that, sadly, has no counterpart in native JavaScript. The  values   function is used to extract all property values from an object, and is arguably most valuable  dad  joke  for objects that hold a collection of “constants,” or serve as an enumeration would in another language.  Listing 16-11 demonstrates how this extraction takes place.  456  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 16   UndersCore and Lodash  Listing 16-11.  Extracting Values from an Object Literal     example-011 index.js 'use strict'; var _ = require 'underscore' ;   var BOARD_TILES = {   IND_AVE: 'Indiana Avenue',   BOARDWALK: 'Boardwalk',   MARV_GARD: 'Marvin Gardens',   PK_PLACE: 'Park Place' };   var propertyNames = _.values BOARD_TILES ;   console.log propertyNames ;    [ 'Indiana Avenue', 'Boardwalk', 'Marvin Gardens', 'Park Place' ]  Reference data  e.g., a hash of US state abbreviations and names  is often retrieved and cached all at   once. This data will typically be dereferenced by key so that some particular value can be extracted, but  sometimes it is useful to work with all values regardless of key, as the Underscore template in Listing 16-12  demonstrates.  Underscore templates will be discussed later in this chapter, but Listing 16-12 should give  you enough to grasp basic usage.  Each value in the BOARD_TILES hash  the tile name  is rendered as a list  item in an unordered list. The keys are inconsequential; only the values matter, a perfect scenario for the  values   function.  Listing 16-12.  Extracting Values from an Object Literal                                      function  _  {   var template = document.querySelector 'tiles-template' .innerHTML;   var bindTemplate = _.template template ;   var BOARD_TILES = {     IND_AVE: 'Indiana Avenue',     BOARDWALK: 'Boardwalk',     MARV_GARD: 'Marvin Gardens',     PK_PLACE: 'Park Place'   };   var markup = bindTemplate {tiles: BOARD_TILES} ;   document.querySelector 'output' .innerHTML = markup; } window._  ;    457  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 16   UndersCore and Lodash  pick    Finally, to whittle an object down to a subset of its keys and values, developers can use Underscore’s pick    function. When passing in a target object and one or more property names, pick   will return another  object composed solely of those properties  and their values  from the target. In Listing 16-13 the name and  numPlayers properties are extracted from a larger hash of board game details with pick  .  Listing 16-13.  Picking Properties from an Object Literal     example-012 index.js 'use strict'; var _ = require 'underscore' ;   var boardGame = {   name: 'Settlers of Catan',   designer: 'Klaus Teuber',   numPlayers: [3, 4],   yearPublished: 1995,   ages: '10+',   playTime: '90min',   subdomain: ['Family', 'Strategy'],   category: ['Civilization', 'Negotiation'],   website: 'http:  www.catan.com' };   var picked = _.pick boardGame, 'name', 'numPlayers' ;   console.log picked ;  * {   name: 'Settlers of Catan',   numPlayers: [ 3, 4 ] } *   omit    The inverse of pick   is omit  , which returns an object composed of all properties except the ones  specified. The properties designer, numPlayers, yearPublished, ages, and playTime are all eliminated from  the result object created by omit   in Listing 16-14.  Listing 16-14.  Omitting Properties from an Object Literal     example-013 index.js 'use strict'; var _ = require 'underscore' ;   var boardGame = {   name: 'Settlers of Catan',   designer: 'Klaus Teuber',   numPlayers: [3, 4],  458  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 16   UndersCore and Lodash    yearPublished: 1995,   ages: '10+',   playTime: '90min',   subdomain: ['Family', 'Strategy'],   category: ['Civilization', 'Negotiation'],   website: 'http:  www.catan.com' };   var omitted = _.omit boardGame, 'designer', 'numPlayers',   'yearPublished', 'ages', 'playTime' ;   console.log omitted ;  * {   name: 'Settlers of Catan',   subdomain: [ 'Family', 'Strategy' ],   category: [ 'Civilization', 'Negotiation' ],   website: 'http:  www.catan.com' } *   In addition to property names, both pick   and omit   accept a predicate that will evaluate each  property and value instead. If the predicate returns true, the property will be included in the resulting  object; if it returns false, the property will be excluded. The predicate for pick   in listing 16-15 will  only add properties to the result object for values that are arrays; in this case, the properties numPlayers,  subdomain, and category.  Listing 16-15.  Picking Properties from an Object Literal with a Predicate Function     example-014 index.js 'use strict'; var _ = require 'underscore' ;   var boardGame = {   name: 'Settlers of Catan',   designer: 'Klaus Teuber',   numPlayers: [3, 4],   yearPublished: 1995,   ages: '10+',   playTime: '90min',   subdomain: ['Family', 'Strategy'],   category: ['Civilization', 'Negotiation'],   website: 'http:  www.catan.com' };   var picked = _.pick boardGame, function  value, key, object  {   return Array.isArray value ; } ;    459  www.it-ebooks.info   Underscore contains a number of utility functions that are frequently used together to create transformation  pipelines for data. To begin a chain, an object or collection is passed to Underscore’s chain   function.  This returns a chain wrapper on which many Underscore functions may be called in a fluent manner, each  compounding the effects of the preceding function call.  Listing 16-16 shows an array of coffee shops and the hours during which each is open. The   whatIsOpen   function accepts a numeric hour and a period  'AM' or 'PM' . These are then used to evaluate  the coffee shops in the collection and return the names of the coffee shops that are open during that time.  Chapter 16   UndersCore and Lodash  console.log picked ;  * {   numPlayers: [ 3, 4 ],   subdomain: [ 'Family', 'Strategy' ],   category: [ 'Civilization', 'Negotiation' ] } *   Chaining  Listing 16-16.  Chaining Functions on a Collection     example-015 index.js 'use strict'; var _ = require 'lodash' ;    * Note that lodash, not underscore, is used for this example. The cloneDeep   function below is unique to lodash. *    var coffeeShops = [   {name: 'Crooked Tree', hours: [6, 22]},   {name: 'Picasso\'s Coffee House', hours: [6, 24]},   {name: 'Sump Coffee', hours: [9, 16]} ];   function whatIsOpen hour, period  {   return _.chain coffeeShops      .cloneDeep                                1     .map function to12HourFormat  shop  {     2       shop.hours = _.map shop.hours, function  hour  {         return  hour > 12 ? hour – 12 : hour ;       }       return shop;     }      .filter function filterByHour  shop  {    3       if  period === 'AM'  {         return shop.hours[0] <= hour;       }  460  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 16   UndersCore and Lodash        if  period === 'PM'  {         return shop.hours[1] >= hour;       }       return false;     }      .map function toShopName  shop  {         4       return shop.name;     }      .value  ;                                 5 }   console.log whatIsOpen 8, 'AM'  ;    [ 'Crooked Tree', 'Picasso\'s Coffee House' ]   console.log whatIsOpen 11, 'PM'  ;    [ 'Picasso\'s Coffee House' ]  After chain   wraps the coffeeShops array in a fluent API, the following functions are called to   manipulate and filter the collection until the desired data has been produced.                  cloneDeep   recursively clones the array and all objects and their properties. In  step 2 the array data is actually modified, so the array is cloned to preserve its  original state.  map function to12HourFormat   { *...* }  iterates over each item in the  cloned array and replaces the second 24-hour number in the hours array with its  12-hour equivalent.  filter function filterByHour   { *...* }  iterates over each modified  coffee shop and evaluates its hours based on the period  'AM' or 'PM'  specified:  the first element for the opening hour and the second for the closing hour. The  function returns true or false to indicate whether the coffee shop should be  retained or dropped from the results.  map function toShopName   { *...* }  returns the name of each remaining  coffee shop in the collection. The result is an array of strings that will be passed  to any subsequent steps in the chain.  5.  Finally, value   is called to terminate the chain and return the final result:  the array of names of coffee shops that are open during the hour and period  provided to whatIsOpen    or an empty array if none match the criteria .  This may seem like a lot to grasp, but Underscore chains can be reduced to a few simple principles that   are easy to remember:   	 Chains can be created with any initial value, though object and array are the most   typical starting points.  Any Underscore function that operates on a value is available as a chained function.  The return value of a chained function becomes the input value of the next function  in the chain.  1.   2.   3.   4.    	  	  461  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 16   UndersCore and Lodash   	   	  The first argument of a chained function is always the value on which it operates. For  example, Underscore’s map   function normally accepts two arguments, a collection  and a callback, but when invoked as a chained function, it only accepts a callback.  This pattern holds for all chained functions.  Always invoke the value   function to terminate a chain and retrieve its final,  manipulated value. If a chain does not return a value, this is unnecessary.  Chaining functions for a collection or object might seem natural and obvious, but Underscore also has  a number of functions that work on primitives. Listing 16-17 shows how a chain can wrap the number 100 to  eventually generate the lyrics to “99 Bottles of Beer.”  Listing 16-17.  Chaining Functions on a Primitive     example-016 index.js 'use strict'; var _ = require 'underscore' ;   _.chain 100    .times function makeLyrics  number  {     if  number === 0  {       return '';     }     return [       number + ' bottles of beer on the wall!',       number + ' bottles of beer!',       'Take one down, pass it around!',        number - 1  + ' bottles of beer on the wall!',       '♫ ♪ ♫ ♪ ♫ ♪ ♫ ♪ ♫ ♪ ♫',     ].join '\n' ;   }    .tap function orderLyrics  lyrics  {        reverse the array so the song is in order     lyrics.reverse  ;   }    .map function makeLoud  lyric  {     return lyric.toUpperCase  ;   }    .forEach function printLyrics  lyric  {     console.log lyric ;   } ;  The times   function takes a number as its first argument and a callback to be invoked for each   decremented value of that number. In this example, the callback makeLyrics   will be invoked starting with  the number 99  not 100  and ending with the number 0, for 100 total iterations. For each invocation, one  refrain of “99 Bottles” is returned. This creates an array of strings, which is then passed to the next function  in the chain.  Because the final chained function forEach   creates side effects instead of returning a value, there is   no need to terminate the chain by calling value  . Instead, Listing 16-18 shows the results that are printed to  the console.  462  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 16   UndersCore and Lodash  Listing 16-18.

Native functions like  setTimeout  , setInterval  , and Node’s setImmediate   give developers a degree of control over when  these functions run—which turn of the event loop will handle their invocations. Underscore augments these  primitives with a number of control functions that add flexibility to function scheduling.  defer   Underscore’s defer   function mimics the behavior of setImmediate   in a Node.js environment; which  is to say, defer   schedules a function to execute on the next immediate turn of the event loop. This is  equivalent to using setTimeout   with a delay of 0. Since setImmediate   is not a JavaScript standard  function, using Underscore’s defer   in both browser and server environments can provide a greater degree  of consistency than poly-filling setImmediate   in the browser.  The example code in Listing 16-19 demonstrates the value of defer   in a user interface. It loads a large   data set of playing card information for the popular card game Dominion, then populates an HTML table  with card details.  While the data is fetched from the server and then processed, the user sees the message, “Please be   patient while cards are loading!” Once the GET request has completed, the processCards   handler begins  to process almost 200 cards in blocks of 10. For each block  except the first , the handler defers processing,  which has two beneficial effects. First, it allows the UI time to paint the previous 10 processed rows in the  table, and second, it allows the user to scroll in between window paints. Because the block size is so small,  the scroll speed is relatively normal for the user. If processCards   attempted to render all table rows at  once, the UI would freeze until all DOM elements had been added to the table.  Listing 16-19.

In JavaScript, debouncing a function can be very helpful if a developer  anticipates that duplicate, identical function calls may be made in quick succession. A common scenario for  a debounced function, for example, is preventing a form’s submit handler from being called more than once  when a user accidentally clicks a Submit button multiple times on a web page.  A custom debounce implementation would require a developer to track the invocations of a   function over a short period of time  perhaps only hundreds of milliseconds  using setTimeout   and  clearTimeout   for each duplicate invocation. Fortunately, Underscore provides a debounce   function that  handles this plumbing for developers, as demonstrated in Listing 16-20.  Listing 16-20.  Debouncing a Function     Quickly Click Me Many Times!     function    {   var onClick = _.debounce function  e  {     alert 'click handled!' ;   }, 300 ;     document.getElementById 'submit'      .addEventListener 'click', onClick ; }   ;    In Listing 16-20 an onClick   function is created by invoking debounce  . The first argument to  debounce   is the function that will actually be run once all duplicate invocations have stopped. The  second argument is a duration, in milliseconds, that must elapse between invocations for the callback to  finally be triggered. For example, if a user clicks the submit button once, and then clicks it again within  the 300-millisecond time span, the first invocation is ignored and the wait timer is restarted. Once the wait  period has timed out, the debounce   callback will be invoked, alerting the user that the click has been  handled.   each time a debounced function is invoked, its internal timer is reset. the specified time span      Note  represents the minimum time that must pass between the last invocation and its preceding invocation  if any   before the callback function executes.  In Figure 16-1, a debounced function with a timeout of 300ms is called three times. After the first call at   point A, 250ms elapse, at which point another call happens at point B and the wait timer is reset. The interval  between B and the next call, C, is shorter: 100ms. Again, the wait timer resets. At point C a third call is made,  after which the wait duration of 300ms is met. At point D the debounced function’s callback is invoked.  465  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 16   UndersCore and Lodash  Figure 16-1.  A debounced function invoked multiple times  The debounced function’s callback will receive any arguments passed to the debounce   function itself.   For example, in Listing 16-20, jQuery’s event object e is forwarded to the debounced function’s callback.  While each invocation may pass different arguments, it is important to realize that only the arguments passed  during the last invocation within the wait period will actually be forwarded to the callback. The debounce    function receives an optional third, immediate parameter which may be true or false. Setting this parameter  to true will invoke the callback for the first invocation instead, ignoring all subsequent duplicates for the  wait period. If the arguments passed to the debounced function vary, capturing the first parameters passed  instead of the last might be strategically beneficial.  throttle   Underscore’s throttle   function is similar to debounce  . It ignores subsequent invocations of a function  for a specified period of time, but does not reset its internal timer with each function call. It effectively  ensures that only one invocation happens during a specified period, whereas debounce   guarantees that  only one invocation will happen sometime after the last invocation of a debounced function. Throttling a  function can be particularly useful if a function is likely to be called many times with the same arguments,  or when the granularity of the arguments is such that it is not useful to account for every invocation of the  function.  The in-memory JavaScript message bus, postal.js, is a useful library for routing messages through   an application. Some application modules send messages at a frequency that might not be useful for  humnan consumption, so any function that displays these messages to a user might be a good candidate for  throttling.  The code in Listing 16-21 demonstrates a simplified version of this scenario. Don’t worry about   understanding the postal.js API entirely—it is sufficient to understand that postal.publish   will place a  message onto the bus, and postal.subscribe   will invoke a callback when that message is received. In this  example a message is published once every 100ms. The callback attached to the subscription, however, is  throttled at 500ms. So, with a little padding for timing inconsistencies  the JavaScript event loop timer has  low precision , the UI will display roughly 20 or 21 updates even though 100 updates have been placed on  the message bus  roughly 1 in 5 messages will be displayed .  466  www.it-ebooks.info   Listing 16-21.  Using a Throttled Function to Control Status Updates  Chapter 16   UndersCore and Lodash           $ function    {     var $friends = $ 'friends' ;     function onStatusUpdate data  {     var text = data.name + ' is ' + data.status;     $friends.append $ '  ' .html text  ;   }        *    * subscribing to status updates from friends    * with a throttled callback that will only    * fire *once* every 500ms    *    postal.subscribe {     channel: 'friends',     topic: 'status.update',     callback: _.throttle onStatusUpdate, 500    } ;     }   ;         $ function    {     var i = 1;     var interval = null;        *      * publishing a status update from a      * friend every 100ms      *      function sendMessage   {       if  i === 100  {         return clearInterval interval ;       }       i += 1;       postal.publish {         channel: 'friends',         topic: 'status.update',  467  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 16   UndersCore and Lodash          data: {           name: 'Jim',           status: 'slinging code'         }       } ;     }       setInterval sendMessage, 100 ;   }   ;    Figure 16-2 illustrates how throttle   differs from defer  . Once a throttled function is invoked at  point A, it will ignore all further invocations  at points B and C  until its wait duration has passed—in this  case, 300ms. Once elapsed, the next call at point D will invoke the throttled function.  Figure 16-2.  A throttled function invoked multiple times  Templates  Underscore offers a micro-templating system that compiles a template string  typically HTML  into a  function. When this function is invoked with some data, it uses the template string’s binding expressions  to populate the template, returning a new HTML string. Developers who have used templating tools like  Mustache or Handlebars will be familiar with this process. Unlike these more robust templating libraries,  however, Underscore’s templates have a much smaller feature set and no real template extension points.  Underscore can be a strong choice as a template library when the templates in an application are fairly trivial  and you have no desire or need to incur the overhead of a template-specific library in an application.  468  www.it-ebooks.info   Template systems usually begin with some markup, and Underscore is no exception. Data binding   expressions are added to a template with “gator tags”  so named because the opening and closing elements,   , look kind of like alligators . Listing 16-22 shows a simple block of HTML that will later be bound to  an object literal containing two properties, title and synopsis.  Chapter 16   UndersCore and Lodash  Listing 16-22.  Template with “Gator Tags”            Gator tags come in three varieties. The tags used in Listing 16-22 generate safe HTML output by   escaping any HTML tag sequences. If the movie synopsis contained an HTML tag such as  , it would  be converted to &lt;strong&gt;. In contrast, the gator tag <%= may be used to output unescaped strings with  HTML markup in-tact. The third gator tag is the JavaScript evaluation tag, and it simply begins with <%  more  on this tag will be covered in a bit . All gator tags share the same closing tag, %>.  To turn the HTML in Listing 16-22 into a populated template the HTML string is first compiled by   passing it to Underscore’s template   function. A reusable binding function is returned. When a data object  is passed to this binding function, any properties that match the binding expressions in the original template  string will be substituted in the final, computed output. Under the hood Underscore uses JavaScript’s with  keyword to magically bring these properties into the template’s scope. Listing 16-23 demonstrates how to  bind a simple template string to a data object, and shows the HTML that is produced as a result.  Listing 16-23.  Binding an Underscore Template            function  _  {   var markup =     '   ' +     '   ';        compile the string into a function   var compiledTemplate = _.template markup ;        invoke the function with data to      get the rendered string   var rendered = compiledTemplate {     title: 'Sunshine',     synopsis: 'A team of scientists are sent to re-ignite a dying sun.'   } ;     document.querySelector 'output' .innerHTML = rendered;   } window._  ;        Sunshine     A team of scientists are sent to re-ignite a dying sun.     469  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 16   UndersCore and Lodash  Once a template string is compiled to a function it may be invoked any number of times with different  data to produce different rendered markup. It is common for applications to compile template strings into  functions during page load  or during application startup, if Node.js is the runtime environment , then call  each as needed during the lifetime of the application. If template strings do not change, there is no need to  recompile them.  Loops and Other Arbitrary JavaScript in Templates Many templating libraries include shorthand tags for common templating chores like iterating over a  collection. To keep its templating system thin, Underscore forgoes syntactical sugar and, instead, allows  developers to write template loops in plain, valid JavaScript.  In Listing 16-24 an unordered list of actors is created by using Underscore’s each   function within the   template. There are two important things to note here. First, plain JavaScript is evaluated within gator tag  code blocks. These blocks are created by using gator tags without a hyphen symbol in the opening tag  e.g.,    instead of   . Second, the each   loop is split in the middle, where valid templating markup  is used to render the actor variable, created by the loop itself, in a list item element. Finally, the loop is  terminated by a closing brace, parenthesis, and semicolon, as if it were a normal JavaScript loop.  Listing 16-24.  Looping in a Template            function  _  {   var markup =     '   ' +     '   ' +     ' ' +     ' ' +     '     ' +     ' ' +     ' ';        compile the string into a function   var compiledTemplate = _.template markup ;        invoke the function with data to      get the rendered string   var rendered = compiledTemplate {     title: 'Sunshine',     synopsis: 'A team of scientists are sent to re-ignite a dying sun.',     actors: ['Cillian Murphy', 'Hiroyuki Sanada', 'Chris Evans']   } ;     document.querySelector 'output' .innerHTML = rendered;    470  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 16   UndersCore and Lodash  } window._  ;        Sunshine     A team of scientists are sent to re-ignite a dying sun.           Cillian Murphy       Hiroyuki Sanada       Chris Evans         JavaScript evaluation tags can also be used to execute arbitrary JavaScript code. The template in    Listing 16-25 calculates a rating percentage for the movie based on X out of Y stars awarded to it by critics.   The template uses Underscore’s internal print   function to render the result of the calculation in the template  output, an alternative to gator tag interpolation that is sometimes used in more complex expressions.  Listing 16-25.  Arbitrary JavaScript Within a Template            function  _  {   var markup =     ' ' +     '  out of   stars!' +     '   % ' +     ' ';     var compiledTemplate = _.template markup ;     var rendered = compiledTemplate {     voted: 4, total: 5   } ;     document.querySelector 'output' .innerHTML = rendered;   } window._  ;        4 out of 5 stars!  80%         Note   Generally it is bad practice to perform calculations in a template  the application’s “view” . Instead,  the actual calculated value should be part of the data passed to the compiled template function. Listing 16-25  should be considered for demonstration purposes only.  471  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 16   UndersCore and Lodash  Living Without Gator Tags Gator tags can be a bit unruly in nontrivial templates. Fortunately, Underscore allows developers to  change the syntax of template tags with regular expressions. Setting the templateSettings property on the  Underscore object to a hash of key value settings alters the behavior of Underscore for the lifetime of your  page  or Node.js process , and affects all rendered templates.  Listing 16-26 shows how to change Underscore’s gator tag syntax into a more terse Mustache   Handlebars syntax. In this case, the three different types of tags  evaluation, interpolation, and escaped  interpolation  are each assigned a regular expression on the global settings object.  Listing 16-26.  Changing Template Syntax            function  _  {   _.templateSettings = {        arbitrary JavaScript code blocks: {{ }}     evaluate:  \{\{ .+? \}\} g,        unsafe string interpolation: {{= }}     interpolate:  \{\{= .+? \}\} g,        escaped string interpolation: {{- }}     escape:  \{\{- .+? \}\} g   };     var markup =     ' {{- title }} ' +     ' {{- synopsis }} ' +     ' ' +     '{{ _.each actors, function  actor  { }}' +     '   {{- actor }} ' +     '{{ } ; }}' +     ' ';     var compiledTemplate = _.template markup ;     var rendered = compiledTemplate {     title: 'Sunshine',     synopsis: 'A team of scientists are sent to re-ignite a dying sun.',     actors: ['Cillian Murphy', 'Hiroyuki Sanada', 'Chris Evans']   } ;     document.querySelector 'output' .innerHTML = rendered;   } window._  ;    Any markup compiled by the template system must now support the specified Mustache syntax.   Templates that still contain gator tags will not be rendered correctly.  Table 16-2 is a convenient reference for matching template settings to syntax and the regular   expressions that enable each syntax.  472  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 16   UndersCore and Lodash  Table 16-2.  Global Template Settings  Setting  Template Syntax  Regular Expression  evaluate  {{ ... }}  interpolate  {{= ... }}  escape  {{- ... }}   {{ .+? }} g   {{= .+? }} g   {{- .+? }} g  Accessing the Data Object Within a Template As mentioned, Underscore uses JavaScript’s with keyword to evaluate a data object’s properties in a  template’s scope as “first class” variables. But the object itself may also be referenced through the obj  property in the template. To modify a previous example, in Listing 16-27 the template tests for the data  property obj.percent in an if else block before attempting to calculate a percentage. If the percent  property exists on the data object, it is rendered; otherwise the calculated value is rendered.  Listing 16-27.  The “obj” Variable            function  _  {   var markup =     '  out of   stars!' +     ' ' +     '   % ' +     ' ' +     '   % ' +     ' ';     var compiledTemplate = _.template markup ;     var rendered = compiledTemplate {     voted: 4, total: 5, percent: 80.2   } ;     document.querySelector 'output' .innerHTML = rendered;   } window._  ;    As a micro-optimization  and perhaps a security feature , the scoped object can be given a name so   that the with keyword is avoided altogether. This makes the templating function run slightly faster, but also  requires that all properties in the template be referenced as properties of the named data object. To specify  a name for the data object, an options object may be passed to Underscore’s template   function when  compiling the template. This object’s variable property will assign the data object’s variable name, which  may then be referred to in the template. Listing 16-28 shows this setting in action.  473  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 16   UndersCore and Lodash  Listing 16-28.  Setting the Data Object’s Variable Name            function  _  {   var markup =     '  out of   stars!' +     ' ' +     '   % ' +     ' ' +     '   % ' +     ' ';     var settings = {variable: 'movie'};      settings is the *third* parameter   var compiledTemplate = _.template markup, null, settings ;     var rendered = compiledTemplate {     voted: 4, total: 5, percent: 80.1   } ;     document.querySelector 'output' .innerHTML = rendered;   } window._  ;     the variable property may be set in Underscore’s global settings. however, giving variables good      Note  and relevant names is important, so it makes more sense to name a variable according to its context. Instead of  defining some generic variable like data or item, the examples in this section use the variable name movie and  apply it by passing a settings object to template   when the movie template is compiled.  Default Template Data While not part of its templating system, Underscore’s defaults   function can be used to ensure that  a template always has default data. This will prevent binding failures in the event that a data object is  missing one or more referenced properties. The first parameter to the defaults   function is an object with  potentially missing properties. Any following arguments may be objects with properties set to default values,  which will fill in any missing properties on the first object. The return value is an object that represents  the “merged” properties of all arguments. Listing 16-29 shows this effect on a data object that is missing  its synopsis property. When the data and DEFAULTS objects are passed to the defaults   function, the  returned object contains the title from data and the synopsis from DEFAULTS.  474  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 16   UndersCore and Lodash  Listing 16-29.  Default Template Values            function  _  {   var markup =     '   ' +     '   ';        compile the string into a function   var compiledTemplate = _.template markup ;     var DEFAULTS = {     title: 'A Great Film',     synopsis: 'An epic hero defeats and evil villain and saves the world!'   };     var data = {     title: 'Lord of the Rings'   };        fill in any missing data values with defaults   var merged = _.defaults data, DEFAULTS ;     var rendered = compiledTemplate merged ;     document.querySelector 'output' .innerHTML = rendered;   } window._  ;    If multiple default objects are passed to defaults  , they are evaluated from first to last. Once a missing   property is found on a default object, it will be ignored on any following default objects.  Summary  Modern and future implementations of ECMAScript have given developers a great many utility functions  on primitive types like String, Array, Object, and Function. Unfortunately, the world moves faster than  specifications come to fruition so libraries like Underscore and Lodash occupy the intersection of developer  needs and language maturity.  475  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 16   UndersCore and Lodash  With over 100 utility functions and a micro-templating system, Underscore enables developers to   manipulate, transform, and render data in objects and collections. Underscore can be used in browser and  server environments and has no dependencies. It can be added to a web page with a simple script tag or  imported as an AMD or CommonJS module. Popular package managers like Bower, npm, component, and  NuGet can all download prebuilt Underscore packages for a developer’s platform of choice.  Underscore’s strong feature set and ubiquitous availability make it an ideal and unobtrusive Swiss Army   knife for JavaScript projects.

JavaScript Frameworks for Modern Web Dev is your guide to the wild, vast, and untamed frontier that is JavaScript development. The JavaScript tooling landscape has grown and matured drastically in the past several years. This book will serve as an introduction to both new and well established libraries, frameworks, and utilities that have gained popular traction and support from seasoned developers. It covers tools applicable to the entire development stack, both client- and server-side. While no single book can possibly cover every JavaScript library of value, JavaScript Frameworks for Modern Web Dev focuses on incredibly useful libraries and frameworks that production software uses. You will be treated to detailed analyses and sample code for tools that manage dependencies, structure code in a modular fashion, automate repetitive build tasks, create specialized servers, structure client side applications, facilitate horizontal scaling, and interacting with disparate data stores
