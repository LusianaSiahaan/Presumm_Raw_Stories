Introduction  The fourth industrial revolution has created big tech winners and monopolis- tic companies that lead the digital economy space today. The unfolding mount  in the digital economy is leaving a significant footprint across industries from  production,  distribution  to  consumption  of  goods  and  services.  This  eco- nomic system is flooded with a dense carpet of tech megatrends. These tech- nological advancements have significantly contributed to the contemporary  global inter-state and intra-state order. To this effect, regional and business  competitiveness depends on how states and industries respond to the dynam- ics of emerging technologies around them. As  technology  plays  a  strategically  vital  role  in  perceived  power  of  a  state  through national security and economic competitiveness, some of the major  innovations like the Web, robotics, Internet of Things, cloud computing, artifi- cial intelligence, and mobile technology  fifth generation of wireless communi- cations, 5G  have created a technological rivalry between global powers.1 Of  course, these enabling technologies come with tremendous opportunities. For  example, not to mention all, the World Economic Forum report indicates that  about 10% of the global economy, by 2027, will be recorded on blockchain.2 In  the mobile technology space, McKinsey predicts that in the coming ten years,  the 5G connectivity revolution alone could boost the global GDP by 1.2–2 tril- lion USD, mainly in healthcare, manufacturing, transportation, and retail sec- tors.3 As the Chinese tech company Huawei holds the upper hand in 5G tech,  the  Western  world  is  racing  to  conquer  the  perceived  challenge  posed  by  China, mainly on a geopolitical basis.4 That being the case, the fight over tech- nological leadership thus has both political and economic incentives for nations. Notably, enabled by emerging technologies, data-driven decision-making has  continued to be a growing field of the knowledge economy. For example, real- time  data  access  to  patients  accelerates  research  and  development  in  the   1 See Hoffmann et al.  2019 , Brown  2019 , and Johnson  2019  for details on the technol- ogy geopolitics. 2 www3.weforum.org docs WEF_GAC15_Technological_Tipping_Points_ report_2015.pdf 3 www.mckinsey.com industries technology-media-and-telecommunications  our-insights connected-world-an-evolution-in-connectivity-beyond-  the-5g-revolution 4 www.economist.com business 2020 04 08 america-does-not-want-china-to-  dominate-5g-mobile-networks   xii  Introduction  medical industry. In this regard, tech has a track record of effectively facilitating  and  providing  robust  solutions  to  the  medical  industry.  To  mention  some,  Kinsa’s  smart  thermometer  has  helped  in  tracking  flu  trends  of  the  United  States in 2018.5 Recently, as the pandemic challenges major economies, trends  in digital tech for tracking, testing, and treating tools show tremendous growth. Similarly,  in  Canada,  an  app  developed  by  the  Self  Care  Catalysts   SCC   enables tracking of COVID-19 health.6 By leveraging the technologies in the  space and facilitating the access to the aggregated real-time data  big data  on  patients, such applications lend promising future to our “new normal” world  of the COVID-19 pandemic. Another development toward fighting the coro- navirus  through  tech  solutions  is  the  US-initiated  supercomputing  consor- tium,  COVID-19  High-Performance  Computing,  in  collaboration  with  tech  companies and academia.7, 8 Beyond the med-tech, social media platforms, and  mobile technologies that kept people connected while maintaining physical  distances to enabling software of working from home and digitized financial  service access, digitization has played a significant role. However, as centralized mega-platforms work with authorities in combating  the COVID-19 pandemic, the issues of user data privacy remain to be a con- cern. A typical example here is the usage of mobile ad location data in 500 US  cities by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in tracing stay-at- home compliance and the spread of the coronavirus.9 On the other end, data  liberation is on the verge, which could potentially boost global GDPs through  the  replication  of  data.  It  is  interesting  to  see  the  giant  tech,  Microsoft,  embracing the previously unthinkable move toward open data.10 Such devel- opments in data accessibility hold enormous opportunities both for estab- lished businesses and startups. This will significantly allow for the minimization  of  digital  waste  and  enable  efficient  utilization  of  previously  underutilized  aggregated  data  for  broader  purposes  such  as  AI  algorithms  and  business  intelligence systems.  5 www.mobihealthnews.com content kinsas-crowdsourced-smart-thermometer-  data-now-rivals-cdc-tracking-flu-trends 6 www.newswire.ca news-releases free-covid-19-health-tracking-app- launched-to-help-canadians-track-and-manage-their-health-and-provide- frontline-researchers-and-public-health-officials-real-time-large- scale-open-source-public-data-816809411.html 7 https:  covid19-hpc-consortium.org  8 www.whitehouse.gov briefings-statements white-house-announces-  new-partnership-unleash-u-s-supercomputing-resources-fight-covid-19  9 www.wsj.com articles government-tracking-how-people-move-around-in-c  oronavirus-pandemic-11585393202 10 www.economist.com business 2020 04 23 microsoft-embraces-big-data   Introduction  xiii  In addition to a significant socioeconomic and political catalyzation, the digital  economic system has paved the way for innovation misconduct that has dis- torted  human  interactions.  From  the  social  media  fake  contents,  business  misconducts  of  the  Theranos'  fraud  charges11  and  China’s  med-tech  faulty  vaccine scandal,12 Facebook and Cambridge Analytica scandal13 to the Russian  election meddling in the sociopolitical discord of the United States, tech has  been in place.14 The preceding discussion clearly illustrates how emerging technologies hold  root in every aspect of our socioeconomic and political interactions today.  Thus, excelling in this is a crucial strategic decision one could make to remain  competent in the dynamically changing digital world. More importantly, from  a business perspective, irreversible consumer behavior is here to tap through  technological  solutions.  As  the  baby  boomers  and  millennials  continue  to  migrate to the digital world and the digital native Gen Z immerses itself into  the new digitized lifestyle, the digital transformation of businesses and applica- tion of robust emerging tech solutions are a crucial thing to consider. Accordingly, this book is designed to flesh out the main developments in the  digital economy space with an emphasis on emerging technologies of the web- based  business  models  and  distributed  ledger  technologies  that  facilitate  modern digital entrepreneurship. More specifically, transformation within the  digital  economic  system  will  be  presented  in  depth  by  taking  the  cases  of  centralized  crowd-based  business  models  of  the  Web  2.0  economy  with  a  further discussion on the distributed network economic system of the Web  3.0. In an effort to bridge the gap between advances in the digital economy  space and reader interest, each chapter presents up-to-date data and illustra- tive examples.  11 www.businessinsider.com the-history-of-silicon-valley-unicorn-theranos-   and-ceo-elizabeth-holmes-2018-5  12 www.nytimes.com 2018 10 17 business china-vaccine-fine.html 13 w w w . v o x . c o m   p o l i c y - a n d - p o l i t i c s   2 0 1 8   3   2 3   1 7 1 5 1 9 1 6    facebook-cambridge-analytica-trump-diagram  14 www.cnn.com 2017 10 12 us 2016-presidential-election-investigation-  fast-facts index.html   C H A P T E R   1  Digital Economy  and the  Information  Society  About a decade has now passed since the fourth industrial revolution took  root in our post-modern society. With the aim of giving a clear picture of the  digital economy, this chapter is designed to cover the state of the art and  major developments under this economic system. Accordingly, we will look at  the information society and the digital economy on which such society is built  on. An extensive discussion on the monopolization of digital platforms, free  riding of the Web, smart business models, and emerging technologies will be  presented. In addition, by having a closer look at the business models of major  digital companies, the chapter will give an insight into the digital businesses of  this economic system. Here, we will briefly discuss the business models of  tech giants such as Google, Amazon, Alibaba, Uber, Airbnb, and Shopify and  also discuss the startups with Fintech solutions.

Further, the chapter will cover the major regulatory frameworks  and policies toward this economic system and identify the main influences  such policies have on the information society and the digital economy. Major  regulatory developments such as the global consumer protection initiative,  e-consumer.gov, the General Data Protection Regulation  GDPR , California  Consumer Privacy Act, taxation of multinationals, and lobbying by the tech  giants are some of the points to be covered under this section. In the section  that follows, we will have an overview of this economic system.   An Overview of the Digital Economy The digital world has become a venue for entertainment, news, shopping, and  social  interaction,  easing  the  way  for  the  current  trends  of  the  collaborative  economy. The Internet and digitization are the drivers of the mesh economy. The  data-driven collaborative economic system of the millennial era, which relies on  information technology as the primary catalyst, is known as the digital economy. In 2013, Owyang et al. argued that one of the catalysts of this digital economy  is social media, which impacts communications, marketing, and customer care  business functions. Mesh, peer, and sharing economy are the other terms that  are interchangeably used to refer to hybrid models of this economy  Hamari  et al., 2015 . The main developments of this digital economic system include  the  Internet  of  Things,  Internet  of  People,  cloud  computing,  artificial  intelligence  AI , big data and business intelligence, financial technologies— including  the  smart  business  models  of  peer-to-peer   P2P   transactions,  crowdfunding and crowdsourcing, innovation and educational marketplaces— and  blockchain-powered  nano-economic  settings.  The  web-based  business  models are at the core of the modern digital entrepreneurship.   Digital Transformation at a Scale With  the  advent  of  growing  digital  platforms  and  marketplaces,  there  are  newly growing economic units known as prosumers. These economic units are  the  producers  and  consumers  of  digitally  driven  value.  Thus,  in  the  digital  economic  system,  value  is  co-created  at  a  near-zero  marginal  cost   e.g.,  reputation system which will be discussed in depth later in this chapter . Zero  marginal cost1 and ease of entry and exit help this economic system easily  create value in real time. The economic system is powered by various emerging  technologies  that  allow  efficient  utilization  of  scarce  resources,  avoid   1 Rifkin, 2014   3  hyper-consumption, create a new chain of value, and rewrite economic power  grid  and  legacy  order  of  things.  The  societal  structure  in  the  information  society, in general, is categorized into two groups: the digital natives  those  born  in  the  digital  era   and  the  digital  immigrants   those  who  adopted  the  digital world’s way of life   Prensky, 2001 . Table 1-1 shows the possible size of the digital sector in the United States as  of 2015.  Table 1-1.

In 2014, PricewaterhouseCoopers reported that five  sectors  of  the  collaborative  economy—P2P  financing   P2P  lending  and  crowdfunding ,  crowdsourcing,  P2P  homestay  networks,  ride-sharing,  and  music video  streaming—are  predicted  to  generate  about  $335  billion  global  revenue by the year 2025. UN Digital Economy Report 2019 shows that the  digital economy accounts for up to 15.5% of the global GDP. According to the   2 Source: IMF Staff Report, 2018, on Measuring the Digital Economy, www.imf.org en  Publications Policy-Papers Issues 2018 04 03 022818-measuring-the-  digital-economy   4  Chapter 1  Digital Economy and the Information Society  EU Commission, multinational companies with the digital business model have  average annual revenue growth of 14%, which is significantly higher than the  multinationals with a traditional business model with an average annual growth  rate of 0.2% to 3%. In 2016, the EU’s information and communications technology   ICT  services accounted for about 3.75% of the GDP.3 By 2023, ecommerce   the way of transacting goods and services over the Internet  is estimated to  have a share of about 22% in global retail sales. A forecast by Statista shows a  growing migration of people to the digital space with over 2.14 billion online  buyers of goods and services in 2021.4 This is triggered by increasing access to  smartphones and the Internet. According to the ITU, as of 2019, there are 4.1  billion global Internet users. Furthermore, R&D, ICT spending, and infrastructural  developments contribute to the rapid growth in the digital economy and mass  adoption of the underlying economic activities. Gartner predicted that, in 2020,  the global ICT spending would increase by 3.7%  see Table 1-2 .  IT Sector  Table 1-2.

The  main  digital  divides  are  the  digital  gender  gap,  digital  age  gap   generation: digital natives vs. immigrants , and digital usage gap  a.k.a. skill  gap . In the latter case, the gap arises mainly due to the degree of sophistication   in terms of digital literacy  of users with the advances in Internet applications.

Individuals using the Internet per 100 inhabitants by region, 20196  To better harness the value created through this economic system and achieve  more inclusive growth, smart business models also have to consider how they  can engage less sophisticated users who use only basic features of the Internet,  like  communication  channels.  Moreover,  in  the  current  era  of  the  digitally  shrinking  world,  more  significant  work  in  harnessing  the  potentials  of  the  information society through higher digital financial inclusion for the previously  underserved regions like that of Africa and minimizing the digital gender gap  is  crucial  by  the  digital  financial  inclusion;  we  mean  affordable  and  ease  of  virtual access to financial services. Such regions are also prone to a significant  gender  disparities  in  access  to  digital  services   we  will  discuss  this  further  later under the “Digital Economy in the Developing Regions” section of this  chapter .

International trade in digitally deliverable services as a percentage of total trade  in services by region7  As this collaborative form of value creation emerges, the economic system  gets complicated and becomes prone to many serious problems that hamper  its  efficiency.  Some  of  the  challenges  and  uncertainties  in  this  economic  system include central point of failure, blockade of platforms, privacy risks,  security and operational risks  fraud, cybercrime, and operational outages ,  lack of trust resulting from the information asymmetry, risk of default, usury  and systemic financial risks due to liquidity, and credit risks with the business  cycle  uncertainties.  Apart  from  its  externalities  to  the  traditional  business  models, this economic system also poses a challenge to the government in  enacting  new  rules  and  regulations.  This  trend  also  creates  tension  in  the  labor market resulting in the substitution of the manually performed tasks to  automation. However, scholars in the field argue that the existing trend can  co-exist until the traditional way of operation fades out and the transformation  to  the  new  digital  economy  matures.  According  to  Intuit’s  Future  of  Accountancy  Report   2013 ,  with  the  demographic  shifts  from  the  digital  immigrants to the digital natives, irreversible consumer behavior emerges, and  the transformation of the traditional service sector to the modern digitized  service naturally smooths by itself as the millennials hold the market through  time, and the baby boomers retire. In line with this, in analyzing the pace of  disruption from the digital wave to the banking industry, Marco Marinc argued   7 Source: Author’s extraction based on UNCTADstat, available at https:  unctadstat. unctad.org    7  that  automated  decision-making  in  transaction  lending  techniques  cannot  make human decision-making based on the relational banking soft information  obsolete  Marinc, 2015 . Soft information is contextual and qualitative, which  is difficult to store and transmit impersonally. Such information play important  role for relaxing credit constraints in lending relationships. Soft information  which  a  banker  gains  through  a  front  desk  service,  for  instance,  allows  individual  decision-making  on  physically  observed  information.  However,  a  direct interaction and transmission of soft information is not viable in fintech  solutions which are digital by nature. Online platform-based and app-enabled  lending solutions mainly relay on artificial intelligence and different algorithms  for decision-making  we will go through some of the reputation protocols and  rating mechanisms underlying P2P lending later in this book . Thus, in addition  to hard quantifiable information, frequent and personal contacts with clients  can  help  in  identifying  the  creditworthiness  of  a  client.  For  example,  in  relational banking, a direct interaction history, and in-person experience of  talking  with  a  potential  borrower,  provides  a  signal  that  helps  a  decision- maker in the approval process. Marinc’s argument is based on the grounds  that a game of incomplete information, such as a poker game, is much more  difficult for computers to master compared to chess, and hence that human  decision-making  surpasses  that  of  automated  actors  when  it  comes  to  strategic decision-making. However, algorithms built in some technologies like  artificial intelligence surpass human decision-making in object recognition and  detection, which can be used for dermatology or lip-reading. Thus, inclusive policy measures and strategies toward the digital transformation  are  needed  in  order  to  harness  the  fruits  of  this  economic  system  fully.  Moreover, at a policy level, in the current era of the digitally shrinking world,  greater  work  in  harnessing  the  potentials  of  the  information  society  and  minimizing the digital gap of all forms is crucial. Lastly, most of the underlying  business models of this economic system are not stress-tested since they are  mostly recent developments.   Monopolistic Digital Platforms:  The Billionaires’ Pulse There  is  a  significant  concentration  of  wealth  created  through  the  digital  economy in the hands of few advanced regions  the United States and China   and  monopolistic  tech  giants   such  as  Microsoft,  Apple,  Amazon,  Google,  Facebook,  Uber,  Airbnb,  Tencent,  and  Alibaba .  In  terms  of  geographic  distribution,  the  United  States  and  China  alone  account  for  about  40%  of  global value-added, 75% of both global distributed ledger technology  DLT   patents and cloud computing market, and about 50% of Internet of Things    8  Chapter 1  Digital Economy and the Information Society   IoT  global spending and generate about 90% of the market cap of the biggest  global digital platforms.8 The digital economy has been referred to as the sharing economy, implying  the collaborative commons under this economic system. For example, today,  thanks to Craigslist, Facebook marketplace, and similar platforms, you can get  a free access to used and brand new items listed by the Internet community  in your neighborhood. This is due to the nearly zero and essentially priceless  access to goods and services which the Web 2.0 economy allowed like never  before. However, the system is not sharing in its core settings. Under this  economic  system,  few  tech  giants  and  digital  platforms  have  proved  to  generate  billions  of  revenues  by  redefining  the  legacy  business  models,  monetizing digital data and aggregating services, and selling them back. Privacy  practice  and  market  control  are  the  main  issues  regarding  the  tech  giants.  Increasing monopolization of the Internet in this regard is a typical example to  mention  Candeub, 2013 . For example, monopolistic digital platforms in the  search engine  Google has about 90% of global market dominance9 , social  media,  and  ads   Facebook  has  about  66%  global  dominance10  and  WeChat  with a pure monopoly of the Chinese market  are some to mention. The tech  giants, according to Forbes, are one of the top 100 companies by market value  in the world. In 2019, Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon.com made up the top  three list in the world with 961.3, 946.5, and 916.1 US billion dollars of market  values,  respectively.  Alphabet   Google ,  Facebook,  Alibaba,  and  Tencent  Holdings followed closely with market values of 863.2, 472.1, 480.8, and 512  billion US dollars, respectively.11 See Figure 1-3.  8 UNCTAD Digital Economy Report 2019 9 Statista, available at www.statista.com statistics 216573 worldwide-market-  share-of-search-engines  10 Statista,  available  at  www.statista.com statistics 272014 global-social-   networks-ranked-by-number-of-users   11 See  Forbes  Top  100  Digital  Companies,  available  at  www.forbes.com top-digital-  companies list tab:rank   9  Figure 1-3.

Strategic service bundling and acquisitions: Digital companies  collude  or  acquire  other  companies  or  startups  to  limit  competition  and  strengthen  their  market  power.  For  example, Facebook acquired several companies, including  Instagram, on April 9, 2012, and WhatsApp on April 19,  2014. Some other technology acquisitions include Fitbit by  Google,  Tableau  and  ClickSoftware  by  Salesforce,  Intel’s  smartphone modem business by Apple, and so on. Antitrust  laws against mergers and acquisitions and anti-competitive  conducts  of  digital  companies  have  been  in  place.  The  Guardian on June 4, 2019, reported Congress’ intention to  investigate  tech  giants   Facebook,  Google,  and  Amazon    12 Source: Author’s extraction based on data from Statista, available at www.statista.com   statistics 272014 global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users    10  Chapter 1  Digital Economy and the Information Society  for “anti-competitive conduct.”13 With the global form of  operation of such digital companies, they face uneven rules  and regulations depending on the region of operation. For  instance, Google, in addition to its US antitrust probes,14 in  the EU, faced three major cases for its shopping comparison  sites ranking, display ads network usage requirements, and  bundling  practice  of  other  Google  apps  with  Android  software  on  phone  makings  that  use  its  software.15  On  March  20,  2019,  the  company  was  fined  a  €1.5  billion  antitrust fine by the EU over the antitrust practices of its  advertising business.16   	 Data-driven  smart  business  models:  As  the  agrarian  economy  relies  on  land,  the  digital  economy  relies  on  data as one asset class that is monetized. Most of the  software  and  Internet  companies’  business  intelligence  relies on free riding digital data, which are extracted for  sale  or  aggregated  to  utilize  in  market  predictions  and  understanding  customers.  In  this  regard,  data  control,  analytical  power,  and  business  intelligence  are  vital  competitive advantages in the knowledge-based economy  of today’s world. Various companies generate revenues  over the Internet by aggregating and providing access to  the  psychographic  and  behavioral  consumer  data  of  product  users,  which  is  fetched  from  major  social  platforms.   	 Emerging  technologies  including  artificial  intelligence,  cloud  computing,  and  machine  learning:  The  big  techs  have  a  massive investment, research, and development toward  emerging technologies that enhance their core business  lines.  13 The  Guardian  News  available  at  www.theguardian.com technology 2019 jun 03  tech-monopoly-congress-increases-antitrust-scrutiny-on-facebook- google-amazon, accessed on May 22, 2020.  14 Ars Technica “Justice Department launches antitrust probe into big tech,” available at  https:  arstechnica.com tech-policy 2019 07 justice-department- launches-antitrust-probe-into-big-tech , accessed on May 22, 2020.  15 Bloomberg Technology, www.bloomberg.com news articles 2019-06-03 google- has-antitrust-playbook-ready-for-doj-after-eu-challenges,  accessed  on  May 22, 2020.  16 The  Verge,  www.theverge.com 2019 3 20 18270891 google-eu-antitrust-fine-  adsense-advertising, accessed on May 22, 2020.   11   	 Size of a digital company and financial resources: The tech  giants  in  the  digital  economy  space  have  a  massive  resource, thus enjoying economies of scale that sustain  their core business lines and further invest in high tech  solutions. These companies also have control of unique  technological infrastructure that is not easily duplicated.  Besides,  they  can  afford  to  invest  huge  money  for  lobbying,  in  policy  battles,  to  influence  government  regulations and curb amendments to their benefit.   Smart Business Models and  Emerging Technologies The digital economic system is shaping the trends in consumption, production,  distribution,  and,  more  generally,  utilization  of  scarce  resources.  Scarce  resources  are  those  resources  that  have  limited  availability  making  them  mostly excludable and of rivalry in ownership. Because of this, some of such  goods and services tend to be overused  hyper-consumption , underutilized,  or  wasted  due  to  a  lack  of  robust  exchange  system  that  can  facilitate  the  exchange of any item of value in an organized way. Thus, technology-oriented  channels have now enabled access to such goods and services in real time. For  instance, think of a car-share platform that enables the sharing of the ride at  a reasonable price. Here, the technology-enabled real-time transaction can  allow a potential client to track available rides to share. The transaction is also  win-win for the driver heading the same way as you with an open empty seat,  while you can save on time, money, and usage of alternative means like public  transport. Another example of this can be the human capital, which is made  easily accessible through the crowdsourcing marketplaces of the collaborative  economy business models. The digital economy is mainly characterized by the  disintermediation of the legacy centralized form of economic system. The rise  of information networks and the advances in information technology have led  to  a  dramatic  shift  in  the  traditional  forms  of  economic  systems  and  organizations. The  peer-to-peer  business  models  underlying  this  economic  system  are  enabled by the digital platforms that facilitate direct peer-to-peer transactions.  Digitized  online  marketplaces  add  significant  value  to  users  in  terms  of  interactive  and  accessible  transactions  through  mobile  apps,  online  marketplaces with a large network of global players, and reduced transaction  costs. Ecommerce marketplaces are typical examples of features of the digital  economic system. The  service  sector  of  this  economy  is  booming  with  the  catalyzing  advancements  in  digital  technology.  For  example,  video  conferencing  and  streaming and online collaboration portals without a need for a face-to-face    12  Chapter 1  Digital Economy and the Information Society  contact have eased the access to education. Also, the traditional healthcare  sector  is  affected  by  the  availability  of  remote  diagnosis,  drug,  and  other  treatment mechanism’s advertisement and the sharing of patient experience  through electronic health records. The same is true in the broadcasting and  media sector with vast social media networks and user-generated content. In addition to self-publishing, free digital content generation  such as video on  demand,  OTT   over-the-top   delivery,  and  streaming  media ,  and  online  blogging,  digital  companies  like  Facebook’s  and  Google’s  ads  models  have  disrupted  the  classified  ads  and  subscription-based  revenues  of  the  news  outlets.  For  example,  amid  the  media  industry  disruption,  some  of  the  Canadian  news  outlets  had  recently  called  for  tax  and  regulatory  changes.  Some  of  these  news  outlets  include  the  National  Post  of  the  Postmedia,  Toronto Star, SaltWire Network, and the CBC of the Torstar.17 In coping with  digital waves, according to Forbes 2019 Insights survey of 700 executives, only  25% of enterprises in the media and entertainment industry made “meaningful”  progress in their digital transformation.18 Data-driven decision-making is another development in the digital economic  system. A significantly large number of global users flood the economic system  through their digital presence. According to the UNCTAD 2019 report,19 there  is an estimate of about 150,700GB of global IP traffic per second by 2022. Here,  digital footprints of users from the digital world are inputs for the current smart  business models. These data are mainly used to understand target customers  and markets and further design better and develop customer-centric products. Ease  of  doing  business  as  a  digital  entrepreneur  is  affected  by  the  area  of  operation. Local startups in different regions are prone to different rules and  regulations  and  infrastructural  developments  depending  on  their  areas  of  operation.  UNCTAD’s  eTrade  Readiness  Assessments  of  Land-Locked  Developing Countries 2019 report20 shows that infrastructure, ecommerce  strategies,  and  legal  frameworks  are  the  main  constraints  for  digitized  economic activities. At the core of the major developments that backed the smart business models  are emerging technologies. Today, the parade of newly emerging technologies  such as artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, big data and analytics, machine   17 The National Post on February 19, 2020, reported news stating “‘The news industry is  in trouble’: Canadian media outlets team up to demand tax and regulatory changes,”  available  at  https:  nationalpost.com news canada the-news-industry-is-in-  trouble-canadian-media-outlets-team-up-to-demand-tax-and-regulatory- changes  18 Forbes,  September  12,  2019,  www.forbes.com sites awsmediaandentertain- ment 2019 09 12 how-to-thrive-in-todays-disrupted-media-markets   752eac2370ed  19 UNCTAD Digital Economy Report 2019 20 https:  unctad.org en pages PublicationWebflyer.aspx?publicationid=2590   13  learning, mobile applications and the Web, autonomous vehicles, and financial  technologies,  including  cryptocurrencies,  blockchain,  and  distributed  ledger  technologies, and robotics are reshaping the business world. Personalized and  customized  services,  tailored  applications,  and  data-driven  decision-making  are  now  shaking  the  business  tree  that  was  long  rooted  with  rotten  and  outdated business applications. At this stage, some of them are in experimental phases without mass adoption.  On the other hand, some of the emerging technologies are a breakthrough in  the  business  world.  For  example,  McKinsey  reported  that,  by  2030,  AI  adoption is expected to raise global GDP by about $13 trillion.21 The report  also highlighted that industries actually are less than 40% digitized in which  there  still  are  further  developments  to  see  in  the  digital  economy  as  the  mainstream emerging tech solutions are adopted at a scale. The potentials,  however, are immense and exhilarating that these technologies are disruptive  to  the  legacy  system.  A  typical  example  of  AI  solutions  includes  the  IBM  Cognos  Analytics,22  Aviso,23  Beyond  Limits,24  and  more.25  A  number  of  businesses are now deploying the IBM Cognos Analytics, AI-enabled business  intelligence platform that visualizes and analyzes data and provides insights.  The solutions such technologies provide to your business create innovative  opportunities to tap into new potentials. Thus, identifying how these emerging  technological solutions could fit into your business is a strategic decision to  make in digital transformation or a formation of new businesses today.

Trust, in the business context, refers to the act of value exchange fairly and  equitably stating the level of confidence an individual puts on their business  partner. This implies that a business confidence, trust, emanates from a robust  bridge of asymmetric information, which is built through a repeated interaction.  Generally speaking, trust depends on the degree of risk involved in a particular  set of transactions. This can be supported by the reputation of the business  partner regarding trustworthiness. A simple example could be the two-sided  rating scheme in the ride-hailing platforms like Uber and Lyft, where riders or  drivers with poor ratings were those with a rough ride-share experience and  in some cases subject to criminal acts.26 On May 29, 2019, The Verge reported  that Uber had taken a measure toward deactivating accounts of riders with  below  average  ratings.27  Accordingly,  reputation  is  one  of  the  most  highly  valued assets in the current era of the digital economy, and it is considered as  the currency of the digital ecosystem  Owyang et al., 2013 . In an eBay-like  online marketplace, sellers’ reputation affects the demand for their products  and acceptance rate of the BIN price  buy-it-now price  offered by them, in  which case highly reputed sellers have more acceptance by the buyers than  the less reputed ones. For instance, let’s say there are two sellers who are  selling the exact brand of toaster you want to buy. One seller has a five-star  rating with 1000 positive reviews. The other seller has a three-star rating with  500 reviews. You would probably choose to buy from the five-star seller over  the three-star. Likewise, buyers’ credibility both in their bids and customer  loyalty depends on their reputation in the market. Economic theories with a  motive to capture the dynamics of trust construction between collaborating  agents  have  suggested  many  game-theoretic  analyses   e.g.,  Fudenberg  and  Levine,  1992;  Friedman  and  Resnick,  2001;  and  Dellarocas,  2003 .  See  Figure 1-4.  26 www.theguardian.com us-news 2020 feb 06 uber-rideshare-lyft-safety-crime 27 www.theverge.com 2019 5 29 18644143 uber-deactivate-rider-below-   average-rating   15  Figure 1-4.  Feedback loops in the data-driven economy: prosumers’ blueprint to data  monetization in supply chain  In  game  theory,  reputation  games  generally  fall  under  the  umbrella  of  the  repeated game  due to the repeated interactions  and Bayesian game structure,  with  the  information  asymmetry   where  one  party  has  more  or  better  information  than  the  other   and  uncertainties  underlying  this  type  of  interaction. This concept has great importance in today’s online marketplaces  and  the  crowd-based  business  models,  where  information  asymmetry  and  uncertainties  are  one  of  the  key  problems.  Online  marketplaces  like  eBay,  Yahoo!  Auctions,  Alibaba  Group,  Amazon.com,  LendingClub,  Kickstarter,  Prosper Marketplace, and so on suffer from significant issues of trust. These  markets are commonly characterized by a repeated transactional interaction  between a number of rational long-run  mostly sellers  and short-run players   buyers with mostly one-time transactions with a single seller  in a sequence  of continuous transactions. In online communities, giving feedback is commonly voluntarily. Since feedback  is privately examined and subjectively valued, it is one of the underprovided  economic  goods.  Provided  this,  some  reputation  models  utilizing  game- theoretic modeling approaches have been proposed, with an assumption that  player’s  types  are  defined  by  their  past  record  and,  hence,  committed  to  honesty  Stackelberg action  with the expectation of their future reputation.    16  Chapter 1  Digital Economy and the Information Society  This is sound theoretical modeling. However, the question of how an efficient  reputation mechanism should be designed so that it can depict the real player’s  type  is  not  addressed.  Therefore,  there  should  be  an  efficient  reputation  mechanism that can guarantee trust within the market and make it efficient.  The literature proves that, in repeated simultaneous or sequential games, a  long-run player who is patient takes a Stackelberg action with high probability;  see Fudenberg and Levine  1992 . This thus guarantees the proper operation  of a reputation game between a long-run and a short-run player  or between  both long-run players with less frequent interactions  provided that it is well  designed. In line with this, Dellarocas’ game-theoretic model shows that, with  a reputation effect, honest collaboration is the best strategy for the long-run  sellers and short-run buyers in an eBay-like online marketplace setting. Despite several arguments in the analysis of the dynamics of trust in online  marketplaces, key questions aimed to address the prior objective of efficient  market development and design remain unanswered. Any protocol designed  to guarantee trust in a given transactional network should be able to capture  the  dynamics  in  the  real  individual  players’  behavior  and  must  be  attack- tolerant in a way that sticks the evolving agents to a given equilibrium outcome.  Attacks  to  be  tolerated  include  whitewashing,  identity  changes   new  pseudonym , fraud, strategic manipulation of reputations, retaliation effects,  and so on. In order to attain this, the mechanism should be designed in such  a way that it optimizes the respective utilities of players. Hence, there is a  need for defining case-specific reputation mechanisms and adapting efficient  incentive punishment schemes that commit all the players to collaborate in a  self-enforcing and decentralized way. To sum up, even if the collaborative economy is a promising economic system  in a robust and cost-effective utilization of scarce resources, the effectiveness  in  its  undertakings  still  is  questionable.  In  this  regard,  being  commonly  operated in the form of web-based collaborations, the issue of building trust  between the collaborating agents is one of the open areas of research as the  collaborative economy grows and expands its applications. We’ll take a deeper  look at the underlying business models of the collaborative economic system  in Chapter 2.   Reputation Management in Online Transactions In this era of collaborative economy, reputation is a highly valued asset that  can  be  considered  as  the  currency  of  peer-to-peer  systems.  Information  asymmetry is one of the underlying factors that calls for an efficient reputation  mechanism that narrows the information gap between collaborating agents.  However, the nature, reliability, and dissemination mechanism of information  define  the  efficiency  of  a  reputation  protocol  to  be  adopted  for  a  given  network. Chen et al.  2004  compared in their experimental study different    17  reputation mechanisms based on the level of information and self-reporting.  Accordingly, they defined a trust value in a range [0, 1], where trust values of  1, 0, and 0.5 represent complete trust, distrust, and uncertainty, respectively.  Buskens   2002 ,  on  the  other  hand,  argues  that  the  number  of  links  in  a  network explains why agents trust more one network than another, while the  number of links of an agent explains why another agent trusts this agent more  than the others in the same network. These metrics allow developing control  and learning behavior on the agents that continually interact. Many other scholars have suggested a mechanism for building trust in a given  network  ranging from Kamvar et al.  2003  to Collier and Hampshire  2010   and Donato et al.  2007  . More recent work by Domingo-Ferrer et al.  2016b   suggests a distributed and co-utile way of computing the agents’ reputation.  This  mechanism  has  the  attractive  properties  of  being  attack-tolerant,  anonymous,  cost-effective,  and  computed  in  a  self-enforcing  decentralized  way. The reputation mechanisms currently at play in the market are subject to  tampering attacks and can be personalized to the peers’ benefit, rather than  truthfully  reporting  on  a  target  agent.  Because  P2P  lending  implies  the  interaction between rational agents, the reputation protocol that operates in  the market should be self-enforcing in order to be rationally sustainable; in  this way, each agent would have incentives to compute values in such a way  that it can truly measure the creditworthiness and honesty of all other agents.  Hence,  making  a  reputation  protocol  self-enforcing  and  beneficial  for  all  involved agents will guarantee that it is in the best interest of each agent in the  system to compute another agent’s reputation as accurately as possible. A  further direction of work in designing a reputation protocol is to take a stride  toward merging the outcome-based reputation and also the social reputation   using state-of-the-art social media, like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram posts,  or LinkedIn connections in which a bunch of personal data are available  and  market-related reputation  such as Amazon or eBay purchases and credit card  expenses, or length of phone calls . For example, one of the key problems underlying the ecommerce market is  the lack of trust between transacting agents. This is due to the uncertainties  and  information  asymmetry  problems  underlying  these  marketplaces.  As  a  result, these platforms employ various feedback mechanisms that help build  trust  between  the  transacting  agents.  Nevertheless,  these  reputation  mechanisms have their pitfalls apart from being managed in a centralized way.  In the eBay reputation system, there is evidence of the correlation between  buyer and seller feedback, suggesting that the players reciprocate and retaliate   i.e., a bad review from a buyer will lead to a bad review from the seller in  return and vice versa ; see Bolton et al.  2013 , Cabral  2012 , and Resnick  and Zeckhauser  2002 . The question is, how exactly can an eBay bidder use  a seller profile to determine how much to bid, and whether to bid for it at all?  In  this  regard,  Aberer  and  Despotovic   2004   argue  that  game-theoretic  reputation systems, which give the equilibrium of the feedback game, can help    18  Chapter 1  Digital Economy and the Information Society  handle  the  problem  of  seller  identification,  provided  that  the  players  are  rational utility-maximizing agents. However, this method of modeling is limited  in capturing the dynamics of online platforms, because there is commonly an  interaction of a long-term player  e.g., seller  with multiple short-term players   e.g., buyers . Thus, due to its practical limitations in capturing the reality on  the  ground  and  quantifying  players’  discount  factors  and  the  discounting  criteria, it is not standardized. The subjective nature of feedback is commonly avoided by a scoring method  based on a set of values for random variables representing the feedback  eBay  feedback score and the detailed seller ratings . Another method suggested is  clustering  and  filtering  of  the  feedback  scores  according  to  their  common  features in order to capture the heterogeneities among individual raters  e.g.,  Amazon feedback and ratings . Yet collusive behavior, Sybil attacks  a malicious  multiple  pseudonym  creation  to  subvert  a  reputation  system  through  a  majority  rule   and  biased  ratings  deviate  online  ratings.  As  a  result,  the  reputation score aggregation mechanism for the online markets is an open  research question. Moreover, cross-validating malicious reporting and whether  enough  feedback  is  solicited  depends  on  the  underlying  incentive  scheme  under the feedback mechanism. Feedback systems in ecommerce marketplaces are important, especially with  the  underlying  information  asymmetry  and  market-related  risks.  They  help  create  a  fair  and  efficient  marketplace.  Hence,  an  efficient  reputation  mechanism  can  allow  us  to  sort  out  malicious  buyers bidders  and  sellers  within the transactional network of this market. The reputation mechanism  helps sort out malicious buyers bidders by imposing buyer requirements in  the marketplace to those with policy violations, retaliation feedback motive,  unpaid items  after placing a winning bid or purchase order , or fraudulent  payments. An incentive scheme for the buyers is that being positively reputed  helps them to be identified and benefit from the loyal customers’ benefit and  rewards. A buyer with a negative reputation can encounter limits on account  privileges  such privileges in the eBay, e.g., include eBay Money Back Guarantee  and discount and reward offers, Gift Cards & Coupons, non-cash eBay Bucks  customer rewards program  greater or equal to $5 in the form of an eBay  Bucks Certificate to qualifying buyers   or the Amazon Prime  a paid service  that gives buyers a few distinct advantages like free shipping . The reputation  mechanism should be designed in such a way that it clearly identifies loyal  customers in the transactional network with these incentive schemes under  consideration. Negative ratings result in a limit on these privileges or overall  buying activity and account suspension in the extreme case. On the other  side, selling performance measures can be used to rate the reputation scores  of  the  sellers  in  the  transactional  network.  These  measures  include  defect  rate  item description accuracy , late shipment rate  item delivery , shipping  and  handling  charges,  communication,  and  cases  closed  without  seller  resolution.   19  For  example,  let  us  have  a  look  at  eBay’s  rating  mechanism   Table  1-3 .  eBay  employs two main feedback mechanisms to bridge the gap resulting from the  information  asymmetry  and  build  trust  between  transacting  individuals  in  the  network. These are the feedback score  FS  and the detailed seller rating  DSR   The FS method uses aggregation of positive, negative, or neutral rating values for  sellers and positive rating values for buyers which later are aggregated to compute  each individual seller’s buyer’s reputation from the transaction records in every  one week. On the other hand, DSR is used as a descriptive index of individual  seller’s reputation which is computed one star  lowest  to five stars  highest  and  the average ratings for a seller are computed once every 12 months for each  seller with a minimum of five rating records for the months under consideration.  Table 1-3.  The eBay stars and their ratings  Seller’s Star Rating Yellow star  Number of Feedback for a Seller 10 to 49  Blue star  Turquoise star  Purple star  Red star  Green star  Yellow shooting star  Turquoise shooting star  Purple shooting star  Red shooting star  Green shooting star  Silver shooting star  50 to 99  100 to 499  500 to 999  1000 to 4999  5000 to 9999  10,000 to 24,999  25,000 to 49,999  50,000 to 99,999  100,000 to 499,999  500,000 to 999,999  Over 1 million positive feedback  In the eBay rating scheme, the feedback score is positively correlated with the  number of positive ratings indicated by the color of the star from yellow star   for aggregated score of 10–59  up to a silver shooting star  for an aggregated  score greater than 1 million . Yet, as the feedback score is an aggregation of  all the negative, positive, and neutral scores a player in the market has, this  way of rating can be biased with size of the transactional network a player in  the market has. For instance, consider that two different sellers A and B have  1000  and  100,000  number  of  transactional  networks,  respectively.  Assume  that from all the transaction records, each has 10% negative ratings and 90%  positive  ratings.  According  to  eBay’s  feedback  computation,  even  if  both  sellers have a proportional record of feedback, seller A will be a purple star,  while seller B will be a purple shooting star with the scale effect. The other  limitation with this method of computation is that it takes longer time to    20  Chapter 1  Digital Economy and the Information Society  update  every  transactional  outcomes,  aggregating  every  week’s  transaction  record with one individual into one feedback score regardless of the number  of transactions in that specific week. Hence, this reputation mechanism fails  to capture the real transactional behavior of the players in the network. Given  the  strategic  nature  of  feedback  giving,  in  which  users  retaliate  and  reciprocate, a co-utile reputation mechanism could be more efficient  Turi  et al., 2017 . A co-utile reputation mechanism is different from the conventional  method of sequential approach in eBay or the simultaneous or blind feedback  giving  method  proposed  by  Bolton  et  al.   2013 .  This  mechanism  helps  compute individual user’s reputation fairly based on a global reputation, which  is derived from the normalized weighted local reputation scores. Turi et al.   2016  argue that reciprocity equilibrium can lead to a co-utile outcome for  positive reciprocity, provided that the outcome is Pareto-optimal and results  in strictly greater payoff to the players. Therefore, reciprocal feedback can be  co-utile feedback. Yet, favoring one another in a reciprocal setting might lead  to a biased reputation system at an aggregate level. Hence, the aggregation  mechanism  should  be  designed  in  such  a  way  that  it  gives  weight  for  each  individual transaction in the network. Some  of  the  common  problems  in  the  online  market  is  that  it  is  global  in  nature and hence difficult to enact global standard rules and regulation and as  a result hard to make efficient contractual agreements. The other is information  asymmetry and hard for identification with a volatile and possibly unstable  pseudonym operation. Zero marginal cost pseudonyms complicate transaction  in  the  online  marketplaces.  Friedman  and  Resnick   2001   proposed  two  mechanisms  to  cope  with  this  problem:   1   cryptographic  verification  of  unique identities of each member with a protocol that uses blind signatures  and  2  a transactional network structure with unprofitable exit and re-entry  setting  through  a  new  entry  fee   or  implicit  cost  of  an  initial  reputation  building  that offsets the gain from any potential exit and re-entry. The co-utile  reputation  mechanism  proposed  in  Turi  et  al.   2017   employs  the  second  mechanism by setting zero reputation scores for all new and malicious players  with an intention to disincentive whitewashing. Setting zero reputation  the  worst possible reputation  to new entrants in online marketplaces is proved  to be the most reasonable mechanism to punish malicious players re-entering  the market with a new pseudonym  see also Dellarocas, 2003a . Hence, from our discussion, we see that the digitization of everything in the  collaborative  economy  including  finance,  service  delivery,  and  goods  and  services  trading  and  understanding  this  dynamics  doesn’t  merely  rely  on  traditional  economic  theory-based  analysis.  Instead,  a  multidisciplinary  approach,  including  computer  science,  information  systems,  management  science, and psychology, has to be in place. The science of building trust calls  for varied insights from computer science, information systems, management  science, and psychology beyond the conventional microeconomic and game- theoretic human behavior modeling.   21   Some Digital Companies and  Their Business Models The most common business models for digital companies include commission  or  brokerage  fees,  subscription  plans,  service  usage–based  fees,  selling  and  rental of goods and services, ads display  web advertising model , and license  sells for software products.28 In this section, we’ll discuss a selection of digital platforms and their business  models, including retail ecommerce platforms, hospitality and transportation  platforms based on Uberification, search engine companies like Google, and  startups based on Fintech solutions.   Retail Ecommerce Platforms Ecommerce  has  allowed  the  sale  of  goods  and  services  online  across  geopolitical borders. In 2019, about $3.5 trillion is globally spent in ecommerce  transactions  see Table 1-4 .  Table 1-4.

In this section, we will have  a closer look at the business models of three sample ecommerce marketplaces   Amazon, Alibaba, and Shopify .   Amazon Amazon  is  an  online  retailer  of  goods  and  services.  To  generate  revenue,  Amazon  relies  on  a  hybrid  business  model  of  commission  or  brokerage,  subscription plans, selling and rental of goods and services, and advertising.  According to Statista,30 the company generated total net sales of about $87.44  billion during the fourth quarter of 2019. Amazon  sells  goods  online  with  inventory  in  its  local  warehouses.  The  company also operates by providing an online platform for selling new and  used  goods  and  services  with  other  partner  retail  companies  and  retains  commission for listings on its platform. In its cloud business, Amazon Web Services  AWS , the company provides  on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individual and institutional  customers. Virtual computers  Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud  is one of the  services provided by AWS. AWS accounted for 13% of the company’s revenue  in the first quarter of 2019. Also, it hosts advertising services on its highly  visited site. Another revenue source is from its Kindle Store for eBooks. With the growing  independent eBook publishing market, the company has managed to generate  significant revenue from the sales of eBooks on Kindle. This business model  has helped the company to be a dominant player  with 67% market share in  201931  in the eBooks market. Through its Amazon Prime service, the company also uses subscription plans  that allow members to stream movies, TV shows, and music via the Internet,  exclusive shopping deals, and fast product shipping. The company charges a subscription fee of $39.99 per month for a professional  selling plan and free individual subscription plan. In its selling fees, it charges  6% for PCs and 45% for Amazon device accessories. On its per-item fees, it  charges  a  $0.99  fee  for  each  item  sold  by  individual  sellers  and  free  for   30 www.statista.com statistics 273963 quarterly-revenue-of-amazoncom  31 About eBooks at https:  about.ebooks.com ebook-industry-news-feed , accessed   on May 22, 2020.   23  professional sellers. Sellers also pay a referral fee on each item sold on the  site. See Selling on Amazon Fee Schedule for the details.32 The company has secured a competitive advantage in its core business lines.  Brick-and-mortar stores, Alibaba, eBay, and other ecommerce marketplaces  and  video  streaming  sites,  like  Netflix,  are  some  of  the  competitors  in  its  different lines of business. In fostering its competitive advantage in each sphere  of business, the company makes a massive investment in new technologies,  research and development, partnerships, and acquisitions. The company has  acquired or invested in about 128 companies in AI, clothing and accessories,  financial services  fintech , media production and entertainment, publishing,  transportation, and logistics.33 In 2018, the company invested $753 million to  acquire online pharmacy, PillPack. With interest in healthcare, Amazon has  partnered with Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase. In transportation,  self-driving car investments have been reported34  e.g., startup called Aurora,  electric truck startup Rivian . With its project Kuiper, Amazon plans to set up  to offer broadband access from orbit with 3236 satellites to expand a global  high-speed Internet access.35   Alibaba Alibaba is a dominant ecommerce player in China, with about 58% market  share. Alibaba has four business models which we will briefly discuss in this  section. It operates through its three main web portals: Alibaba.com, Taobao,  and Tmall, to facilitate transactions between buyers and sellers. As of June  2019, the company has 674 million users.36 The first business model is through its Alibaba.com marketplace, where the  company  focuses  on  a  business-to-business   B2B   business  model  of  a  transaction  between  wholesale  suppliers  and  global  retail  distributors.  The  second business model is through its Taobao marketplace, where the company  utilizes eBay and Amazon-like business-to-consumer  B2C  or consumer-to- consumer   C2C   business  model.  The  third  Alibaba’s  business  model  is  through  its  Tmall  marketplace,  where  the  company  facilitates  B2C  online  retail of multinational brands  like Gap, Nike, and Apple  for China’s middle  class.

The fourth business model of Alibaba is through its  financial service, Ant Financial. AliExpress and 1688  online retail , Alimama  advertising platform operating  search  marketing,  display  marketing,  promotion  commission,  and  real-time  bidding utilizing big data , Aliyun  in cloud computing , and Cainiao Network   Chinese Smart Logistics Network  are the other subsidiaries of the company.  According to the Macrotrends, the company’s annual revenue for 2019 was  $56.152 billion, a 40.74% increase from 2018.37   Shopify Shopify  is  a  Canada-based  ecommerce  marketplace  that  enables  sellers  to  commercialize  their  products  on  its  cloud-based  platform.  It  uses  a  subscription-based business model. As of early 2020, sellers pay a monthly  subscription of basic  $29 , Shopify  $79 , and advanced  $299  plans to access  the Shopify tools and resources. Unlike Amazon, eBay, or Alibaba’s business  models,  the  Shopify  platform  is  a  specialized  ecommerce  platform  that  provides sellers with the tools to build and promote their web-based stores  of a unique brand. This mimics the traditional shop rentals in a commercial  building.  As  of  2019,  the  platform  hosts  about  820,000  online  stores   SimilarTech, 2019 . Its business model is ideal for unique branding of any size   e.g., Tesla and Red Bull are some of the big brands with online stores on  Shopify . In addition to the subscription fees, it has third-party apps in its App Store.  Adding third-party apps can increase your monthly costs. Shopify also supports a payment gateway called Merchant e-Solutions, which  provides  a  global  payment  processing  offering  an  automated  billing,  mobile  payment, real-time transaction results, web-based reporting, PCI compliance,  and  fraud  management.38  In  the  third  quarter  of  2019,  Shopify  Merchant  Solutions generated about $225.0 million in revenue from payment processing  fees of Shopify Payments, Shopify Shipping, Shopify Capital, transaction fees,  referral  fees,  and  sales  of  point-of-sale  hardware.39  According  to  Investors. shopify, the company generated a total of $390.6 million revenues in the third  quarter of 2019, of which $165.6 million is from the subscription solutions.40  37 Macrotrends,  www.macrotrends.net stocks charts BABA alibaba revenue,  accessed   on March 20, 2020.  38 www.shopify.com payment-gateways united-states merchant-e-solutions 39 Marketplace   www.marketplacepulse.com stats shopify shopify-mer-  Pulse,   chant-solutions-revenue-131, accessed on May 22, 2020.  40 Shopify financial data available at https:  investors.shopify.com Investor-News- Details 2019 Shopify-Announces-Third-Quarter-2019-Financial-Results  default.aspx, accessed on March 20, 2020.   25   Uberification The millennial era is characterized by an intense usage of mobile devices and  increased screen times. A survey on the screen time shows that, on average,  people in the United States check their phone every 12 minutes.41 According to  the Statista, as of 2019, there are 3.2 billion global smartphone users42 and that  by 2023 the global mobile app revenues are expected to hit $935.2 billion.43 The  ride-sharing company, Uber, took the mobile web revolution a step forward by  redefining  the  transportation  service  through  on-demand  service  provision  based on mobile applications. Uberification refers to the provision of services  based on Uber’s business model of app-enabled mobile services. Without the  need to own the product, Uber and similar companies  like Airbnb  have derived  a massive chunk of revenue by creating digital platforms that connect service  providers and customers. Similarly, online food orders and delivery platforms like  Uber Eats and SkipTheDishes facilitate instant access to food orders and delivery  from  local  restaurants.  The  mobile  app-enabled  business  model  is  booming.  According to App Annie, there were about 194 billion App downloads in 2018.44  Thus, in today’s competitive business environment, capturing the customer base  of mobile users by building a mobile app is a vital business strategy as building a  website. To help us understand the core of this business model, we will have a  closer look at two of the biggest companies utilizing this, Uber and Airbnb.   Uber Through its online platform and smartphone App, Uber, Uber Technologies  facilitates  on-demand  service  between  users  and  service  providers.  The  company started as a ride-sharing company. Over the years, the tech company  has diversified its products, including Uber P2P ride-sharing  UberPOP , ride  service  hailing   UberPool ,  food  delivery   Uber  Eats ,  electric  bikes  and  scooters, carrier shipping  Uber Freight , aerial electric ride-hailing, air flights   uberAIR Uber Elevate , and helicopter rides  UberCHOPPER . Founded in  2009, the company is one of the disruptive companies in the last decade.45  Uber  is  further  powered  by  its  key  technologies  like  AI,  machine  learning,  robotics, and self-driving vehicles. The San Francisco-based company, Lyft, is  one of its competitors. As of 2019, the company has about 30,000 employees.46  41 https:  nypost.com 2017 11 08 americans-check-their-phones-80-times-   42 www.statista.com statistics 330695 number-of-smartphone-users-   a-day-study   worldwide   43 www.statista.com statistics 269025 worldwide-mobile-app-revenue-forecast  44 www.appannie.com en insights market-data the-state-of-mobile-2019  45 CNBC  ranked  Uber  second  from  the  list  of  2018  CNBC  Disruptor  50  companies,  Disrupting:  Public  transportation,  taxi,  and  limousine  services,  www.cnbc.com 2018   05 22 uber-2018-disruptor-50.html, accessed on May 22, 2020.  46 https:  pitchbook.com profiles company 51136-75   26  Chapter 1  Digital Economy and the Information Society  However, the Uberification business model has been questionable, mainly due  to the employment package such companies offer. On May 8, 2019, Uber and  Lyft  drivers  conducted  a  strike  against  low  wages  and  lack  of  full-time  employment  benefits,  long  hours  of  work,  and  working  conditions.47  The  drivers  were  classified  as  independent  contractors,  which  assumes  the  company is free riding to generate its huge chunk of revenue. As of the third  quarter of 2019, the company generated revenue of $3.8 billion.48 In April 2019, Driverless cars, which is the company’s self-driving unit got  a  $1  billion  investment  from  SoftBank  and  Japan’s  auto  industry   The  Verge .49 However, there still are controversies around driverless cars. One  of the major incidents around this, the autonomous vehicle crash of Tempe,  Arizona, in March 2018, has made the company questionable regarding this  service. Further, major regulatory issues arise around driverless cars, one  of which is the issue of liability in the case of crashes.50   Airbnb Airbnb  facilitates  access  to  local  homes  by  connecting  guests  with  hosts  through its online platform. It operates in more than 190 countries, with 31  offices  around  the  world  and  13,000  employees.  In  2018,  the  multibillion  hospitality tech company is valued at about $38 billion.51 The company follows a crowd-based business model for a hospitality service  where  a  community  of  interested  individuals  interacts  over  its  digital  marketplace. Potential hosts make a listing of places or events on the Airbnb  platform  where  guests  can  make  a  booking reservation.  The  company  generates  revenue  from  fees  for  booking  accommodations  and  Airbnb  experiences  and  also  charges  VAT  on  service  fees.52  Guests  are  charged  a  guest service fee  0–13% depending on the location  for a completed booking  through its platform. In addition, hosts are charged host fees  3% or more  depending on the location  for property or event listing with a completed   47 https:  globalnews.ca news 5254600 uber-lyft-drivers-strike-   declining-wages   48 https:  investor.uber.com news-events news press-release-details 2019  Uber-Announces-Results-for-Third-Quarter-2019 , accessed on March 20, 2020.  49 w w w . t h e v e r g e . c o m   2 0 1 9   4   1 8   1 8 5 0 7 0 4 9   u b e r - a t g - s e l f - d r i v i n g -   autonomous-car-investment-softbank-toyota-denso  50 See ABC for some points on Legal Implications of Self-Driving Vehicle Technology, avail- able  at  www.americanbar.org groups litigation committees business-torts- unfair-competition practice 2018 top-8-legal-implications-of-self-  driving-car-technology-litigation , accessed on May 22, 2020.  51 www.statista.com topics 2273 airbnb  52 See  Airbnb  service  fees  at  www.airbnb.ca help article 1857 what-is-the- airbnb-service-fee?locale=en&_set_bev_on_new_domain=1577510813_vPS6N- 5PQtaytKsO3, accessed on March 20, 2020.   27  transaction. The platform also offers a host-only fee to allow service providers  the control over final prices. Since  its  inception  in  2008,  over  400  million  global  guests  have  used  the  accommodation service through the Airbnb platform.53 Like all other business  of the collaborative economy, Airbnb’s business model is far from perfection.  Some  of  the  issues  around  the  company’s  business  model  are  local  rental  shortages with preferences for Airbnb listings, illegal subletting and safety, and  security concerns resulting from home-sharing services with strangers.54   Google Google is one of the tech giants who free rides the Internet through its online  ad-based  business  model.  The  company’s  hybrid  business  model  aggregates  multiple business lines across sectors of publication, mail, music, and broadcasting  industries  beyond  its  advertising  networks  and  cloud  services  business.  The  company’s  prominent  business  model  is  the  bundling  of  online  advertising  technologies with its search engine service. In its search engine, the company  has formed a co-utile form of value creation. That is, global users can access its  search engine for free whose data then becomes the input for the targeted ads.  It leverages its search algorithm to process queries and aggregate users’ data. Data-driven  decision-making  is  at  the  core  of  today’s  knowledge-based  economy. The global IT spending for 2019 is about $3.76 trillion with data  centers  and  enterprise  software  spending.55  Users’  psychographic  and  behavioral data, which are fetched and aggregated, are also used for intelligent  business decision-making and understanding of markets by businesses. This  has a significant effect on the understanding of customers and markets, design  communications,  product  development,  and  branding  strategies   Caulkins  et al., 2018; Kregor et al., 2018; and Sleep et al., 2019 . Beyond its ad-based business model, Google also provides cloud computing   a.k.a.  on-demand  computing   and  data  storage  services  for  users  and  enterprises. The tech giant is one of the most prominent cloud vendors like  Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and IBM. AI, IoT, and analytics are  the leading technologies the company relies on. Furthermore, Apps, in-app  purchases,  Google  Play  Store  contents   music,  books,  movies,  TV  shows,  news,  and  magazines ,  and  software  and  hardware  products  are  the  other   53 www.alltherooms.com analytics airbnb-ipo-going-public-revenues-   business-model-statistics   54 A survey on 1021 Airbnb horror stories shows uncovered various unchecked dangerous  loopholes  and  scams  around  the  short-term  rental  platform,  www.asherfergusson. com airbnb , accessed on May 22, 2020.  55 www.gartner.com en newsroom press-releases 2018-10-17-gartner-says-   global-it-spending-to-grow-3-2-percent-in-2019   28  Chapter 1  Digital Economy and the Information Society  revenue sources of Google. The multibillion tech giant generated about $45.8  billion in revenues in the fourth quarter of 2019, of which the majority comes  from its ads business.56 In 2018, its Google website revenue alone was $136  billion,  which  is  the  largest  share  of  the  revenue  of  its  parent  company,  Alphabet.57 Data privacy and security, antitrust, search result manipulations, and censorship  are  some  of  the  issues  around  its  business  environment.  Still,  with  less  sophisticated users of the Web, the data privacy issue remains a dilemma. The  black box problem around the AI tech it uses for decision-making is another  concern which the company pitched to resolve through Explainable AI:58  People say they want privacy, but their actions indicate that they do not  really care about it. Although many people say they dislike companies  tracking their locations, “everyone loves this feature of Google Maps that  tells you how long it will take to get home.”  —Hal Varian, Google’s chief economist 59   Fintech Fintech refers to technological solutions for financial services. Some of the  major services offered with these technological solutions include underwriting,  lending, transaction banking, asset management, mortgages, financial planning  and management, and portfolio management, payments, currency exchanges,  insurance, credit rating, digital currency, capital management, investment, and  more.  AI,  machine  learning,  distributed  ledger  technologies   such  as  Blockchain , and data analytics are at the core of fintech developments. Fintech  solutions also power online businesses and ecommerce. These technological  solutions, mostly run by startups, are disruptive to the traditional banking and  financial  sectors.  Annual  review  by  McKinsey   2015   reported  that  60%  of  global  banking  profits,  mostly,  consumer  finance,  mortgages,  SME  lending,  retail  payments,  and  wealth  management,  are  at  risk  from  these  market  entrants  with  disruptive  technologies.  By  2023,  the  market  is  expected  to  reach  $305.7  billion,  of  which  payment billing  solutions  take  the  highest  share.60 There are about 12,211 global fintech startups with a high concentration  in the United States.61 Some of these fintech companies include Betterment  and Wealthfront, Venmo, Robinhood, Ant Financial, Motif Investing, Xoom,   56 www.statista.com statistics 267606 quarterly-revenue-of-google  57 www.statista.com statistics 266206 googles-annual-global-revenue  58 www.bbc.com news technology-50506431, accessed on May 22, 2020. 59 https:  fortune.com 2018 10 30 data-regulation-tech-industry ,  accessed  on   May 22, 2020.   29  2iQ Research, ZestFinance, Credit Karma, CommonBond, Kabbage, Tesorio,  iDGate  and  QxBranch,  SoFi,  Square,  Stripe,  LOYAL3,  Atom  Bank,  and  MaxMyInterest. In addition, already-established IT companies like Facebook,  Apple Pay, Android Pay, and Google Wallet are also actively involved in the  money  transfer  markets  and  mobile  payments.  Here,  the  top  48  venture  capital-backed fintech companies are valued at about $187 billion.62 The top  ten of the leading Fintech innovators for 2019, according to KPMG, are Ant  Financial   China ,  Grab   Singapore ,  JD  Digits   China ,  Gojek   Indonesia ,  Paytm  India , Du Xiaoman Financial  China , Compass  United States , Ola   India , Opendoor  United States , and OakNorth  United Kingdom .63 Mobile  technology,  digital  transformation,  and  users’  digital  preference  have  contributed to the fintech innovation diffusion. According to Ernst & Young,  64% of global consumers have at least once used fintech-powered platforms,  and 96% of them are aware of at least one fintech service.64 The market is  growing at a fast pace, with significant investments across different sectors.  Partnering  with  fintech  startups  and  embedding  fintech  solutions  into  a  business  has  become  a  vital  competitive  strategy  for  businesses.  In  2018,  there were a total of $111.8 billion global funding deals for fintech,65 and in the  second quarter of 2019, fintech investment topped about $8.3 billion.66   Digital Economy in the Developing Regions About 50% of the world’s population doesn’t participate in the digital economy  at all  WEF , of which the dominant share goes to the developing regions. In  order  to  have  a  look  at  the  digital  economic  system  from  the  developing  regions’ perspective, we will pick Africa’s nascent digital economy landscape.  In this case, we will discuss the issue of digital financial inclusion in the lens of  the developing countries, specifically Africa, where there is a significant share  of the unbanked population.  60 www.globenewswire.com news-release 2019 04 09 1801702 0 en Global-Fintech-   Market-2018-2023-Market-Set-to-Reach-USD-305-7-billion-by-2023.html  61 www.statista.com statistics 893954 number-fintech-startups-by-region  62 www.cbinsights.com research report fintech-trends-q2-2019  63 https:  home.kpmg au en home insights 2019 11 2019-fintech-100-lead-  ing-global-fintech-innovators.html  64 https:  assets.ey.com content dam ey-sites ey-com en_gl topics bank-  ing-and-capital-markets ey-global-fintech-adoption-index.pdf  65 https:  home.kpmg xx en home media press-releases 2019 02 global-fin-  tech-investment-hits-record-in-2018.html  66 www.cbinsights.com research report fintech-trends-q2-2019    30  Chapter 1  Digital Economy and the Information Society   Africa’s Nascent Digital Economy: Digital Financial Inclusion The share of adults using mobile phones in Sub-Saharan Africa doubled over  the last 5 years, of which a significant amount is unbanked. The region accounts  for the highest mobile money usage in Africa. The barriers to financial service  include lack of ID, little money for banking, and cost and geographic constraint  to access banking services. Moreover, lack of confidence in traditional financial  institutions is one of the other issues. Reports show that about 66% of Sub-Saharan Africa is unbanked  the Global  Findex Database, 2017,67 and World Bank68 . This gap is a potential niche for  mobile  payments  like  the  Kenyan  M-Pesa,  Nigerian  Moneywave,  and  other  fintech solutions. Moreover, the fast pace of mobile subscription allows for a  potential expansion of digital financial inclusion through virtual financial services. Key drivers of digital financial inclusion in Africa are mobile payments, micro- credit, and crowd-based digital business models, DLTs, and cryptocurrencies.  Fintech  waves  have  brought  tech  and  telephone  companies  in  the  credit  market. Social lending apps through smartphones hold a significant potential  in  redefining  and  transforming  the  microfinance  funding  models  in  remote  rural areas and crowded cities of the continent. In the past 5 years, Africa’s digital entrepreneur ecosystem through incubators,  accelerators, and tech hubs has grown tenfold  World Bank . The continent  has the highest rate of mobile subscriptions with about 50% of subscriptions  in  Sub-Saharan  Africa.  This  implies  the  potential  for  leapfrogging  fintech  solutions. Mobile-enabled and web-based platforms by local tech startups are  increasing in the continent. Only 27% of Africa’s population has access to the  Internet,  which  is  only  10%  of  the  global  online  population   World  Bank .  Digitizing government payments, remittances, SME payments, and value chain  payments enables participation in the digital economy and drives progress to  the goal of universal financial access  World Bank . Fintech solutions are playing key roles in extending financial and banking services  to the underserved, thus significantly adding to the global agenda of financial  inclusion. These digital solutions allow affordable and accessible financial services  to  everyone.  The  innovation  diffusion  of  fintech  is  significant  in  emerging  economies  e.g., Indonesia, China, and Kenya . In addition to convenience, the  following features make fintech solutions appealing in emerging economies:   	 Growing mobile subscription and built-in applications: Mobile  money  sector  coverage  in  Western  Africa  is  13  times  larger  than  the  local  banks.  Flutterwave,  the  Nigerian   67 https:  globalfindex.worldbank.org sites globalfindex files 2018-  04 2017%20Findex%20full%20report_0.pdf  68 http:  documents.worldbank.org curated en 719111532533639732 pdf 128850-WP-  AFR-Digital-Access-The-Future-of-Financial-Inclusion-in-Africa-PUBLIC.pdf   31  mobile  payment  system,  recently  partnered  with  the  Chinese  tech  giant  Alipay  for  receiving  payments  for  transactions with its users. This creates the opportunity  for the Nigerian merchants to participate in cross-border  digital economic system.   	 Reduced  service  and  transaction  costs:  For  example,  the  mobile  money,  M-Pesa,  allowed  the  virtual  transfer  of  payments  and  reduced  travel  and  wait  times.  This  payment  solution  has  increased  the  rural  household  incomes of Kenya by up to 30%.   	 Ease of access to credit for SMEs, unlike credit rationing biases  and  high  costs  of  credit  in  traditional  funding  models:  For  example, Alipay provides credit for vendors operating on  the  Alibaba  ecommerce  platform.  Through  service  bundling across its platforms, the Chinese tech giant uses  users’ real-time data; it has built an efficient risk pricing  and functioning financial services. Ant Financial operates  as a virtual financial institution that is subject to regulations.  	 Growing  mobile  phone  subscription  and  Internet  service  coverage:  For  the  unbanked,  mobile  subscription  alone  has replaced the bank account function of basic financial  services like the virtual credit market access to remote  rural areas.   	 Data access for rating and pricing risk and surpassing the  institutional  geographic  constraints  through  virtual  presence  put  fintech  solutions  at  advantage  over  the  traditional  financial  services  in  banking  the  unbanked.  Recently,  the  African  Development  Bank  launched  the  African  digital  financial  inclusion  facility  which  allows  credit  scoring  using  geolocation  data,  contacts,  phone  call  frequency,  and  call  logs.  However,  this  system  of  credit custody comes at the cost of an invasion of users’  privacy.   	 A complementary monetary system: The recent Zimbabwean  hyperinflation  of  300%   IMF69   is  a  good  example  of  a  fiat  currency  collapse.  This  has  led  to  a  multicurrency  system and a near fully digital monetary system. About  90%  of  the  country’s  adults  are  users  of  EcoCash,  the   69 www.imf.org en News Articles 2019 09 26 pr19355-zimbabwe-imf-   staff-concludes-visit-art-consult-discuss-1st-rev-staff-mon-program   32  Chapter 1  Digital Economy and the Information Society  Zimbabwean  digitized  payment  system   Techzim70 .  However, mobile money like EcoCash has been criticized  for  exacerbating  financial  instabilities  in  countries  with  a poor monetary system. EcoCash drained the foreign  currency  in  the  hands  of  the  people  at  a  time  and  misused the cash-in, cash-out, and cash-back services for  selling foreign currencies in demand, resulting in financial  instability concerns in the country  the Financial Times71  and Quartz Africa72 . There is a similar concern around  M-Pesa’s  disproportionate  charges  on  the  smallest  transactions and transaction fee of up to 31% on cross- border payments  usury laws need to be in place . M-Pesa  is a typical example for digital financial inclusion of the  unbanked, where it helped to increase Kenya’s financial  inclusion to 83% from about 27% prior to its inception   2019 Financial Access Household Survey73 .  On the regulatory sphere of the digital economy, P2P regulatory frameworks  of quota restriction requirements and minimization of operational risks and  customer  protection   segregation  of  platform  user  money,  well-ordered  platform cessation, default and debt management, transparent and informative  lending process  are at play. One of the regulatory requirements  e.g., Ethiopia   to operate a P2P lending market is a partnership requirement with traditional  banks and credit agencies facilitating the lending process. Potential risks of  credit default, financial regulation, and supervision, data protection, technology  risk, and reputation risk are at the core of concerns around such virtual trade  and credit services. Financial tech solutions alone are not enough to increase  financial  inclusion.  Rather,  a  well-functioning  payment  system,  physical  and  institutional infrastructure, economic stability  e.g., moderate inflation with  stability  in  fiat  currencies ,  robust  supervisory  and  regulatory  policies,  and  viable consumer protection are required. More specifically, issues to consider in scaling the digital economy in Africa are  pointed out as follows. Primarily, policy reforms to lower entry barriers  e.g.,  telecom, encourage competition and investment  and ensuring competition  and  efficiency  through  fair  access  to  credit  are  still  works  to  be  done.  A  significant  barrier  to  entry  and  red  tape  are  some  of  the  constraints  tech  startups face in Africa. For example, in 2018, Nigeria drafted a policy proposal   70 w w w . t e c h z i m . c o . z w   2 0 1 9   1 0   b a n - o n - c a s h - i n - c a s h - o u t - a f f e c t s -   onemoney-and-telecash-more-than-ecocash   71 www.ft.com content 2078bf62-f9ab-11e9-98fd-4d6c20050229 72 https:  qz.com africa 1321152 zimbabwes-ecocash-mobile-money-crash-   has-people-worried   73 https:  fsdkenya.org publication finaccess2019    33  of shareholder funds that range between $275,000 and $14 million for fintech  startups  licensing.  Uganda’s  free  zone  for  developments  around  digital  solutions, on the other hand, is a step forward in facilitating the innovation  diffusion of fintech solutions. Furthermore, poor infrastructural developments  have  lagged  the  continent  behind  the  fast-growing  global  digital  economy  space.  Global  access  to  digital  financial  services,  continental  payment  infrastructure, and platforms could allow the population to participate in the  global and continental digital economy space. However, only a few governments  are investing in developing digital infrastructure  universal Internet network  coverage,  affordable  Internet,  and  broadband  connectivity ,  services,  skills,  and digital entrepreneurship. Besides, supporting the demand side for higher  innovation  diffusion  is  vital.  Digital  literacy  and  curriculum  design  for  the  lower-end  infrastructural  development  through  innovation  hubs  and  ICT  centers will allow seizing opportunities in the digital world. In the continent  where the majority of the population use mobile and web technologies only  for  checking  email,  making  phone  calls,  and  social  media  presence,  human  capital  investment  enhancing  digital  skills  of  workers  and  entrepreneurs  is  vital to adopt the digital economy at a full scale. Moreover, smartphones are  smart by algorithm, not smart by heart to safeguard users and help in decision- making.  Thus,  digital  financial  literacy  is  also  an  issue  to  be  given  a  huge  concern. To  ensure  a  smooth  and  robust  digital  transformation  is  another  issue  to  consider. In the dynamic digital era, we are adopting the rapid changes and  developments; thus, every company is an education center to continually train  employees for digital skill readiness and effective digital transformation. When  it comes to our global village of the Internet era, thinking big through a digital  single  market  that  resolves  regional  fragmentations  and  interoperability  of  policies  across  the  continent  could  help  in  enhancing  the  nascent  digital  economy  space.  A  well-structured  consumer  protection  system  is  also  important in the digital economy. For example, in the digital financial markets,  less  sophisticated  investors  and  creditors  with  the  urge  of  access  to  loans  participate in financial services of this form. In this regard, there is evidence of  increasing debt with the ease of access to virtual credits at speed. As it has  been the case with the 2008 financial crises of sub-prime lending, banking the  unbaked comes at a cost. Besides, the commodification and monetization of  data is against data privacy and ownership of users. In this regard, Kenya has  passed the EU’s GDPR-inspired laws, while Google has set a limit on lending  apps with a loan repayment period of a month or less. In summary, Africa’s digital economy is a very early stage of development. Yet,  it’s expected that the continent’s growing digital native generation with locally  developed digital solutions and tech startups will make the difference as it  adapts to the new developments in this economic system.   34  Chapter 1  Digital Economy and the Information Society   The Advent of the Digital Era and  Global Regulatory Frameworks Digital transformations in the global economies have called for reviewing and  developing new regulatory frameworks. In this section, I will discuss the main  regulatory practices in the digital economy space. Together with the support  of the developments of the digital economic system, regulatory institutions  are responsible for the advancement of the ICT sectors. Thus, in this disruptive  phase of the digital space, to ensure a fair, competitive, and innovative business  environment  is  one  of  the  main  goals  of  governments.  To  date,  there  are  various rules and regulations in place for the digital economy. As a result, many  tech companies have been subject to fines and penalties for violating the digital  economy  rules  and  regulations  in  place.  Table  1-5  presents  selected  digital  frauds, data breach fines, penalties, and settlements during the past two years.  Table 1-5.

Marketplaces  are  also  filled  with  many  less  sophisticated buyers and investors. Digital frauds, scams, unethical practices,  digital market manipulation and deceptions, fake news, privacy, and security  concerns are some of the issues in the digital economy.74 In addition, whenever  vulnerable people are involved in a value creation process, the law needs to  intercede. Countries follow different approaches to deal with the issues that  arise in this economic system. An initiative called e-consumer.gov has been  launched  in  an  effort  to  protect  global  consumers  and  foster  fair  trade  practices  in  the  digital  economy.  Table  1-6  shows  the  top  ten  complaint  reports between July 1 and September 30, 2019, for companies based in the  United  States,  China,  United  Kingdom,  India,  Canada,  Hong  Kong,  France,  Spain, Poland, and Germany  e-consumer.gov75 .  74 . The issue of illegal sale of human kidneys for auction had been a topic of discussion  around the ecommerce marketplaces, late in 1999. The kidney that was listed on eBay  had  reached  a  bid  of  $5.75  million  until  it  was  removed  by  eBay.

In  order  to  effectively  capture  the  digital  economy,  revisiting  the  existing  regulatory  frameworks is vital. Such a revision should consider private capital, competition,  global and regional interoperability, consumer and data protection, security,  legal intercept, taxation, a public interest, and freedom of innovation  see ICC  Policy Statement, 201677 . One  example  of  the  gap  in  the  digital  economy’s  regulation  is  the  lack  of  robust taxation systems. Multinational company digital tax dodging and base  erosion and profit shifting  BEPS  in the digital economy are common mainly  in developing regions  e.g., Africa, Etter-Phoya et al., 2019  where the tech  giants  operate.  According  to  the  EU  Commission,  on  average,  digital  multinationals  pay  only  9.5%  effective  tax  rate,  which  is  significantly  lower  than the traditional multinationals that pay 23.2%.78 To harness a fair share of  the growing revenues of digital multinationals, the EU Commission proposes  a  digital  single  market  and  interim  taxation.  In  developed  countries,  new  taxation systems are underway for tech companies whose revenue bases are  reliant on their citizens. A digital service tax on digital service provision to   76 Source: e-consumer.gov 77 https:  iccwbo.org publication icc-policy-statement-on-regulatory-   modernization-in-the-digital-economy   78 https:  ec.europa.eu taxation_customs sites taxation files   factsheet_digital_taxation_21032018_en.pdf   37  citizens has now started to be imposed in some countries like Austria  5% ,  Canada  proposed 3% , France  3% , Turkey  7.5% , and the United Kingdom   proposed 2% .79 With a significant concentration of the tech companies in the United States, the  digital taxation system has faced backlashes from the US government which claims  the act an unfair trade practice in defending its tech giants like Apple, Facebook,  Google,  and  other  American  tech  companies.80  There  also  is  growing  digital  taxation  in  Africa,  where  countries  like  Benin,  Kenya,  Tanzania,  Uganda,  and  Zambia imposing taxes on the use of social media81 with expected reforms to levy  a tax on revenues of the multinational tech giants as well.82 Digital taxation on  users is claimed to reduce connectivity, especially in Africa.83 A framework for  international digital taxation can reduce the opportunities for a tax haven in the  digital  economy.  The  recent  framework  on  the  international  agreement  for  a  unified  approach  for  digital  taxation  proposes  new  rules  to  tax  multinational  digital companies.84 Here, tax differentiation across business lines, double taxation,  enforcement, and difficulty of collection of taxes from digital multinationals and  the  absence  of  physical  presence  of  some  digital  businesses  are  some  of  the  challenges for digital taxation. On the other hand, the United States has become  a watchdog for its tech giants as nations press onto the digital service tax.85 The  other  recent  developments  in  the  regulatory  sphere  of  the  digital  economy are the General Data Protection Regulation  GDPR . The GDPR  applies to the 28 European countries calling for a transparent and informed  data access policy. Companies violating the GDPR are subject to a sanction of  up to 4% of their global annual revenues or 20 million euros, whichever is  greater. Until the end of 2019, a total of about $476,401,336 fines have been   79 See the Digital Services Tax: response to the consultation, 2019, available at https:   assets.publishing.service.gov.uk government uploads system uploads  attachment_data file 816389 DST_response_document_web.pdf 80 www.nytimes.com 2019 07 10 business us-france-tariffs.html 81 https:  webfoundation.org 2018 11 how-some-african-governments-are-  keeping-millions-of-citizens-offline ?mc_cid=8c91bc4943&mc_eid=  875484373f  82 “Uganda Plans Reforms to Tap Facebook, Google Advertising Revenue,” Bloomberg Tax,  October 24, 2019, available at https:  news.bloombergtax.com daily-tax-report-  i n t e r n a t i o n a l   u g a n d a - p l a n s - r e f o r m s - t o - t a p - f a c e b o o k - g o o g l e -  advertising-revenue  83 See 2019 Affordability Report at the Alliance for Affordable Internet  A4AI , available at  https:  news.bloombergtax.com daily-tax-report-international uganda-plans-  reforms-to-tap-facebook-google-advertising-revenue  84 See the Public Consultation Document Secretariat Proposal for a “Unified Approach”  under Pillar One, 2019, available at www.oecd.org tax beps public-consultation- document-secretariat-proposal-unified-approach-pillar-one.pdf  85 The New York Times, “As Nations Look to Tax Tech Firms, U.S. Scrambles to Broker a  Deal,”  July  12,  2019,  at  www.nytimes.com 2019 07 12 business economy tech- company-taxes.html   38  Chapter 1  Digital Economy and the Information Society  charged  on  134  violations  across  the  member  states   GDPR  Enforcement  Tracker86 . The United Kingdom, France, Germany, Austria, and Bulgaria are  the top five countries with the highest fines since the implementation of the  GDPR, as of December 2019. On the other hand, there are some disparities in the regulations of the US  digital  economy.  Here,  the  digital  economy  rules  and  regulations  for  data  privacy,  taxation,  and  net  neutrality  are  not  uniform  across  states.  For  example, while 27 states in the United States levy a digital sales tax of 1% to  7%, 23 other states do not levy any.87 The California Consumer Privacy Act   CCPA , effective January 1, 2020,88 is the act for the protection of consumers  based in California. The Act applies privacy and transparency requirements for  consumer data. Unlike the GDPR, the CCPA is not applicable at the federal  level. Moreover, there is discriminatory taxation across digital goods and services.  Accordingly,  a  framework  for  digital  single  market  that  fosters  a  non- discriminatory and uniform regulation of the digital economy across the states  is  crucial   McQuinn  A.  and  Castro  D.,  2019 .  China  follows  a  digital  protectionism approach with data localization and blocking of foreign digital  platforms  including Facebook, Google, and Dropbox . This has protected the  Chinese  tech  giants  from  the  potential  competition  of  the  global  digital  economy space  e.g., Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent . To  survive  the  dynamic  digital  business  environment,  tech  companies  also  need to apply various non-market strategies. One of these is lobbying. In this  regard, lobbying expenses have dramatically increased over the past few years  amid regulatory changes. In order to communicate strategic information to  government officeholders, the tech giants spend billions of dollars in lobbying.  In 2018, Google spent $21.7 million on lobbying.89 According to the Center  for Responsive Politics, in the second quarter of 2019, three of the biggest  tech companies  Amazon.com, Facebook, and Alphabet Inc.  joined the top  lobbying spenders, spending $4.15 million, $4.11 million, and $3.15 million in  lobbying,  respectively.90  The  lobbying  cost  has  been  dramatically  increasing  over  the  years  as  regulatory  interventions  in  digital  platforms  increased.    86 www.enforcementtracker.com  87 See a blog post by Victoria Venn, November 11, 2019, Sales Tax for Digital Goods in the   U.S., available at https:  quaderno.io blog sales-tax-digital-products-us   88 National Law Review, available at www.natlawreview.com article 2019-year-ccpa-   infographic  89 CNBC,  www.cnbc.com 2019 06 09 google-is-techs-top-spender-on-lobbying-  but-facebook-amazon-also-up.html, accessed on May 22, 2020.  90 See  OpenSecrets.org  at  www.opensecrets.org news 2019 07 facebook-google-  amazon-up-lobbying-game , accessed on May 22, 2020.   39  The four big techs  Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google  spent a total of  $27.4  million  on  lobbying  combined  in  2016,  and  this  spending  doubled  in  2018 to about $55 million.91 Summing up, a digital business model that operates over the Web and utilizes  cloud infrastructures should consider and implement the rules to operate in  the dynamic digital non-market environment. Moreover, such business models  should consider data access and processing policies, privacy, and security by  design. On the users’ side, formation of user data unions could help protect  the  data  rights  of  users  in  the  digital  economy  space  and  compensate  or  reduce  free  riding  over  the  monetized  user  data.  The  last  note  is  on  the  choice of the location of cloud server hosts, which is highly dominated by the  US-based  web  hosts,  and  the  accompanying  rules  in  the  host  and  source  countries.   Summary This chapter took a deep look into the digital economy. The digital economy  takes many varied forms, and information technology plays a pivotal role in  enabling  most  of  the  sharing  economy.  Various  online  platforms  enable  connections between people, organizations, and ideas more efficiently than  the traditional ways of communication. This results in new economic, social,  and financial models that further enhance the sharing economy. Information  technology and social media, population growth, growing income disparities,  and the increasing global financial, environmental, and social crises are some  of  the  driving  forces  behind  this  system.  Hence,  through  the  collaborative  economic setting and mainly through the Internet, a means to share and utilize  limited resources in a collaborative way is created. In its raw sense, the digital economy system is governed by the following core  principles: collaboration, empowerment, transparency, humanity, and altruistic  sharing for the common well-being. This economic system is characterized by  the underlying key economic features of sharing, leasing, swapping, selling and  buying, lending, giving, and bartering. With these key transactional features, it  unlocks the idle capacity in the utilization of the scarce economic resources  mainly using, but not limited to, the Internet. Various online platforms enable  connections between people, organizations, and ideas more efficiently than  the traditional ways of communication. This results in new economic, social,  and  financial  models  that  further  enhance  the  sharing  economy.  Financial  technologies, including the business lines of peer-to-peer  P2P  transactions,  crowdfunding and crowdsourcing, innovation, and educational marketplaces,  are  some  of  the  common  structures  of  this  economy.  The  collaborative   91 See Center for Responsive Politics at OpenSecrets.org.   40  Chapter 1  Digital Economy and the Information Society  economy  paradigm  revolves  around  the  core  principles  of  collaboration,  empowerment,  transparency,  humanity,  and  that  of  altruistic  sharing  for  the  common well-being, which results in efficiency with no hyper-consumption.  The emergence of irreversible consumer behavior is one of the catalysts for a  widespread  replication  of  this  system  all  across  the  globe.  This  implies  a  preference shift of the digital society to a new form of utilization of goods and  services.  Moreover,  the  significant  insights  underlying  the  digital  economic  system have facilitated  and benefit from  big data processing. In addition, the Uberification of services across different sectors of the digital  economy following Uber’s business model of app-enabled mobile services has  greatly  facilitated  instant  access  to  economic  resources.  Equal  to  the  collaborative system the digital economic system enabled, as discussed in this  chapter,  this  economic  system  has  also  created  fat  tech  companies  which  exploit the honeypot at a scale. Rifkin  2014 , in his book The Zero Marginal  Cost Society, presents the paradox in the capitalist system and that the invisible  hand  that  has  been  responsible  for  capitalism’s  success  has  led  to  a  new  successor  paradigm  called  the  collaborative  economy.  He  describes  this  collaborative system as a “zero marginal cost society.” Nevertheless, some of  the new business models we came across with this trend have elements of  altruism  and  interest  combined,  which  has  diverted  the  core  principle  underlying the sharing economy with a seed of capitalism embodied in it. In  line with this, some scholars argue that the collaborative economy, which has  initially manifested itself in the form of sharing economy, has the tendency to  be pure capitalism. This economy is characterized by abundant liquidity. PricewaterhouseCoopers  estimated  that,  by  the  year  2025,  transactions  under  this  economy  are  expected to generate about $335 billion at a global level. Despite its abundant  liquidity,  the  collaborative  economy  has  posed  many  challenges  to  the  incumbent  traditional  players  of  the  respective  sectors.  Some  of  these  challenges  include  disrupting  the  incumbent  customer  base  of  traditional  sectors  and  also  making  their  business  models  and  services  obsolete.  Furthermore,  the  service  sector  of  this  economy  is  booming  with  the  catalyzing  advancements  in  digital  technology.  In  the  e-education  service  provision,  for  example,  video  conferencing  and  streaming  and  online  collaboration portals without a need for face-to-face contact have eased the  access  for  global  supplies  and  demand  in  the  sector.  Also,  in  the  e-health  sector,  the  traditional  business  is  hard  hit  by  this  wave,  in  which  remote  diagnosis, advertising of drugs and other treatments, and the sharing of patient  experience through electronic health records are made easy. The same trend  is true in the broadcasting and media sector, where a vast amount of social  media networks and user-generated content is flourishing. On the other way  round, with the new business models, new risks to the collaborative economy  itself arise. These new models are exposed to new challenges and uncertainties  unique to their individual setup. This is mainly due to the dynamic and hasty    41  evolution of the business models in order to cope with the new regulatory  and legal codes and the latest technology-based competition from their fellow  players. Furthermore, this economy, being in its infant stage of development,  poses a challenge to the government, because it is difficult to enact new rules  and regulations coping with the dynamics of the collaborative business models.  This  will  disrupt  the  government’s  revenue  also  with  a  paramount  transformation of the incumbent market players before new rules are enacted.  Another critical thing to point out in this trend of the new economy is the  problem of mistrust between the players within the system itself. This results  from the uncertainties and asymmetric information that exist in most of the  transactions of the digital economy models. The topics covered under this chapter are far from addressing all the issues  arising  in  the  digital  economy.  The  aim  here,  in  general,  is  to  foster  the  application  of  the  digital  economy  and  its  core  principles  through  a  closer  analysis of the underlying business models. Detailed analyses and presentations  of the main business models and technologies for digital entrepreneurship are  given in the subsequent chapters.   C H A P T E R   2  Crowd-Based  Digital Business  Models Crowdfunding, Crowdsourcing, and P2P Online  Lending  The  chapter  presents  an  in-depth  discussion  of  the  value  creation  in  the  platform-based businesses of the Web, including crowdfunding, crowdsourcing,  and peer-to-peer  P2P  online lending market. Moreover, solution concepts  that resolve potential issues of trust and fear, mainly in crowdfunding and P2P  online lending, will be presented. Through intriguing facts, up-to-date data on  the  existing  platforms,  and  illustrative  examples,  the  chapter  will  help  you  understand the current state of the art. This is to equip the reader with the  techniques on how to effectively participate in crowd-based businesses as a  digital entrepreneur or investor. The chapter is organized as follows. The first  section  focuses  on  crowdfunding,  examining  the  crowdfunding  models,  underlying problems, proposed solutions, and the implication for crowdfunding.     Abeba N. Turi 2020 A. N. Turi, Technologies for Modern Digital Entrepreneurship,   https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-6005-0_2   44  Chapter 2  Crowd-Based Digital Business Models  The second section looks at the crowdsourcing market, highlighting the value  creation process between the crowd community and requesters. The third  section dives into the P2P online lending market with a detailed discussion on  the  value  co-creation  in  P2P  lending  and  the  underlying  problems  and  a  distributed  reputation  mechanism  for  P2P  online  lending.  We  will  discuss  some  of  the  business  models  at  the  core  of  the  digital  economic  system,  ranging from crowdfunding to P2P online lending markets.   Crowdfunding A  growing  number  of  individuals  motivated  by  profit,  philanthropy,  or  any  other  reasons  are  engaged  in  the  crowdfunding  industry.  This  industry  is  experiencing fast growth as indicated in a recent report.1 As of January 18,  2020,  a  total  of  $6  billion  has  been  globally  raised  from  about  62  million  backers across different platforms.2 By 2025, the global crowdfunding market  is expected to generate up to $28.8 billion.3 The largest crowdfunding regions  are  North  America  and  Asia.  A  wide  range  of  online  third-party  market  platforms  link  entrepreneurs,  investors,  and  philanthropists  to  facilitate  investing  in  social  enterprises.  Currently,  there  are  a  number  of  diverse  crowdfunding  platforms  with  different  application  areas  and  methods  of  funding. These include Kickstarter, Sellaband, AngelList, Betterplace, JumpStart  Africa,  VereinRespekt.net,  c-crowd,  Seedups,  Thundafund,  Prosper,  Funding  Circle, LendingClub, and so on.  1 http:  research.crowdsourcing.org 2013cf-crowdfunding-industry-report 2 www.thecrowdfundingcenter.com data  3 www.statista.com topics 1283 crowdfunding    45  Figure 2-1.  Percentage of global successful projects by category  January 1, 2014–March 12,  2020 4   What Is Crowdfunding Crowdfunding  is  shaping  the  collaborative  economy  by  creating  a  financial  market that operates as an accelerating catalyst for a wider range of investor- entrepreneur relations. Crowdfunding can generally take the form of investment crowdfunding  which  can  follow  debt-based,  equity-based,  profit-sharing,  or  hybrid  models   or  donation  crowdfunding.  In  investment  crowdfunding,  project  initiators  and  funders  interact  on  the  basis  of  expected  returns.  For  example,  in  equity  crowdfunding,  several  types  of  capital  and  creative  projects  are  sold  to  a  crowd  of  potential  shareholders  in  the  form  of  equity,  while  in  debt  crowdfunding,  the  crowd  investors  finance  the  debt  and  receive  a  debt  instrument that pays interest return. Note that equity-based crowdfunding is  one of the potentially co-utile markets in the crowdfunding industry, because  it is a win-win game both for the entrepreneur who gets new financing sources  and an investor backing this entrepreneur which gains by being a stakeholder  of  a  potentially  growing  startup  company.  A  special  form  of  investment  crowdfunding  is  reward-based  crowdfunding  in  which  the  returns  are  non- financial. In reward-based crowdfunding, the crowd collaboratively donates,   4 Source:  Author’s  extraction  based  on  data  from  The  Crowdfunding  Center  at  www. thecrowdfundingcenter.com data categories   46  Chapter 2  Crowd-Based Digital Business Models  pre-purchases products, or buys unique expertise experiences in return for a  defined set of products or rewards. A typical example here is a free software  development or a scientific research project.5, 6 On the other hand, a donation  crowdfunding is mostly initiated for charitable projects with a social cause. Investment crowdfunding is still in its infancy: it only accounts for a small share  of the total crowdfunding industry, and its legalization and formalization are  still in progress. In late 2012, President Obama signed the JOBS Act, which  legalizes equity financing through crowdfunding as seed money to startups, in  an initiative to seek new routes that stimulate the economy.7 Crowdfunding can be promoted through an open call on one’s web page,8 by  posting  a  notice  in  a  public  place,  or  through  organized  crowdfunding  platforms. According to Greenberg et al.  2013 , crowdfunding platforms have  the  property  of  supporting  the  exchange  of  all  six  resources  described  by  resource  exchange  theory:  love,  status,  information,  money,  goods,  and  services. Mollick   2013   pointed  out  that,  beyond  or  in  addition  to  fund-raising,  crowdfunding is used by entrepreneurs to demonstrate estimate the demand  for a proposed product  hence operating as a signal for the traditional form of  funding , to pre-sell and introduce a new product  marketing purposes , to  create interest in new projects in their early stages of development, to attract  the  attention  of  the  media,  and  so  on.  According  to  Gerber  et  al.   2012 ,  requesters entrepreneurs  take  part  in  the  crowdfunding  market  to  raise  funds,  establish  relationships,  receive  validation,  replicate  successful  experiences of others, and or expand awareness of their work through social  media.  On  the  other  hand,  these  authors  also  identified  the  motives  for  funders  to  participate  in  this  market  as  seeking  rewards,  supporting  entrepreneurs,  or  engaging  and  contributing  to  a  trusting  and  creative  community; they concluded that the weight attached to each of these motives  varies across different players. In this regard, Pazowski et al.  2014  also argue  the same as the aforementioned scholars and further discuss the disincentives  for  both  entrepreneurs  and  funders.  Along  the  same  line,  Lehner   2013   stated  that  the  crowd  behaves  in  unpredictable,  chaotic,  and  multifarious  manners and reacts in a hyperbolic way to any actions by the funded project.  5 See,  for  example,  Experiment,  a  crowdfunding  platform  for  scientific  research  at   https:  experiment.com . The platform follows an all-or-nothing crowdfunding model,  in which initiators collect the funds if the project meets its funding goal during the speci- fied timeline of the campaign. 6 www.weforum.org agenda 2019 02 crowdfunding-money-for-research-levels-  the-playing-field  7 www.masscatalyst.com news what-is-title-iii-equity-crowdfunding 8 For  example,  the  movie  Hotel  Desire  raised  €170,000  in  80  days  at  its  own  website   www.german-films.de filmarchive browse-archive view detail film hotel- desire index.html   47  Personal  networks   involving  public  figures   and  extensive  social  media  networks   through  Facebook,  Twitter,  etc. ,  as  well  as  the  quality  of  the  underlying project, have most often been mentioned as key factors to success  of crowdfunded projects.   Main Problems in Crowdfunding There are a number of problems that are inherent to crowdfunding, including  issues of coordination and asymmetric information resulting in mistrust and  fear effects. Lack of coordination between funders is one of the key deterring  factors in the crowdfunding effort. An experiment on a simulated donation- based  crowdfunding  platform  by  Solomon  et  al.   2015   indicates  that  a  leadership  approach  is  a  better  strategy  to  donate  for  a  project  of  one’s  interest  i.e., to back a project on which you have confidence in order to signal  for other potential donors  provided a time frame for a project to be funded.  In contrast, the wait-and-see approach is a better strategy for funders with  small  payouts  and  relatively  weak  preferences   wait  and  make  a  small  contribution at the end . In addition to this, both intentional and unintentional  free riding may occur in the crowdfunding market. Let’s  say  you  have  a  non-exclusive  civic  project  and  that  you  rely  on  crowdfunding to run the project. As it is common for public goods  a common  word  in  economics  for  non-excludable  and  nonrivalrous  goods ,  potential  backers can free ride on other actual backers’ contributions, in which case  you cannot exclude the expected benefits. Another example is open source  projects  e.g., codes and applications  like the ones through the community- raised funding on the Linux Foundation. According to Wash and Solomon  2014 , crowdfunding entails some element  of public good. Clearly, if funds are raised for schooling, healthcare, and so on,  this is public good in the obvious sense. Yet, a subtler form of public good  occurs no matter the nature of the new product being funded, because the  funding crowd makes that product available to the market for everyone to use  ex post. Being an interaction between anonymous players, the crowdfunding business  model  suffers  from  the  information  asymmetry  problem.  As  Wash  and  Solomon   2014   stated,  crowdfunding  markets  do  not  guarantee  a  stable  match  and  there  exists  mistrust  by  the  funders   is  the  entrepreneur  trustworthy? , while on the side of the entrepreneur requester, there is a fear  of failure and a fear of public disclosure of the project idea and its details  with  the subsequent loss of intellectual property . Belleflamme et al.  2014  also  identified  uncertainties  and  the  entrepreneur  and  funders  in  the  pre-ordering  and  profit-sharing  forms  of  crowdfunding. They recommended the formation of strategic ties between  the entrepreneur and investors consumers by creating a sense of belongingness,   information  asymmetries  between    48  Chapter 2  Crowd-Based Digital Business Models  membership to the community, and the rights of control and vote. The latter  rights can be realized in some cases by involving the crowd in some strategic  decisions about the design and nature of the product. Mollick  2013  identifies  delay in payment of pre-agreed rewards to the funders and failure as a result  of a fraud or an overambitious project as some other challenging uncertainties  in crowdfunding  see also Cumming and Johan, 2019 . Hildebrand et al.  2014  found that there exist perverse incentives for the  group  leaders  in  peer-to-peer  lending  systems.  This  implies  incentive  manipulation  through  a  potential  bribing  attack  in  which  group  leaders  get  rewards for a signaling effect. As a result, they suggested that the leader take  a  significant  share  of  the  loan  and  defined  the  cutoff  criterion  in  effect.  According to them, this will lead to lower interest rates and lower rates of  default. Reputation  and  signaling  mechanisms  are  proposed  for  most  of  the  crowdfunding markets through centralized platforms. Another recent form of  digital financing relies on a purely distributed network built on blockchain and  distributed  ledger  technologies.  Such  crowdfunding  models  are  under  the  tokenization business model, which includes the initial coin offering  ICO ,  initial  token  offering   OTP ,  secure  token  offering,  and  coinsale   we  will  discuss further about the blockchain-powered decentralized applications and  funding models in Chapters 3 and 4 of this book . A typical example of the  recent failures in the crowd-based digital business models of this form is the  DAO attack  the attack on the decentralized form of crowdfunding based on  the blockchain platform . The decentralized autonomous organization  DAO  was a smart contract  a  ruleset  in  blockchain  tech  language9   built  for  automating  organizational  decision-making  and  business  rules  through  decentralized  network  on  the  Ethereum blockchain platform. It used crowdfunding  crowdsale, or an initial  coin offering  ICO   in tokenizing the service. Unlike marketplace crowdfunding,  the  DAO  was  not  owned  by  any  individual,  but  rather  it  belonged  to  the  distributed network of people governed by a consensus mechanism. In May  2016, following its deployment, the DAO raised about $150 million through  crowdfunding coinsale. This coinsale was one of the largest crowdfunding in  the history of the digital crowd-based business models. However, the DAO  crowdfunding  was  attacked  by  a  malicious  smart  contract  that  withdrew   9 Discussed in detail in Chapter 3 and 4 of this book.   49  about  one  third  of  the  funds   12  million  ETH   from  the  DAO.  As  Vitalik  Buterin announced on June 17, 2016:  An  attack  has  been  found  and  exploited  in  the  DAO,  and  the  attacker  is  currently in the process of draining the ether contained in the DAO into a child  DAO. The attack is a recursive calling vulnerability, where an attacker called  the “split” function, and then calls the split function recursively inside of the  split, thereby collecting ether many times over in a single transaction…. The  development community is proposing a soft fork,  with NO ROLLBACK; no  transactions or blocks will be “reversed”  which will make any transactions  that make any calls callcodes delegatecalls that execute code with code hash  0x7278d050619a624f84f51987149ddb439cdaadfba5966f7cfaea7ad4  4340a4ba  ie. the DAO and children  lead to the transaction  not just the call,  the  transaction   being  invalid,  starting  from  block  1760000   precise  block  number subject to change up until the point the code is released , preventing  the ether from being withdrawn by the attacker past the 27-day window. This  will later be followed up by a hard fork which will give token holders the ability  to recover their ether.10  The funds were recovered through a soft fork11 and hard fork12 that drained  the attacker.13   Crowdfunding Models The fund-raising projects from the general public through the online platforms  commonly rely on two basic models or a mixture of them. The two models  are “all or nothing” or “keep it all.” The all-or-nothing  a.k.a. return rule method  model is when the fund-raising  period is over, money is only collected from the contributors if a predetermined  minimum  amount  of  money  has  been  pledged;  if  the  target  amount  is  not  reached,  no  money  is  collected.  This  method  is  better  for  projects  whose  success critically depends on a certain minimum budget  Wash and Solomon,  2014 .  10 https:  blog.ethereum.org 2016 06 17 critical-update-re-dao-vulnerability  11 A soft fork is a blockchain  a distributed digital ledger technology  term which refers to  a fork to a blockchain that invalidates all prior transaction records blocks, thus building  over the same history of records under a given protocol.  12 A hard fork is a blockchain term for a change in either the consensus rules or protocol   and building of a different history of records.  13 https:  blog.ethereum.org 2016 07 20 hard-fork-completed    50  Chapter 2  Crowd-Based Digital Business Models  The keep-it-all  a.k.a. direct method  model is where all the funds collected  over  that  specified  fund-raising  period  are  handed  over  to  the  requester   entrepreneur , whether the target amount is reached or not. This model is  convenient for continuous projects in which any amount of funds raised can  still be used to keep the project in progress. The bounty model, in which a reward is raised for the entrepreneur completing  a certain task, can be viewed as having some elements of the previous two  models. According to Wash and Solomon  2014 , the all-or-nothing method  in  the  donation-based  crowdfunding  increases  the  donors’  willingness  to  donate;  further,  it  leads  them  to  donating  according  to  their  preferences  rather than relying on the projects that signal high funding preference by other  funders; however, it disincentivizes coordination. On the other hand, according  to  the  same  authors,  the  keep-it-all  mechanism  encourages  coordination,  with  a  less  efficient  outcome.  See,  for  example,  Figure  2-2  depicting  the  number of successful projects across selected crowdfunding sites by category.  Note that each of the platforms has its own funding model.  Figure  2-2.  Fully  funded  projects  across  crowdfunding  platforms  by  category   January  1,  2014–March 14, 2020 14  14 Source: Author’s extraction based on data from The Crowdfunding Center, available at   www.thecrowdfundingcenter.com data categories   51   Investment Crowdfunding In line with the theme of the text, I will narrow down the discussion in the  remaining sections into investment crowdfunding that involves entrepreneurial  and  investment  decision-making,  unlike  the  donation  crowdfunding.  More  specifically,  by  taking  equity-based  crowdfunding,  I  will  present  a  detailed  analysis of the underlying business model. Investment crowdfunding can follow debt-based, equity-based, profit-sharing,  or hybrid models. It is one of the examples of a potentially co-utile market, in  which two or more agents with different motivations interact. The case we  analyze  here  in  detail  is  a  specific  type  of  investment  crowdfunding,  debt- based crowdfunding, which can be extended to equity crowdfunding through  convertible  notes.  Like  in  crowdsourcing,  anonymity  in  the  crowd  and  asymmetric  information  between  the  crowd  and  the  entrepreneur  are  key  features  in  this  industry.  As  stated  by  Romer   2011 ,  such  asymmetric  information between the two dealers can distort investment choices more  than would be the case for decisions based on only interest rates or profits.  In this market, both agents  funder and entrepreneur  are rational and take  part in the market to optimize their respective expected utility  “profit” . Investment crowdfunding is in its infancy, and it represents only a very small  share of the total crowdfunding volume. In addition to the legal constraints  imposed on the market, other factors  including mistrust and fear of disclosure,  as described earlier  deter individual players from taking part in such forms of  investment.  These  factors  still  keep  drawing  the  market  back,  despite  the  approval  and  legislation  enhancing  such  open  funding.  For  this  reason,  a  co-utile  protocol  whereby  both  agents  mutually  benefit  and  derive  their  optimal utility would be very useful. In this sense, we aim at neutralizing the  potentially deterring factors through incentive mechanisms in order to ensure  the co-utility of the protocol. An efficient crowdfunding decision under financial market imperfection can be  developed through a robust mechanism design, including reputation system  and cryptographic solutions  Turi et al., 2017 . Unlike the traditional form of  investment,  further  consideration  in  crowdfunding  is  a  case  in  which  the  crowd investor may end up with negative returns  loss of the principal invested  plus verification costs . This is an extreme scenario in case the crowdfunded  project fails or happens to be a fraud. It is important to note the following key points about equity crowdfunding:   	 Being  the  owner  of  the  project,  the  entrepreneur  has  much  more  information  about  her  investment  project   return, actual output, risk, actions of the entrepreneur,  etc.  than the potential crowd investors.   52  Chapter 2  Crowd-Based Digital Business Models   	 The investor incurs a verification cost to gather enough  information on the project details to make an investment  decision;  this  verification  cost  is  assumed  to  be  compensated by the entrepreneur  see Romer, 2011 .   	 The project financing can wholly rely on crowdfunding  as  a special case of Romer’s financial markets’ imperfection  analysis,  the  entrepreneur’s  wealth  invested  in  such  a  project is zero  and has an expected output which might  be different from the actual output.   	 There are a large number of crowd investors, and there   exists competition among them.   	 The investors are risk-averse in their investment decisions  of  projects  listed  on  crowdfunding  platforms.  That  creative idea you seek for funding should prove confidence  in the eyes of your potential backers. Here, the campaign  strategy  you  use  and  the  project  display  to  pitch  your  idea  have  to  be  robust.15  Entrepreneurs  in  online  platforms also are risk-averse toward publicizing creative  project ideas products to the anonymous crowd for fear  of  being  copied.  Equally  important  with  efficient  impeachment is to avoid claiming fictitious  unattainable   products in an effort to win the crowd. In  equity  crowdfunding,  the  entrepreneur  becomes  indebted to reward the expected return to the investors.  Hence,  the  entrepreneur’s  optimal  strategy  is  the  one  that minimizes the verification cost, given their respective  basic  returns,  at  some  critical  level  of  debt  to  the  entrepreneur.  Note  again  that,  unlike  the  traditional  form of investment, this form of investment may end up  with zero return and hence loss to investors even if they  pay the verification cost.   	   Investor’s Funding Decision A potential investor in crowdfunding, or backer, considers a number of things  before committing to fund a project. The expected net return to the investor   backer  under a debt contract with the competition and risk of project failure  assumptions depends on the level of investment, rate of return, the probability   15 See, for example, a sample most backed successful project, Fidget Cube: A Vinyl Desk  Toy, project which raised a total of $6,465,690 from 154,926 backers on Kickstarter.  Listing  and  campaign  available  at  www.kickstarter.com projects antsylabs fidget-  cube-a-vinyl-desk-toy?ref=discovery_most_backed   53  of success for the project, and the proportion of backer’s investment to the  total debt of the entrepreneur. By implication, the investment decision of the  backer  depends  on  the  expected  net  return  of  the  project.  Therefore,  an  investor  takes  part  in  the  crowdfunding  of  the  project  if  and  only  if  the  required net return is not more than the optimal expected net return. This  implies that, in order for her to invest in the project, her return for investing  in that project should, at least, match the return of investing in a safe asset.  Otherwise, if the latter return is greater than optimal return from crowdfunding  investment, she does not take part in the project at any interest rate. Note  that this also implies that the risk premium offered by the projects should be  substantial  enough,  depending  on  the  market,  to  surpass  the  minimum  required level of return which could be attained by investing in a safer asset.  Furthermore, it is limited to the extent to which it can offer optimal return  to the individual investors. Also, the unobserved risk premium induced in the  random interest rate offered by varied projects to be crowd financed should  minimally be bound to the market optimal level of return. Given a crowdfunding debt contract and the proportion of backers’ investment,  if the project surely rewards the backers and the expected return is guaranteed,  then  the  underlying  investment  decision  depends  on  the  utility  a  potential  investor  might  derive  from  this  level  of  return,  given  the  required  rate  of  return.  As  stated  previously,  investors  in  crowdfunding  platforms  are  risk- averse of various degrees based on their level of information, experience with  such investment, invested amount, income, and so on. The analysis of this  market further considers constant absolute risk aversion and invariant risk in  absolute money terms  see Cvitanic and Zapatero, 2004, and Turi et al., 2017 .  An investor, who is maximizing her expected utility of return, invests in the  project if she derives positive utility from the funding, provided that the utility  is strictly higher than the utility of the next best alternative safer investment.  That is, if the utility she derives by investing in that project is at least as high  as the utility she would obtain with a safe asset  local nonsatiation . Therefore,  keeping all other factors aside, a risk-averse investor takes part in the crowd  investment  at  the  optimal  debt  contract  when  deriving  higher  utility  as  compared to a safe asset. Another interesting scenario is the case in which  the investor might end up with negative returns, in case of fraud or failure of  the  project.  A  risk-averse  investor  also  tries  to  avoid  this  scenario  in  her  investment  decision,  reflected  in  the  mistrust  effect  which  we  will  discuss  later in this chapter.   Entrepreneur’s Investment Decision In many cases, entrepreneurs choose crowdfunding over alternative funding  options for many reasons, for example, to access a large number of investors  or  for  any  other  reason  like  demonstrating  the  demand  for  a  proposed  product, creating interest in new projects in the early stages of development,    54  Chapter 2  Crowd-Based Digital Business Models  attracting  the  attention  of  the  media,  marketing,  establishing  relationships,  receiving  validation,  replicating  successful  experiences  of  others  through  feedback, expanding awareness of work through social media, and so on  see  Mollick, 2013, and Gerber et al., 2012 . Entrepreneurs broadcast their project  for public funding through crowdfunding platforms, if the net return is greater  than the market value of the project idea if transferred to a second party  e.g.,  white  labeling  or  acquisition  of  fintech  startups  by  established  financial  institutions . As mentioned previously and will soon discuss in detail, due to  the  disclosure  fear  effect,  the  entrepreneur  also  is  risk-averse  toward  her  project being funded through the anonymous crowd. Provided these, a digital  entrepreneur goes for crowdfunding if the utility she derives by running the  project through seed money financing from an anonymous crowd is at least as  high as the market value of her project idea when sold to some buyer and,  more generally, if the expected return paid to the outside investors does not  result in credit rationing and if the expected net returns to her are higher than  what she can earn by refraining from running the project  opportunity cost of  investment .   The Effects of Fear and Mistrust in Crowdfunding From the earlier discussion, we see that to make crowdfunding co-utile, we  must  deal  with  negative  utilities  that  deter  an  individual  investor  or  entrepreneur  from  taking  part  in  this  market.  Apart  from  the  net  return- based investment decisions highlighted in the previous section, some other  factors might discourage the participation of an agent. One  of  the  main  deterring  factors  is  mistrust  by  funders  regarding  possible  frauds  Cumming and Johan, 2019 . A study conducted on projects listed on  Kickstarter and Indiegogo shows that fraudulent listings are characterized by  less crowdfunding engagement history and poor social media presence and  provide  poorly  worded,  deceptive,  and  confusing  crowdfunding  campaigns   Cumming  et  al.,  2016 .  For  example,  in  May  2013,  a  crowdfunding  scam  claiming to improve traditional beef jerky attracted about $120,000 pledges  and got suspended before within minutes of completion on Kickstarter.16,17  The project was characterized by some negative crowd feedback, no picture  or video of founders in the content display, a campaign page from backers  with new accounts, and a poor backing records of unsuccessful campaigns and  predatory pricing of rewards with significantly small amount of pledge requests  as compared to expected rewards  Cumming and Johan, 2019 .  16 See the fraudulent crowdfunding campaign “KOBE RED - 100% JAPANESE BEER FED  KOBE BEEF JERKY” at www.kickstarter.com projects kobered kobe-red-100-  japanese-beer-fed-kobe-beef-jerky  17 https:  money.cnn.com 2013 06 17 technology kickstarter-scam-kobe-jerky    55  Another  example,  Theranos,  a  health  tech  startup,  has  been  charged  with  wire fraud in its crowdfunding attempt using fictitious blood testing technology  claims.18 The tech startup is one of the top Silicon Valley fraudulent startups  of  the  digital  era.  Journalist  John  Carreyrou  has  explored  the  multibillion- dollar startup, Theranos, fraud scandal in his book Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies  in a Silicon Valley Startup  Carreyrou, 2018 . Funders want to be sure that their investment goes to the right project and  they want to be guaranteed the promised return. As Lehner  2013  pointed  out,  the  utility  functions  of  equity  investors  in  crowdfunded  ventures  may  differ from those of traditional for-profit investors. From the entrepreneur’s point of view, fear of failure and imitation or plagiarism  with full content disclosure  loss of intellectual property  are deterring factors  for crowdfunded ventures. This element of fear on the side of the entrepreneurs  affects the extent they could freely signal quality and preparedness of their  project idea to the general public. As a result, the entrepreneur faces a trade- off between a need of raising capital and the threat of their idea being copied  by other market participants  Pazowski et al., 2014 . With a larger level of crowdfunding project output and a higher credibility of  the project, an individual crowdfunding investor’s utility increases, while this is  not true if the project has larger output and low credibility. Hence, above the  minimum required return with trust, the utility of an individual investor will  be  the  highest  possible  one  under  this  condition,  and  collaboration  in  the  crowdfunding takes place with full credibility. On the other hand, with low  trust, the credibility of the project fails, and even above the threshold expected  return, no collaboration in crowdfunding takes place. As much as the crowdfunding markets’ significance to the digital entrepreneur  and investor community, there are various scams and frauds across different  platforms.  See,  for  example,  The  Doom  That  Came  To  Atlantic  City!19  A  board game project on Kickstarter was charged for a deceptive crowdfunding  campaign. In 2012, the crowdfunding campaign targeted $35,000 and actually  raised $122,000 failing to reward or return the funds to its backers.20 A similar  example  on  another  crowdfunding  platform,  Indiegogo,  is  the  iBackPack  crowdfunding  campaign.21  The  crowdfunding  campaign  was  charged  by  the  FTC for failing to use consumer funds to produce high-tech backpacks.22  18 The US SEC https:  www.sec.gov news press-release 2018-41 19 www.kickstarter.com projects forkingpath the-doom-that-came-to-atlan-  tic-city comments  20 The Federal Trade Commission at www.ftc.gov news-events press-releases 2015 06   crowdfunding-project-creator-settles-ftc-charges-deception  21 www.indiegogo.com projects ibackpack-wifi-ultra-thin-powerful-batteries  22 The  Federal  Trade  Commission  at  www.ftc.gov news-events press-releases    2019 05 ftc-charges-operator-crowdfunding-scheme   56  Chapter 2  Crowd-Based Digital Business Models   Proposed Solutions Lack of trust in crowdfunding leads a potentially co-utile market to a non-co- utile  outcome.  To  have  a  market  that  works  optimally,  we  must  keep  the  investment  crowdfunding  strictly  co-utile.  The  following  are  some  possible  solutions  to  the  problems  of  mistrust  by  investors  and  fear  of  intellectual  property loss or other project-related fear by the entrepreneur.   Encrypt and Secure Your Ideas to Protect Your Intellectual  Property Entrepreneur should be guaranteed protection for her intellectual property  that  does  not  depend  on  any  legal  common  framework  accepted  by  all  investors  protection should be self-enforcing if we want to achieve co-utility .  To do so, any individual entrepreneur, before publicly broadcasting her idea,  should encrypt it and secure the private key with a decentralized timestamp,23  where an individual hash tag is generated for each project description in a  common basket for all the projects running on a specific platform. Hence, in  case of any claim, she can decrypt the document and claim ownership.   Contribute to Projects That Are Promising A  robust  reputation  system  built  in  a  crowdfunding  platform  can  help  in  filtering credible projects. Individuals taking part in this market are rational, and investors can diversify  the risk by investing in more than one project. Mollick  2013 , in his analysis  of  the  crowdfunding  industry,  has  found  evidence  that  funders  respond  to  signals about the quality and creditworthiness of the project, regardless of  their expectations for financial return. Signaling can be through peer ratings,  where the probability of failure from the past record and poor quality or an  infeasible project can be revealed and publicly displayed based on these general  public ratings. Such a public rating also allows for experts within the crowd to  evaluate the project idea. Moreover,  as  Wash  and  Solomon   2014   stated,  individual  project  funders  complement each other because no individual funder can finance the project  alone. Thus, each funder prefers to contribute to projects that are promisingly  financed  by  others,  so  that  the  project  receives  enough  funds  to  succeed.  Likewise,  investments  in  crowdfunded  startups  do  not  rely  wholly  on  one  individual  investor’s  contribution,  but  on  an  aggregate  contribution  by  the  entire crowd. Therefore, equity investments by the crowd complement each   23 Refer to the decentralized timestamp mechanisms in crypto currencies like Bitcoin.   57  other. This implies that there is a need for collaboration between the agents   either  between  the  investors  themselves,  or  between  entrepreneurs,  or  between investors and entrepreneurs .   Diversify Your Investments In  order  to  minimize  crowdfunding  risk,  potential  investors  in  equity  crowdfunding can invest in more than one unrelated project. This will enable  you to minimize risk by replacing a single risk with a large number of smaller,  unrelated risks across a number of diverse projects. As is common in financial  markets, remember that this technique can help you in minimizing project- specific risk, not market risk.   Proposed Crowdfunding Mechanism Crowdfunding projects listed on most platforms only pass a basic screening  process on whether they meet the platform requirements. Hence, it is up to  the potential backers to filter the worthiness of projects to invest.24 In some  of the platforms like Kickstarter, the all-or-nothing funding model helps filter  out unattainable projects. Here, a community-based reputation mechanism to  rate entrepreneurs and mitigate mistrust by investors will be presented. The  following solution concept with a head of special interest  a team lead  and a  signaling  effect  has  been  proposed  in  our  prior  study  of  the  crowdfunding  market  Turi et al., 2017 . In our setting, we consider the interdependent utility of the community by  maintaining  the  resource  flow  within  the  community  with  the  reputation  mechanism. Furthermore, we assume that an individual can form a team and  become what we will call the “head” of her team. Hence, in this setting we  introduce a team player, where there will be varied teams of different nature  and interests within the market. An entrepreneur can broadcast her project  idea individually or join a team for a signaling effect. Any individual investor  who is interested in any of the teams will join the team to avoid the risk of  failure with a membership fee that is proportional to her individual investment  capacity. An entrepreneur who wants a signaling effect from such team leaders  pays a stimulation fee for the signaling effect of the head and the fee is paid in  two rounds: first, before the signal and, second, after a successful campaign  with the signaling effect. This will allow for a detailed and closer look at the  feasibility of the project by a second party who plays a signaling role. The key role of the head in this transaction is to bear the risk of failure, with  an  insider’s  view  assumption,  through  signaling  for  a  potentially  promising  project. The head issues protection notes to the members in that it guarantees   24 www.kickstarter.com blog accountability-on-kickstarter   58  Chapter 2  Crowd-Based Digital Business Models  potential  investors   team  members  who  are  supposed  to  pay  continual  membership  fee   to  be  paid  some  percentage  of  their  invested  amount  as  compensation in case of failure of a wrongly signaled project. Furthermore,  the signaling also has a spillover effect for other potential investors who are  not members of the team. In the deal between the entrepreneur and the head, the entrepreneur provides  the  head  with  additional  convincing  information  on  her  project  far  more  detailed than the information disseminated to the general public. In order to  avoid the project idea being leaked or overtaken by the head, the entrepreneur  provides a redacted document, with key content being reasonably suppressed. We further assume that there will be a defined time frame within the platform  in which it is expected to raise the funds for the project. Hence, assuming the  debt  contract  as  discussed  earlier,  when  the  project  is  broadcast  for  crowdfunding, the head pledges some amount of money which will be issued  in the form of convertible notes as early as possible to signal the trustworthiness  and value of the project. In doing so, she takes into account the net gain she  draws from the investment. Her return from the signaling investment depends  on  the  level  of  risk  she  takes,  which  in  turn  depends  on  the  level  of  creditworthiness of the project provided the level of generalized information  in  the  redacted  document  and  other  detailed  information,  including  the  personnel qualifications and general public rating. Note that the head derives an informational advantage over the general public  from directly observing the redacted project idea and other more detailed  information. A rational head aims at maximizing her gain by minimizing the  possible risk due to the failure of the project. The protection note issued is  some  percentage  of  the  purchased  share.  Hence,  the  possible  loss  by  the  investor who is a member of the team in case of failure of the project will be  reduced to the interest, the unrecovered proportion of the loan, and the time  value  of  money.  Therefore,  when  responding  to  the  signaling  effect  of  the  head, investors should take into account the possible scenarios in which the  entrepreneur really signals a potentially promising project. If a potential investor would like to convert her invested amount C into a  share, the outstanding balance of the loan is automatically converted to equity  at a discount rate d. In this case, in addition to the expected return on equity,  the investor will have a greater share amount over a new individual investing  the  same  amount  of  money  at  a  given  price,  p,  at  the  valuation  of  a  later  funding round. This difference in return is equal to   .  d C p dp-  For example, suppose an investor invested $21,000 in a project startup using  a convertible note with a discount rate d=15%. Let the stock price, p, at the  valuation of the later funding round be $7 per share. Then, at the valuation of    59  a later funding period, she will have a total of 3529.4 shares weighing to unre-  alized return amount,  p  , of $24705.8 at $7 per share. However, a   æ ç è  C -  p dp  ö ÷ ø  new  investor  of  the  same  amount  of  investment  will  have  a  total  of  3000  shares at the valuation of the later funding round. The  expected  total  return  to  the  head  will  be  the  principal   the  invested  amount by the head , the interest on the invested amount, the service charge  for membership to the group, the stimulation fee for the signaling effect, and  the risk taken by the head  in two forms, fixed rate of prepayment, followed  by up on fulfillment fee, which is some percentage of the pledged amount by  the head and total money for the protection note . As long as the project to invest in is successful through the signaling effect, all  the parties  investor, head, and entrepreneur  benefit. Furthermore, in order  to avoid false signals from their investment decisions, there should be a clear- cut criterion which filters reasonable signaling with a sufficiently large share of  investment by the head  commonly referred to as sufficient skin in the game . In  case  of  systemic  signaling  to  a  potentially  failing  project,  a  total  sum  of  membership fees and equivalent compensation for upon-success return, over  her initial signaling investment to the head, should outweigh the potential loss,  provided some percentage of the total pledged loan by the head. Here, the  likelihood  of  failure  of  the  project  is  assumed  known  by  the  head  with  an  insider’s  view  assumption,  while  it  is  unrevealed  to  the  other  investors.  A  potential  investor  incurs  loss  by  investing  in  an  unsuccessful  project  with  probability of failure if the net return in a simplified form is negative. This is a  sufficient condition for a project that fails to reward the investors for sure. In  other  words,  for  any  project  with  negative  return,  the  head  systematically  signals only if the potential gain upon her initial investment level and signaling  service fees is greater than the loss incurred. That is, a rational head maximizing her net gain takes the risk and signals to  the project if the potential net gain from signaling is greater than the net loss  she might incur by signaling this project. Given the probability of failure for  the project, a profit-maximizing head signals to the project if and only if the  required  signaling  amount  she  is  supposed  to  lend  is  less  than  her  upper  optimal boundary of share. For example, when the head knows that the project is not promising, heads  signaling investment should at least help issue the protection note. The head  should also gain from the service charge for both the stimulation and service  charge to the mass investor in her team. Suppose the membership fee is 1%   i.e.,  a  proportion  of  the  potential  investment  capacity  of  the  individual,  allowing for proportional contribution by each member . In addition to the  membership fee, the entrepreneur rewards the head with a stimulation fee of  2% of the expected amount of total crowdfunds for the project. Suppose the    60  Chapter 2  Crowd-Based Digital Business Models  protection note issued to this specific project costs the head 0.5% of the total  protection note issued in the group. The entrepreneur offers interest rate of  12%,  including  the  risk  premium.  Consider  a  project  with  a  probability  of  failure 0.5 upon the public rating and let the head’s overall expected gain on  her loan  including the interest and ex post stimulation fee  be 10% of her  total  transaction  during  the  process.  Then,  given  this  set  of  information,  funding by the head will be less than 0.1875. That is, the upper bound to her  possible signaling investment of this project should be less than 18.75% of the  total funds requested by the entrepreneur for the project in which an ordinary  investor would incur loss with the stated probability of failure and an insider’s  view. Hence, given the provided rate of return by the entrepreneur and a conversion  discount of the convertible note into a shared stock relative to the next fixed  priced round, there will be a higher probability of loss to a regular investor.  This is with the signaling effect of the head with less than 18.75% of investment  participation  out  of  the  total  amount  requested  for  the  startup  financing.  Therefore, based on this criterion, potential investors can filter reasonable  signals on investment projects they are interested to invest in. Hence, the  filtering is applicable regardless of the unrevealed type of the other parties  involved. This  solution  concept  is  ideal  for  most  crowdfunding  projects  where  self- financing capacity is rare and thus proposing a second-party  head of team   signaling.   Implications for Crowdfunding Practices As discussed previously, the applicability of crowd-based financing is limited by  the market inefficiency arising from the effects of fear and mistrust, as well as  the access to asymmetric information. The model presented for crowdfunding  implies that, under the return-based investment decision, collaboration in the  ∗  is  not  less  than  the  market  takes  place  as  long  as  the  optimal  net  returni required net return. However, with the mistrust and fear effects in the market,  co-utile collaboration takes place at the Pareto-optimal point at which the  optimal level of no fear and trust is attained, and this point lies above the  threshold  level  at  which  the  return-based  investment  decision  takes  place.  Hence, such market inefficiencies do also reduce investment at a given interest  rate, and they are among the most important factors affecting the broader  applicability of this business model. Studies show that there exists a significant  variation  in  the  success  rate  of  projects  being  financed  across  different  crowdfunding  platforms   Jeffries,  2013,  and Lau,  2013 .  These  success  rate  variations across project types and platforms are also related to the fear and  mistrust effect issues raised earlier in this chapter.   61  Along the variation within and across the platforms, we can draw repercussions  for  the  behaviors  of  investors  and  entrepreneurs  in  the  crowdfunding  ecosystem. For instance, a significantly visible difference between Kickstarter  and Indiegogo is that the former is focused on specific project categories and  geographical settings and has more restrictions on the types of projects and  incentive  schemes  offered  by  individual  projects.  As  of  January  2016,  Kickstarter is open for worldwide backers, while it is limited to the projects  from the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand,  the Netherlands, Denmark, Ireland, Norway, Sweden, Spain, France, Germany,  Austria,  Italy,  Belgium,  Luxembourg,  and  Switzerland   see  Table  2-1  for  a  sample  of  successful  projects  listed  on  Kickstarter .  Moreover,  the  funding  model that it follows is the “all-or-nothing” method, which has the effect of  increasing  the  donors’  willingness  to  donate  and  leads  them  to  donating  according  to  their  preferences   self-capacity  signaling  of  projects   and  hence  builds  trust.  However,  this  method  disincentivizes  coordination   Wash  and  Solomon,  2014 ;  the  community-based  reputation  mechanism  under  the  proposed  crowdfunding  mechanism  section  of  this  chapter  can  be  used  to  handle such a coordination problem. Hence, in addition to the project qualities  and  other  platform-related  marketing  packages,  the  relative  credibility   the  higher trust to the entrepreneurs on this platform coming from the platform’s  setup itself  and the focus group targeting of the platform have contributed  for a relatively higher success rate of projects’ running campaigns through this  platform. This credibility also has something to do with the reduction in the  fear of failure effect; hence, more projects come upfront for soliciting finance  from the crowd.  Table 2-1.

A study conducted by Cumming et al.  2014  on the mixed  funding model used by Indiegogo since 2011 provides sample evidence that  projects  using  the  “all-or-nothing”  method  have  more  average  completion  rate  and  more  attraction  to  investors  than  projects  using  the  “keep-it-all”  method. Here again, this has implications for the mistrust effect underlying the  “keep-it-all” mechanism. Despite  the  traditional  investment   see  Romer,  2011   for  analysis  of  the  imperfections  of  financial  markets ,  crowd-based  project  financing  most  commonly does not rely on the entrepreneur’s wealth, in which we have also  assumed that the entrepreneur’s wealth invested in a project is zero. Hence,  whether a project on a crowdfunding platform is funded depends only on the  potential output, but not on the financial base of the entrepreneur. Additional  catalysts could be the product type and novelty, the ability to run a successful  campaign, incentive schemes including the risk premium and product offer,  and the like. This implies that the effect of shocks that may occur outside the  financial system is low: any outside shock affecting the entrepreneur’s wealth  will not have any implied effect on the project’s output. Crowdfunding also   26 See  sample  popular  Indiegogo  crowdfunding  projects  including  Ethan  Van  Sciver’s  CYBERFROG  2:  REKT  PLANET   the  biggest  crowdfunded  comic ,  Sculptor   Auto- Rotating 4K Touchscreen Monitor , Pollution & Viral Filtration Mask With Botanicals,  and so on at www.indiegogo.com    63  allows  for  any  individual  entrepreneur  to  get  financing  from  the  crowd  regardless of the individuals’ wealth. In this regard, even though the efficiency  of this business model has not been tested over the long run, its potential  survival rate in any business cycle will be relatively high, unlike the traditional  funding model. Besides,  the  funding  success  rate  of  new  projects  owned  by  previously  successful entrepreneurs is high, which implies a reputation effect. For example,  this  rate  is  reported  to  nearly  double  that  of  the  overall  site  average  in  Kickstarter27  Table 2-2 . Based on the analysis offered in this chapter, if the  reputation of the entrepreneur is high  e.g., because he has a long record of  successful projects , then even low returns can be co-utile for the investors.  An additional factor here can also be the experience acquired in the previously  run campaigns  this builds the trust on the side of investors and somehow  tackles the fear effect on the side of entrepreneur .

Concretely, if the type of the entrepreneur involves fear  of disclosure, there is co-utility for the entrepreneur only if the investment by  the investor is higher than a threshold representing the expected loss when  the investor leaks the idea. This means that receiving small contributions can  be co-utile only if the fear of disclosure is very low, say, if the entrepreneur  feels no one other than himself can successfully carry out the project. For  example, projects that are more artistic skill-oriented suffer less from fear of  disclosure than projects consisting of developing a mass produced digital item   that can be copied . Likewise, projects with better potential expertise suffer  less from fear of failure and therefore are more trusted by potential investors   especially  if  the  entrepreneur  offers  defined  reward  guarantees,  like  perceptible  prototypes  presented  during  campaigns .  In  addition,  those  projects  with  a  focus  group  targeting   i.e.,  where  the  investor  targets  and  defines interest groups like the ones we see in Kickstarter  tend to have a  better  success  rate.  Moreover,  projects  owned  by  previously  successful  entrepreneurs will have a higher success rate, which implies a reputation effect:  if the entrepreneur’s reputation is high  see the discussion about Kickstarter  earlier ,  even  low  returns  can  be  co-utile.  Projects  with  timely  issues  and  special orientation to a focus group also tend to enjoy higher trust, attracting  sympathetic  investors;  in  this  category,  we  can  mention  green  startups,  medical solutions or projects with a social dimension  say, assistive technologies  for the elderly , and so on.   Crowdsourcing Crowdsourcing means outsourcing a task to a group of self-interested individuals  by means of an open call to expertise or individuals with a given skill set offering  rewards  financial or non-financial  for work. It is one of the outcomes of the  collaborative  economy  made  possible  by  the  catalyst  role  of  information  technology. The crowdsourced tasks can be as diverse as image annotation, data  labeling for machine learning systems, English proofreading, language translation,  consumer surveys, rating search engine results, spam detection, product reviews,  article review, and so on. Typical examples of crowdsourcing are the Wikipedia   which  is  open  source  by  nature ,29  proof-read  on  Project  Gutenberg   open  source ,30 or Amazon Mechanical Turk listings like business process outsourcing  or  machine  learning  development  and  more!31  The  millennial  generation  is   29 www.wikipedia.org  30 www.gutenberg.org  31 www.mturk.com    65  crowdsourcing  itself  in  many  of  such  digital  micro  jobs  listed  across  major  crowdsourcing platforms and companies’ social media pages.32 Like  in  crowdfunding,  players  in  crowdsourcing  also  have  heterogeneous  motives for participation. Note that some authors consider crowdfunding as  a special case of the “parent notion” crowdsourcing  e.g., Schwienbacher and  Larralde, 2012 . However, there is a clear-cut distinction between the two  business models, even though they have general public sourcing in common.  According to Brabham  2013 , “crowdfunding describes a funding model for  financing projects and ideas through general public participation in soliciting  funds,  while  crowdsourcing  is  a  distributed  problem-solving  and  production  model to leverage the collective intelligence of online communities to serve  specific organizational goals.” Slivkins  and  Vaughan   2014   identified  heterogeneity  underlying  the  crowdsourcing market as individual task performance levels, relative difficulty  in  the  task,  attitude  of  workers,  and  satisfaction.  Consequently,  incentive  schemes in such markets have a significant effect on the functioning of the  peer-to-peer interactions, especially with an anonymous large crowd. Huang  et al.  2012  found an adverse effect of increasing rewards on the quality of  the solutions produced by the crowd: higher rewards do not guarantee higher  quality, because participants may exert more effort in the competition itself  than in cooperating to achieve quality. The authors proposed a policy that can  induce more participation and higher effort with higher expected payoff. Earlier work by Terwiesch and Xu  2008  presented an analysis of the type of  innovative tasks that can be executed through crowdsourcing contests and  the associated optimal reward structure. A larger crowd size encompasses  diversity and in effect benefits the requester, whereas performance-contingent  reward  in  the  market  induces  more  effort.  A  related  work  by  Anari  et  al.   2014  states that the requester derives some utility by hiring the crowd and  there is a minimum level of wage each worker wants to get paid for getting  hired. Yet, there is information asymmetry between the requester and the  worker, because the information on the minimum wage the worker wants to  get paid is private to the workers. With this underlying asymmetric information  and the budget constraint of the requester, they designed a budget-feasible  mechanism with a given effort level in order to choose the right set of workers  that maximize the requester’s utility. According to Ghosh and McAfee  2012 , quality and participation  with an  associated  cost  of  effort   are  the  key  issues  that  arise  in  crowdsourcing  analysis. They argue that the level of effort an agent chooses to exert depends  on the underlying incentives offered. In this regard, they analyzed mechanisms   32 Are  Millennials  Crowdsourcing  Themselves  Out  of  Jobs?  Forbes,  October  22,  2012,  available at www.forbes.com sites larissafaw 2012 10 22 are-millennials-  crowdsourcing-themselves-out-of-jobs 721d0b2c2813   66  Chapter 2  Crowd-Based Digital Business Models   community  of   Innovation-community.de   that  can  incentivize  high  effort  in  case  entry   i.e.,  joining  the  effort   is  an  endogenous  strategic  choice  by  the  participating  crowd.  Their  analysis  for  crowdsourcing  based  on  attention  rewards  shows  that  when  the  cost  of  producing the lowest possible quality content is low, the optimal mechanism  displays all but the poorest contribution. And in the cases where there is a  fixed total reward randomly distributed to the participating crowd, subsidizing  entry may improve the expected quality of the average contribution, but not  the expected quality of the best contribution. The crowdsourcing activity may be launched through an offline campaign with  self-interested  part-time  workers  or  most  commonly  through  online  platforms. The accompanying rewards for the participant may take the form  of monetary rewards by the task generator  pay-on-task or contest prize  or  in  the  form  of  attention  rewards  for  the  so-called  user-generated  content   UGC -based sites. Here, we should take into account that in this model, the  transaction takes place directly between the two market players  the crowd  and  requester task  assigner   on  a  two-sided  marketplace  platform.  CrowdFlower,  Mechanical  Turk,  InnoCentive   open  innovation  problem- solving ,  Presans   connect  and  solve  R&D  problems ,  Ideake   collaborative  crowdsourcing ,  innovators,  creators,  designers,  and  thinkers ,  and  Challenge.gov   crowdsourcing  for  government problems  are some examples of crowdsourcing platforms. Zhang  et  al.   2012   argued  that  there  are  intrinsic  incentive  problems  underlying the crowdsourcing market, where all the players  the crowd and  requester  are selfish, that is, they strategically optimize their selfish interest.  They  propose  incentive  mechanisms  based  on  social  norms  by  integrating  reputation mechanisms that can induce high effort. On the other hand, according to Slivkins and Vaughan  2014 , there exists  information  asymmetry  in  the  crowdsourcing  market  and  workers  and  requesters can behave strategically. Accordingly, persistent reputation scores  for  both  workers  and  requesters  will  limit  spam  and  induce  worker  effort  while  encouraging  requesters  to  be  more  considerate.  They  further  argue  that the basic models for reputation systems have limitations when applied to  crowdsourcing markets  e.g., limitations in the domain-specific design goals,  reputation  designed  separately  from  task  assignments,  limited  information  about the players, etc. , and they pointed out that there is a need for defining  an optimal reputation mechanism specifically designed for the crowdsourcing  market. Here, it is worth noting that in this market there is usually a platform two- sided marketplace that acts as a catalyst third party in return for reasonable  service  fees   see  Figure  2-3 .  Therefore,  the  basic  transaction  takes  place  directly between the two players as in a peer-to-peer system, though strictly  speaking, it is not a peer-to-peer system.   67  Figure 2-3.  The crowdsourcing value chain  Given a crowdsourcing platform and agent’s utility functions, there exists a  co-utile  protocol  which  is  mutually  beneficial  for  workers  and  requesters  irrespective  of  their  individual  interest.  Co-utility  in  this  market  is  viable  provided that the goals of the requester and worker are complementary and  the qualification type of the worker matches the task. Given the level of effort to perform the task, expected reward, and the task- specific cost of effort to worker  it can take the form of time devoted to  reading,  understanding,  and  performing  the  task,  expenses  incurred  to  perform the task, etc. , worker will not exert effort to perform a task, a given  type task, however he values the reward associated with the task. Yet, in the  case of a work type match, the working decision depends on the accompanying  reward and time. The participation decision of an individual entails a trade-off  between  labor-leisure  choices   neoclassical  model  of  labor  supply .  Hence,  there  should  be  a  reasonable  incentive  scheme  influencing  the  worker’s  participation. On the other hand, consider the monetary reward-based crowdsourcing. The  goal of the requester is to maximize her expected utility from crowdsourcing  a  task.  That  is,  she  wants  to  maximize  the  value  she  receives  from  the  completed work minus the payments made. Usually, the cost and amount of  effort  exerted  by  the  crowd  workers  are  unknown  to  the  requester.  A  requester  who  wants  a  task  to  be  performed  faces  the  choice  between  sending an online request to the anonymous crowd and relying on an offline  traditional employee. Note that when a worker who exerts low effort  shirks   is hired, the requester considers the cost to be both wage and disutility from  hiring a shirking individual. Yet posteriorly disclosed behavior of the individual   reflected by the quality or quantity of the output produced  can help filter    68  Chapter 2  Crowd-Based Digital Business Models  out shirking workers from future potential crowdsourced tasks by the same  requester. A rational requester who wants a task to be performed will post the task to  the anonymous crowd only if the expected task completion and reward is  greater than any other means of recruitment. Further considerations are the  type of the task which are difficult to crowdsource for various reasons  e.g.,  special tasks in conservative institutions like the financial sector . Therefore,  based  on  the  utility  functions  defined  earlier  and  the  incentive  scheme underlying the market, we see that both agents  worker and requester   maximize  their  respective  utilities  by  taking  part  in  this  market.  Since  this  does not depend on the private types of the agents, we can say that strict  co-utility is achieved.   P2P Online Lending Market Peer-to-peer  P2P  lending is the practice of lending money between peers   individuals or businesses  through online marketplaces by a direct transaction  between  the  borrowers  and  the  lenders.  The  platforms  that  facilitate  this  practice  operate,  in  return  for  a  service  charge  they  receive  from  the  customers, by rendering services of match-making and credit checking. Some  examples  of  such  online  marketplaces  include  LendingClub   currently  the  world’s  largest  P2P  online  lending  platform ,  Prosper  Marketplace,  Funding  Circle, Zopa, SoFi, Comunitae, RateSetter, and ThinCats. There also are some  non-profit global person-to-person microlending platforms such as Kiva and  Zidisha   unlike  Kiva,  Zidisha  involves  no  local  intermediaries  in  its  global  operations . Peer-to-peer lending has the potential to disintermediate the traditional retail  banking with a lower cost structure and access to micro-level loans directly  originated from individual peers. P2P lending commonly follows the installment  loan type, in which loans are repaid in periodic installments  usually monthly  ones  that include the principal and the interest. These loans can be unsecured  or secured and, normally, do not have government insurance protection, being  operated based on a private deal. Some platforms  e.g., Zopa and RateSetter  in the United Kingdom  offer protection funds. Risk perceptions are commonly  reflected in terms of the interest rate following the platforms’ individual loan  rating   see  individual  platforms’  loan  grade rating33  and  also  Collier  and  Hampshire, 2010 .

For  instance,  borrowers  post  loan  requests  in  the  online  P2P  marketplaces  to  finance various aspects in their lives such as travel, medical, or even wedding  expenses. Lenders in this market view loans as investments to obtain some  returns. Also, lenders may have motivations beyond returns, such as to do  social  good  and  help  the  community   Krumme  and  Herrero,  2009 .  See  Table 2-4.  Table 2-4.

For instance, in some countries like the  United  States,  there  is  a  quota  restriction  requirement  for  the  maximum  amount a lender can invest in a given P2P lending marketplace  Serrano et al.,  2015 . Other regulatory and policy frameworks in the P2P online lending deal  with the minimization of operational risk and customer protection  Milne and  Parboteeah,  2016   through  segregation  of  the  platform  user  money,  well- ordered platform cessation, default and debt management, and transparent and  informative  lending  process.  For  Funk  et  al.   2015 ,  one  of  the  regulatory  requirements to operate a P2P lending market in some countries is partnership  operation  with  the  traditional  banks  in  facilitating  the  lending  process.  They  stress that external stakeholders like banks and credit agencies are vital in P2P  lending marketplaces. On the internal aspect of the P2P lending platforms, they  suggest a restructuring of the internal form of the P2P platform itself with a  focus  on  the  business  models,  organizational  design,  and  those  factors  that  generate success of P2P platforms. Furthermore, other regulatory policies focus  on enhancing competition and ensuring efficiency through a fair access to credit. Zeng  2013  has presented a detailed analysis of the United States’ and Europe’s  legal frameworks concerning the P2P lending. Following the 2008 regulations in  the  United  States,  P2P  lending  market  is  made  more  transparent  with  the  Securities and Exchange Commission  SEC  making updated reports of the P2P  companies  through  its  Electronic  Data  Gathering,  Analysis,  and  Retrieval   EDGAR   system.  Further,  a  secondary  market  operation  for  the  notes  following the regulation enabled the liquidity of the P2P loans. According to  Zeng  2013 , the major regulatory issues regarding the P2P lending market in  the United States and Europe are the same. Some of these include the following:   	 Securities  laws  require  the  SEC  registration  of  P2P  platforms,  P2P  offerings,  platform  notes,  of  any  P2P  transaction  broker  and  investment  advisers,  and  platforms’  report  the  record  of  P2P  notes  to  the  SEC  and  comply  with  federal  securities  laws   see  the  1933  Securities  Act  that  requires  investors  to  be  informed  about  public  offerings  of  securities .  Prosper  and  LendingClub, for example, are registered with the SEC.   	 Lending laws lender licensing, usury laws, state licensing  requirements,  and  bank  secrecy  act  regulations   i.e.,  requirement  of  the  P2P  platforms  to  verify  the  true  identities  of  both  the  lenders  and  borrowers,  e.g.,  criminals  or  members  of  terrorist  organizations  based  on  information  from  federal  agencies ,  which  involve  reporting  any  suspicious  account  activities  and  information sharing and anti-money laundering programs,  and third-party usage of bank charters.   71   	 Consumer  protection  laws:  Lenders funding  bank  and  P2P lending operator are required to provide sufficient  information  to  the  borrowers  and  investors  in  a  given  transaction  regarding  the  loan  terms,  and  any  form  of  consumer discrimination is illegal  securing a fair access  to  credit .  Furthermore,  the  debt  collection  process  should be complying with the law  e.g., collecting a debt  in a harassing or abusive way is illegal .  Note that the preceding regulation list is in the context of the US law and the  SEC considered as the authority here, while the European system has its own  regulatory  body.  One  of  these  bodies  of  the  P2P  financing  in  the  United  Kingdom is the Financial Conduct Authority  FCA . The  form  of  P2P  lending  Rotating  Credit  Association   RCA ,  commonly  practiced in many countries including the United States, the United Kingdom,  Asia, and Africa, has been controversial due to the usury issues associated  with this form of lending. This is because RCAs are commonly formed between  members with regular contributions to a common pool, which is sequentially  distributed to each member. In most cases, this form of lending relies on a  social trust, and high interest rates are set  about 30%  to offset potential  default. As a result, countries like the United States and Canada have usury  laws  that  prevent  excessive  interest  rates  on  loans   e.g.,  Revised  Code  of  Washington  RCW  19.52 . This law does not exist in the United Kingdom,  which  has  served  a  tax  haven  for  the  US  payday  lenders.  This  also  is  an  indication  for  some  of  the  problems  associated  with  the  global  regulatory  framework disparities in the P2P lending market. Marot  2014  analyzed the expected returns in the P2P online lending market  in connection with the probability of default underlying each loan. Accordingly,  he predicted that the risk of default varies with time during the loan period  and that there is an increasing risk of default with time, which will start to  decline when the loan is close to maturity. According to Emekter et al.  2015 ,  loan  grade,  debt-to-income  ratio,  credit  score   FICO ,  and  revolving  line  utilization have a significant effect on the probability of default. In the same  line, Funk et al.  2015  have presented a detailed review on the factors that  define  borrower’s  probability  of  successful  loan  origination   liquidity   and  those that determine the probability of successful return to the lender. Here,  they identified a generalized category of borrower characteristics as financial,  demographic, and social like friends and group affiliation  see also Lin  2009   for the categorization of borrower characteristics into hard and soft credit  information .   72  Chapter 2  Crowd-Based Digital Business Models   Main Problems in P2P Online Lending Markets The P2P online lending market is prone to the following key problems: liquidity  risks, fraud, security and operational risks  dangers of fraud, cybercrime, and  operational  outages ,  platform  failure,  risk  of  default,  usury  and  systemic  financial risks due to liquidity, and credit risks in the business cycle. In order  to  tackle  some  of  the  problems  stated  here,  government  regulations,  systematic agreements, and feedback mechanisms are recommended  Zeng,  2013, and Yang and Lee, 2016 . Milne and Parboteeah  2016 , on the other  hand, believe in developing a reliable business process model that can tackle  the underlying problems and industry-wide standardization that help achieve  the legal requirements set by the monitoring authority.  In the UK the related initiative  HM Treasury, 2014  to  develop  standardized  APIs   application  programming  interfaces  for SME data so that transaction information  can be shared by all potential lenders, and not only the  bank providing a business with payment and bank account  services. This standardization could be a further support  for the growth of P2P lending.  —Milne and Parboteeah  2016   The market is prone to a mistrust problem between the borrowers and the  potential  lenders.  In  practice,  the  platforms  make  loan  grading rating  to  identify loans based on their level of risk. This factor displays the inefficiency  of  the  market,  which  has  room  for  improvement  both  for  lenders  and  borrowers.  As  Krumme  and  Herrero   2009   argued,  the  long-term  sustainability of the P2P online lending network depends on the reconciliation  of risk and expected rewards. Moreover, there are formation of third-party  platforms   platforms  with  an  automated  investing  tool:  LendingRobot  and  BlueVestment   for  LendingClub ,  LendingMemo,  etc.   that  thicken  the  P2P  lending  market  layer  with  the  addition  of  middle-ground  players.  Such  platforms cause the market to deviate from its original peer-to-peer nature.  These third parties use automated algorithms that can filter out the credibility  of  the  loans  in  the  platform  in  return  for  the  service  charge  they  receive,  hence replacing the basic individual-level manual filtering mechanism. By doing  so, they indirectly signal those loans with higher potential return, and hence,  they discard the potentially defaulting loans. Information asymmetry risks underlying the market creates difficulties in the  online  P2P  lending  markets’  day-to-day  transactions   see,  e.g.,  Funk  et  al.,  2015;  Lin,  2009;  McIntosh,  2010;  and  Serrano  et  al.,  2015 .  Accordingly,  identifying  credible  borrower’s  identity  is  one  of  the  key  factors  for  the  lenders’ profitability from this kind of investment. Some scholars in the field,  like Serrano et al.  2015 , argue that P2P lending platforms are responsible to    73  provide  accurate  information  on  the  borrower  characteristics  in  order  to  foster the efficiency of the lending process. Numerous P2P lending platforms  are flourishing in this sector of the financial industry. Hence, increasing the  participation rate in these platforms depends on the credibility of the platform  itself  in  addition  to  the  borrowers’  characteristics  and  lenders’  herding  behaviors. Yang and Lee  2016  identified the following three categories of  trust for the credibility of a P2P lending platform:   	 System-based trust through service quality  efficient and  flexible transactions , information accuracy, security, and  systematized  contractual  terms  and  conditions,  which  will also help reduce adverse behaviors arising from the  information asymmetry.   	 Cognitive-based  trust  by  creating  first  impressions  through awareness, reputation, and addressing perceived  risk.   	 Affective-based   trust   from  affection between individuals , for instance, the utilization  of social networking which helps for a long-term strategic  alliance, which builds trust and mutuality.   confidence  developed   Associated with the information asymmetry in this market and mistrust effect,  several types of filtering and reputation methods are at play in the market,  including  third-party  algorithmic  investing,  basic  filtering,  and  community- based reputation. In this regard, Collier and Hampshire  2010  analyzed how  structural and behavioral community signals interact with a borrower’s signals  to the mistrust effect in P2P lending. As a result, they developed a model and  theoretical  application  to  community  reputation  systems,  by  considering  a  person’s social reputation together with an outcome-based reputation, which  produces  an  implied  market-related  reputation.  Hence,  social  capital  risks,  that  is,  the  social  network  and  connections  between  members  that  help  incorporate the soft credit information about the borrower, is considered as  one of the tools to bridge the information gap between borrowers and lenders  in this market  Lin, 2009, and Greiner and Wang, 2009 . Yet, the effect of  social  capital  in  filtering  credible  borrowers  depends  on  the  participants’  creditworthiness where an agent can strategically mask itself under the social  capital shield whenever a group effect is considered. Sabater and Sierra  2002 , on the other hand, analyzed a reputation system  from the individual dimension  i.e., based on direct interaction of individuals  in  the  light  of  outcome-based  reputation ,  social  dimension   i.e.,  extended  social  interaction:  witness,  neighborhood,  and  system  reputation  based  on  the role played by a target agent , and ontological dimension  i.e., a complex  reputation  mechanism  based  on  a  combination  of  other  related  behavioral  structures of an individual agent . In addition to these three dimensions, the    74  Chapter 2  Crowd-Based Digital Business Models  reputation  system  they  recommend  also  takes  into  account  an  outcome  reputation deviation, where greater variability in rating values implies volatility  of the target agent in fulfilling her promises. Since the operations managed by humans are carried out through an online  interface, the P2P lending ecosystem encompasses both technical and human  factors.  The  underlying  rational  human  behaviors   both  on  the  side  of  borrowers and lenders , which autonomously interact through the facilitation  of the technical ebusiness system, define the efficiency of the market. The  problems arising from the human and technical factors can easily make the  system a complex and hard one to control. It is also worth noting that the  human  factors  play  a  prominent  role,  and  the  way  a  technical  algorithm  responds to manage such factors accordingly is one of the key indices of the  efficiency of the system. Furthermore,  individual  investors  in  the  conventional  P2P  lending  markets  today face stiff competition from the institutional investors that can relatively  better sink the potential risks with the economies of scale at an institutional  level. Moreover, unlike the private investors who are not commonly financial  experts, the institutional investors have their own credit algorithms that help  them evaluate loan pricings  e.g., TruSight by the Ranger Capital Group . For  instance,  in  the  United  States,  like  the  New  York-based  investment  firm  Eaglewood Capital,36 there are many financial institutions that invest in the  P2P lending marketplaces risks. In 2016, banks invested in more than 25% of  the loans in LendingClub;37 institutional investors bought more than 50% of  the P2P loans in LendingClub and Prosper.38 Such a scramble over the P2P  lending by institutional investors can draw us back to the legacy centralized  financial market, rather than the genesis collaborative economic system built  in  the  P2P  sectors.  In  this  like  setting,  it  is  clear  that  the  forerunning  P2P  lending  marketplaces  will  through  time  be  monopolized  or  taken  over  by  institutional investors and a vicious circle of capitalist system persists, not the  collaborative economic setting.   Value Co-creation in P2P Online Lending Market Peer-to-peer  lending  marketplaces  provide  services  matching  potential  investors  with  borrowers  on  online  platforms,  thereby  serving  borrowers’  and  lenders’  interests.  Unlike  the  classical  setting  risks  in  which  lenders  determine  the  loan  rate  through  bidding  for  prices,  nowadays  rates  are   36 www.ft.com content b0696414-3f3f-11e3-9657-00144feabdc0 37 https:  bankinnovation.net allposts operations sales-mark lending-club-talks-   transforming-banking-but-banks-fund-25-of-its-loans   38 www.ft.com content 28247fe4-6597-11e2-a17b-00144feab49a   75  assigned centrally by the platforms based on the credit score of borrowers   see  Prosper  Rating39 .  Non-qualifying  borrowers  are  filtered  out  from  the  market, and loan notes that satisfy the credit grade standard of the platforms  are approved for credit listing. In most cases, about 90% of loan applications  are filtered out of the market  e.g., LendingClub and Prosper . These platforms  use  loan  approval  credit  and  pricing  models  for  assigning  rates  to  the  applications based on their level of risk. Yet, some of the models applied by  LendingClub and Prosper had raised legal issues, because their current loan  ratings  were  claimed  to  violate  the  state  interest  rate  caps  in  the  United  States.40 By the fourth quarter of 2019, LendingClub issued about $56.8 billion  loans.41 Another form of the P2P lending is the non-profit lending market  e.g., Kiva  and Zidisha . The interaction in this form of global level P2P lending networks  is  co-utile,  in  which  a  chain  of  interaction  between  the  P2P  microfinance  website, local microfinance institutions  MFIs , borrowers, and the non-profit  humanitarian lenders is formed in a mutually beneficial way. Here, the MFIs  get capital at a near-zero cost, the MFI borrowers are linked to the potential  lenders through the global lending website, and the non-profit global lending  site  links  lenders  to  the  MFI  borrowers.  Note  also  that  the  probability  of  default and the level of information asymmetry are larger in the non-profit  lending markets. Kiva  uses  a  multi-tiered  system  of  credit  scoring  for  rating  the  local  microfinance institution  MFIs . By overviewing the Kiva’s internal monitoring  system  and  considering  the  strategic  incentives  created  by  MFIs,  McIntosh   2010  showed that, if a borrower on Kiva listing defaults, it’s highly probable  that the MFI  who gets capital from Kiva at a 0% interest rate  will cover the  repayment  in  order  to  keep  its  Kiva  score  high,  and  consequently,  Kiva’s  reputation scheme doesn’t directly ensure the underlying reliability of the end  users. Hence, unlike successfully rating the institutions, the rating mechanism  employed in this platform is far from being directed to the individual borrowers.  Hence, this and other related factors make the non-profit P2P lending different  from  the  individual  peers’  level  analysis  of  the  profit-oriented  P2P  lending  market.  39 www.prosper.com plp invest prosper-ratings  40 See an article by Matt Scully of Bloomberg Business on August 31, 2015, for the details  on this: www.bloomberg.com news articles 2016-02-25 microsoft-says-it-will-  file-an-amicus-brief-to-support-apple  41 See  LendingClub  total  loan  issuance  from  2012  to  2019  at  www.lendingclub.com   info statistics.action   76  Chapter 2  Crowd-Based Digital Business Models   Investment Decision in P2P Online Lending The  following  key  points  are  vital  in  characterizing  and  understanding  P2P  online lending markets:   	 There is asymmetric information.  	 The P2P online lending market is perfectly competitive   with a large number of borrowers and lenders.   	 Lenders are risk-averse and borrowers are risk-neutral.  Hence, a borrower’s utility function is weakly concave in  that  they  can  be  risk-neutral   or  risk-averse  in  some  exceptional cases with lower impatience to borrow . On  the other hand, lenders who invest in the loan notes of  anonymous  borrowers  have  strictly  concave  utility  function  strictly risk-averse .   	 Lenders  and  borrowers  are  expected  to  be  utility   maximizers, with strictly increasing preferences.   	 The  income  of  the  borrower  and  the  loan  amount  originated are exogenously defined, and strategic default  is an endogenous factor depending on the loan type.   	 There  is  a  visible  deterministic  functional  relationship  between the loan type  based on the level of risk  and  the interest rate assigned to it, which is trivial from the  intrinsic quality of the loan.  In the discussions that follow, I will take two different cases to analyze the  market depending on re-investment possibilities.   Case 1: Lender Cannot Borrow This is a unidirectional investment scenario in which loans are originated only  by potential lenders. In this case, lending and borrowing tasks are performed  by two disjoint groups  borrowers and lenders .  Borrower We  assume  that  there  are  no  constraints  on  the  payment  profile  and,  as  stated previously, borrowers are risk-neutral. This means that they will only  be  concerned  by  the  origination  of  the  loan  at  any  cost  given  the  level  of  urgency of the need for loan financing. Based on the formula for calculation of  present value of annuities, the present value of a loan amount l0 with future   annuity payments, P, is given by  a n i  , where n is the number of   n   -  i  1  =  - +  1 i   77  terms of the loan  commonly 3–5 years’ terms in online P2P lending market   and i is the per period random interest rate, accounting for risk premium. This  accounts for the time value of money  interest rate , and the future value and  present value are linear in the amount of payments of the loan. The present  value of monthly payments of P is PV i, n  = P. an ∣ i. From this follows that the  payoff to the borrower after the origination of the loan is the net gain over  the loan term discounted to present value. Hence, borrower’s net gain from   n   −  i  − +  1 1 i  l0  = −  the loan origination, Πb, is  Õb depends  on  the  borrower’s  residual  income  after  the  loan  repayment  is  discounted to its present value over the term of the loan at a presumed level  of impatience: the more patient the borrower is over her current financial  need, the more she can wait before borrowing.  . The utility of the borrower   P  .  Lender Risk diversification through an investment portfolio is common in P2P online  lending. For lending as an investment, preferences on loan notes depend on  the  respective  expected  return  from  each  loan.  Hence,  a  rational  investor  composes  her  portfolio  of  investment  with  loan  notes  that  can  guarantee  optimal expected return. From the portfolio of investment, our focus is on  the individual interaction of a lender with each individual borrower, provided  that there is a diverse probability of default across the borrowers. Investment  on an individual note depends on the expected return for that note. The market interaction between a large number of borrowers and lenders  defines the optimal interest rate for different loan type categories. Edelstein  et  al.   2003   argue  that  the  volatility  in  the  interest  rate,  the  covariation  among market interest rates, the borrower collateral and income, the loan  term, and the risk preference of borrowers and lenders determine the optimal  loan interest rate contracts. The lender’s profit is the difference between the  cost of funds and loan repayments by the borrower. Krumme and Herrero   2009  predicted that lenders in the P2P market fail to maximize the expected  payoff,  where  there  is  suboptimal  behavior  by  lenders  because  of  the  investment preference for riskier and highly defaulting loans. They argued that  a lender investing in a higher credit grade scoring has greater expected payoff  than one investing in a lower grade, as there is a high rate of default associated  with a low loan grade. With a large number of lenders, the loan market is competitive and there is a  minimum  non-zero  spread  between  the  contract  and  market  interest  rate  below  which  no  lending  occurs.  Lenders  identify  a  potential  probability  of  default based on the observable borrower attributes that generally depict the  borrower’s  creditworthiness  based  on  past  record  of  a  given  borrower    78  Chapter 2  Crowd-Based Digital Business Models  characteristics  McIntosh, 2010 . Note that a lender aims at profit maximization  which is the sum of profits from the loan origination to all potential borrowers  from her portfolio of investment across the notes. The lending rate across the notes can differ depending on the level of riskiness  of  the  target  borrower.  Provided  this,  a  lender’s  profitability  depends  on  probability of repayment of each borrower, interest rates, and the size of each  note in the portfolio composition. Lenders choose to invest in the notes of a  P2P lending market if the return rates are high enough to compensate for the  loss, which implies that the higher the interest rates are, the more likely the  lender will be willing to invest in the risky notes. However, the valuation of  the  loans  in  the  conventional  P2P  lending  markets  is  questionable.  In  this  regard, Emekter et al.  2015  argue that the higher interest rate charged on  riskier  loans  at  the  LendingClub  is  not  enough  to  offset  the  associated  incremental  risk  due  to  default  by  comparing  the  theoretical  interest  rate  with the actual one set for the loans at the LendingClub. In  line  with  this,  Iyer  et  al.   2009   contend  borrower’s  creditworthiness  depends on factors other than the platforms’ rating and argue that about 28%  of the interest spread between the highest credit grade  AA  and that of the  lowest grade  HR  in the Prosper Marketplace is due to the other borrower  characteristic variables. Likewise, the loan grades in the LendingClub accurately  predicted about 60% to 80% of the loans’ probability of default  Serrano et al.,  2015 . Yet the remaining inaccuracy with the predictive power of the loan  grades calls for a more robust technique that could handle the potential credit  risks underlying the market and hence keep the accuracy of lenders’ expected  profit.   Case 2: Lending with Re-investable Borrowing Another scenario to be considered is one in which re-investment is possible.  That is, lenders can also borrow from others to re-invest in the same market.  Here, the lender is assumed to rely on short-term loans for extending long- term loans to her borrowers. In this case, individual lenders mimic banks in  that they rely on borrowing in addition to their own capital to make loans for  profit.  Thus,  investors  make  profit  through  arbitrage  opportunities  in  the  market,  P2P  loan  carry  trade.  P2P  loan  carry  trade  refers  to  an  investment  technique  seeking  profit  from  the  spread  in  interest  rates  in  re-investable  borrowing of the online P2P lending market. Lenders maximize profit by choosing how much they would like to lend and  the loan type, based on their risk preference by taking the lending rates as  given.  Rational  players  engage  in  the  market  to  maximize  their  respective  financial  goals.  As  long  as  their  respective  goals  are  met,  there  is  a  self- enforcing mutually beneficial interaction between the borrowers and lenders  in the market.   79   Proposed Mechanism for P2P Online Lending As  previously  stated,  mistrust  is  identified  as  one  of  the  main  problems  underlying the P2P online lending market. In this section, I will briefly discuss  the  solution  concept  we  proposed  in  our  prior  study  of  this  market.  This  solution concept is the decentralized co-utile reputation mechanism  Turi et al.,  2017, and Domingo-Ferrer et al., 2016b . The mechanism outputs a global  reputation  for  each  target  agent  that  is  computed  by  a  set  of  anonymous  score  managers,  who  take  as  input  local  reputation  scores  derived  from  interactions of the target agent with other agents. Thanks to its fully decentralized nature, the mechanism does not rely on a  central authority to compute reputations. A central authority is problematic  for at least two reasons:   1.  Possible biases in the reputation calculation introduced  by the authority for its own benefit  which would break  co-utility    2.  Privacy  issues  caused  by  the  systematic  compilation  of  agents’ opinions and reputations by a sole central entity  Beyond avoiding a central authority, the protocol also presents several other  features that make it interesting for P2P lending, such as   	   	 Anonymity: Being fully distributed, the protocol relies on  agents’ collaboration in order to compute reputations.  However, agents remain anonymous to each other during  the  calculation  process,  which  prevents  them  from  colluding in order to distort a target agent’s reputation  for their own benefit. Low overhead: Even though a distributed protocol usually  requires more information exchanges than a centralized  one,  the  protocol  limits  the  number  of  messages  and  communication  compute  reputations. Moreover, the reputation calculation can be  done  in  parallel  and  without  interfering  with  the  main  purpose of the P2P network. Proper  management  of  new  agents:  Newcomers  do  not  gain  any  reputation  benefit,  and  hence  agents  cannot  expect  to  neutralize  a  bad  reputation  by  taking  a  new  identity  which in turn disincentivizes bad behaviors .  iterations   needed   to    	   80  Chapter 2  Crowd-Based Digital Business Models   	 Attack  tolerance:  The  protocol  is  also  robust  against  a  number of tampering attacks, both targeted at increasing  the  agents’  own  reputation  and  at  decreasing  the  reputation  of  others.  In  fact,  agents  trying  to  tamper  with reputations can be easily detected by others  and  punished by lowering their reputations .  The  protocol  calculates  reputations  based  on  the  well-known  EigenTrust  model   Kamvar  et  al.,  2003 ,  which  distinguishes  between  local  and  global  agent reputations. Local reputation refers to the reputation score  trust  of  an  individual  target  agent,  computed  by  another  agent,  who  had  a  direct  transaction with her. The global reputation of an agent is the aggregation of  each local reputation value computed by the agents who directly interacted  with her. The global reputation in a P2P lending is the overall reputation score  of  a  borrower  based  on  the  local  reputations  obtained  from  a  set  of  transactions she undertook with a set of lenders in the market. This score, if  available, is the one used as an immediate reference for the future credible  potential transaction. A simplified computation of a lending transaction is presented in Figure 2-4,  in which a score manager i computes the global reputation score of a single  borrower k. The figure depicts a graph with local-trust-value weighted nodes  of a network of interaction of peer k. The computation of k´s global reputation,  ˆg k , by a single score manager, SMk, is based on their network of interaction.  Figure 2-4.  Co-utile reputation calculation  SMk and  SMj2 j2, respectively    are the score managers of k and    81  A decentralized co-utile reputation system for the P2P online lending market  is defined as an electronic system using a distributed chain of computation  that signals the creditworthiness of a given borrower for a potential transaction  to be handled by a specific platform. This is done by formally embedding the  actual performance or reputation effects into the information system of the  P2P  marketplace.  Based  on  the  calculation  of  local  and  global  reputation  values, we can build a trust-oriented and strictly peer-to-peer lending market, in  contrast to the current P2P lending market, which needs a middle layer and  hence is not strictly P2P. The system is set in such a way to encompass the  type of loans and underlying behaviors of the participating agents. The co-utile nature of the aforementioned reputation protocol applied to P2P  lending lies in the mutual benefit of agents computing the reputation, that is,  the lenders: if borrowers can also lend, then all agents are interested in the  availability of a reliable reputation to assess the loan risk; if borrowers cannot  lend, then only lenders are interested in computing reliable reputations, and  mutual benefit holds between lenders. Co-utility, and in particular the self- enforcing nature of the protocol, ensures correct computation of reputations  by lenders, with no incentive to deviate. Furthermore, the key characterizing features of the co-utile reputation system  depicted earlier have a significant potential for improving the efficiency of the  P2P  online  lending  market.  For  instance,  the  decentralized  nature  of  the  protocol  assures  the  operation  of  the  market  without  central  authorities.  This has a very important advantage in extending the operation of P2P lending  practices  beyond  geographic  boundaries  where  there  is  no  common  legal  framework that binds individuals across the globe to specific rules. In addition,  decentralization eliminates third-party platforms acting as intermediaries and  hence reduces operational costs. Furthermore, the self-enforcing property of  this protocol ensures correct computation of reputations, without incentive  to deviate. Moreover, the proper management of new agents embodied in this protocol  can  be  useful  in  guaranteeing  differentiation  of  existing  players  from  new  entrants,  which  also  will  resolve  one  of  the  underlying  problems  in  the  community-based lending. In this regard, one of the prominent examples can  be  the  problem  underlying  the  community-based  reputation  mechanism   Hildebrand  et  al.,  2014,  and  Collier  and  Hampshire,  2010   in  which  communities  signal  the  creditworthiness  of  an  individual  member  agent.  A  finding by Krumme and Herrero  2009  shows one of the drawbacks underlying  the community-based reputation, where the lenders’ preference pattern with  regard  to  credit  grade  remains  unchanged  across  community  groups  with  different  reputation  and,  hence,  there  is  no  identification  effect  of  the  community-based reputation when combined with the credit grading effect.  Such a reputation mechanism has a problem with the management of new  entrants because if a previously existing community has poor loans, it would    82  Chapter 2  Crowd-Based Digital Business Models  be easier to start all over with a new community of no history. A specific case  is  a  seller  with  a  poor  rating  in  eBay:  he  will  be  rationally  interested  in  whitewashing  his  reputation  by  mutating  into  a  new  seller  with  a  new  pseudonym.  New  entrants  can  be  filtered  out  with  the  underlying  zero  reputation  score,  and  loans  with  higher  risk  are  already  priced  at  a  higher  interest rate. This implies that in order for a borrower to obtain a trusted  loan  in favorable conditions , she should have a positive normalized reputation  value from her local transaction score. The adaptation of the aforementioned  decentralized co-utile reputation protocol to the P2P online lending market  promises to deter whitewashing and improve the efficiency of the system. The decentralized computation of the reputation is done by score managers,  who  are  defined  for  each  borrower  using  a  distributed  hash  table   DHT    Domingo-Ferrer et al., 2016b . A score manager computes the borrower’s  global reputation based on the local reputation fetched from the set of direct  transactions by the borrower. The electronic system must publicly maintain  the  computed  reputation  score  of  each  agent  within  the  market,  and  it  is  continually  updated  with  upcoming  transactions   reputation  scores  can  be  updated on a daily or a weekly basis . Once the global reputation for each  agent in the market is computed in a decentralized way, transactions are more  predictable to a rational investor. Before deciding to lend money to a borrower,  a potential lender asks the reputation system for the global reputation of the  borrower or directly refers to the local reputation she gave to the borrower  if a transaction took place between the two in the past. In some cases, where  there is a direct transaction record between the borrower and lender, the  lender might realize a variation between the global reputation score and that  of the local reputation record she has about the borrower. In this case, she  compares the two and takes the one with a lower value for further investment  decisions regarding k. The normalized local reputation score identifies if the  borrower is credible  positive reputation values  or if she is a defaulting type  or just a borrower with a first-time loan request in this market  zero reputation  value .  In  addition,  the  global  reputation  score  reveals  the  borrower’s  creditworthiness based on her weighted local reputation scores. Since  P2P  loans  have  no  collateral,  reputation  capital   reputation  of  the  borrower  is intangible collateral of this transaction. A borrower defaults if  the value of default is greater than the value of paying back. Her gain from the  default is the loan amount originated, given an initial presumed small positive  reputation of the system. Yet, with the current transaction’s default, she will  also  lose  her  reputation.  Thus,  reputation  gain  punishes  an  intention  to  default. Figure  2-5  depicts  the  workflow  of  the  decentralized  reputation  protocol  when applied to the online P2P lending market. In the figure, consider that a  potential lender, A, in an online lending market wants to invest in the loan  requests of borrower, B. The various steps of Figure 2-5 are as follows:   83   1.  B is a registered borrower in a platform.  2.    A  set  of  lenders,  J,  who  had  past  transactions  with  borrower B give local reputation scores to B.  The  reputation  system  in  the  platform  assigns  a  global  reputation  score  for  each  member  based  on  a  decentralized  co-utile  reputation  protocol.  Hence,  the  score manager of B queries the set J and computes the  global  reputation  of  B  based  on  the  transitive  trust  assumption.  A potential lender A queries the global reputation system  for the reputation scores of his target notes, in order to  make  investment  decisions  on  her  preferred  loan  note  out of the entire return rate category based on her risk  preference.  In addition to checking the global reputation score of B,  according to the implementation rules of the protocol, if  investor A has already interacted with borrower B and,  thus, has calculated a local reputation value, then A can  make her investment decision by directly referring to B’s  local  reputation.  Here,  self-experience  is  considered  a  good  reference  point.  However,  local  and  global  reputation  values  may  not  always  be  the  same,  since  global  reputation  is  a  weighted  sum  of  all  the  local  reputations that borrower B has. In that case, it is better  for A to take both valuations into account and make the  investment  decision  based  on  the  comparison  of  these  values  with a negative bias, taking the one with the lower  reputation value .  The potential transaction between lender A and borrower  B is realized based on B’s reputation.   3.    4.    5.    6.    84  Chapter 2  Crowd-Based Digital Business Models  Figure 2-5.  Workflow of the decentralized co-utile reputation system for P2P lending  Note  that  Figure  2-5  is  drawn  under  the  assumption  of  non-diversified  investment   for  simplicity  of  presentation ,  whereas  investors  can  have  a  portfolio of diversified investment. The application of the reputation protocol to the P2P lending market helps  neutralize the negative utilities arising in the market. With a perfect trust and  exact valuation of notes in the market, participation in the P2P online lending  market offers the highest possible reward. The reason is that investment in a  P2P online lending market generates better rewards than traditional banking  market, because   1.    2.    Many  loans  that  would  not  have  been  approved  by  traditional  banks  are  listed  for  financing  in  these  marketplaces with a relatively higher rates of return.  The  reputation  protocol  can  help  the  identify  creditworthiness of the individual borrower  which helps  exploit all potential loan listings  so that investing in that  borrower’s note is better for a rational utility-maximizing  lender.  Moreover, there is no way for the lender to get a better payoff without getting  the borrower worse off  maybe through increased rate of return or refusal to  finance . In the same way, it is not possible for the borrower to get a better  payoff without a decrease in the lender’s payoff  maybe through defaulting or  imposition of a lower rate of return . A  limitation  of  this  reputation  approach  is  that  it  is  outcome-based  and  it  does not take into account the individual behaviors other than the specific  transactions, based on past records of the transaction. Also, it fails to leverage  any  previous  reputations  available  for  newcomers   who  are  assigned  zero  reputation with the aim of thwarting whitewashing .   85   Summary Crowdfunding  platforms  facilitate  the  match  between  the  entrepreneurs,  investors, and backers and hence should be designed in such a way that all the  players  communicate  the  transactional  information  and  maximize  their  respective  utilities.  Even  if  crowdfunding  has  been  a  very  relevant  funding  source of the collaborative economy in the recent few years, it has not yet  reached maturity and access to the greater share of the global population.  Hence, there is still a potential for this industry to increase its current trend  of  growth  to  its  fullest  potential.  In  addition,  redefining  the  crowd-based  business model to fit a variety of project types, as well as flexible applicability  under various conditions  mainly in developing countries as an alternative to  the existing microfinance models , can be avenues for further research. There  is  a  need  to  understand  and  examine  the  dynamics  of  the  crowdfunding  industry and its potential to be applicable to any type of project financing and  attract the largest number of backers investors. Here, considerations in the  design of incentive schemes should be the dynamics of the market with time,  factors that affect the success of a given crowdfunding campaign, networking  effect,  self-enforcing  reputation  scheme,  crowdfunding  type,  project  type,  methods of reward, and so on. Note also that incentive design is at the core  of the collaborative economy. As discussed earlier, reputation is the backbone of the collaborative economy,  which is in general prone to the information asymmetry risk. A direction for  future work is to take a stride toward merging the outcome-based reputation  with the social reputation  using state-of-the-art social media, like Facebook,  Twitter, Instagram posts, or LinkedIn connections in which a bunch of personal  data are available  and with the market-related reputation  such as Amazon  or eBay purchases and credit card expenses or length of phone calls . This will  help  consider  the  initial  reputation  of  the  target  agent’s  behavior  in  these  social networks and markets other than in the platform under review. As a  result,  a  richer  and  multi-dimensional  understanding  of  the  borrower’s  foreseeable behavior will be reached. Extending global reputation in this way  will also pave the way to new risk assessment methods, not merely reliant on  outcome-based reputation  which only considers credit history, credit scores,  and such like . Hence, the next question will be how to best use the data from  the social media, other marketplaces, and all other information sources for  the reputation purpose in P2P lending markets. A promising avenue is to seek an aggregated reputation. This can be done by  integrating  outcome-based,  social,  and  market-related  reputations  for  P2P  online lending. Here, proper weights for each reputation type, including the  target peer’s economic, commercial, and social records beyond the lending  market,  should  be  set  while  properly  punishing  malicious  peers.  Such  a  compounded reputation can clarify the expected behavior of an agent much  more accurately. For example, an individual can be reputed loyal if she has a    86  Chapter 2  Crowd-Based Digital Business Models  good  reputation  of  not  defaulting  on  previous  loans,  being  loyal  in  social  interactions, having a stable income base, having a stable credit card record,  not being bankrupt or in a devastated economic condition that would prevent  paying back, being careful, and so on. Thus, it would be highly interesting to  develop such an integrated reputation. This  chapter  also  covered  another  form  of  crowd-based  digital  business  model, crowdsourcing. This model has proved efficiency in outsourcing a task  to  a  large  number  of  people  via  the  Web.  Tasks  listed  in  centralized  marketplaces  or  open  source  platforms  can  be  paid  or  unpaid.  The  non- financial rewards underlying some of the crowdsourced tasks have redefined  the classical theories of labor allocation and wage determination.

The chapter provides a conceptual review  of blockchain tech economics by organizing dispersed thoughts in the field.    Abeba N. Turi 2020 A. N. Turi, Technologies for Modern Digital Entrepreneurship,   https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-6005-0_3   88  Chapter 3  Web 3.0: The Distributed Information Network Economy  The technology is one of the forefront developments in the digital economy,  and it facilitates efficient utilization of scarce resources by disintermediating  the  traditional  business  models.  Besides  cryptographic  techniques  and  algorithmic  consensus  mechanisms,  the  value  co-creation  process  and  the  consensus  on  an  update  of  a  state  for  blockchain-powered  distributed  networks  relies  on  the  economic  theories  of  mechanism  design  and  cryptoeconomics. Such networks are composed of rational economic units,  and their economic characterization will help better understand the system  and  its  dynamics  in  light  of  the  existing  economic  and  business  models.  Decentralized  platforms  under  this  economic  system  have  opened  the  potential for new ways of exchange over the Internet and broader financial  inclusion. Here, I will cover the panorama of the distributed ledger technologies  with  further  discussions  on  blockchain-powered  nano-economies  and  tokenization, asset valuation, cryptocurrency markets, and some foundation  on  cryptoeconomics  and  consensus  mechanisms.  I  will  also  present  a  discussion on the governance of decentralized Web 3.0 economies and open  source projects by taking the case of the QuadrigaCX.1   Distributed Ledger Technologies Blockchain  broadly speaking, distributed ledger technologies  refers to a type  of distributed digital ledger that facilitates the transfer of an item of value in a  distributed way. Every block contains a group of valid transaction records and  attributes of the transacted item in a given period. Token sales  commonly,  secure token offering  STO  or initial coin offering  ICO   for mining  issuing   digital  coins  or  mining  transactions  are  the  most  common  funding  models  employed under this system. The technology deemed to allow decentralization  of  the  notion  of  trust  using  cryptography  and  peer-to-peer  verification  mechanisms  that  enables  issuance  of  cryptocurrencies  such  as  Bitcoin  and  other nano-economy tokens. Some scholars argue that blockchains operate  as trust machines  see, e.g., Vigna and Casey, 2019  and some question the  tech as a trust machine  see, e.g., Hileman and Rauchs, 2017 . Key features of the distributed ledger and blockchain technologies make it  attractive  to  financial  institutions  and  other  transactional  networks.  These  key features are      Security of the transaction: The tech is distributed, secured  with  cryptographic  validation  of  transactions,  and  effi- cient, and transaction records are transparent.  1 One of Canada’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges which was issued a Termination and  Bankruptcy Assignment Order by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia early April 2019,  www.quadrigacxtrustee.com    89              Efficient in transaction processing time and cost: A one-time  data  entry  in  a  distributed  way  without  a  double  and  separate record of events resulting in a significant reduction  in costs of data reconciliation, checks, and transfers. Support  of  smart  contracts:  A  smart  contract   a.k.a.  chaincode  of  business  rules  in  the  Hyperledger  Fabric  language   refers  to  a  computer  program  for  a  digital  agreement built on top of a given protocol. Transparent and distributed records of transactions: Building  an  enterprise  business  on  top  of  blockchain  platforms  helps for a secure transparent traceability and audit of the  business  process  transparently,  hence  increasing  the  business  efficiency  by  reducing  transaction  costs.  For  instance,  a  well-built  banking  blockchain  network  can  improve the monitoring of payments and immutable audits  as they go across different banks and helps in speeding up  payments and lowering costs. In the banking sector, where  security  is  at  the  forefront,  a  permissioned  blockchain  technology  is  viable  for  a  faster,  more  accurate,  secure,  and  transparent  banking  operation  like  processing  of  payments and reconciliation of transaction records.   Panorama of the Distributed  Ledger Technologies Blockchain technology is known for its versatile features in which it can be  adapted to a broader set of functions beyond the hard-core cryptocurrencies.2  It can be utilized for any transfer of an item of value in peer-to-peer  P2P - based networks. Some applications of blockchain technology to transactional  record systems and financial services, other than the cryptocurrencies, include  securities  settlement,  currency  exchange,  supply  chain  management,  green  energy  trading,  P2P  transfers,  asset  registration,  correspondent  banking,  regulatory  reporting  and  anti-money  laundering   AML   rules,  provenance,  property rights, finance  payments, record of business transaction agreements  like  bonds,  invoice  financing,  letter  of  credit,  transaction  settlement  in  international trades, etc. , healthcare, environmental protection,3 and so on.  2 See Swan, M.  2015 .

IDC Market Glance depicts Blockchain segments of the growing  blockchain industry and vendors that are offering solutions worldwide as of  the year 2019.4 These platforms can generally be categorized as Bitcoin-based  platforms, FinTech Blockchain platforms, smart contract platforms, institutional  Blockchain  platforms   commonly  consortium  or  private  blockchains ,  and  sidechain platforms. In its current form, it is hard to tell whether the technology  is a bubble or a sustainable solution toward enhancing the efficiency of the  digital economic system. However, the technology has a considerable potential  to  meet  its  expectations  or  at  least  be  a  base  for  the  forerunning  new  technological solutions that rely on its fundamentals as a stepping-stone. Some of the companies and vendors offering blockchain solutions worldwide  include Ripple Labs Inc., Genpact Ltd., MaidSafe.net Ltd., Bitmark Inc., TIBCO  Software  Inc.,  IOTA  Foundation,  Chronicled,  Inc.,  MultiPlan,  Inc.,  Virtusa  Corporation, Google Inc., Beijing Dajie Zhiyuan Information Technology Co.,  Ltd.,  The  Boston  Consulting  Group  Inc,  OpenBazaar,  Bank  of  England,  US  Securities and Exchange Commission, AlphaPoint Corp., BlockCypher, Inc.,  Microsoft Corporation, and so on.5 The technology is in the early stages of adoption in the banking sector mainly  in  the  intra-bank  cross-border  payments   e.g.,  Royal  Bank  of  Canada  is  exploring  the  potential  of  the  tech  for  its  payments  of  Canadian  and  US  banks . In its current form, it is hard to tell whether the technology is a bubble  or  a  sustainable  solution  toward  enhancing  the  efficiency  of  the  digital  economic  system.  The  Gartner  Hype  Cycle  for  blockchain  business  2019  shows that the tech is in a trough of disillusionment and about 5 to 10 years  away  from  transformational  impact.6  However,  the  technology  has  a  considerable potential to meet its expectations or at least be a base for the  forerunning  new  technological  solutions  that  rely  on  its  fundamentals  as  a  stepping-stone.  4 Some  of  the  companies  covered  in  the  IDC  Market  Glance  include  Ripple  Labs  Inc.,  Genpact Ltd., MaidSafe.net Ltd., Bitmark Inc.,  TIBCO Software Inc., IOTA Foundation,  Chronicled, Inc., MultiPlan, Inc., Virtusa Corporation, Google Inc., Beijing Dajie Zhiyuan  Information Technology Co., Ltd., The Boston Consulting Group Inc, OpenBazaar.org,  Bank of England, US Securities and Exchange Commission, AlphaPoint Corp., BlockCypher,  Inc.,  Microsoft  Corporation,  and  so  on;  see  IDC  Market  Glance:  Blockchain  1Q19  at  www.idc.com getdoc.jsp?containerId=US44837919 5 See IDC Market Glance: Blockchain 1Q19 at www.idc.com getdoc.jsp?containerId=  US44837919 6 Gartner.com  available  at  www.gartner.com en newsroom press-releases 2019-10-  08-gartner-2019-hype-cycle-shows-most-blockchain-technologies-are-still- five-to-10-years-away-from-transformational-impact, accessed on April 2, 2020.   91  Enterprise solution Blockchain applications are also worth highlighting here.  Distributed ledger technologies utilized for enterprise solutions, for example,  Hyperledger Blockchains platform from the Linux Foundation, are one of the  promising outcomes from the developments in the field of blockchain tech.  Some  examples  of  the  enterprise  solution  blockchain  include  Hyperledger  Sawtooth   mainly  for  the  supply  chain  management  helping  traceability  of  produce  using  the  Internet  of  Things ,  Hyperledger  Fabric   permissioned  enterprise  blockchain ,  and  Hyperledger  Indy   for  a  distributed  identity  recording .7  These  forms  of  enterprise  blockchain  platforms  are  mostly  permissioned ones in which authorization and task identifications are centrally  assigned.  The  technology  facilitates  the  business  process  within  a  defined  business network while guaranteeing the immutability of data. Provided  that  such  ledger  platforms  are  permissioned  by  nature,  a  legal  compliance check can also be done through read-only access to the external  stakeholder. Still, scalability issues are yet to be addressed to reach the full  potential  of  this  technology  in  most  business  process  applications.  In  this  regard, the possibility for keeping track of and linking data off-chain to related  on-chain data for a specific transaction, known as the archival bond, is a crucial  feature  Lemieux and Sporny, 2017 . For example, in a land registry application  of  the  blockchain,  the  land  transaction  record   i.e.,  the  state  change   is  recorded on the main chain, while the other issues like the purpose of the  transaction and other related information for the state change go to the off- chain record. The archival bond ensures the reconciliation and readability of  both the off-chain and on-chain data to each other.   Tokenization Tokenization, in the context of the digital economy, refers to the modeling of  value  as  a  digital  token.  In  simple  words,  tokenization  is  the  process  of  converting  an  item  of  value  into  digital  tokens.  This  implies  a  tangible  representation of a digital asset through a pledge that helps for valuation and  transfer  of  a  digital  asset.  The  idea  of  a  tokenized  economy  is  not  new.  Tokenization  enables  the  creation  of  new  assets   e.g.,  cryptocurrencies,  property tokens . The English merchant tokens are one example of these like  tokens in the physical world, outside the cryptocurrencies’ space. Historically, coins had intrinsic value being mint out of precious metals like  gold. Like elsewhere, during those days in England, the minting of gold and  silver coins was a royal privilege. However, with the intrinsic value underlying  these coins, the smaller size of coins changes that can reduce in value with the  amount of the precious metal used was infeasible in production and usability.   7 See Hyperledger frameworks at www.hyperledger.org projects   92  Chapter 3  Web 3.0: The Distributed Information Network Economy  Moreover, a shift to other inferior metals like bronze or copper would require  a larger size in order to keep the intrinsic value. Hence, small change coins,  namely, metal tokens with lesser intrinsic value than their face value, were  used for local exchange purposes. During the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, Bristol issued its tokens for circulation  within the city and ten miles around it. Local merchants during that time used  to  privately  produce  small  change   leather,  lead,  and  tin   tokens  and  used  them in their local daily exchanges. These tokens were accepted at their face  value only within that boundary. BerkShares are the other tokens accepted at  retail  stores  in  the  region  of  Massachusetts.  Adams  Community  Bank,  Lee  Bank,  Salisbury  Bank,  and  Trust  Company  and  Pittsfield  Cooperative  Bank  provided  the  exchange  of  BerkShares  for  USD  at  a  rate  of  95  cents  per  BerkShares.8  Ethiopia’s  primitive  money  of  salt  block  token  called  “amole  tchew” is another similar example. During the mid-20th century, local daily  exchanges in the country took place with these locally accepted salt block  tokens,  while  gold  was  used  large-scale  transactions.  Likewise,  cryptocurrency refers to programmable token money which is deployed on a  distributed network.  for    Blockchain-Powered Token Nano-economies The rise of information networks and the advances in information technology  have led to a dramatic shift in the traditional forms of economic systems and  organizations. The logic is that blockchain is a technology that facilitates a  consensus  on  the  state  of  the  world.  Hence,  once  the  consensus  can  be  reached, it is all about to build an entirely new economic system on top of it.  The blockchain network operating with native tokens  cryptocurrencies  as a  unit of value can be represented as an economy with an initial endowment.  The cryptocurrencies injected into the market through the mining process  are the monetary base of that token economy. A token refers to a quantified unit of value and a native token within this like  economy  facilitates  the  exchanges  of  value  through  the  built-in  protocol.  Tokens  can  have  asset,  payment   transfer  of  value ,  security,  equity,  utility  functions, or a hybrid function within the ecosystem they operate. Even if the  market  coverage  for  a  token-based  economy  can  be  global,  the  setting  in  these like markets is confined to its own network and is bound to the holders  of the token. Such platforms are commonly built on three layers: social layer,  data  layer,  and  technical  layer   Lemieux  et  al.,  2019 .  In  general,  economic  agents in such a nano-economy obtain cryptocurrencies for  1  utility purposes  or  2  as a currency for a store of value or  3  payment purpose or as an asset  depending on the type of the cryptocurrency.1  8 www.berkshares.org berkshares_banks, accessed on April 2, 2020.   93  Members of a blockchain network are economic units that participate in the  token economy for a specific transaction purpose. Such networks commonly  are composed of three principal economic units:      The  general  blockchain  network:  The  community  which  utilizes  the  native  token  for  their  consumption  and  production decisions  the token users .     Developers:  Developers  mimic  the  social  planner  policymaker  role  in  the  traditional  economic  setting,  thus drafting the rules of the game in which a decentralized  coordination between participants is achieved.     Validators: Validators verify if the transactions in the token  economy run according to the rules of the game. This  role of the validator in the blockchain network is like the  notary public witnessing signatures on documents in the  traditional economy.  Economic  units  in  the  conventional  cryptocurrency  markets  can  generate  value through either a crypto investment or as miners transaction validators  for the creation of coin and validation of other investors’ transactions. This economic set has its business model in which it injects helicopter9 money  in the form of initial coin offerings or other forms of operating tokens which  I will discuss in Chapter 4 of this book. These native tokens are then used to  exchange items of value  goods and services  in that specific token economy  and also for an exchange to other crypto- or fiat currencies. Further, as the  nano-economy  grows  in  network,  new  tokens  are  minted  and  circulated  within the system. The blockchain technology handles the exchange record  and transaction verification in a distributed setting. Some of the functionalities  on which the token economies are based are in line with the principles of a  free market economic system. In these markets, the price of the tokens and  transaction fees adjust with the market, while the amount of coin creation  over time is algorithmically defined. The blockchain tech facilitates transparency  in the transfer of values created by self-interested economic units. Thus, a  token economic system built on a blockchain tech with an efficient distributed  consensus mechanism is automatic, in that it regulates itself to generate value. Blockchain-powered platforms have structural similarities with the models of  a closed economy, in that there is market clearing in the token economy. The  value  created  is  consumed  by  the  economic  units  in  the  nano-economy.  Besides,  labor  inputs  into  production   extraction  of  the  native  coins  and   9 Helicopter money is a term in monetary economics referring to central banks making  direct payments to individuals, mainly in times of liquidity trap.   94  Chapter 3  Web 3.0: The Distributed Information Network Economy  transaction validation  are supplied by the consumers blockchain network’s  community. For example, Ethereum-based cryptocurrencies with utility value  are spent on services or are earned for performing a task within that specific  platform. In order to see the fixed supply conditions under the cryptocurrencies,  consider  the  liquidity  preference-money  supply  analysis  of  Keynesian  macroeconomic  theory   represented  by  the  liquidity  preference-money  supply, LM, curve . As in the closed economy’s model, the interest rate for the  cryptocurrency  depends  on  the  equilibrium  of  supply  and  demand  for  the  cryptocurrency.  Given  the  amount  of  cryptocurrency  supplied  in  the  blockchain  network,  real  income,  and  real  interest  rate,  the  demand  for  a  cryptocurrency depends on the real income of the blockchain community and  interest  rate  of  the  cryptocurrency.  The  equilibrium  of  a  cryptocurrency  market implies that, given the total amount of cryptocurrency supplied in the  network, the interest rate is an increasing function of the output level. Hence,  assuming a fixed supply of a cryptocurrency, with higher income, the demand  for the cryptocurrency rises and decreases with the increase in the interest  rate   the  rate  at  which  the  cryptocurrency  is  borrowed  and  lent  in  the  cryptocurrency exchange market .1   Value in Token Economies The  valuation  of  things  that  cannot  be  traded  is  a  complex  scenario.  Untradeable things like true friendship are valued by the proxies like the time  we give for the friendship, inviting dinner, or giving presents. Another example,  respect or honor that can be won or reflected  which is exchanged in human  interactions  is one of the human elements that have a value but cannot be  monetized per se. Likewise, reputation commonly referred to as social capital  is some other human element that can be built but not monetized. The  developments  in  trade,  exchange,  and  coinage  have  resulted  in  the  monetary valuation of economic resources. The price valuation of goods and  services within the economy works only for monetized things. However, in  reality, the world is full of many other human interactions that are priceless  and  hence  not  accurately  captured  through  the  conventional  economic  models. One example of this phenomenon is the practice of gifting, which is  one of the nonmonetary social systems. Gift  economies  are  a  much  discussed  and  controversial  topic  among  economists.  The  question  of  “why  people  give  gifts?”  is  a  topic  that  goes  under  behavioral  economics.  One  of  the  key  features  of  a  gift  is  that  it  is  priceless. For example, redacting price stickers from presents implies that the  value of the gift, which is the willingness to give  the value of the item in the  eyes of the bearer , is more important than willingness to pay  price  for that  item. A gift in this sense has a value, but not a price.   95  When a market fails to function well  e.g., a monopolistic market, speculative  market bubbles, or promotional gift for a competitive advantage , prices fail  to capture value. In this case, the willingness to pay correspondence of utility   willingness to pay as a measure of consumers’ satisfaction  fails. Hence, the  notion of tokenization can also have enormous implications for the theoretical  analysis of the gift economy, which has remained a gray field of study and the  value theory in general. Paying a monetary unit for an exchange of goods and services of value is one  of the characteristics underlying currency as a store of value. There is nothing  without value, but not everything can be directly monetized in the traditional  form of monetary units. Thus, tokenization allows the valuation and transfer  of value of any kind through a fungible unit of currency that is accepted within  that specific token economy. Hence, in a token economy, we have a broader  set of values that are accounted for using tokenization than solely a monetary  value.  The  word  “token”  implies  a  sign  or  a  symbol.  In  the  language  of  a  currency unit, tokens signify a currency  digital or physical  that does not have  intrinsic value. For the fiat currencies, this feature of a currency is backed by  a legal tender. On the other hand, digital tokens are quantified units of value  built through a defined protocol. Tokens are fungible  unique  in that they can  be used to indicate any form of value which cannot be quantified using the  traditional form of monetary unit  e.g., we can tokenize the social capital of  an  individual  through  reputation  token  which  is  hard  to  capture  through  a  traditional monetary unit . This introduces a new form of valuation for goods  and services that have previously been undervalued or not measured in terms  of a unit of currency. Tokenization makes it simple to value other forms of  value that cannot be quantified through the traditional monetary units. For example, a crowdsourcing platform can reward participants for every task  they perform based on the reward model of the marketplace. However, how  about a user liking or commenting on content from a social media or a user’s  social capital in a given network? How will that be monetized through a unit  of currency? In this regard, tokenization brings a monetary unit measurement  to  the  next  level.  Unlike  the  fiat  currency,  which  is  indivisible  and  unique,  tokens are fungible, in that it is possible to exchange tokens with different  specific forms of value. A token allows accounting for all values  social, natural,  cultural,  etc.  capital .  Digital  currencies  of  this  form  are  unique  to  their  ecosystem and are programmable currency units in that terms and conditions  for the exchange and use of the token are programmed, often on a smart  contract to run the protocol.   96  Chapter 3  Web 3.0: The Distributed Information Network Economy   Asset Valuations in the Token Economy Agents’ expectation affects the usability of a platform and thus the increase in  the  value  of  the  token.  Most  token  and  cryptocurrency-based  platforms  feature an endogenous response of platform productivity depending on the  size of the network. This is because increased usage of a token results in an  appreciation of the token accompanied by an increase in its value. Thus, such  nano-economies experience endogenous growth.10 According to Cong et al.   2018 , intermediate transactions on decentralized networks and their trading  create an inter-temporal complementarity among users, generating a feedback  loop between token valuation and platform adoption. In this nano-economic  setting, agents’ expectations about the native blockchain application on which  the  token  is  powered  and  the  resulting  network  effect  from  the  broader  usability  of  the  platform  are  significant  contributors  to  the  growth  of  the  token-based  nano-economies.  In  fact,  late  2017  and  beginning  of  2018  has  been  the  time  where  the  price  exploded,  after  which  the  decline  in  the  interest of users resulted in a significant decline of the recent price of bitcoin.11  The fluctuation in the price during this period has further financial explanations  beyond this; however, here we are interested in the network effect that draws  the interest down. Besides, the value of the token underlying the platform and  thus  the  growth  of  the  nano-economy  are  enhanced  by  positive  network  externalities and spillover effects. Network externality refers to the concept  that a change in the product’s value changes as the number of users of the  product changes. Network externality is common in other forms of social  media platforms like LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and so on in which  the user base is significant in the early stages of their adoption. Keeping all other factors constant and ignoring the current price of a token,  let us see the demand and supply curves for a token with a network externality.  The willingness to buy the token with the network externality depends on  how many people use the platform. As stated earlier, the private benefit of  each network participant  token user  increases as the number of participants   10 In macroeconomic theory, Paul Romer  1990  developed a theory of economic growth  with  “endogenous”  technological  change.  The  theory  explains  how  to  construct  an  economy of profit-maximizing agents that endogenize technological progress. Economic  growth, according to this theory, depends on population growth and capital accumula- tion. The robust prediction of the variant of this model is that an increase in population  or  an  increase  in  the  share  of  people  working  in  the  knowledge  sector  will  increase  economic growth.  11 CNBC on June 4, 2018, ran a story, according to which “Google searches for ‘bitcoin’  nosedive 75% this year as interest in struggling cryptocurrency wanes.” Quoting the sig- nificant price increase of about $20,000 in December 2017 and the following fluctuations  in the price of bitcoin, they reported that the prices dropped in 2018 by roughly 50%,  www.cnbc.com 2018 06 04 google-searches-for-bitcoin-nosedive-75-  percent-this-year.html   97  increases. For the ease of presentation, we assume that network participants  are  homogenous   Liebowitz  and  Margolis,  1995 .  Figure  3-1  depicts  the  relationship  between  average  network  benefit   ANB   and  the  size  of  the  network  measured in the number of users of the token . The average network  benefit of a token user within the platform is an index for the willingness to  pay for one unit of network participation, which is positively related to the  number of the token users. Without the network effect, the average benefit  of all the participants is fixed and thus is a horizontal ANB curve. Here, the  marginal network benefit  MNB  is the change in total benefits to users of the  token when an additional token user joins the network. Note that, with the  network eternality, an additional user of the network results in an increase in  the  valuation  of  the  token  and  the  rise  in  the  benefits  for  all  users  of  the  network. Thus, the ANB curve lies below the MNB curve. There are arguments on  whether the marginal cost of a token is near zero.12 Here, by the marginal  cost of a token, we mean the cost of hashing the added block containing this  token, assuming a fixed cost of building the blockchain system running this  application. The associated costs with the creation of a token and mining a  new block depend on the consensus mechanism in play. For instance, in the  proof-of-work  PoW  consensus mechanism, this cost of mining a new block   creating a new token  is the cost of electricity and hardware used for this  purpose. Mining decisions are made if the expected return is higher than the  cost of mining a new block. If the token’s value increases, the profit of mining  at the current difficulty increases. As a result, the number of miners increases,  and the protocol increases the difficulty level. The marginal cost of bitcoin  production is positively related to the computational power, electricity prices,  and energy efficiency of the hardware and is directly associated with the price  of bitcoin  Hayes, 2019 . During periods of excess demand  e.g., the bitcoin  price bubble of the late 2017 and early 2018 , two main forces will be at play  either  individually  or  combined.  These  are  the  decline  in  the  market  price  and or the increase in the mining difficulty  in the case of a proof-of-work  mechanism  to resolve the discrepancy. During the bitcoin bubble, the price  fell and the mining difficulty rose simultaneously. Thus, from the idea that marginal costs are associated with the price of the  token, we can argue that the marginal network cost of a token increases with  the number of tokens used by the network. At the equilibrium, the marginal  benefit  should  equal  marginal  cost.  Under  a  perfectly  competitive  market  structure  which is the case in the decentralized networks of this kind , it  holds that the marginal benefit is also equal to price. The optimal price, p*, is  the  threshold  below  which  a  miner  would  not  participate  in  the  network.   12 Especially, in the collaborative economic settings of the zero marginal cost society; see   Rifkin  2014 .   98  Chapter 3  Web 3.0: The Distributed Information Network Economy  Thus, p* < MBN. The optimal network size under the given cost condition  and  optimal  price  of  the  token  is  q*.  Even  if  there  are  a  large  number  of  miners  suppliers , a unit of token added is only by one of the winning blocks,  thus  keeping  the  equilibrium  at  q*,  unlike  other  forms  of  decentralized  networks which contain many suppliers of the network commodity  Liebowitz  and  Margolis,  1995 .  However,  this  discussion  followed  from  the  PoW  mechanism; the general conclusion applies to most of the other token cases  where  the  exchange indirect  usability  of  digital  currencies  like  bitcoin  and  mainly ethereum are the typical cases in most token economies. Moreover,  despite the different types of cryptoassets, generally speaking, a token of any  kind is a means of exchange, store of value, and unit of account functions in  its blockchain network.

In this regard, the endogenous growth model is ideal for  capturing  the  user  base  effect  in  the  growth  of  the  token  nano-economy.  Following the nonrivalrous idea-based theory of increasing returns20  which is  a variant of Romer’s endogenous growth model , the blockchain platform can  be used at any scale of production after being developed. Given a fixed cost  of  building  the  blockchain  system  that  runs  the  tokenized  application,  the  standard  replication  argument  implies  that  subsequent  value  generation  occurs  with  constant  returns  to  scale.  Including  the  blockchain  system  development, production is characterized by increasing returns. There are two key factors that drive per capita growth in the token nano- economy: network size and increasing returns to scale  growth in the network  size results in growth of the scale of the token economy, where the increasing  returns to scale of the value of the nano-economy translates the growth in  scale into growth in per capita income   Jones, 1997 .  19 https:  coinmarketcap.com currencies bitcoin historical-data ?start=20  120320&end=20200320  20 Jones,  C.  I.   1997 .

National Bureau of Economic Research   102  Chapter 3  Web 3.0: The Distributed Information Network Economy  ,     The following formulation explains how a value of a token and the expected  returns to users increases with the scale of adoption and usage of the token,  thus a network effect. Note: a network effect is a phenomenon in which the  benefit for users of a given product increases as more members use the same  product  or  service.  Augmenting  the  idea-based  theory,  assume  a  given  exogenous user base growth,  N N n = > 0 N0 > 0, where Nt is the user base  of  the  platform  at  time  t.  Let  Yt  be  the  quantity  of  a  single  consumption  output good produced, and let Tt be the state of blockchain technology over  which  the  token  economy  is  built.  The  output  in  this  case  is  the  token  underlying the nano-economy. The state of a blockchain protocol depends on  the  technological  shocks  in  cryptography,  cryptoeconomics,  consensus  mechanisms, related technologies  complementary or substitute , regulatory  issues, and the users’ preferences.21 Empirically, considering the state of the  tech constant here is crucial. This is mainly due to the rigorously dynamic  environment  of  the  blockchain  space  which  is  used  by  technically  non- sophisticated general users, except the developer community. The production function of the token economy Yt = Tσ t Nut, where Nut is the  user base of the platform  including the investors token holders and those  working for the validation of the transaction taking place in the blockchain  platform  and σ > 0 imposes the assumption of increasing returns to scale.  Holding the state of blockchain protocol constant, there are constant returns  to scale: doubling the quantity of the user base  here only Nut  will double  output  the value of the platform . Thus, as the number of the token users in  a blockchain-based platform increases, the value of the token underlying the  nano-economy  increases.  Because  the  protocol  over  which  the  token  economy runs is nonrivalrous, the existing technology T can be used at any  scale of token production, leading to increasing returns in T and N together.  Production  function  for  ideas—the  model  for  the  blockchain  protocol  development and improvement in the consensus mechanisms— T  = δNdt , T0  > 0, where  T  represents the rate of changes  advances  in the blockchain  technology and DLTs over time, Ndt is the number of developer community  working to improve the blockchain protocol and the underlying consensus  mechanism, and δ > 0 is a parameter quantifying the number of new protocol  designs  and  improvements  in  the  consensus  mechanism  the  developer  community  adds  to  the  nano-economy.  The  total  nano-economy  network  size at a given time, t, is the summation of the developer community  Ndt  and  users of the platform  Nut : Nt = Nut + Ndt. Consider that a fraction of the  nano-economy network, w, also work as developers: Ndt = wNt and Nut =   1 – w Nt, where w ϵ  0, 1 . Thus, the per capita nano-economy income, yt ≡  Yt   Nt = Tσ t  1 – w . Therefore, the growth of per capita income of the nano- economy,  y  y:  gy  = σgT.  Note:  T  T=δwNt   T.  From  this,  in  order  for  the   21 Cong, L. W., Li, Y., and Wang, N.  2018 . Tokenomics: Dynamic Adoption and Valuation   103  blockchain  technology  protocol  over  which  the  nano-economy  application  runs to be stable  constant , the term Nt  T should be constant implying gT is  constant  k.  Therefore,  the  long-run  per  capita  income  growth  rate  of  the  nano-economy  is  given  by  gy  = σk.For  network  size  growth  and  increasing  returns, per capita income growth is proportional to the rate of network size  growth  and  the  increasing  returns  to  scale  is  indicated  by  the  factor  of  proportionality,  σ.  This  implies  the  expected  return  to  the  token  users  is  proportional  to  the  network  size  growth,  that  is,  innovation  diffusion  and  adoption of the token at a scale. This implies that long-run per capita growth in the value of the nano-economy  is  the  result  of  a  growth  in  the  network  size  and  increasing  returns.  The  nonrivalry nature of the distributed blockchain protocol and developments  around the technology’s consensus mechanism implies that the token nano- economy  exhibits  increasing  returns  to  scale.  As  the  size  of  the  network  increases, the size of the developer community increases, thus resulting in  more advancements of the blockchain protocol over which the nano-economy  runs. Moreover, some of the robustness of the consensus mechanisms over  which such distributed systems run depends on the size of the network  e.g.,  the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism . To conclude, as Cong et al.  2018   stated, in under any consensus mechanism, a network effect plays a crucial  role. For example, in proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, it is vital that the  stake is not concentrated in the hands of a single user for the majority rule to  apply. Thus, the user base needs to be large and dispersed in order to hold a  majority of stake and have an efficient consensus. Likewise, in the proof-of- work  consensus  mechanism  like  the  one  underlying  bitcoin,  more  miners  potentially deliver faster and more reliable confirmation of transactions, and  miners’ participation in turn depends on the size of the user base. The user  base and scale of adoption reflect the general usefulness of the platform. As  more  people  participate  in  a  given  blockchain  platform,  more  transactions  take place including token exchange, mining, or any other forms of transaction  validation  which  increases  the  value  of  the  underlying  token.  Moreover,  as  Cong  et  al.   2018   noted,  a  greater  user  base  lures  greater  resources  and  research and development into the blockchain community, accelerating the  technological progress.   Cryptocurrency Market Depth and Efficiency Do cryptocurrency markets’ pricing satisfy the efficient market hypothesis?  The cryptocurrency market is inefficient where recent bubbles and volatility  have been experienced in these programmable currencies  especially, Bitcoin .  Moreover, investments in ICOs are commonly based on speculation. There  are controversies on whether the price of cryptocurrencies fully reflects the    104  Chapter 3  Web 3.0: The Distributed Information Network Economy  available information, thus satisfying the efficient market hypothesis  see, e.g.,  Brauneis and Mestel, 2018, and Caporale et al., 2018, who found that these  markets are inefficient and Jakub, 2015, who argues the other way around .22  Figure 3-4.  Cryptocurrency market capitalization for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple, respec- tively, as of March 20, 202023  Cryptocurrency market depth shows how easy it is to get in or get out from  a security market  e.g., in relation to liquidity and volume of bitcoin market, if  the market is deep, then a large volume of pending bid and ask orders keep  prices unchanged for a large order . However, a high volume of a cryptocurrency  exchange  does  not  necessarily  mean  a  deep  market  where  a  potential  mismatch of orders can create high volatility in a cryptocurrency valuation.  Cryptocurrency market is a shallow market because many people are willing  to trade with high frequency. Market depth for the cryptocurrency is affected  by the velocity of cryptocurrencies as a medium of exchange. Moreover, the  underlying cryptocurrency protocols affect the depth of these markets. In the  ethereum network, GHOST  Greedy Heaviest Observed Subtree  protocol  of financing blocks that are simultaneously created and are off the main chain   22 CNBC on December 22, 2017, reported “Bitcoin-mania stock volatility shows the fallacy  of ‘efficient markets’” following the Bitcoin bubble that their emotion beyond rational  decision-making drives investors, www.cnbc.com 2017 12 22 bitcoin-mania-stock- volatility-shows-the-fallacy-of-efficient-markets.html, accessed on April 2,  2020.  23 Data available at Coinmarketcap.com.   105   orphan blocks  can inefficiently inflate prices. Besides, there are more gray  fields  in  the  cryptocurrency  market.  For  example,  in  the  “zero  address  accounts”   Ethereum’s  0x0  accounts ,24  a  large  number  of  transactions  are  sent to these unknown either externally owned account  EOA  or contract  addresses where millions of dollars are locked.   Cryptoeconomics In this section, we will cover the state of Blockchain-powered networks from  the economic point of view. The newly growing field of cryptoeconomics that  deals with the incentive analysis of the distributed ledger technologies mainly  focuses on the core economic concept of cost minimization  cryptoeconomic  security margin optimization  and profit maximization  social welfare of the  network  in  general .  In  this  regard,  the  economic  characterization  of  such  distributed  networks  will  help  analyze  such  networks  using  the  economic  models which are employed in the analysis of economic units. Distributed ledger technologies, from the perspective of cryptoeconomics,  have  two  main  components:  consensus  algorithms  and  smart  contracts.  Besides the cryptographic tools, the theoretical underpinnings in the currently  emerging field of the cryptoeconomics are one of the key engines driving the  developments  in  blockchain  technology   Davidson  et  al.,  2016;  Pilkington,  2016; and Catalini and Gans, 2016 . Cryptoeconomics refers to the field of  study  that  utilizes  reward  models  and  cryptography  for  well-functioning  coordination of a distributed network. More specifically, it is a line of study for  the  incentive  analysis  of  distributed  networks  like  the  blockchain-powered  platforms. A closely related field of study in this regard is the reverse game  theory,  mechanism  design,  social  choice  theory  with  smart  contract  technology, and behavioral economics. This has a more significant implication for the governance mechanisms of  the distributed networks based on the blockchain technologies in general.  The  conventional  blockchain  technology  protocols  revolve  around  the  mechanisms to sustain a consensus for the distributed networks. Distributed  networks like the blockchain depend on a self-governance principle. Such  defines  the  coordination  of  the  agents  according  to  the  protocol.  Block  authorization  or  verification  in  the  transaction  record  process  of  the  conventional  blockchain  networks  is  accompanied  by  incentives.  These  incentive schemes are designed in a way that thwarts anarchy using different  consensus  mechanisms,  some  of  which  include  proof  of  work,  proof  of  stake, proof of value, and so on.  24 See etherscan at https:  etherscan.io address 0x000000000000000000000000000   0000000000000   106  Chapter 3  Web 3.0: The Distributed Information Network Economy   Conventional Consensus Mechanisms The Byzantine Generals Problem  an agreement problem  is a term used for  inconsistent failure detection by the actors in a distributed computer network  system. It describes a situation where a system failure in a distributed network  leads to imperfect information. The problem is related to a story about the  Byzantine  army  surrounding  a  city  with  a  mission  to  attack  the  city.  The  decision to mount an effective unilateral attack or retreat is made through a  distributed consensus. Variation in the individual decisions may have the risk of failure, or it is costly.  Thus, either a coordinated attack or coordinated retreat is the best strategy  to follow. Hence, the coordination protocol design in this particular situation  should  take  into  account  the  best  strategy  that  will  result  in  consensus.  However,  the  presence  of  malicious  generals  complicates  potential  coordination. The generals might be divided into a position to either attack  or retreat. Malicious generals, who are part of the Byzantine army, can use the  diversity signaling two different commands of a retreat and attack to the two  groups of generals which results in uncoordinated war and weakening of the  Byzantine army. Another challenge for potential coordination results from the  geographical  disparities.  The  messages  sent  through  messengers  that  cross  through the city may fail to be delivered  say, if the messenger is caught or the  message  is  tampered  with .  In  this  case,  the  Byzantine  fault  tolerance  consensus can be reached only if the honest generals achieve the majority  vote  retreat or attack signal . If the message delivery failure is the majority,  then a pre-set strategy is followed, say, attack. Computer system analysts use this story to illustrate the problem of reaching  a consensus in a distributed network of computers. The analysis is further  used  for  the  protocol  development  and  mechanism  design  in  a  distributed  setting of digital information exchanges. Similarly, cryptoeconomics has a lot to fetch from the history and story of  human  interactions  of  this  form.  Tomas  Sedlacek,  in  his  book  Economics  of  Good and Evil: The Quest for Economic Meaning from Gilgamesh to Wall Street,  argues that economic discipline is beyond the abstract mathematical modeling;  it is instead a discipline that is framed based on human philosophy, art, culture,  history,  myth,  religion,  and  values.  The  book  provides  an  insight  into  the  history of economic thought starting from the “the epic of Gilgamesh,” set in  ancient Mesopotamia, to the modern mainstream economics describing the  economic taught beyond mathematical inquiry and abstraction. There are some insights that the cryptoeconomic principle can borrow from  historical  event  records  and  myths.  For  instance,  an  interesting  consensus  mechanism is presented in the old testament story of the book of Judges 7,  where a consensus was reached for a coordinated unilateral attack by “God’s  army.” The story presents Gideon’s 300 chosen mighty Israelites crew and the    107  defeat of the Midianites, the Nation of Graspers. In this story, Gideon started  by filtering out unwanted warriors for this purpose and reduced the numbers of  thousands of warriors who showed up into only 300 through a repeated filtering  mechanism.  Then,  he  followed  the  attack  strategy  provided  to  him  by  God,  dividing the warriors into groups of three. Accordingly, during the night of the  attack, the 300 Israelites’ warriors encircle the Midianite camp, and following  Gideon’s signal, they created a simultaneous noise by blowing their trumpets,  breaking their pots with loud noises, and waving their torches. The coordinated  noise created the impression of a huge army surrounding the Midianites, which  resulted  in  their  defeat.  The  association  of  this  consensus  mechanism  with  cryptoeconomics can show us how the filtering and the incentive mechanism  imposed within this protocol led to a victory of the Israelites. Any mechanism design that aims to create a self-enforcing mechanism with a  consideration for a cryptographic algorithm implementation should answer  the following key questions:     What are the key incentives to verify a transaction?    How  to  incentivize  honest  behavior  of  adding  a  valid   block on the main consensus chain?     What are the constraints to consider when analyzing the  incentive dynamics in the network: reward and cost of a  malicious actor  balancing incentives ?     What is the optimal reward or penalty that guarantees   self-governance within the network?  Once these questions are addressed, the incentive mechanism can be analyzed  based on the behavior of the actors in the network. The security of a protocol  designed  based  on  the  cryptoeconomic  principle  is  measured  by  the  cryptoeconomic security margin  CESM . CESM is an economic measure of  security of a network which estimates the cost economic loss of malicious  behavior for violating a protocol’s guarantee. The higher the CESM, the more  secure the network is; this is guaranteed through a robust penalty assignment  mechanism. A distributed network using blockchain technology mainly relies  on the consensus algorithms for a value co-creation purpose. The consensus  mechanism in this setting stands for the agreement of the distributed nodes  in the network for an update of a given state. Hence, the main work in the  design of a business model for a blockchain technology lies on how a consensus  can be reached inclusively. In the case of the Israelites’ army, deviation from  the Gideon’s command could result in loss of their harvest and their life; thus,  every  warrior  agrees  on  a  unilateral  attack  after  the  filter.  An  additional  incentive scheme in this scenario was the belief that God  a superpower  had  full trust in the system. Thus, cryptoeconomics, by definition, refers to the  mechanism design that helps guarantee the consensus in such a distributed  setting.   108  Chapter 3  Web 3.0: The Distributed Information Network Economy  Some of the conventional consensus mechanisms employed in these systems  include   1.    2.    3.    4.    5.    6.    7.    8.    Byzantine fault tolerance: Consensus is reached based on  the information signed by all validators whose network  membership is centrally approved.  Federated  Byzantine  Agreement:  Consensus  depends  on  the  collective  knowledge  of  a  set  of  trusted  validators  whose individual agreement matters for the consensus.  Deposit-based  consensus:  Relies  on  a  skin  in  the  game  principle where validation of a transaction that is not in  line  with  the  chain,  whether  the  main  chain  or  off  the  main chain, is approved by the GHOST arbitrator  Greedy  Heaviest Observed Subtree  costs a security deposit.  Proof  of  work   PoW :  Demands  hashing  power  for  verification  of  a  transaction  that  ends  in  the  main  consensus chain.  Proof of stake  PoS : Verification of a transaction  mining a  block   requires  initial  consumption  of  validator’s  coin   kernel  in that same block to be validated according to  the hash function, and the signature of the block by the  bonded validator is rewarded if it ends in the chain with  the highest total coin consumed.  Proof of value  PoV : A social operating system that relies  on reputation mechanism and reward of native coins.  Proof-of-elapsed  time   PoET :  Requires  time  and  capital  investment like that of the PoW, except that instead of  puzzle-based authorization like in the PoW, it relies on a  central  trust  execution  and  authentication;  it  is  a  distributed model that relies on a centralized leadership.  Proof  of  burn:  Is  a  non-reimbursable  coin  sent  to  an  address that gives the privilege to authorize a block on  a random basis. The probability of mining the next block  increases with the amount of coin in which a miner burn  and continuation of the mining process require continual  coin burning like an investment in hashing power for the  PoW.   There are two general theories which cryptoeconomics borrow to achieve  coordination in distributed networks like the Blockchain:  109   1.    2.   is   through   achieved   groups coalitions    Cooperative game theory: A category of games that involve  competition  between  in  which  cooperation  is  achieved  through  external  enforcement.  In the first stage of a coordinated choice model, a player  decides whether to join the coalition or not. The second  stage is to maximize the total welfare of the coalition and  individual utilities.  Non-cooperative  game  theory:  A  category  of  games  that  involve  competition  between  players  and  in  which  cooperation  self-enforcing  mechanisms. The uncoordinated choice model assumes  that all players have individual incentives. We can consider  two  main  self-enforcing  solution  concepts  to  achieve  cooperation  under  this  category  of  games.  The  bribing  attacker model also works under the assumption of the  uncoordinated  choice  model  with  a  potential  bribing  attacker  with a nil cost  that thwarts the system. Hence,  in  the  case  of  bribing  attacker,  a  cryptoeconomic  mechanism  starts  by  considering  the  cost  and  budget  constraints of the potential briber.     Coordination protocol: A self-enforcing protocol with a  coordination  mechanism  that  is  designed  based  on  the  players’  preference,  for  example,  a  Vickrey  auction.     Co-utile  protocol:  A  self-enforcing  protocol  without  a  coordination  mechanism  in  which  cooperation  is  achieved only through a self-enforcing and mutually  beneficial interaction between the players.  Developing  a  reward  model  in  a  cryptoeconomic  analysis  starts  with  the  abstraction of the expected level of coordination and assumptions about the  cost constraint and budget plan of a potential attack. A coordination protocol  can be achieved through adjustment of utilities of the game using rewards,  punishments, or utility transfer such that individuals are fairly treated and that  optimal network value is derived. The goal is to maximize the social welfare  function of the platform on which a cryptocurrency is based using a robust  consensus mechanism. This is a constrained optimization subject to incentive  compatibility, cost of an attack, rationality, feasibility constraint, and resource  constraint. The utility function of each economic unit in the platform defines  the platform’s social welfare function, which indicates the general well-being  of the economic state in the network. A given mechanism over a platform    110  Chapter 3  Web 3.0: The Distributed Information Network Economy  maximizes the social welfare of the network if it is Pareto efficient. Otherwise,  there  exists  another  mechanism  of  resource  allocation  that  generates  a  strictly greater utility for at least one economic unit in the network. The voting process to agree about a given state in the blockchain network is  as follows:  1.    2.    3.    4.    A  total  of  K  unconfirmed  transactions  in  the  network  arise.  Given a set of validators, N, in the network, there are   M  ⊆  N  successful  miners  mining  block  B  containing  transactions k ∈ K.  Miner J ∈ M who mines block B first gets a reward and  block B is recorded in the main chain with a total of M  number of votes  consensus over the state of block B .  All  N J  get  no  reward  from  this  transaction,  that  is,  a  total  of  all  other  mined  block  except  B  goes  to  the  unconfirmed transactions pool and the process continues  in this fashion for all transaction validation.  See Figure 3-5 for a simplified presentation of a single transaction verification  process without a loss of generality. In the figure, the transition verification  passes through a hashing and encryption process in order for it to be recorded  in the chain of the existing blocks of transactions. The transaction fee is paid  to miner J, who adds a valid block to the main chain first from the set of  successful miners M. The consensus about a given state in the network can be  represented as a market in which the state over which consensus is drawn is  a commodity, and the number of votes validating the state can be considered  as the price for that state. Accordingly, as in the invisible hand principle, a  robust consensus mechanism can lead the distributed free market system to  equilibrium.   111  Figure 3-5.  A simplified abstraction of the consensus process on a blockchain for the verifica- tion of a transaction t between x and y  A reward model in a mechanism design minimizes attack by making potential  attacks  expensive   through  punishment  that  raises  the  cost  of  potential  attack . For example, in the PoW, the cost of a 51% attack or cost of any  deviation to any miner chains other than the main chain is made expensive  through a hash power requirement. Likewise, in the PoS, the cost of deviation  to the miner chain is equated to the amount of coin burned in the block, skin  in  the  game.  One  comparison  between  the  consensus  mechanisms  can  be  made  by  comparing  the  utility  functions  of  each  economic  unit  which  is  a  function of their respective profit functions. For example, the profit function  of a miner in the PoS mechanism is a function of the hash rate defined by the  miner’s  relative  computational  power,  difficulty  factor,  block  mining  time,  block reward, and the transaction fees. On the other hand, the profit function  of a miner in the PoS mechanism is a function of the stake  security deposit ,  block mining time, and the transaction fee.   112  Chapter 3  Web 3.0: The Distributed Information Network Economy   Limitations of Conventional Consensus  Mechanisms In  order  to  sustain  the  system  with  every  agent’s  honest  involvement  and  hence to maintain the protocol, incentive mechanisms are employed. These  incentive schemes include economic reward  block reward or transaction fee  block renting privilege which, respectively, is for the coin creation transaction  and other transactions included in the block that ends in the main consensus  chain  and app platform utility. In addition, malicious peers in the network are  disincentivized  through  punishments   credible  threats  for  self-enforcing  behavior  in the form of loss of privilege in PoW protocol and loss of stake  deposit  in  the  PoS  protocol.  However,  the  conventional  incentive  designs  suffer from a number of limitations in generating the optimal level of value  that could be attained. For instance, the underlying honest majority assumption  of the most extended chain rule is with limit when it comes to economic  attacks like selfish mining wherein there is strategic withholding of a block;  with the randomness of creating a valid block, the system can be subverted  without the need for majority hashing power. In the discussion that follows,  we see some illustrative scenarios that posit a note on the limitations of the  conventional consensus mechanisms.   Scenario 1: Bribing Attacker in the PoW for the Bitcoin  Mining According to the PoW reward scheme, a block is valid if it ends in the main  consensus chain, and verification of this valid block is accompanied by a block  reward in BTC. Under both coordinated and uncoordinated choice models,  one  has  the  incentive  to  add  a  valid  block   on  the  main  chain  where  the  majority adds  because she gets the block reward of 12.5 BTC  at time of  writing  only if she is in line with the others  panel a . All other miners have  the same incentive to verify a valid block transaction for the same reason, and  hence the main chain consensus is guaranteed. Note that, under the PoW  scheme, the cryptoeconomic security margin  the cost of adding invalid block   is the hashing power consumed with no any other accompanied punishment.  The mechanism is computationally expensive. See Figure 3-6 for an example  of mining game.   113  Figure 3-6.  Mining game  Under a bribing attacker model  panel b , with a bribing attack budget of β  units  e.g., subsidized mining pools , the payoff of the validator for adding a  block is presented in the following table. Note that there is no cost to the  attacker to extend her chain.   Scenario 2: The Soft Fork Penalty Assignment In distributed networks, a hard fork refers to a change in either the consensus  rules or protocol and building a different history of records. A typical example  of  a  hard  fork  is  the  case  for  the  decentralized  autonomous  organization   DAO  which deployed a different smart contract in the ethereum history.  This  virtual  blockchain-based  company   a  global  distributed  crowdfunding  business model with autonomous governance for blockchain projects  raised  about $150 million in less than a month of operation before it was hacked  resulting in a loss of about 40% of the funds. For DAO contract’s reentrancy  attack, a hard fork was the last resort solution which the ethereum foundation  took in order to recover the stolen funds to the native account.25 On the other hand, a soft fork builds over the same history of records under  a  given  protocol.  Consider  the  soft  forking  scenario  in  the  longest  chain  rule. Block reward is assigned for the block that follows the longest consensus  chain.  Only  those  transactions  on  the  longest  consensus  chain  are  valid.  Now, consider a soft fork where two blocks B and C appeared making two  different  branches  of  the  chain   subtree   due  to  strategic  actions  of  the  miners  or  network  faults   latency  or  failure .  Given  the  immediate  predecessor  block  A   with  an  existing  reward  +1 ,  the  conventional  mechanism blindly assigns a penalty of 0 in PoW and –1 in PoS mechanisms  making  the  transactions  in  both  the  soft  fork  blocks  invalid  regardless.26   25 See a blog post by Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, on the completion of the  hard  fork   July  20,  2016 ,  https:  blog.ethereum.org 2016 07 20 hard-fork- completed , accessed on April 2, 2020.  26 Bentov et al.  2016    114  Chapter 3  Web 3.0: The Distributed Information Network Economy  Then, the protocol continues by rewarding  +1  to the next block D that  makes one of the two branches longer. Here, we see that there is a possible  unfair penalty assignment to either B or C. Hence, is there any other penalty  assignment mechanism  other than the blind punishment  that identifies and  penalizes the malicious one in case it appears that the soft fork happened  only  due  to  either  B  or  C,  but  not  both?  Avoiding  such  unfair  penalty  assignments requires to preselect validators before any possible fork. This in  turn depends on whether all the nodes are simultaneously online, allowing  for a secure selection of validator in the same way for each block on both  chains. Besides, even if the online availability issue is manageable, the system  could still suffer from other vicious circle problems, specifically successive  validators’ collusion risk in a chain for a 51% attack.27   Scenario 3: Market Concentration Hashing Power The cryptocurrency market is a competitive market with newly growing coins  being  continually  introduced  to  the  market.  Unlike  the  early  ages  of  the  bitcoin, the market share for the bitcoin has significantly reduced with a shift  of investment in the newer cryptocurrencies  Iwamura et al., 2014 . In addition  to other market powers and security issues, the hard fork in the bitcoin is one  of the reasons for its reduced market share. On the other hand, the consensus  mechanism within the bitcoin market itself bears some market concentration  in  the  hands  of  a  few  mining  pools  with  more  substantial  hashing  power,  mainly in areas with relatively cheaper electricity. This is similar to the principle  of higher odds of winning with buying a greater share of tickets in a lottery  game.  The  same  thing  happens  for  the  stake  pools  in  the  PoS  consensus  mechanism. This diverts the truly distributed nature of the network on which  this cryptocurrency is based. For example, see Figure 3-7.  27 https:  github.com ethereum wiki wiki Proof-of-Stake-FAQ   115  Figure 3-7.  Hash rate distribution among largest Bitcoin mining pools as of March 20, 202028   Scenario 4: Nothing at Stake vs. Sufficient Skin in the Game  for the PoS Consensus Mechanism A proof of stake is a consensus mechanism that uses stakes of native tokens  by potential validators  see Figure 3-8 to understand a simplified workflow in  a PoS . A fork for a double-spend of a digital good  rewriting of a transaction  history  does not cost if a malicious agent has nothing at stake in that block.  Still, even if there is some stake in the block and the return from the fork is  higher  than  the  coinage  burned  in  the  stake,  there  will  be  an  incentive  to  subvert the system. Hence, what is the threshold stake that can guarantee  sufficient skin in the game? The burned stake  money  within the proof of  stake does not go to anyone  wasted money . Hence, issues can arise on the  ways to transfer the burned money at stake to some other party within the  network. Similarly, there is a concern on the length of time the money under  this consensus mechanism has to be at stake.  28 www.blockchain.com en pools   116  Chapter 3  Web 3.0: The Distributed Information Network Economy  Figure 3-8.  A simplified proof-of-stake consensus mechanism   Scenario 5: Tragedy of the Commons and Market Failure  in Distributed Networks As opposed to the centralized monetary policy, the cryptocurrency economy  is governed by the algorithmic setting of open source code that defines the  money supply and its value in circulation. Unlike the unlimited supply of fiat  currencies,  the  supply  for  some  of  the  cryptocurrencies  like  bitcoin  and  Litcoin is limited. The total number of bitcoin in circulation as of the writing  of this book is about 16,898,563 BTC out of the total expected supply of 21  million. As a result, the block reward scheme  halving every four years  for  transaction verification will shift to transaction fees as the total number of  bitcoins get exhaustively mined through time. As compared to the transaction  fees, the block reward generates a higher return to the miners. The shift in  the incentive dynamics through time can result in the tragedy of the commons  for a shared resource. In the context of the digital economy, such decentralized  networks of the unregulated digital assets with open source code are prone  to  the  commons,  that  is,  contrary  to  the  common  good  of  the  network;  individual miners act selfishly with a motive to maximize their profits in the  transaction verification process. For instance, the incentive for mining might  reduce and hence subvert the efficiency of the network. With lesser miners  in  the  network,  there  will  be  higher  market  concentration,  censorship  of  transactions,  and  an  increase  in  transaction  fees   a  similar  scenario  for  a  different reason arises with the block ceiling issue will be further discussed in  Chapter 4 .   117   Governance of Decentralized Web 3.0  Economies and Open Source Projects:  The Case of the QuadrigaCX The transition from the traditional economic system to the digital economic  system has created a new age in the history of economic thought. For instance,  the  developments  in  the  digital  currencies,  unlike  fiat  currencies,  have  challenged the traditional thoughts about the issuing of a currency by a central  trusted party, the central bank. On the other hand, governance and regulation  are  one  of  the  most  critical  issues  arising  in  relation  to  the  decentralized  platforms of the Web 3.0 economies in light of the institutional economics  and public choice theories  Brown, 2019; Guo and Liang, 2016; Atzori, 2015;  and Yeoh, 2017 . In this section, by taking a specific case of the Quadriga hack   a  typical  example  of  the  unregulated  world  of  cryptocurrencies ,  I  will  highlight  key  challenges  in  the  regulation  of  the  decentralized  Web  3.0  economies. Quadriga was one of the largest Canadian cryptocurrency exchange startups  with a platform for storing and exchanging of various digital tokens and coins   including Bitcoin, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin SV, and Ether . The exchange,  according to the 2019 Ernst and Young’s report,29 is affiliated with three main  legal  entities   Quadriga  Fintech  Solutions  Corp.,  Whiteside  Capital  Corporation,  and  0984750  B.C.  LTD.   doing  business  as  QuadrigaCX  and  Quadriga Coin Exchange. Following the controversial death of its founder and  CEO Gerald Cotten in December 2018, QuadrigaCX collapsed. This resulted  in a central point of failure wherein customers being unable to access their  digital wallets with the loss of passwords and the underlying protocol, which  were solely handled by Cotten. As a result, the online startup was insolvent  with a liquidity problem. Following this, tens of thousands of clients who were  online users of this cryptocurrency exchange platform came forward with a  claim for the loss of investments in millions of dollars. Moreover, with the artificially created user accounts and multiple aliases, the  CEO mixed personal and corporate finance. The controversial death incident  resulted  in  the  freezing  of  about  $180  million  CAD  in  cryptocurrency  exchanges.  Early  April  2019,  the  three  affiliate  entities  were  issued  a  Termination  and  Bankruptcy  Assignment  Order  under  the  Bankruptcy  and  Insolvency Act.  at   29 Available   https:  documentcentre.eycan.com eycm_library Quadriga%20 Fintech%20Solutions%20Corp English CCAA 1.%20Monitor’s%20Reports 6.%20 Fifth%20Report%20of%20the%20Monitor Fifth%20Report%20of%20the%20 Monitor%20dated%20June%2019,%202019.PDF   118  Chapter 3  Web 3.0: The Distributed Information Network Economy  As there was no physical presence for the company other than Cotton’s home  office, jurisdiction was one of the issues in dealing with this case at the court  that later relied on Nova Scotia as a base jurisdiction in consideration of the  location  of  Cotton’s  home  office.  The  other  major  issue  in  open  source  projects  including the cryptocurrency industry  is that there is no defined set  of regulations specific to these industries. Moreover, cryptocurrency exchange  markets  rely  on  third-party  payment  channels  for  liquidation  without  any  traditional bank accounts, which creates a limit in their physical presence and  traceability. In the traditional financial market regulations, one of the means of  customer protection is setting of capital requirements which implies that the  owners of financial institutions hold substantially more assets than the value  of the investment in the financial market  like the value of a bank deposit . In  contrast to this, as of April 12, 2019, Quadriga owned about $28.6 million  CAD  in  assets  as  compared  to  about  $215.7  million  CAD  it  held  from  investors.30 Further, with the limited physical traceability, some argue that the  business  was  a  scam  that  with  cold  wallets   deemed  to  be  created  by  the  founder for “offline security reasons”  lacked records on the blockchain, thus  making it suspicious.31 There also are several disputes surrounding the veracity  of  the  death  of  the  CEO—who  held  the  key  to  millions  of  dollars  in  his  brain—the Quadriga conspiracy.32 The  immediate  challenge  for  cryptocurrency  users  is  the  lack  of  a  clearly  defined  customer  protection  framework  that  takes  into  account  the  developments toward investment in such open source projects and exchange  markets.  A  more  profound  challenge  in  this  regard  is  the  limited  physical  presence  of  such  digital  platforms  and  further  geolocation  issues  for  legal  jurisdictions.  An  interesting  issue  to  be  taken  into  account  by  regulatory  frameworks in relation to such open source projects is about the sophistication  level of investors in such platforms. Usually, in such projects, most investors  are not that sophisticated in understanding the underlying smart contracts  and the dynamics of assets of the platform as are such open source projects.  Thus, depending on their geographic jurisdiction, a strict disclosure duty and   30 See  Ernst  and  Young’s  report   a  trustee  overseeing  bankruptcy  proceedings  for  the  Quadriga cryptocurrency exchange  on the bankruptcy of Quadriga Fintech Solutions  Corp., Whiteside Capital Corporation, and 0984750 B.C. LTD. of the city of Halifax in  the  Province  of  Nova  Scotia,  www.scribd.com document 409470435 Trustee- Report-FINAL, accessed on April 2, 2020.  31 On February 9, 2019, CBC reported the incident with a running head “Quadriga mystery  deepens  with  little  evidence  of  cold  wallets  containing  $250M,”  www.cbc.ca news  canada nova-scotia quadriga-mystery-deepens-with-little-evidence-of- cold-wallets-containing-250m-1.5011573, accessed on April 2, 2020.  32 On February 4, 2019, Bloomberg reported the news with a heading “Crypto CEO Dies  Holding Only Passwords That Can Unlock Millions in Customer Coins,” www.bloom- berg.com news articles 2019-02-04 crypto-exchange-founder-dies-leaves- behind-200-million-problem, accessed on April 2, 2020.   119  collateralized  debt  obligations  need  to  be  imposed  on  such  open  source  projects  and  exchange  markets.  An  important  thing  to  consider  is  also  to  answer  the  question  of  how  such  open  source  projects  like  the  crypto  exchange markets get backed when there are no bank accounts to which they  link.  A  similar  issue  is  highlighted  for  the  stable  coins   see  the  discussion  under Facebook’s stable coin initiative, Libra, in Chapter 5 . Moreover, there are ethical challenges in the decentralized Web 3.0 economies.  The  most  interesting  ethics  issue  is  what  duty  such  open  source  digital  platforms have to their variety of stakeholders and investors. This depends on  the platforms’ specific roles  e.g., cryptocurrency platforms like that of Libra,  identifying whether the platform is acting as an issuer, a trader, or an agent  working for investors is vital . The  Quadriga  hack  is  a  typical  example  of  the  regulatory  challenges  and  loopholes  around  the  decentralized  Web  3.0  economies  and  open  source  projects.  Equal  with  the  challenges  in  regulating  digital  platforms  is  the  countervailing  effects  of  vague  regulatory  frameworks  on  the  potential  developments and advancements of the Web 3.0 economy. The regulatory  concerns  connected  with  such  digital  platforms  are  still  controversial  with  some playing a countervailing effect on the advancements in the area. Brown   2019 , in his cryptocurrency and financial regulations analysis, presents the  tension  in  the  regulations  of  the  cryptocurrency  market,  highlighting  the  rejection of many cryptocurrency-based projects by the SEC. See, for example,  the shutdown of a stable coin startup, Basis, due to regulatory constraints  from  the  US  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission   SEC .33  faced  Recommendations are for the regulatory bodies to understand the tech under  consideration in order to achieve salient regulatory goals and also follow tech  neutral approaches not to limit advancements in the digital space. On  the  other  hand,  new  business  models  give  rise  to  new  challenges  and  uncertainties.  Thus,  in  keeping  a  healthy  digital  economy  space,  such  marketplaces and open source projects operating in the dynamically evolving  technological business environment need to cope with new regulatory and  legal codes. In  conclusion,  many  other  questions  arise  as  far  as  the  regulation  of  the  decentralized  platforms  is  concerned.  For  instance,  even  if  the  underlying  principles of decentralization of platforms is the notion under the Web 3.0  economies, with new developments in the digital economic system are the  creation  of  big  players  in  the  industry  space.  Thus,  another  concern  is  to  manage regulation where such big players can still lobby to their best interests.   33 See the interview with the Intangible Labs CEO, Nader Al-Naji, to Forbes on December  13,  2018,  www.forbes.com sites michaeldelcastillo 2018 12 13 sec-rules- kill-cryptos-top-funded-startup 5e1fc8b2918c, accessed on April 2, 2020.   120  Chapter 3  Web 3.0: The Distributed Information Network Economy  Moreover, with the potential global level operation of these like networks and  existence  of  arbitrage  opportunities,  standardization  and  harmonization  of  international regulations are vital, thus bridging the gap that might arise when  malicious open source projects can exploit regulatory havens. However, as it  is common in most of the global regulatory frameworks, proposed regulations  are prone to fail politically across regions.   Summary This  chapter  has  presented  in-depth  coverage  on  the  state  of  the  art  and  developments  in  distributed  ledger  and  blockchain  technologies  covering  concepts from introduction to the underlying tech, economics of blockchain- powered networks, cryptoeconomics, governance, and consensus mechanisms.  Moreover,  the  chapter  has  pointed  out  directions  for  future  work  to  stir  further study efforts into this area. At the core of distributed ledger and blockchain tech is the access to data in  a  more  transparent  and  distributed  fashion.  In  today’s  knowledge-based  economy,  facilitating  access  to  aggregated  data  is  needed  for  business  sustainability. This will enable leveraging of business intelligence system in an  integrated  and  more  efficient  way  which  is  prominently  vital.  Data-driven  decision-making has continued to be a growing field in the current era of the  digital  economic  system.  For  example,  with  the  growing  trends  of  rapidly  increasing  quantity  and  variety  of  data  from  customers,  integrating  and  exploiting the benefits of such information in inductive reasoning surrounding  strategic business decisions has proven to be successful  Caulkins et al., 2018;  Erevelles et al., 2016; and Fan et al., 2015 . Lately, the hype of decentralization through distributive technologies seems  to nearly breaking, unlike the vibe around the tech during the past few years.  This  is  mainly  due  to  the  immature  and  volatile  applications   like  the  cryptocurrency bubbles  and that they are not the only game in town with  advances  in  Fintech.  In  this  regard,  identifying  the  major  bottlenecks  for  innovation diffusion and maturity of distributed ledger technologies is vital.  One question to ask is whether the Internet and centralized marketplaces  shadowed this tech not to reach the critical mass. The future is data science,  doing this at a scale and hitting the critical mass calls for more technological  advancements and developments in the digital economy space. Expectations  are that blockchain and distributed ledger technologies are stepping-stone for  a newer form of data management in the information society, just like the  developments from Web 1.0 to Web 2.0.   121  Further work in transitioning the technology to its full potential calls for   1.    2.    3.    4.    5.    6.    In-depth  cryptoeconomic  analysis  and  programmable  incentives that sustain distributed networks  Analysis  of  the  dynamics  of  the  token  economy  under  various business cycles  Governance of distributed networks and the associated  financial systemic risk assessment  Design of robust consensus mechanisms for blockchain  and DLT-powered platforms and identifying the optimal  properties of such consensus mechanisms  Understanding market structure of the cryptocurrencies,  price volatility, and monetary policies with a decentralized  settings of the cryptocurrency  Viability of global wallets and digital currencies issued by  central banks and their implied effects  Lastly, considering the technology as a disruption to the trust management  models  is  questionable.  As  we  have  discussed  under  the  governance  of  decentralized  Web  3.0  economies,  with  major  hacks  that  the  distributed  ledger technologies’ space has faced, considering the tech as a trust machine  of the digital economy is misleading.   C H A P T E R   4  Blockchain and  Distributed  Ledger  Technology  Applications  In about a decade of its existence, blockchain technology has seen some level  of innovation diffusion to many sectors other than its genesis application of  cryptocurrencies  see Figure 4-1 . This chapter presents an objective view of  the developments of blockchain and distributed ledger technologies beyond  the cryptocurrencies. By drawing from the current states of the tech, I will  present  a  detailed  analysis  of  existing  and  potential  use  cases  including  ecommerce, Vickrey auction, self-sovereign digital identity management, and     Abeba N.

The chapter further lends key points to consider for  applying blockchain and distributed ledger technologies in businesses. Here,  starting from justifying why blockchain is a potential solution concept for a  business, I will cover points such as asset digitization, participants identification  and the degrees of permission, tokenization, decentralized applications, smart  contracts  and  robust  consensus  algorithm,  scalability  of  data  throughput,  payment channels, as well as a business model development for token sales.  Figure 4-1.  Phases of Blockchain adoption across companies, based on 2018 PwC Survey1   How You Can Think About Using  Blockchain in Your Endeavors There  are  standard  procedures,  methods,  and  approaches  that  blockchain  analysts  follow  in  blockchain  protocol  design.  By  focusing  on  blockchain,  distributed  ledger  technologies   DLTs ,  and  smart  contract  applications,  in  this  section,  I  will  provide  recommendations  for  designing  and  deploying  distributed ledgers and smart contracts. This helps make strategic decisions  for businesses considering adoption of blockchain and DLT solution concepts,  thus  adding  to  the  evaluation,  development,  and  selection  process  of  this  technology. Figure 4-2 depicts five key challenges businesses face in adopting  blockchain technology and tips to overcome these challenges.  1 Data  Source:  PwC  Global  Blockchain  Survey  2018,  available  at  www.pwc.com gx en  issues blockchain blockchain-in-business.html   125  Figure  4-2.  Five  key  challenges  for  adoption  of  Blockchain  into  businesses  and  tips  for  success2  Generally speaking, in the design of a blockchain platform, a blockchain analyst  should take into account the following key points.   Justify Why Blockchain Is a Potential Solution  Concept for the Problem Under Consideration Behind any blockchain solution is the need for immutable preservation and  recording of relevant information and ease of retrieval whenever lost. Here,  feasibility,  efficiency,  usability  through  best  practices  or  a  pilot  platform   together with innovation diffusion to the end users , functionality, and, most   2 Source: Author’s analysis based on data from Deloitte’s 2019 Global Blockchain Survey   126  Chapter 4  Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology Applications  of all, value-add of a blockchain solution concept over the legacy system have  to be justified. For instance, economic value-add through decentralized applications  DApps   and  social  engineering  can  be  one  of  the  reasons  to  choose  a  blockchain  solution  over  a  legacy  centralized  system.  Nevertheless,  not  all  forms  of  transaction or value transfer issues call for a distributed blockchain solution.  Distributed  relational  databases  in  which  the  stakeholders  can  have  access  based  on  industry  regulation  and  several  other  technologies  could  address  some of the data access and registry issues in many of the use cases. However,  in  some  of  the  use  cases,  the  themes  can  be  beyond  the  principal  value  exchange and include self-sovereign personal data management scheme and  facilitation of service provision across stakeholders and further enhance the  mini-economy  through  value  creation  based  on  the  tokenization  of  the  ecosystem.  In  effect,  it  will  be  helpful  to  check  if  the  use  case  requires  all  parties to see the same set of data on the state updates at the same time—all  eyes on the same data at the same time. Besides, blockchain tech excels at data ownership by users. Users can take  ownership of their data through the use of digital signatures. If users can own  and maintain their encrypted data, this supports transparent value transfer.  Thus, the analyst has to answer why blockchain  or any other DLT  would be  an ideal solution concept by identifying if any of the properties of blockchain  tech add value, which can be of interest and solve the issue in the use case.  Some  of  these  include  safe,  immutable,  and  decentralized  record  systems,  interaction  between  different  groups   for  the  permissioned  blockchain ,  tokenization, transparency and ease of tracking and handling of records, and  preservation of the archival bond  and data mapping across participants and  reconciliation  with a chain of records across different clusters and groups,  facilitating the empowerment of service provision  blockchain enables value  generation  through  a  distributed  network .  Therefore,  blockchain  tech  or  DLT-based solutions are useful in the following circumstances:   	   	   	   Business  network:  A  business  network  must  exist,  with  multiple  organizations  that  are  willing interested   incented to work together.  Need to share data: There is a need for shared visibility of  data or transactions between participants in the business  network.  Multiple  “writers”:  The  information  to  be  shared  must  originate  from  more  than  one  participant.  Multiple  organizations  must  provide  data execute  transactions.  Together  with  this,  attention  should  be  given  to  the  compliance of the requirement for regulations and audits  in choosing between a public and permissioned blockchain  solution.   127   	   	   Trust issue: There is a need for a single source of truth  within the network; participants do not inherently trust  any one party to hold that data.  Business  value  analysis   BVA :  There  must  be  sufficient  business  justification  for  the  project.  That  is,  the  blockchain  solution  must  provide  tangible,  material  business benefits.   Digitization of Assets The digitization of assets defines the assets  representations of tangible or  intangible goods, or information  that are used within the business network  and  represented  on  the  blockchain  ledger.  For  example,  this  would  be  designing a blockchain application for a vehicle auction on Hyperledger that  articulates who are the participants and models the asset and access control  rules.  Creating  Hyperledger  Composer  applications  on  the  Fabric  Testnet  includes  the  following  process  starting  with  the  creation  of  the  asset  to  running the transaction:   1.  Create participants  e.g., buyer and seller for the vehicle .  2.  Create vehicle owned by one of the participants.  3.  Create vehicle listing to put it up on blockchain.  4.  Run a new transaction to make an offer.  5.  Close the bidding by running that transaction.  6.  Check that the vehicle has changed hands.  Further, integration with other technologies such as AI, biometrics, and IoT  can be taken into account for the digital presence of the asset.3 The advances  in the information networks and specifically the blockchain technology enabled  traceability  and  a  transfer  of  digitally  identified  things  in  more  secure  cryptographic hashes  digital signature or fingerprint of data  and transparent  way. The supply chain management, distributed ride-sharing of the autonomous  car,  and  land  registry  on  the  blockchain  are  some  examples  of  the  digital  migration of the physical world assets to the blockchain-based platforms. In  this  vein,  blockchain  technology  has  facilitated  and  organized  information  networks that let the digital transformation of the real-world assets through  the means of tokenization. For example, in the real estate market, the asset   3 In the supply chain blockchain solutions, traceability of products is ensured through the  Internet of Things sensors which are attached to the product. See, for example, Fishcoin:  Blockchain-based Seafood Traceability & Data Ecosystem, https:  fishcoin.co , accessed  on April 6, 2020.   128  Chapter 4  Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology Applications  representing a property  the deed  is digitized, allowing it to be represented  in a divisible form  like any form of a digital token .4 This will allow partial full  selling  or  renting  of  the  property  ownership  by  just  sending  an  equivalent  token  representing  the  portion  of  the  property  to  the  transacting  agent.  Migrating real-world assets to the blockchain through tokens requires a secure  and accurate mapping with the underlying physical assets.   Identify the Participants and the Degrees  of Permission Identifying the participants and the degrees of permission defines economic  units based on their stakes in the ecosystem and ability to maximize the social  welfare within the system through added values. It is vital to have a defined set  of internal stakeholders and clearly set blockchain business network through  abstraction  of  the  business,  privacy,  data  access  policy,  and  compliance  requirements of any external stakeholders. For a permissioned blockchain, participants are the business networks that  are collections of known and identifiable organizations that work together.  The  type  and  relationship  between  the  target  network  members  have  to  clearly be identified in framing the business network. Start by identifying if the  subjects  are  competing  or  complementing.  For  example,  in  the  case  of  an  auction, buyers placing a bid over a listing are competing with each other, and  thus, transparency of the actual bids might be a challenge for Vickrey auction- like settings  I will discuss this in connection with the potential applications  later in this chapter . Because with the transparent traceability of transactions on the blockchain  registry, it is not feasible to have two or more competing companies subjects  to  co-create  value  over  a  common  blockchain  platform.  Hence,  effective  strategies  e.g., masking or reduction  for operating competing companies in  a  common  platform  should  be  framed  if  there  is  a  potential  for  value  co-creation through a blockchain solution concept. For a permissioned blockchain, businesses have to decide whether to be within  the blockchain business network based on a business value analysis  BVA .  4 See  blockchain  platforms  Bankex  and  Polymath  for  the  Proof-of-Asset  Protocols  and  LINQ, a project by Nasdaq for the digital representation of physical assets, available at  https:  bankex.com  and https:  polymath.network , respectively.   129   Tokenization and Decentralized Applications  DApps  The analyst can create an application5 on top of the blockchain platform that  can foster a value creation process  mostly for use cases with the goals of  social  engineering  beyond  the  economic  derive,  e.g.,  see  the  Plastic  Bank  blockchain  solution—a  Vancouver-based  startup  aimed  at  tackling  ocean  plastic to alleviate global poverty through blockchain-based token rewards6   within the mini-economy and incentivizes the participants. Hence, on top of  the distributed solution, we can build a DApp that can generate additional  values   like  a  monetary  reward   for  the  participants.  This  can  be  achieved  through the tokenization of the system beyond the core value transfer, that is,  to design the incentive scheme over which value transfers on the platform  take place. In the analytical phase of token engineering, consider utilizing the  tools from game theory and mechanism design concepts  mostly referred to  as cryptoeconomics in DLT designs  for analyzing the incentive schemes and  dynamic optimization for maximizing the nano-economy’s welfare.   Develop the Smart Contract and Use a Robust  Consensus Algorithm A  smart  contract  contains  a  set  of  business  logic  that  is  enforced  by  an  underlying code that verifies, facilitates, and executes the “if-then” statements  of the agreement, thus auditing and reconciling the business process as the  application runs. It defines “what can be done” within the business network  resulting  in  queries  and  updates  to  assets  represented  on  the  ledger.  For  example, if a payment for a given asset transaction is not fulfilled, the defaulting  buyer is locked out of the asset. Note that the user initiates a smart contract.  In the Ethereum platform, to initiate a contract for a given application, you  start by making a transaction that sends ether to an externally owned account   EOA  and then go for an initial coin offering  ICO—a prepaid funding model   that  builds  the  users  of  the  network  for  that  specific  application.  Such  contracts help confirm a transaction and the associated obligations of a given  asset transfer in an indisputable fashion. Further, the endorsement policies or  consensus on which transaction is to be put on the chain and who runs the  smart contract has to be defined, that is, models of the business network:  founder-led  relying on other participants to validate  or consortium  everybody  is  responsible  for  each  stamp  validating  transaction,  and  the  tech  sets  the  compliance .  5 To  learn  more  about  the  decentralized  applications,  see  State  of  the  DApps  at   www.stateofthedapps.com , accessed on April 6, 2020. 6 Available at IBM case studies: www.ibm.com case-studies plastic-bank   130  Chapter 4  Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology Applications  Evaluation  and  implementation  of  this  technology  to  any  form  of  business  solution  should  also  take  into  account  archival  bond  and  interoperability  which  were  discussed  in  Chapter  3  of  this  book  and  scalability  of  data  throughput and possible payment channels. Let us now have an in-depth look  at scalability of data throughput and payment channels.   Scalability of Data Throughput As it has repetitively been mentioned, scalability issues are one of the key  problems in the conventional blockchain protocols. At time of this writing,  Bitcoin and Ethereum’s speed of transaction processing is 4 and 13 transactions  per  second,  respectively,  unlike  the  Visa  transactions  of  2000  per  second.7  The  most  common  issue  with  the  scalability  of  the  existing  blockchain  protocols is the block ceiling  a limit on the number of transactions per block .  Removing  the  block  ceiling  comes  with  an  increase  in  the  bandwidth  requirement. In the PoW consensus mechanism, this implies a concentration  of  mining  power  in  the  hands  of  a  few  big  miners,  which  induces  higher  transaction  fees  and  lesser  security  of  the  system.  The  block  ceiling  also  results in censorship of transactions based on transaction fees. As a result,  some solutions to address the scalability issue have been proposed  Decker  and Wattenhofer, 2015; Croman et al., 2016; and Luu et al., 2016 .8 The first  solution is the micropayment channels  to record the final transaction out of  a series of transactions between nodes . The second is the SegWit  segregated  witness ,  which  proposes  for  the  storage  of  signature  data  into  extended  blocks.  The  third  solution  in  this  regard  is  the  off-chain  oracles  in  which  external entities take part in the computation process outside the chain. The  other solution concept proposed is the sharding of transactions into groups   segregation of transactions .   Payment Channels Payment  channels,  also  known  as  micropayment  channels,  are  a  class  of  techniques  to  allow  users  to  make  multiple  Bitcoin  transactions  without  committing  all  of  the  transactions  to  the  bitcoin  blockchain.  In  a  typical  payment channel, only two transactions are added to the blockchain, but an  unlimited number of payments can be made between the participants  two  transactions: to open the channel and to close validation of refunds to the  respective parties according to the balance sheet and storing of BTC , that is,   7 https:  towardsdatascience.com the-blockchain-scalability-problem-the-race-  for-visa-like-transaction-speed-5cce48f9d44 8 See also www.bloomberg.com news articles 2019-01-17 mit-stanford-academics-  design-cryptocurrency-to-better-bitcoin   131  the  Lightning  Networks.  A  similar  enabling  scale  channel  for  Ethereum  is  known as Raiden Network. The scalability of the Bitcoin blockchain lightning  network is considering the off-chain approach. Also, only two transactions  could be taken into account in the case of multiple transactions and opening  a  payment  channel   multiple  signature  address .  For  instance,  multiple  transactions and balance transfer between a customer and restaurant can be  set  through  a  payment  channel  with  the  restaurant  where  both  deposit  a  given amount of BTC in a common address. Considering  the  larger  blockchain  network  as  a  single  economic  unit,  the  network can attain economies of scale by efficiently utilizing the underutilized  blocks to include a greater number of transaction records. In this context, the  economies of scale  increasing returns to scale  implies the cost advantage  which the network experiences with an increase in its transaction throughput  and  increase  in  the  value  created  by  the  network   number  of  confirmed  transactions  in  a  given  time .  More  specifically,  scalability  as  economies  of  scale to a blockchain protocol is a declining unit cost of transaction processing   bandwidth cost and individual transaction fee  as a function of the number of  the total transaction being processed. The  scalability  of  a  blockchain  protocol  implies  a  constant decreasing  unit  cost  of  a  block  capacity  with  an  increase  in  the  number  of  processed  transactions in that block. The increasing returns to scale is the distributed  economies of scale, indicating cost saving in a value co-creation process. As  more transactions are being processed in a given time, more tokens are being  consumed, and the number of users increases with the number of transactions.  Accordingly, the value of the underlying cryptocurrency increases, and there  will be faster circulation of the token within the network, unlike the common  cryptocurrency hoarding issues. This results in an increased velocity of money. As  discussed  earlier,  the  economies  of  scale  for  the  PoW  consensus  mechanisms can come from monopolization of the mining power by fewer  miners at the cost of decentralization of the network.2 However, according to  Catalini and Gans  2016 , PoW mechanism results in economies of scale due  to a network effect that guarantees security. That is, with an increase in the  number of users, the value of the underlying cryptocurrency increases, which  attracts  miners  with  higher  expected  reward  from  transaction  fees  and  increases  the  security  of  the  system.  Despite  its  promising  features,  the  scalability issue underlying blockchain technology is one of the main challenges  in adopting the technology to various sectors of the economy. Once the economies of scale with the scalability of blockchain protocols are  achieved, a large amount of data in the real-life transactions can be processed  faster and secure on blockchain platforms. Hence, identifying the potential  distributed economies of scale that can be attained by the network will help  in determining optimal mechanism design that maximizes the social welfare  function of the blockchain network. Network effects with increased usage of    132  Chapter 4  Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology Applications  a cryptocurrency result in the appreciation of the cryptocurrency accompanied  by  an  increase  in  its  value.  Hence,  network  effects  are  the  demand-side  economies of scale in a cryptoeconomy. This increasing returns to scale is the  competitive advantage the incumbent network enjoys in the cryptoeconomy  over  new  hard  forks.  The  more  the  protocol  is  scalable,  the  more  the  blockchain  community  enjoys  the  economies  of  scale  from  the  enhanced  speed of transaction  total value output  at a lower fixed cost of a transaction.   Develop a Business Model for the Token Sales Depending on the classes of token for securities regulation, the crowdsale  business models for a token sale can follow an initial coin offerings  ICO  or  security token offering  STO , similar to initial public offering of legacy financial  model. The initial coin  token  offering a business model is a decentralized  investment crowdfunding model for raising the inceptive capital of a blockchain  network. It enables monetization of the underlying tokens by selling initially  issued tokens to early adopters, thus allowing access to the goods and services  the  network  provides.  Note  that  in  a  tokenized  system,  the  value  of  the  underlying token depends on the size of the network. Thus, the ICO has an  impact on the token valuation. In the scarce token economic system of capped  token  supply,  ICO  pitches  mostly  focus  on  the  fixed  supply  of  the  token,  justifying the law of demand for the token market. Bitcoin and Litecoin supply,  for example, are fixed to 21 million. On the other hand, there are some cases to opt for the uncapped supply  for  instance, the increase in price for assets with a high velocity of money does  not  sustain  over  the  long  run .  The  creation  of  digital  currency,  like  cryptocurrencies, has opened a new window in the financial industry. In this  regard, it is crucial to identify the differences between coins, utility tokens,  and tokenized  securities. The  utility tokens   e.g.,  Filecoin for  a  file  storage  network or a voting coin in governance that identifies voting eligibility  are  used to access services within a given network. Utility  coins,  in  general,  are  consigned  to  be  a  privilege  of  membership  in  these ecosystems. In these networks, the value of the token depends on the  utility of the service within the network. The value increases with the size of  the network. An initial coin offering grants access to the network’s expected  services and goods’ provision in a similar way to the coupons that organizations  give  to  their  members.  Tokens  can  also  take  the  form  of  assets,  that  is,  cryptoassets,  categorized  as  security  tokens  in  which  investors  invest  in  a  token sale or an ICO with the expectation of future profit  through dividends,  shares, interest, or investment in other tokens or assets . A good example of  security  tokens  is  tZERO,  a  blockchain-powered  capital  market  platform.  Provided the aforementioned classes of crowdsale, the blockchain analyst has  to make an appropriate decision of which model of ICOs to follow and ways  to comply with the legal requirements underlying the fuel token. In the United    133  States, token sales are subject to the Howey Test, which identifies if a given  token is subject to abide by the securities law.9 Utility tokens are commonly  locked under some terms and conditions through smart contracts like the  ones in the Ethereum platform. Financing projects through ICOs  unregulated  funding model is found to be  risky as a result of growing scams. Consequently, the STO  regulated  business  model has come into place as an alternative to the ICO crowdfunding business  model.10 STO is one of the distributed networks’ crowdfunding or venture  capital financing business models. It represents tokenized securities powered  by DLTs and is regulated by the laws and agencies in the relevant federal and  state authorities. Unlike the traditional securities trading  like IPOs or equity  crowdfunding ,  STO  tradings  are  more  transparent  and  instant  in  clearing  without the need for intermediaries and are easily exchanged in the secondary  markets. The Money Morning reported that the STO crowdfunding model is  estimated to generate about global funding of $10 trillion by 2020.11 In coping with the security, token valuation, and incentive-compatibility issues,  other variations of venture capital funding for open source projects have also  been  proposed.  One  of  these  is  the  interactive  coin  offerings  mechanism  proposed by Teutsch et al.  2017  in guaranteeing a fair valuation equilibrium  in the token sale dilemma of certainty of valuation and participation through  token quantity specification at each point of token valuation. Fabric  Ventures  and  TokenData  report   2018   reported  that  more  than  $5.6  billion had been raised in ICO by the startups in the year 2017, accounting for  about 48% of the total listings across different blockchain platforms  see also  Table  4-1 .  Key  factors  identified  for  successful  ICOs  and  STOs  include  trust   which  can  be  built  through  an  efficient  reputation  scheme ,  transparent  information  disclosure,  smart  contract  and  governance  of  self-regulated  blockchain  community,  tradability  of  the  underlying  token  or  coin,  venture- specific related qualities  identified through the accompanying whitepapers, web  hosting like GitHub repository, network effect, tokenized asset, project initiators’  credibility, etc. , and the ICO STO elapsed time  Amsden and Schweizer, 2018;  de Jong et al., 2018; Fabric Ventures and TokenData report, 2018; Rhue, 2018;  and Teutsch et al., 2017 . Thus, most of the key factors underlying the crowd- based business models discussed under the equity crowdfunding determine the  success rate of a project financing through the ICOs or STOs.12  9 See Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which points out the  transactions which are considered securities and the associated requirements. 10 See Momtaz  2019  for the details on the token sales and the ICOs. 11 https:  moneymorning.com 2018 04 09 forget-icos-security-token-offer-  ings-are-a-10-trillion-opportunity , accessed on April 6, 2020.  12 See Chapter 2 of this book which presents a detailed analysis of the crowd-based busi- ness models, especially the equity crowdfunding, for the key factors behind successful  crowdfunding campaign.   134  Chapter 4  Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology Applications  Table 4-1.

This is due to the uncertainties and information  asymmetry problems underlying these marketplaces. This section leverages a  decentralized reputation mechanism powered by blockchain technology.16 The feedback system in the ecommerce marketplaces is important, especially  with  the  information  asymmetry  and  market-related  risks  underlying  the  market. This helps create a fair and efficient marketplace. Hence, an efficient  reputation mechanism can allow us to sort out malicious buyers bidders and  sellers  within  the  transactional  network  of  this  market.  The  reputation  mechanism  helps  sort  out  malicious  buyers bidders  by  imposing  buyer  requirements in the marketplace to those with policy violations, retaliation  feedback motive, unpaid items  after placing a winning bid or purchase order ,  or  fraudulent  payments.  An  incentive  scheme  for  the  buyers  is  that  being  positively  reputed  helps  them  to  be  identified  and  benefit  from  the  loyal  customers’  benefits  and  rewards.  A  buyer  with  a  negative  reputation  can  encounter limits on account privileges  such privileges in the eBay, e.g., include  eBay Money Back Guarantee and discount and reward offers, Gift Cards &  Coupons, non-cash eBay Bucks customer rewards program  greater or equal  to $5 in the form of an eBay Bucks Certificate to qualifying buyers , or the  Amazon Prime  a paid service that gives buyers a few distinct advantages like  free shipping . In a Vickrey auction17 of eBay, buyers compete and bid according to a private  valuation of the product. Lack of trust implies that a deal between a winning  buyer and seller collapses due to mistrust effects on both sides of the players.  Apart  from  the  payment  failures,  in  eBay-like  marketplaces,  a  seller  with  a  default  record  commonly  receives  lower  or  no  bids  on  its  listings.  The  prominent assumption in this analysis is that the players’ types are identified  by their past record of the transaction. In a repeated stage game, in the long  run  with  a  sequence  of  transactions,  no  transaction  deal  will  take  place  between  rational  utility  and  profit-maximizing  players.  In  expectation  of  default by the seller in the initial stage game, all other buyers do not bid or do  low valuations for a listing of this seller. As a result, with future reputation   16 OpenBazaar,  Monetha   Switzerland ,  Colu   Israel ,  Rate   Singapore ,  Retail.  Global   Moscow , Ubcoin Market  East Europe , Purse  San Francisco , OB1, Shopin, AORA,  Elementh, RAVELOUS, and so on are some of the ecommerce startups powered by the  blockchain tech as of 2019.  17 Vickrey auction is a type of sealed bid, which self-enforces second-price auction. That is,  in a sealed bid, bidders privately submit true valuations of their bids and the winner pays  the second-highest bid.   138  Chapter 4  Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology Applications  effects,  a  long-run  player   seller   would  prefer  to  be  credible  both  in  its  product specification and delivery. In this case, the player is identified with the  commitment types of players, commonly referred to as “irrational” players.  One of the game-theoretic approaches, other than the Nash equilibrium,18 to  capture this like interaction is the Stackelberg action  an action in which a  follower’s  strategy  depends  on  a  leader’s  action  in  a  game .  This  method  results in an outcome that commits the seller to be honest at any cost in fear  of reputation loss. Therefore, when the reputation effect comes to play, the  socially suboptimal equilibrium does not hold anymore, and that is what keeps  the  existing  online  marketplaces  running.  This  way  of  analysis  neither  guarantees an optimal return to the seller with strategic behavior underlying  the short-term buyers. A reputation mechanism should be designed in such a way that it identifies  loyal customers in the transactional network with these incentive schemes  under consideration. Negative ratings result in a limit on these privileges or  overall buying activity and account suspension in the extreme case. On the  other side, selling performance measures can be used to rate the reputation  scores of the sellers in the transactional network. These measures include  defect  rate   item  description  accuracy ,  late  shipment  rate   item  delivery ,  shipping and handling charges, communication, and cases closed without seller  resolution. Therefore, there is a need for a design of a reputation protocol  which can be all-inclusive and distributed. This allows all involved agents in the  network to rate each other in a rationally self-enforcing way. The science of  building  trust  calls  for  varied  insights  from  computer  science,  information  systems,  management  science,  and  psychology,  beyond  the  conventional  microeconomic and game-theoretic human behavior modeling. The subjective nature of feedback is commonly avoided by a scoring method  based on a set of values for random variables representing the feedback  eBay  feedback score and the detailed seller ratings . Another method suggested is  clustering  and  filtering  of  the  feedback  scores  according  to  their  common  features in order to capture the heterogeneities among individual raters  e.g.,  Amazon feedback and ratings . Collusive behavior, Sybil attacks, and biased  ratings deviate online ratings. As a result, the reputation score aggregation   18 A Nash equilibrium in game theory refers to an optimal state which leads to stability in  interactions of different players. In this state, no player has the incentive to deviate since  each payoff through the original strategy is optimally provided that other players’ strat- egy  remains  unchanged.  In  games  that  operate  suboptimally,  we  can  achieve  better  results by changing the rules of the game  e.g., by applying self-enforcing protocols in  order to attain mutually beneficial outcomes, co-utility . Selfish behavior can predict a  Nash equilibrium. But this equilibrium may not encompass other forms of equilibrium  that can arise in real life; the players can be not only selfish but also kind and may display  kind intentions that lead to different types of equilibrium. Such equilibrium can be cap- tured through different approaches such as reciprocal interaction through the notion of  reciprocity equilibrium  Turi et al., 2017 .   139  mechanism for online markets is an open research question. Moreover, cross- validating  malicious  reporting  and  whether  enough  feedback  is  solicited  depends on the underlying incentive scheme under the feedback mechanism.   Incentive-Compatible Blockchain-Powered Reputation  Mechanism Given  the  strategic  nature  of  feedback  giving,  in  which  users  retaliate  and  reciprocate, a co-utile reputation mechanism powered by blockchain tech can  enable to fill in the loopholes with online reputation systems. This mechanism  helps compute individual user’s reputations fairly based on a global reputation,  which is derived from the normalized weighted local reputation scores. Turi  et al.  2016  argue that reciprocity equilibrium can lead to a co-utile outcome  for  positive  reciprocity,  provided  that  the  outcome  is  Pareto-optimal  and  results in a strictly higher payoff to the players. Therefore, reciprocal feedback  can be co-utile feedback. Favoring one another in a reciprocal setting might  lead to a biased reputation system at an aggregate level. Hence, the aggregation  mechanism  should  be  designed  in  such  a  way  that  it  gives  weight  for  each  transaction in the network. In  the  game-theoretic  reputation  models,  feedback  aggregation  strategy  depicts  the  behavior  of  the  players  in  the  equilibria  selection   Aberer  and  Despotovic, 2004 . Hence, the aim of a reputation system designer in a game- theoretic reputation modeling is then to draw feedback aggregation strategy  that results in a single socially desirable equilibrium from the set of available  equilibria. Some of the conventional aggregation strategies used by the existing  online  marketplaces  include  a  summation  of  all  the  rating  scores   all  the  negative,  positive,  and  neutral  scores   or  an  average  of  the  total  feedback  score  in  a  given  period  or  percentage  of  positive  reviews  from  the  total  reviews. With the co-utile reputation mechanism, as the designing mechanism  is  with  the  underlying  assumption  that  the  aggregated  global  reputation  is  derived from normalized local reputations computed in a self-enforcing way  and aggregated in a distributed way with every player being the score manager  making the computation fair enough, this aggregation mechanism performs  better in depicting the true behavior of the players. Therefore, along with its  other  interesting  features,  this  makes  the  co-utile  reputation  mechanism  a  viable  complement  to  building  a  somewhat  organized,  efficient  online  marketplaces. Like  all  other  digital  economy  business  models,  ecommerce  is  far  from  perfection. Some of the major problems ecommerce markets face are depicted  in Figure 4-5.   140  Chapter 4  Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology Applications  Figure 4-5.  Common problems in online market  In a co-utile blockchain-powered reputation mechanism, incentive compatibility  can be achieved through a co-utile reputation protocol. The co-utile reputation  mechanism employs the first mechanism by setting zero reputation scores for all  new  and  malicious  players  with  an  intention  to  disincentivize  whitewashing.  Setting zero reputation  the worst possible reputation  to new entrants in online  marketplaces is proved to be the most reasonable mechanism to punish malicious  players  re-entering  the  market  with  a  new  pseudonym   see  also  Dellarocas,  2003a . For the second mechanism, blockchain tech can be utilized to record and  track unique digital identities, thus verifying users. The aggregate of reputation  data across the network is run on the blockchain tech using the smart contract  that defines the business rules.19 Thus, a blockchain platform offers a standardized  way of accessing reputation data of users that have been accumulated.20 A  decentralized  co-utile  reputation  with  a  costly  exit  and  re-entry  can  be  applied  to  secure  a  transaction  over  such  digital  platforms   see  Turi  et  al.,  2017 . The decentralized co-utile reputation mechanism is an extension to the  well-known  EigenTrust  mechanism   Kamvar  et  al.,  2003 ,  with  additional  properties of being fully distributed and co-utile  Domingo-Ferrer et al., 2016b .   19 See Dennis and Owen  2015 , Brunie et al.  May 2016 , Subramanian  2018 , Carboni   2015 , and Cai and Zhu  2016  for the details on the application of the blockchain tech  in the online marketplace.  20 On August 13, 2018, Forbes covered the potentials of the blockchain tech for building  trust  in  the  online  marketplace,  www.forbes.com sites shermanlee 2018 08 13   a-decentralized-reputation-system-how-blockchain-can-restore-trust-in- online-markets 1f6b1e9f481a, accessed on April 6, 2020.   141  Being  decentralized,  it  helps  avoid  interference  by  any  central  authority  to  compute reputations and hence reduce the problems of biased computation  and privacy issues arising from computation by a sole central entity. The protocol also has additional interesting features that make it relevant to the  online  market.  Specifically,  agents  computing  each  other’s  reputation  in  a  distributed way remain anonymous to each other during the calculation process.  Besides,  it  is  cost-effective  with  a  limit  on  the  number  of  messages  and  communication iterations needed to compute reputations, and, being an outcome- based computation, its computation can run parallel to the main transaction. This  protocol  also  manages  new  agents  by  assigning  them  zero  reputation  scores as if they were malicious agents, thereby disincentivizing the creation  of new or multiple identities to “clean” malicious past behaviors. The protocol  computes  global  reputation  scores  of  agents  based  on  local  reputations  resulting  from  individual  transactions.  The  computation  and  aggregation  mechanism  of  this  reputation  protocol  makes  it  robust  against  several  tampering attacks, both targeted at increasing the agents’ own reputation and  at decreasing the reputation of others. That is because the distributed nature  of  the  protocol  and  weighted  aggregation  of  the  global  reputation  scores  makes  it  hard  for  agents  who  try  to  tamper  with  reputations.  Of  course,  these like malicious agents can easily be detected by others  and punished by  lowering  their  reputations .  Therefore,  by  adopting  a  proper  weighted  aggregation mechanism of the co-utile reputation protocol, it is possible to  make  the  mechanism  robust  against  tampering  attacks.  Furthermore,  this  mechanism  is  robust  against  common  abuses  of  online  rating  systems  of  retaliation  and  reciprocal  feedback  systems  like  the  ones  on  eBay   Bolton  et al., 2013; Cabral, 2012; and Resnick and Zeckhauser, 2002 .   Blockchain Solution Concept for Users’ Verification  and Reputation Data Tracking In this case, a distributed identity solution preserving the record of relevant  information  and  ease  of  retrieval  whenever  altered   for  malicious  acts  of  whitewashing and tampering  is important. Such a setting can be formulated  with a blockchain platform that can create a token economy, helping to issue  unique identifications to the users  buyers and sellers . Such a well-established  record system enables easy verification and identification of the users. This  setting can also help track and uniquely identify the users registered within  the system, thus efficiently running the reputation system. In this network,  blockchain is used to record users’ unique identity and transactions and track  and validate reputation scores and token transfers in the reputation network.  The tokenization process follows a system in which the crowdsource of rating  peers is monetized and circulated within the ecommerce platform. Here, the  valuation  of  a  reputation  system  can  be  achieved  by  tokenizing  the  users’  reputations based on key characteristic variables.   142  Chapter 4  Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology Applications  For  sellers,  key  factors  that  will  help  in  the  valuation  of  reputation  scores  include defect rate  item or service description accuracy , late shipment rate   item  delivery ,  shipping  and  handling  charges,  communication,  and  cases  closed without seller resolution. Likewise, for the buyers, factors like policy  violations, retaliation feedback motive, unpaid items  after placing a winning  bid or purchase order , or fraudulent payments are taken into account. The  rating of a user in the system works like the voting system, but dichotomous  voting  scheme  enabling  upvoting  and  downvoting  depending  on  the  utility  derived from the transaction. As the ID verification process builds up and the  number  of  users  for  the  platform  increases,  the  demand  and  value  of  the  reputation token increase, hence resulting in a co-utile system.  Figure 4-6.  Ecommerce platform with a blockchain-powered reputation system   143   Use Case 2: Vickrey Auction The well-known Vickrey auction, a.k.a. second-price auction, refers to a sealed  bid where buyers place a coated bid on a listing.21 This auction mechanism  assigns the asset to the highest winning bid with a price of the second-highest  bid.  This  form  of  bidding  incentivizes  bidders  to  place  honest  bids,  thus  revealing  individual  willingness  to  pay  for  an  asset.  The  smart  contract,  distributed  ledger,  and  other  application  developments  on  the  blockchain  space   like  the  Ethereum  Name  Service,  ENS22   enable  the  execution  of  Vickrey auctions without the need of intermediaries. The technology enables  the masking of bids until their reveal stage in order to preserve the underlying  privacy principle of a sealed bid. A  typical  example  in  this  regard  is  the  hypothetical  Hyperledger  Fabric  car  auction network which is supported by the IBM Blockchain cloud service for  saving blocks of transactions and authentication and certification purposes.23 In  a Hyperledger Composer application, the participants of the network are defined  by identifying members of the auction to populate the auction network, the  asset to be auctioned, and the asset listing where members can place bids. The  structures of such auctions run on a permissioned and public blockchain platform  might pose a question on the authenticity and traceability of things in the physical  world. Once a listing is made available with a unique name, the transaction is  initiated where bidders place a coated bid on the listing. The smart contract  applies  the  business  rules  by  updating  the  ledger,  ensuring  the  transfer  of  ownership of the asset to the highest bidder at the second bidding price. The stages of auction execution on a blockchain platform are24   1.    The  auctioneer  initiates  the  auction  by  registering  an  ethereum domain name for the auction.  21 This use case is based on the existing recent developments of blockchain technology for  auction purposes. Some examples of blockchain-based auction include the Auction 3.0   www.eauction.idf.solutions  , a global decentralized auction for asset sale and lease,  Christie’s auction, a British auction house, and an Art Sale of $318 million on a Blockchain  in partnership with the blockchain-based arts and collectibles platform called Artory  www. artory.com  .

Potential bidders place a deposit for participating in the  auction  based  on  a  bid  deposit  requirement   this  is  a  security deposit for revealing the bid at the reveal stage;  a portion or all can be charged for not revealing the bid  at the specified time .  Buyers place coated bids  bid mask, not the actual bid to  preserve privacy  on the asset listing until the bid period  closes.  Bid  mask  can  be  generated  with  a  privacy- preserving commitment to the actual bid, where bidders  submit a hash of a nonce and their bid value which will be  revealed at on successful closure of the bidding phase.  When the specified bidding period is over, all coated bids  are revealed with actual bids.  After the reveal stage, the asset ownership is transferred  to  the  highest  winning  bidder  who  pays  the  second- highest bid price, thus updating the ledger. The auctioned  ETH  is  locked  in  a  smart  contract  guaranteeing  the  ownership of the asset.  At  the  closing  of  the  auction,  those  who  placed  and  revealed lower bids than the highest bid amount withdraw  their security deposit.  Figure 4-7.  A simplified business network of a car auction on a blockchain platform   145   Use Case 3: Self-Sovereign Digital Identity  Management With the advent of the Internet and developments in social media networks  over the past few years, digital presence has dramatically increased. This has  led to the formation of digital identities that are directly or indirectly linked  to  the  physical  world.  Most  of  the  social  media  networks  are  used  by  a  significant number of non-privacy-conscious users. Information asymmetry is  one of the problems underlying the digital economic system. Thus, perfect  identification of individuals through social media presence is hard with unstable  pseudonyms and possible multiple accounts an individual can own. The ease  of access and ownership of these digital IDs and the resulting zero marginal  cost pseudonyms underlying these platforms complicate the identification of  individuals through such platforms. In excelling over the digital presence of  people, recent developments have emerged to tap the underutilized potential  of digital IDs through distributed ID solutions. A legally recognized identification is crucial for the socioeconomic and political  inclusion of individuals. Identification is one means of social capital and trust  for  human  interactions  in  modern  society.  Data  breaches  with  centralized  databases and fraudulent activities are some of the key challenges in the digital  economic system. One of the major developments in the application of the  blockchain  and  distributed  includes  the  secure  decentralized  identification  solution  concept.25  This  contributes  to  a  safe  sharing of data through the Internet. These applications primarily focus on  securing digital identities on DLTs26 and further facilitate trust in identification- based  service  provisions.  With  its  underlying  features  for  digital  identity  management, the technology is referred to as a trust machine.27  ledger  technologies    ID2020 One of the developments in digital identity solutions is the ID2020, an alliance  working toward identity provision. The alliance between Accenture, Microsoft,  Mercy Corps, Hyperledger, and UNICC aims at providing digital identities for   25 Decentralized digital identity management has gained significant attention following the  advent of data sharing over the Internet. For example, the Canadian identity network,  SecureKey, has been joined by two US credit agencies  Equifax and TransUnion , Bank of  Montreal, Bank of Nova Scotia, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Royal Bank of  Canada,  Toronto-Dominion  Bank   which  poured  about  $20  million  investment ,  and  Desjardins in its early trial stage  Reuters, May 4, 2017 , https:  in.reuters.com  article us-canada-blockchain-credit-idINKBN1802OR, accessed on April 6, 2020. 26 Evernym is an example of an open source self-sovereign identity solution on a permis-  sioned distributed ledger: www.evernym.com   27 Vigna and Casey  2019    146  Chapter 4  Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology Applications  undocumented people, thus facilitating the attainment of Target 16.9 of the  UN  Sustainable  Development  Goal:  “By  2030,  provide  legal  identity  for  all,  including  birth  registration.”  ID2020  relies  on  blockchain  tech  to  store  and  secure  digital  IDs.  According  to  the  Identification  for  Development   ID4D   global data, as of 2018, about 1 billion people in 151 different countries lack  proof  of  legal  identity.28  As  a  result,  ID2020  is  designed  to  bridge  this  identification coverage gap. ID2020 is aimed at providing self-sovereign, unique,  persistent,  private   with  encryption ,  and  portable  identity  solution  for  the  global  undocumented  population,  thus  providing  them  legal  recognition.  In  decentralized  identity  solutions,  for  privacy  reasons,  private  identifiable  information including biometric data  fingerprints, retina scan, etc.  is encrypted  and stored off the chain and is accessible upon permission by the subject.  Figure 4-8.  Regional identification coverage gap29  As it is indicated in Figure 4-8, the identification issue is a common problem  all across the world. In developing countries, this mainly has to do with the  poor record and governance system. In developed countries as well, there is  a significant number of undocumented people, mainly in the urban areas of  homeless communities. Homeless individuals, while living on the streets, face  the risk of losing relevant documents, including government-issued ID, mainly  due  to  the  lack  of  personal  storage  and  other  personal  conditions.  Consequently,  they  face  a  challenge  in  accessing  the  needed  government,   28 https:  datacatalog.worldbank.org dataset identification-development-  global-dataset, accessed on April 6, 2020.  29 Source: Identification for Development  ID4D  Global Dataset   147  health,  social,  legal,  and  financial  services.  Getting  their  ID  back  can  prove  difficult for them as they are unable to prove who they are. For example, in  2015,  CBC  News  reported  that  in  Vancouver  BC,  a  homeless  man  Steve  Borik won lotto worth $25,000 CAD, but could not claim the prize because  he lacked ID.30 Borik was trapped in a vicious circle problem that he could not  get a photo ID without a birth certificate from his birth town of Montreal,  Quebec, nor could he obtain a birth certificate without a photo ID. After five  months of trial, CBC become involved and resolved the issue, helping him  obtain a photo ID in about three weeks. In this situation, if there were a well- established record system and ID solution which does not require the subject  to carry around the ID  especially for such vulnerable group of the society ,  the  time  and  effort  exerted  to  retrieve  Borik’s  identity  would  have  been  minimized.  Hence,  creating  a  convenient  identification  mechanism  for  the  undocumented  people  is  an  ideal  solution.  Hence,  a  distributed  identity  solution preserving the record of relevant information and ease of retrieval  whenever lost is important. Such a setting can be formulated with a blockchain  or DLT platform that issues unique IDs. The tech can provide legal recognition  for undocumented people and also facilitates access to the service provisions.   Refugee Camp Food Distribution Blockchain Solution Another example of self-sovereign digital identification is the ID solution for  the  undocumented invisible  refugees.  The  identification  of  a  person  has  a  significant value for the social capital of the individual subject. Refugee individuals  often lose their vital documents like government ID and possessions because of  the lack of personal storage or in the process of leaving their home country to  escape war, persecution, or natural disaster vital documents, like identification,  that reveal their background. This poses a challenge for building trust during  their  settlement  process  with  the  lack  of  trust.  One  of  the  international  organizations that deal with the humanitarian act of settlement of the refugees  has launched a pilot project that will facilitate its service provision addressing  the issue of traceability with the lack of identity. The pilot project led by the  World Food Program  WFP , Building Blocks  Blockchain for Zero Hunger ,31 is  utilizing blockchain for its food distribution at the refugee camps in Jordan. Initiated in 2016, the project aimed to facilitate the cash transfer without the  need  for  intermediaries  and  an  immutable  record  of  beneficiaries’  data.  In  2018,  WFP  assisted  24.5  million  people  in  62  countries  through  cash  transfers.32  During  this  year,  $1.74  billion  in  physical  banknotes,  e-money,   30 CBC News: www.cbc.ca news canada british-columbia steve-borik-homeless-   man-wins-lotto-1.3369155  31 See the WFP Building Blocks at https:  innovation.wfp.org project building-  blocks, accessed on April 6, 2020.  32 www1.wfp.org cash-transfers, accessed on April 6, 2020.   148  Chapter 4  Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology Applications  mobile money, debit cards, or value vouchers have been transferred to the  beneficiaries. Cash accounts for about 35% of WFP’s food assistance portfolio. The blockchain record system records biometric information of the beneficiaries  through an iris scanner that uniquely identifies the food beneficiaries and further  records the transactions with the WFP voucher. The technology is intended to  save  the  transaction  costs   of  cash  transfer  through  banks  and  financial  institutions  and speed up services through a direct value transfer using the  Ethereum platform. The eye scan payment system further helps resolve the risk  of fraud and double-spending of the food vouchers through immutable records  of transactions and unique identifications. The transparent record system also  helps  in  reconciliation  and  tracking  of  the  supply  chain  of  food  allocation  services down up to the local units. This helps perform timely auditing without  the  cost  of  collecting  and  sharing  information.  Moreover,  with  the  self- governance  of  secured  data,  the  application  is  believed  to  empower  the  beneficiaries in the service provision. As of May 2018, about $9 million has been  transferred to about half a million registered users through blockchain.   Civic A similar blockchain-based identity solution is provided by the Civic33 digital  personal identity verification protocol which uses identity verification tokens  called Civic utility tokens.34 In 2017, with the aim to create an open source  marketplace for identity verification, the platform raised about $33 million in  a  token  sale.  The  civic  distributed  ledger  protocol  records  attested  identification data and civic token-based transactions and performs verification  of  users’  encrypted  biometric  data.  The  DLT  protocol  facilitates  identity  verification between service providers. Encrypted biometric data are accessed  by the subjects through mobile applications, and user’s data can be accessed  through QR codes scanning at the partner service provision center.35   Evernym Evernym builds and operates Sovrin, a permissioned DLT-based global identity  network that provides cryptographic digital credentials.36 Sovrin is an open  source  digital  identity  platform  that  pledges  a  scalable  self-sovereign  and  verifiable ID solution. The network operates on a permissioned blockchain,   33 www.civic.com , accessed on April 6, 2020. 34 See also Tykn’s identity and access management system at https:  tykn.tech , accessed  on April 6, 2020.

The project is aimed at creating a  self-governed  personal  identification  system,  unlike  the  centralized  data  storage system, which is deemed to be costly and mostly insecure being a  honeypot  for  malicious  agents.  The  Sovrin  identity  solution  can  ease  and  facilitate  link  contracts,  escrow  and  payment  systems,  asset  and  document  management, an online reputation system, and so on. A user’s Sovrin identity  on  the  distributed  ledger  is  the  collection  of  the  user’s  Sovrin  identifiers   verification key , claims, disclosures, and proofs. In the same way as many other distributed ledger solution concepts, private  identifier data of users are stored off the chain. The following diagram depicts  the Sovrin ledger workflow. In the diagram, user Jane, with a sovereign digital  ID,  interacts  with  different  participating  institutions   banks,  employer,  government, school, retailer, and the chamber of commerce which has a claim  over Jane’s identity . Registered institutions share their respective public keys  with Jane and vice versa for verification.37   Use Case 4: Vital Statistics Recording DLT Solution Most of the developing countries have a poor record and event registration  of  vital  statistics.  For  example,  according  to  UNICEF  Canada,  only  7%  of  children  under  five  have  been  registered  at  birth  in  Ethiopia.38  Thus,  this  solution  focuses  on  providing  events  recording  mechanism  for  the  undocumented perspective and future population in the developing countries. An efficient birth record mechanism could help facilitate access services and  prevent right violations  e.g., early marriage and child labor  and further helps  the authorities in service planning like immunization delivery. In extension to  the blockchain digital ID solution, vital statistics and events recording can be  a  handy  and  feasible  solution  concept  mainly  in  developing  countries  like  Ethiopia.  Hence,  a  distributed  event  registration  and  birth  record  solution  preserving the record of relevant information and ease of retrieval whenever  lost is essential. Such a setting can be formulated with a blockchain platform  that  can  create  a  nano-economy  helping  to  issue  unique  certificates.  Vital  statistics recording using blockchain is being used or at least under pilot in the   37 See the Sovrin ledger which is built on Evernym at the Sovrin Foundation; White Paper:  “How Sovrin Works,” available at www.evernym.com wp-content uploads 2017 07  How-Sovrin-Works.pdf  38 www.unicef.ca en ethiopia-birth-registration   150  Chapter 4  Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology Applications  State of Illinois, the United Kingdom, and Brazil.39 For example, the UK-based  platform, Tykn, operates in recording data about life and death across borders.  The platform is accessible to authorized agents who verify and record birth  notification data. Events and units can be recorded through various mechanisms. The relational  databases  which  the  stakeholders  can  have  access  based  on  the  industry  regulation  and  several  existing  technologies  could  address  the  problem  of  event  recording.  This  is  one  of  the  issues  that  put  the  potentials  of  the  blockchain tech under question. Regardless, there are some potentials of this  tech in the vital statistics recording mainly in the developing countries where  demographic data is poorly managed. Combined with other applications that  incent  the  mini-economy,  a  blockchain-powered  token  system  and  events   birth, death, population statistics  recording solution built on top of it can be  helpful. Here, one might raise the question of why blockchain would be an  ideal  solution  concept.  One  potential  answer  for  this  is  that  most  of  the  blockchain solutions embed a social engineering element, which makes it an  ideal  solution  for  vital  statistics  recording.  For  instance,  beyond  the  data  record system, self-sovereign personal data management scheme, facilitation  of the service provision across the stakeholders, and further enhancement of  the mini-economy through value creation based on the tokenization of the  ecosystem are some of the features that make this solution ideal. This can  also  help  track  and  uniquely  identify  registered  members,  thus  efficiently  addressing their demand  e.g., medical service provision .  39 See Illinois Blockchain Initiative which was launched on November 16, 2016, with key  participants of Illinois’ Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity  DCEO ,  Department of Financial and Professional Regulation  DFPR , Department of Insurance   DOI , Department of Innovation & Technology  DoIT , and Cook County’s Recorder  of Deeds at stake: https:  blockchan.ge blockchange-birth-registration.pdf,  and  Brazil’s  first  birth  record  on  blockchain  at  https:  cointelegraph.com news  first-blockchain-exclusive-birth-certificates-recorded-in-brazil   151  Figure 4-9.  A diagrammatic presentation of birth and beyond record system on blockchain  On top of the event recording solution, a tokenized system that incents the  participants and creates value can be designed. Such a solution concept has  the potential to exploit the increased use and coverage of mobile technology  in developing countries.   Summary Despite  slower  pace  adoption,  Blockchain  has  remained  to  be  an  evolving  technology  with  yet  to  be  explored  potentials  for  businesses  and  digital  economy space in general. Gartner’s recent study puts the technology as one  of the top ten strategic tech trends for 2020.40 In this chapter, we have covered  strategic tools for adopting the tech to your businesses. However, it is important  to bear in mind that applying the tech to businesses today calls for evaluation  and prudent decision-making as the tech is not the only game in town. For  example, with fintech waves in the financial industry, considering blockchain- powered  payments  depends  on  whether  the  tech  outweighs  any  alternative  fintech solution and or if there is any possibility to combine the two. Moreover,  applying  the  right  strategy  for  the  adoption  of  the  tech  to  leapfrog  the  opportunities it offers to rewrite the economic power grid is pivotal. In addition,  as the technology evolves in its path to maturity, businesses need to continually  update their applications in order to be competitive. In association with this, in  2019, Gartner predicted that about 90% of blockchain-powered platforms will  be obsolete in less than two years unless replaced mainly due to the issues of   40 See Gartner Research at www.gartner.com en doc 432920-top-10-strategic-   technology-trends-for-2020   152  Chapter 4  Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology Applications  interoperability  across  blockchain  platforms,  dynamic  smart  contract  integrations, scalability issues, and corporate data structures.41  Figure 4-10.  Blockchain adoption across industries, based on 2018 PwC Survey42  Coming  to  its  potential  applications,  in  digital  identity,  a  self-declared  data  ownership  by  the  identity  owner  is  a  key  in  guaranteeing  rivalry  and  excludability of access to individual data. This allows users to grant or deny  access to their data and for how long. It enables the individual to decide who  should have access to what data and for how long. While the distributed ID  protocol calls for a self-sovereign data management, there still is a need for  institutional trust anchors that enforce and attest the validity and truthfulness  of a claim over a digital ID. See Hileman and Rauchs  2017  for the key roles  of gatekeepers in permissioned blockchain networks  listed as access control,  terms and conditions, software maintenance and updates  optional , dispute  resolution arbitration, setting terms for asset issuance tokenization, regular  reporting,  data  mining,  setting  additional  terms  and  conditions,  assistance  when  there  is  a  need  for  compromise,  etc. .  This  will  help  in  tackling  the  potential  risks   e.g.,  fraud   and  market  failure  resulting  from  a  perfectly  distributed system. Moreover, blockchain or other forms of the DLTs are not  to replace the back-office systems, instead facilitate organization and access  to the existing data. As Gerard  2017  noted:  41 www.gartner.com en newsroom press-releases 2019-07-03-gartner-   predicts-90--of-current-enterprise-blockchain  42 Data Source: PwC Global Blockchain Survey 2018   153  When  blockchain  schemes  do  promise  some  specific  outcome,  it  is  usually  the  magic  of  full  availability  of  properly  cleaned  up  and  standardized  data.  The  actual  problem  is  cleaning  up  the  data  in  the  first  place,  or  getting legacy systems talking to each other at all. For all  the  considerable  effort  at  computerization,  there  is  still  too much paper and human effort. Settlements can still  take days.  Even  if  blockchain  is  considered  to  be  a  secure  distributed  system,  the  robustness of the security underlying this technology is questionable. Potential  attacks  and  risks  underlying  this  technology   mainly,  cryptocurrencies  and  smart contracts  have been extensively discussed in different surveys about  the blockchain system security and privacy  Hileman and Rauchs, 2017; Joshi  et  al.,  2018;  Möser  et  al.,  2018;  and  Li  et  al.,  2017 .  Self-generated  and  maintained  keys  face  recovery  attacks  because  the  signature  process  lacks  sufficient randomness in generating the keys. With the decentralized setting  of these networks, in case of losses in private key, tracing tampering attacks  with the lost ID can be hard. Thus, this puts private security criteria of the self-sovereign ID solution under  question.  Also,  depending  on  the  consensus  mechanism  in  play,  double- spending  e.g., the usage of the same ID for more than one time in accessing  a  service  provision   can  be  a  problem  in  blockchain  ID  solutions.  Thus,  consensus  mechanisms  should  be  efficiently  designed  to  tackle  this  issue.  Transaction privacy leakage is one of the other issues raised. An empirical  analysis on the Monero  a cryptocurrency platform  showed that transactions  could be leaked with about 80% accuracy  Möser et al., 2018 . Therefore, the  algorithmic  design  of  such  networks  calls  further  work   like  replacing  the  mixing sampling distribution to near-real distribution sampling technique for  the case in Monero . As there are a significant group of non-privacy-conscious people  because of  lack of knowledge or impatience in access , the privacy settings underlying  such  digital  ID  solutions  should  also  be  designed  with  greater  care.  More  generally, regulatory issues, governance constraints, and bureaucracy are the  other barriers in applying the DLT solution concepts. Hileman and Rauchs   2017  argued that critical challenges  mainly, privacy, confidentiality, regulatory  environment, and legal risks  in the application of the DLTs persisted. Security  issues are also detected around the smart contracts  a.k.a. chaincodes  mainly  due to program flaws  Li et al., 2017 . For further consideration in the business  rule designs of the blockchain ID solutions  and beyond , see the summary of  a taxonomy of vulnerabilities in smart contracts in Table 4-3.   154  Chapter 4  Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology Applications  Table 4-3.  Taxonomy of vulnerabilities in smart contract sourced from Li et al.  2017   Level Contract source  code  Vulnerability Call to the unknown Out-of-gas send  Cause The called function does not exist  Fallback of the callee is executed  Irregularity in exception handling  Type-check error in contract execution  Function is re-entered before termination  Private value is published by the miner  Alter a contract after deployment  Send Ether to an orphan address  The number of values in stack exceeds 1024  State of the contract is changed before  invoking  Seed is biased by malicious miner  Timestamp of block is changed by malicious  miner  Exception disorder  Type casts  Reentrancy vulnerability  Field disclosure  Immutable bug  Ether lost  Stack overflow  Unpredictable state  Randomness bug  Timestamp dependence  EVM bytecode  Blockchain  mechanism  Using biometric data  e.g., like the one for the neural network facial recognition  or iris scan for the WFP ID solution  in digital IDs may not persistently prove  efficiency for all. Problem with a biometric data record like facial recognition  is that it leads to social profiling of some vulnerable group of people  e.g.,  homeless . Immutability is a challenge in situations where reverting transaction  records, like correcting errors, are needed  Hileman and Rauchs, 2017 . In the  long term, even if it is only the hash that is going to be stored on the chain,  other  background  information  stored  in  the  integrated  databases  of  the  participating  organizations  can  result  in  social  profiling  with  an  immutable  record  of  biometric  data.  A  digital  ID  can  also  pose  a  challenge  for  some  people   e.g.,  those  fleeing  conflict  and  persecution  without  revealing  their  identity . In terms of cost, small-scale service providers  like private shelters   might find it expensive to use scanning machines.   C H A P T E R   5  Currency Under  the Web 3.0  Economy  Digitalization,  as  a  core  development  in  the  modern  socioeconomic  and  political  interactions,  has  called  for  sectoral  digital  transformations.  In  line  with  this,  the  digital  economic  system  is  evolving  and  so  are  currency  and  payment systems. Financial innovations through a development of new financial  services and products to date have helped in reducing the costs of deposits  and increasing the return from lending. Some of such developments have been  discussed in Chapters 1 and 2 of this book. This chapter starts with a discussion on the ongoing arguments and trends of  central bank digital currencies  CBDCs . The discussion fleshes out the major  issues  arising  in  the  adoption  of  this  form  of  payment  system  by  the  conservative  institutions,  national  banks.  Further  limitations  and  feasibility  concerns about this form of payment system will be discussed in depth. The  chapter  starts  with  a  brief  introduction  to  the  CBDCs,  followed  by  the  comparison  with  the  conventional  payment  systems   including  banknotes,  bank deposits, other electronic currencies, etc. .    Abeba N. Turi 2020 A. N.

Besides, CBDC distributed ledger technology solution concept will  be presented in light of mechanism design for this form of currency. In addition,  further  consideration  in  the  application  of  the  CBDCs,  including  the  cost- benefit  analysis,  monetary  policy  implications,  regulatory  issues,  and  the  technical layer in the design of the CBDCs, will also be discussed. In relation  to the effects of the introduction of CBDCs, the implication of CBDCs for  the banks and non-bank financial institutions is also highlighted. Finally, the  discussion on the CBDCs wraps up by pointing out concluding remarks on  the prospects and controversies of its application of the CBDCs and directions  for future work. The  chapter  will  further  extend  the  discussion  of  the  Web  3.0  monetary  system to stablecoins. Stablecoins are price-stable cryptocurrencies pegged  by other stable assets like gold, stable fiat currencies, or other cryptocurrencies.  Here,  I  will  review  cryptocurrency  volatility  and  its  implied  effects  in  cryptocurrency as a unit of account, medium of exchange, and store of value  like  any  currency  unit.  Moreover,  by  taking  a  case-specific  analysis  on  Facebook’s  cryptocurrency,  Libra,  I  will  assess  its  underlying  stablecoin,  dubbed GlobalCoin.   Central Bank Digital Currencies:  Prospects and Controversies Central banks  a.k.a. national banks, reserve banks, or monetary authorities   are institutions that oversee and regulate the banking system and control the  monetary base. The world’s oldest central bank is Sweden’s Sveriges Riksbank,  which awards the Nobel Prize in economics. The Federal Reserve is America’s  central bank, overseeing banking and making monetary policy. Others include  the Bank of Canada, Bank of England, Bank of Japan, and European Central  Bank   ECB .  The  ECB  acts  as  a  common  central  bank  for  17  European  countries:  Austria,  Belgium,  Cyprus,  Estonia,  Finland,  France,  Germany,  Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia,  Slovenia, and Spain. Countries have a system designed to protect depositors and the economy as  a whole against bank runs  a financial crisis where banking customers panic to  withdraw funds . This system has four main features:   	 Deposit  insurance:  Guarantees  that  a  bank’s  depositors  will be paid even if the bank can’t come up with the funds,  up to a maximum amount per account.   	 Capital requirements: Regulators require that the owners  of banks hold substantially more assets than the value of  bank deposits.   157   	 Reserve requirements: The rules set by the federal reserve   that determine the minimum reserve ratio for banks.   	 Discount  window:  An  arrangement  in  which  the  federal  reserve stands ready to lend money to banks in trouble.  The central banks are responsible for the issuance of paper currency and the  minting of coins with a government decree in the fiat currency system. Figure 5-1 shows how money is created to circulate in the economy through  the  interaction  of  banks  and  individuals.  The  figure  depicts  a  simplified  presentation assuming that initially the money supply consists of only cash in  the hand of a customer and that she deposits the cash into a checkable bank  deposit.  Figure 5-1.  How banks create money from deposits and loans  Human developments in history have led to the creation of currency as a form  of medium of exchange. It is intriguing to observe how our payment systems  and monetary civilizations evolved from using shell money, stones, salt bars,  precious metals, fiat currencies to electronic hashed money  Ferguson, 2008 .  After the end of WWII  July 1–22, 1944 , the United Nations Monetary and  Financial  Conference   a.k.a.  Bretton  Woods  Conference   took  place  to  regulate international monetary and financial order through a new financial  system.1 With the participation from 44 allied nations, the conference came  up with a draft for a stable currency system. This resulted in the US dollar to  be the world’s reserve currency backed by gold. Because the United States   1 See Mikesell and Mikesell  1994 .   158  Chapter 5  Currency Under the Web 3.0 Economy  held most of the global gold reserves following the war, countries tied their  local currencies with the US dollar. Thus, with the gold standard, governments  came  up  with  the  gold  certificate   claim  check   for  a  gold  reserve  in  the  treasury,  thus  serving  as  representative  currencies.  This  resulted  in  the  convertibility of gold for paper currencies. In 1971, this system was interrupted  by  the  Nixon  Shock  following  the  suspension cancellation  of  the  unilateral  convertibility  of  US  dollars  into  gold  or  other  reserve  assets.2  This  was  in  response  to  increasing  inflation.  The  shock  resulted  in  the  current  freely  floating fiat currency system with political decree where no currency is not  backed by gold or other assets of intrinsic value. The value in the fiat currency depends on the confidence the public has on  its  government.  However,  the  government-backed  fiat  currency  system  by  itself  has  not  always  proved  perfection,  especially  in  times  of  crisis.  A  prominent example is the Zimbabwean $100 trillion dollar banknote which  was nearly worthless due to the hyperinflation the country underwent.3 This  notion  of  legal  tender   political  decree   has  enabled  the  central  banks  to  issue  an  unlimited  amount  of  paper  currencies  and  monetize  without  the  need to back it with anything of value and demonetize it when necessary.4  Moreover, as the digital economic system expands, our payment systems and  currencies have even evolved to electronic units with binary strings of ones  and zeros in the databases of the commercial banks and non-bank financial  institutions  NBFIs . The  digital  economic  system  and  widespread  use  of  distributed  networks  have dramatically increased human interactions resulting in the improvements  of value creation and exchanges. Beyond the disruption in the conventional  business models, such developments in information technology have posed a  challenge by potentially reducing the role of the government. One example of  such  developments  are  cryptocurrencies   programmable  money .  Like  any  form of developments in the payment system  like a visa card , cryptocurrencies   2 On August 15, 1971, President Richard Nixon closed the gold window and imposed a  10% surcharge on all dutiable imports to force other countries to revalue their currencies  against the dollar. See Irwin  2013 . 3 On May 6, 2016, CNN ran a story on “The 100 trillion dollar banknote that is nearly  worthless” highlighting the long-rooted hyperinflation in Zimbabwe and the failed central  banknotes in the country, retrieved on April 5, 2019. 4 The very recent example in this regard is the demonetization of all 500 and 1000 rupees  banknotes by the Indian government with the goal to “curtail the shadow economy and  reduce the use of illicit and counterfeit cash to fund illegal activity and terrorism.” See the  press release by the Reserve Bank of India “Withdrawal of Legal Tender Status for ₹ 500  and ₹ 1000 Notes: RBI Notice  Revised ,” Reserve Bank of India, November 8, 2016,  www.rbi.org.in Scripts BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=38520,  retrieved  on April 20, 2020.   159  are other forms of currency that revolutionize the conventional fiat currency  system. One important aspect of such currencies in the private form is that  they reduced the role of the government as a legal tender. However,  the  innovation  diffusion  and  survival  of  such  a  form  of  private  currencies as a payment system have not been long rooted to date. The wild  fluctuations in the prices  bubbles  and inconsistent acceptance of such forms  of currencies have led to the question on whether the governments have to  step up in the issuance of e-cash  or, more specifically, central bank digital  currencies   CBDCs   which  are  deemed  to  be  more  stable .  Unlike  the  conventional  distributed  network-based  cryptocurrencies,  the  digital  coins  from  banks  have  an  interesting  feature  in  that  they  are  free  of  credit  risk  backed by the fiat currency of the issuing bank  Dyson and Hodgson, 2016 .  The  main  purpose  behind  this  argument  is  to  keep  the  payment  systems  secure and efficient through a government-backed currency system, unlike the  private form of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, ethereum, and so on.   Central Bank Digital Currencies The banking sector being one of the facilitators of economic interactions is  considering mirroring the digitalization of the other sectors. In today's digital  society,  in  many  countries,  the  use  of  cash  as  payment  systems  shows  a  declining pattern  e.g., about 2% of payment systems in Sweden;5 Griffoli et al.,  2018 . As the digital society transforms into a cashless transaction behavior,  there is a need for the development of a safe and efficient payment system.  The  sector  faces  some  challenges  from  new  developments  in  financial  technologies. The developments in the decentralized private digital currencies have made  central  banks  question  and  experiment  the  potentials  for  the  central  bank  digital currencies. Some examples of the banks involved in the exploration of  CBDCs include the Bank of England,6 Central Bank of Uruguay, Norges Bank,7   5 www.riksbank.se en-gb payments--cash the-riksbanks-task-in-relation-to- payments what-is-money  6 In 2018, the Bank of England published a working paper on the design principles and bal- ance sheet implications of the central bank digital currencies  CBDCs . The paper showed  the dynamics in the initial stages of CBDC launch and the potential dramatic shift  bank  run  of private sectors and users from the bank deposits to the CBDCs  Kumhof and  Noone, 2018 . 7 See also a working paper series on the central bank digital currencies by the Norge Bank,  Norges Bank Papers No. 1  2018 .   160  Chapter 5  Currency Under the Web 3.0 Economy  Riksbank, ECB,8 Reserve Bank of Australia  on hold9 , Federal Reserve,10 Bank  of  Canada,11  and  so  on.  The  issue  has  remained  to  be  open  with  different  levels of curiosity, vivacity, as well as fear of the need, functionality, design,  feasibility, and related regulatory issues on whether these forms of government- backed cryptocurrencies are viable to develop. The idea is further circulated  and discussed by various experts and international organizations.12 For example, in 2018, IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde, in her speech  during  the  Singapore  FinTech  Festival,  highlighted  the  need  to  consider  CBDCs.13 She argued that the state has to step up in the provision of the  accompanying payment systems of the digital economy for privacy, security,  and consumer protection as well as financial inclusion reasons. A global survey  on the central bank's cryptocurrency by the BIS shows that central banks are  interested in the notion of the central bank's cryptocurrency; however, they  are considering it with greater care and caution. Most are only at a conceptual  stage with Sweden and Uruguay in a relatively better state of adoption. Central bank cryptocurrency  CBCC , a.k.a. Fedcoin, refers to programmable  e-money of central bank in which transfers take place on a peer-to-peer  P2P   basis without the need for intermediaries or a central server, unlike other  forms  of  electronic  means  of  payment  systems  such  as  mobile  money  and  credit or debit cards  Bech and Garratt, 2017 . The primary purpose behind  a central bank digital currency is to provide state-guaranteed electronic means  of payments.  8 Bloomberg on January 7, 2019, run a story, according to which “Virtual Currencies To Go  Down as ‘Load of Nonsense’,” says ECB’s Hansson. Quoting the cryptocurrency bubble  and the European Central Bank policymaker Ardo Hansson, they reported the need for  investor  protection  from  the  private  cryptocurrencies.  Similar  reports  show  that  the  European Central Bank has no plans to issue digital currencies; see story by Reuters on  September 14, 2019, quoting “ECB has no plan to issue digital currency: Draghi,” www. reuters.com article us-ecb-bitcoin ecb-has-no-plan-to-issue-digital-  currency-draghi-idUSKCN1LU1JM 9 See the Speech by Tony Richards, Reserve Bank of Australia Head of Payments Policy  Department,  on  “Cryptocurrencies  and  Distributed  Ledger  Technology,”  Australian  Business Economists Briefing Sydney, June 26, 2018, www.rba.gov.au speeches 2018  sp-so-2018-06-26.html, accessed on March 20, 2020. 10 Up until the writing of this text, the Federal Reserve of the United States is not con-  vinced about the idea of CBDCs.  11 See Fintech Research by the Bank of Canada: www.bankofcanada.ca research digi-  tal-currencies-and-fintech fintech-research, accessed on May 22, 2020.  12 See, for example, Griffoli et al.  2018 , IMF Staff Discussion Note No. 18 08. 13 See the article by the IMF published on November 14, 2018, with running head: “Winds  of  Change:  The  Case  for  New  Digital  Currency,”  www.imf.org en News Articles   2018 11 13 sp111418-winds-of-change-the-case-for-new-digital-currency,  accessed on March 20, 2020.   161  such   system   facilitates   their  central  operating   In its form of transaction, the P2P setting of this cryptocurrency mimics a  direct  cash  exchange  that  has  partial  anonymity.  In  the  retail  form  of  transaction,  the  P2P  nature  of  the  cryptocurrency  guarantees  anonymity  through a decentralized setting. On the other hand, anonymity is limited, in  that  transactions.  Cryptocurrencies in the wholesale transactions are thus instead preferred for  efficiency and cost-effective settlement purposes.14 For example, e-krona, one  of  the  potential  CBDCs,  has  two  main  forms  of  value-based  and  account- based. The value-based one attains anonymity where its ownership follows a  prepaid  business  model,  while  the  account-based  one  requires  partnership  with other central agencies in its functionality.15 The  central  bank  can  create  one-to-one  convertibility  between  electronic  federal reserves and paper notes, implying that the CBDCs are issued  ledgers  are created  in replacement to the reserves and notes or the other way round.  It is common that most  if not all  of the private cryptocurrencies operate  under  the  principle  of  limited  supply,  while  the  supply  of  CBCCs,  like  the  conventional money supply, is meant to endogenously be determined by the  market   commercial  banks—credit  unions  and  trust  companies—influence  the quantity of demand deposits and the money supply .   The Legacy Payment Systems vs. CBDCs CBDCs are different from other forms of the banking digital currency system,  in  that  the  electronic  currencies  are  issued  by  private  entities,  unlike  the  banknotes coins which are issued by the central bank. Thus, CBDCs are the  electronic  version  of  the  banknotes coins  issued  by  central  banks.  Central  bank  cryptocurrencies  can  give  customers  the  option  to  choose  over  the  commercial  banks  with  risk-free  central  bank  Fedcoin  liabilities.  The  key  feature underlying this form of currency is anonymity in the end users while  the  need  for  this  is  arguable   Bech  and  Garratt,  2017 .  These  forms  of  electronic currencies have not been applied so far. With an increase in the electronic means of payments  bank cards, mobile  payment systems, and debit cards , the survey by the Riksbank on the pattern  of payments shows a decline in the use of cash in Sweden  Skingsley Riksbank,  2018 . One of the key factors behind this shift in the pattern of payments is  related to the demographic composition of the people, where the younger  generation  tends  to  use  the  electronic  means  of  payments  the  more.16   14 A study by the IMF supports that CBDCs facilitate real-time and secure international   settlements  He et al., 2017 .  15 See Riksbank’s e-krona project report 2  2018 . 16 See also Mancini-Griffoli et al.  2018 .   162  Chapter 5  Currency Under the Web 3.0 Economy  Riksbank  has  been  closely  involved  in  conceptualizing  and  identifying  the  potentials  and  implications  of  central  bank  digital  currencies  through  its  e-krona project. The project works on researching on rethinking the Swedish  krona in a digital form.  If the state, via the central bank, does not have any payment services to  offer  as  an  alternative  to  the  strongly  concentrated  private  payment  market,  it  may  lead  to  a  decline  in  competitiveness  and  a  less  stable  payment system, as well as make it difficult for certain groups to make  payments. Ultimately, it may also risk eroding basic trust in the Swedish  monetary  system.  Some  of  these  problems  could  be  neutralised  or  mitigated by an e-krona.  —Skingsley Riksbank, 2018  Another  project,  Project  Ubin,  by  the  Singapore  Central  Bank,  is  also  underway.  The  project  aimed  at  creating  a  digital  token  version  of  the  Singapore dollar and securities asset. The digital token is intended to facilitate  the domestic inter-bank payments and international settlements that are run  on the DLT platform.17 A similar project is the one in Uruguay. Here, a pilot program on the central  bank  cryptocurrencies,  e-Peso,  has  been  deemed  successful  for  a  greater  governmental  financial  inclusion   Central  Bank  of  Uruguay .18  The  e-Peso  platform keeps the record of ownership of the digital banknotes and does not  utilize distributed ledger technologies of any kind. In contrast to the private  digital tokens  which are in most cases distributed by nature , central bank  tokens are supposedly run under the notion of the legal tender, which passes  regulatory  requirements.  The  platform  overall  issued  20  million  e-Pesos.  About 35% of the e-Peso was distributed by a third-party PSP that held an  equivalent of money with the central bank. Users own electronic wallets to  hold e-Pesos, where P2P transactions take place through text messages or the  mobile  e-Peso  application.  In  this  digital  currency  system,  the  role  of  the  central bank is a legal tender, which is a complementary monetary system to  cash peso.  17 See the report by the Monetary Authority of Singapore on “Project Ubin: Central Bank  Digital  Money  using  Distributed  Ledger  Technology,”  www.mas.gov.sg Singapore- Financial-Centre Smart-Financial-Centre Project-Ubin.aspx,  accessed  on  March 20, 2020.  18 www.epeso.com.uy    163  Figure 5-2.

The  main  purpose  behind  CBDCs  is  to  facilitate  a  direct  public  access  of  money from the central banks. Moreover, the private payment systems are  prone to shocks during economic instabilities and may face failure in crisis.  Hence, this form of complementary currency system by the central banks is  meant to create safe payment systems and secure stabilization. For instance,  during a bank-run situation where the public tries to withdraw their funds due  to fears of a bank failure, CBDCs can be used as an alternative to a bank run  from the banking system to cash. Overall, according to the 2019 survey by the  BIS,21  the  purpose  behind  this  currency  system  includes  payment  safety,  securities  settlement  arrangements,  payment  efficiency   domestic  and  international ,  financial  stability,  financial  inclusion   mostly  in  emerging  economies , and monetary policy implementations  see Figure 5-4 .  Figure 5-4.  Motivations for issuing a CBDC, ranked in order of importance: factors scaled  “not so important = 1” to “very important = 4” 22  Despite a very limited use of cryptocurrencies by financial institutions, the  underlying technology, DLTs, is into play for settlement purposes by central  banks.  Large  banks  and  financial  firms  are  working  on  using  blockchain  technology to transfer assets other than Bitcoins without the need for the  intermediary  in  the  transaction   e.g.,  for  cross-border  money  transfer  and  trading shares for closely held companies . One example of such wholesale  payment  systems  is  a  project  run  by  the  Bank  of  Canada,  Jasper.  Such   21 www.bis.org publ arpdf ar2019e3.pdf 22 Data Source: Barontini and Holden  2019 . BIS Central Banks’ survey on CBDCs, 2019   165  settlement  services   real-time  settlement   are  run  through  permissioned  DLTs.  DLTs  allow  decentralization  of  the  notion  of  trust—which  in  the  traditional system has been built by centralization either in banks or central  banks and supported by the regulatory, supervisory, and legal system and by  government funds—using cryptology and peer-to-peer verification to enable  issuance of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoins. Unlike the distributed DLTs, the permissioned DLTs  Corda and Hyperledger  Fabric  are perceived to be suitable for the financial markets and banks due to  privacy and other administrative issues. In these forms of DLTs, the consensus  is reached through trusted parties among the stakeholders  e.g., the central  bank in the case of settlement services  of the transactions running on such  platforms  Bech and Garratt, 2017 . The transfer of central bank digital money  takes place through digital depository receipt, CB's digital reserve liability for  which CB tokens are issued. The technology has not proved to be better than  the  conventional  centralized  system  beyond  their  minimized  risk  of  a  transaction through real-time settlements. Thus, the application of the DLTs  in the financial market infrastructures is still in its infancy, mostly at the proof  of  concept  and  pilot  stages.  The  technology  in  its  current  form,  however,  seems  to  be  promising  for  cross-border  transactions   He  et  al.,  2017,  and  Chapman et al., 2017 .   CBDC DLT Solution Concept What should the protocol for the CBDCs look like? This depends on the  roles the central banks play in the payment system and the interaction with  the stakeholders of the system  including banks, NBFIs, clearing organizations,  payment service providers, CBDC exchange intermediaries, businesses, and  individuals .  Kumhof  and  Noone   2018   in  the  Bank  of  England's  working  paper series identified three different models of CBDCs depending on the  access to CBDC: Financial Institutions Access, Economy-wide Access, and Financial  Institutions Plus CBDC-Backed Narrow Bank Access. The  access  models  can  be  summarized  into  two  main  categories   Norges  Bank Papers No. 1, 2018 :   	 Account-based model  users have direct access, and CBDC  account with the central bank and transfers and access  take  place  through  payment  instruments—mobile  devices, Web, cards, and IoT    	 Value-based  model   an  indirect  access  to  the  CBDCs,  where  users  use  non-central  bank  channels  to  buy sell  and transfer CBDCs    166  Chapter 5  Currency Under the Web 3.0 Economy  Moreover, the protocol development for CBDCs, distinct from the private  cryptocurrencies, should take into account for the role of the central banks  as  lender  of  the  last  resort,  legal  tender   CBDC  ledger  government  legal  decree ,  interest  rates  and  monetary  policy,  and  the  adjustable  unlimited  supply of the CBDCs.23 Digital wallets are developed in such a way that they  preserve the cash-like anonymity of the users. The private key is composed of  the information about the user, which is hashed and stored in the  distributed  relational  database, and CBDC ledger stores the index of each value transfer  transaction. Like all other cryptocurrencies, public keys hold the address of  individual users. Further design concepts on the technical layer of CBDCs are  beyond the coverage of this text. Figure 5-5 shows the possible basic design of the CBDC system. It is developed  based on the key classifications of CBDCs  Kumhof and Noone, 2018; Norges  Bank Papers No. 1, 2018; Riksbank, 2018; and Bech and Garratt, 2017  and  the general DLT technical layer network design concept.  Figure 5-5.  Possible basic design of CBDC system:  c  and  d  Financial Institutions Access;   b ,  c , and  d  Economy-wide Access; and  a  and  e  Financial Institutions Plus CBDC-Backed  Narrow Bank Access  23 Here, central banks need to have the mandate and ability to increase the CBDC supply,  thus the liquidity, to eligible institutions during crisis. Unlike the caped private cryptocur- rency supply principle, the supply of CBDCs varies with the demand where central banks  buy sell short-term government securities in exchange for the CBDCs in the account- based CBDC system  see Bordo and Levin, 2017 .   167  Important  issues  to  take  into  account  in  the  course  of  applications  of  the  modified  versions  of  these  like  digital  currencies  at  the  central  bank  level,  beyond defining the roles and legal mandates of the central banks, include24   1   Technical   issues:  Mechanism  design  and  protocol  development with different denominations of the digital  banknotes.   2   Privacy and security issues  anonymity of ownership .  3   Analytical issues: Concept design and application.  4   Regulatory issues: The legal standing of such currencies.  5   The  issue  of  interest  on  CBDCs:  Interest  is  charged  on   CBDCs and identifying the consequences.   6   The effects of such a currency system together with an   overall feasibility analysis.  On the legal mandates and requirements side, there is a need for an amendment  in  the  existing  acts  and  laws  defining  the  mandates  of  the  banks  in  issuing  currencies. For the Riksbank, the existing act is considered congruent for the  value-based  CBDCs  while  it  requires  some  amendments  for  the  account- based  ones   see  e-krona  project’s  report  225 .  Furthermore,  regulation,  cybersecurity, the economic cycle  during recession times, which most of the  financial  technologies  have  not  encountered  yet,  new  risk  scoring  and  risk  management models seem to have the edge over those of traditional banks ,  and rise in interest rates are other important factors to consider. Some of the  new business models have also not been tested over the long term  through  time price increase by fintech startups may result in customer attrition and  lessening the effect of price erosion on the banking sector , and some broad- based  structural  shifts  could  tip  a  given  region  toward  faster  digitization.  Denmark,  for  example,  has  adopted  legislation  that  calls  for  a  cashless  economy within five years.   Further Considerations in the Application  of the CBDCs In this section, we will flesh out major concerns, stir direction for future work  in this field, and implications of the CBDCs from different dimensions.  24 See  Barontini  and  Holden   2019 ,  BIS  Central  Banks’  survey  on  CBDCs,  2019,  and   25 www.riksbank.se en-gb payments-cash e-krona e-krona-reports e-   Hileman and Rauchs  2017 .  krona-project-report-2    168  Chapter 5  Currency Under the Web 3.0 Economy   Implication for Monetary Policy Interest-bearing  CBDCs  are  considered  to  be  alternative  stable  payment  system in the incidence of crisis while there are some reservations on their  need in some countries, for example, Norway.26 In terms of implication to the  monetary policy, there is no evidence of negative impacts of the CBDC as a  payment system. The size of money  of any form  in circulation and type of  payment systems do not have a direct influence on the monetary policy, but  can  facilitate  ways  to  conduct  a  monetary  policy   Bordo  and  Levin,  2017;  Norges  Bank  Papers  No.  1,  2018;  and  Rogoff,  2015 .  Hence,  CBDCs  as  payment  system  do  not  create  any  different  direct  effects  from  banknotes  than facilitating a transparent system. However, the store of value aspect of  the  CBDCs  can  create  an  alternative  to  the  user;  thus,  central  bank  can  impose lower-bound interest rate  negative where necessary , which will help  rule  out  cash   resolving  the  zero  lower  bound ;27,  28  in  addition,  the  lower  interest rates on CBDCs can reduce the debt burden for CBDC-denominated  ones that extend to the fiscal policy tools.29   Regulatory Issues As far as the digital economy is concerned, the rule governing the digital value  transfer and the need for the accompanying technology at the central bank  level  financial, technical, and legal aspects  are required. Moreover, framing  the ways to govern and regulate the private sectors  intermediaries facilitating  the access to the CBDCs and payment systems built on top of the CBDC  system  operating on the CBDC platforms is vital. With the anonymity of the  CBDCs,  further  consideration  for  the  ethos   ethics   such  as  anti-money  laundering, pathos for the trade-off between privacy and digital ID management,  where privacy is one of the emotional appeals for the digital society, is another  issue to take into account.   Technical Layer In spite of other complex issues that arise with the introduction and application  CBDCs,  the  system  is  supposed  to  be  viable  in  terms  of  a  technological  infrastructure.30 However, the type of technology which could be deployed   26 See Norges Bank Papers No. 1  2018 . 27 See Rogoff  2015  for the details on the cost and benefits of forgoing banknotes in favor   of electronic currencies.  28 See also Friedman Rule  Friedman, 1989 . 29 See Barrdear and Kumhof  2016 , Bordo and Levin  2017 , and Rogoff  2015 . 30 Norges  Bank  Papers  No.  1   2018   states  that  scalability,  interoperability,  accessibility,  security, and flexibility of the CBDCs are possible to realize assuming the associated  financial costs of the system development which depends on the technology, functional- ity, and security and other institutional factors like outsourcing and system ownership.   169  for government-backed digital currencies and the design approach remain an  answered. Here, to devise a system utilizing DLTs or alternative technological  solutions  CBDC ledger or an XRP-style ledger  without compromising the  central bank's role in controlling its currency in a secured attack-resistant way  is  needed.  Besides,  the  definition  of  stakeholders  and  possible  related  applications running on top of the CBDC platform requires further research.  Moreover, the question of whether central banks operate on a unique platform  of  their  own  or  a  commonly  utilized  global regional  platform  needs  to  be  addressed.   Disruptive Technologies in the Commercial  Banking Industry and NBFIs Banks based on their business line focus are categorized into three main types:   1.  Retail bank  consumer banking  is the provision of services  by  a  bank  to  individual  consumers:  services  offered  include  savings  and  transactional  accounts,  mortgages,  personal loans, debit cards, and credit cards.   3.    2.  Commercial  bank  is  a  type  of  bank financial  institution  that provides services such as accepting deposits, making  business loans, and offering basic investment products to  individuals, corporations, or large middle-sized business. Investment  bank  is  a  financial  institution  that  assists  individuals,  corporations,  and  governments  in  raising  financial capital by underwriting or acting as the client's  agent  in  the  issuance  of  securities   or  both   and  assist  companies  involved  in  mergers  and  acquisitions   M&A   and  provide  ancillary  services  such  as  market  making,  trading  of  derivatives  and  equity  securities,  and  FICC  services   fixed  income  instruments,  currencies,  and  commodities . Unlike commercial banks and retail banks,  investment banks do not take deposits.  Overall, the key banking services provided by traditional banks are financing,  investments, and transactions. Banks drive their revenue by bundling these  services.   Fintech With improved artificial intelligence, cost-effective data mining and processing,  and  convenient  and  efficient  speed  of  operation  capturing  the  low-end  customers' preference, the financial technology wave has created noticeably    170  Chapter 5  Currency Under the Web 3.0 Economy  significant pressure to the incumbent players in the financial markets, including  banks and credit card providers  such as Visa and Mastercard . Many fintech  companies  operate  in  different  business  lines   including  credit,  deposit,  settlement services, etc. . As such, fintech startups with technology-enabled  financial solutions are emerging. For example, Stripe31 is a technology company  that allows both private individuals and businesses to accept payments over  the Internet32 and is valued at $5 billion and has partnered with Visa. It focuses  on  providing  the  technical,  fraud  prevention,  and  banking  infrastructure  required  to  operate  online  payment  systems.  Square,33  a  financial  services,  merchant  services  aggregator,  and  mobile  payment  company  for  in-person  payments, is yet another example. Already-established  IT  companies  are  also  entering  the  traditional  banking  businesses. For example, in peer-to-peer money transfer market, Venmo, part  of  the  PayPal  company,  allows  for  easy  transfer  of  small  amounts  of  cash.  Major IT companies are joining the battle as well. Facebook has entered the  money  transfer  market.  Apple  Pay,  Android  Pay,  and  Google  Wallet  are  boosting  mobile  payments.  IT  platforms  for  matching  such  as  peer-to-peer  lending  have  provided  a  substitute  for  the  brokerage  function  of  banks,  particularly  crucial  in  transaction  banking.  Automation  and  algorithmic  decision-making  based  on  artificial  intelligence  have  brought  further  competition in transaction banking. Banks could lose 60% of retail profit  in  consumer  finance,  mortgages,  small-  and  medium-scale  enterprise  lending,  payments, and wealth management  to tech startups by 2025, according to a  report by McKinsey.34 Accordingly, banks need to rethink their business models through technological  solutions.  Upon  consideration  for  competitive  advantage,  banks  can  build  fintech  innovation  labs  or  buy partner  with  startups.  Factors  favoring  the  adoption of cloud technology by banks and NBFIs include cost efficiency, data  growth,  and  analysis,  speed,  convenience,  simplicity,  cloud  computing,  automated decision-making, and so on. However, there are challenges to deal  with as far as moving to the cloud is concerned. These include security and  compliance,  reliability   system  failure  and  other  disasters ,  regulation  at  the  core of the banking industry, and the like. It should also be noted that banks are  known to be risk-avert and conservative in some way. Classic examples of how  banks react to fintech are the American Goldman Sachs and Spanish BBVA.35   31 www.cnbc.com 2015 05 07 stripe-expands-into-asia-latin-america.html 32 https:  stripe.com en-ca 33 https:  squareup.com ca en payments in-person-payments 34 See  “FinTechnicolor:  The  New  Picture  in  Finance”  at  www.mckinsey.com ~ media  mckinsey industries financial%20services our%20insights bracing%20 for%20seven%20critical%20changes%20as%20fintech%20matures fintech- nicolor-the-new-picture-in-finance.ashx  35 www.cbinsights.com research banks-record-fin-tech-investment    171  De  Nederlandsche  Bank  already  uses  Amazon  Web  Services  for  a  host  of  banking services such as credit risk analysis, retail banking, mobile applications,  website hosting, and high-performance computing. Bankinter, the sixth largest  bank  in  Spain,  also  moved  to  Amazon  cloud  and  brought  down  their  risk  simulations from 23 hours to just 20 minutes. A Dutch bank Robeco Direct  N.V.  an asset management firm  managing around 8 billion euros of assets in  investment funds and mortgages shifted their whole retail banking platform to  the cloud.36   Access to CBDCs by the Households and Businesses:  Implications for Banks and NBFIs Potential effects and the disruption of the conventional banking and financial  institutions systems  e.g., bank runs from bank deposits to the CBDCs with  the central bank-backed deposit insurance  are some of the major concerns  raised about the CBDCs. The introduction of CBDCs has an increasing effect  on interest rates of extended loans and interest rate levied on customers’  deposit which also depends on the lending market structure  Griffoli et al.,  2018   see Figure 5-6 . With lower or no cost, people can switch between  CBDCs and interest-bearing investments such as bank deposits. This has an  implied effect of decreasing the quantity of real money  cash  that people plan  to hold or save in checkable bank deposits. In addition to the government- backed currency security, if CBDC holdings bear interest with direct access to  the CBDCs, then there are chances that households replace their deposits in  the  commercial  banks  depending  on  the  rate  of  return  accompanying  the  CBDCs.  For  example,  consider  a  hypothetical  money  creation  process  between a bank and its customers. Consider that Alice has $100 in cash and  that  the  required  reserve  ratio  for  the  bank  is  10%.  Let’s  say  those  who  borrow from the bank convert 50% of the cash into CBDCs and deposit the  remaining 50% at the bank. Assume that Alice deposits all her money at the  bank.  Following  this,  the  bank  lends  out  $90  and  reserves  $10.  Whoever  borrows the $90 will convert $45 into CBDCs and deposit $45 in a bank.  Given  the  required  reserve,  the  bank  will  now  lend  out  $40.5.  Whoever  borrows the $40.5 will convert $20.25 into CBDCs and deposit $20.25 in a  bank. The bank will lend out $18.225 and so on. Overall, this portioning of  deposits  with  CBDCs  reduces  the  amount  of  bank  deposits  which  would  otherwise  have  been  higher  by  a  monetary  transmission  of  50%  loanable  funds which were switched to CBDCs. This switch also shrinks the currency  in circulation.  36 www.financewalk.com 2015 technology-finance-career-trends-2015    172  Chapter 5  Currency Under the Web 3.0 Economy  Figure  5-6.  The  effect  of  CBDCs  on  commercial  banks’  loan  and  deposit  markets:  bank  deposits adjust for interest rate changes in bank loans  However, the goal of central banks, as the body of the government, is not to  disrupt the banking and financial institutions' business lines than providing a  secure and efficient payment system. Norges Bank identified additional factors  that might lay the ground for introducing CBDCs. These include international  competitiveness of a currency, where CBDCs allow a local currency to be  linked to different payment systems that would otherwise be linked to other  ubiquitous currencies; a payment system doesn't have a direct effect on the  monetary  policy  tools,  and  thus  CBDCs  are  taken  as  one  of  the  payment  systems; and that it helps in increasing seigniorage  return to central banks for  issuing currency through minting coins and printing paper money .37 A study conducted by the Bank of England pointed out that a potential bank- run situation resulting from the access to the CBDCs is manageable as long as  there  is  a  variable  rate  of  return  on  CBDC  holdings  and  CBDCs  are  not  convertible  to  either  electronic  federal  reserves  or  bank  deposits  and  if  CBDCs are issued against government securities  Kumhof and Noone, 2018 .   37 See Norges Bank Papers No. 1  2018 . See also Bordo and Levin  2017  who have stated  their concerns over the shrinking seigniorage with the diminishing use of cash in the digi- tal society.   173  In the same line of reasoning, Bordo and Levin  2017  argue that CBDCs are  “costless  medium  of  exchange,  secure  store  of  value,  and  stable  unit  of  account”  under  the  condition  that  account-based  access  with  adjustable  interest  rate  through  stabilization  monetary  policy  is  attained.  Thus,  households and businesses should not have direct access to the CBDC; rather,  they  can  exchange  CBDCs  and  bank  deposits  from  the  commercial  banks,  NBFIs,  and  CBDC  exchange  intermediaries  that  have  direct  access  to  the  CBDCs. Therefore, in this form, the CBDCs serve as a supplement payment  system to the bank deposits, banknotes, and government securities.   Outlook In this section, we have extensively discussed the notion of central bank digital  currencies. Open research questions in this regard include   1.  The  convertibility  of  CBDCs  with  banknotes,  other  electronic  the  responsiveness  of  the  end  users  to  the  access  for  the  CBDCs  currencies,  bank  deposits,   and    2.  Technical  layer  and  mechanism  design  behind  a  robust   and efficient CBDCs   3.  Whether central banks operate on a unique platform of  their own or a commonly utilized global regional platform  4.  Bank  runs  and  the  competitive  strategies  of  the  commercial banks and NBFIs against such technological  disruption   5.  Financial stability, monetary policies, and the governance   and regulation of the access to the CBDCs   6.  Further work on the compelling evidence for identifying  the  value-add  of  CBDCs  over  the  conventional  central  bank payment systems and whether central banks should  indeed need to introduce CBDCs  because the idea of  efficient  and  secure  payment  system  doesn’t  affirm  a  decisive ground for introducing CBDCs38  and so on  Generally speaking, the notion of the CBDCs is too early, and it is not clear  whether those involved in it in one way or another are going to consider it or  if a modified notion is going to develop out of it. Various studies of different   38 See Norges Bank Papers No. 1  2018  which identified currency competitiveness, insig- nificant monetary policy effect, and seigniorage in support of the introduction of CBDCs,  even if, according to them, the latter is not an issue for Norway’s baking system.   174  Chapter 5  Currency Under the Web 3.0 Economy  degree echoed the need for further study and scrutiny of the system before  its real-world application. Thus, there is no real-world evidence of the issuance  of CBDCs so far. The main problem is that the idea of the CBDCs did not  emanate  from  an  existing  problem  that  required  such  a  solution  concept.  Instead, it comes from embracing the newly evolving private cryptocurrency  notion. Thus, a whole bunch of complex issues arises in its introduction and  application. Whether this remains to be an infatuation of the renowned highly  conservative  institution  or  if  the  institution  ultimately  reaches  a  feasible  augmented version is a thing to observe in the  near  future.   Financial Technology Applications and Money Programmable  DLT-based  currency  system   cryptocurrencies   came  into  place  following  the  2008  financial  crisis  that  significantly  challenged  the  mainstream economic theories of the federal reserve system and monetary  stabilization policy. This development lucid Hayek’s private currency system  proposed in the 1970s  see Hayek’s  2009  book Denationalization of Money:  The Argument Refined and Iwamura et al.  2014  . Digital  finance  innovations  of  the  cryptocurrencies  are  considered  virtual  game-changers, meeting the fintech business model needs for the digital value  transfer  and  exchanges.  This  technology  has  made  possible  geographically  unbounded frictionless, secure, and cost-effective flows of values across the  globe.  Cryptocurrencies  like  Bitcoin  are  peer-to-peer  payment  systems  in  which direct transaction between peers is conducted without a central party.  A network of nodes confirms transactions between peers and records in the  blockchain  a public mutually distributed ledger, which is a co-utile network .  It  uses  cryptology  to  guarantee  trust  between  transacting  peers  in  a  decentralized way. Despite its promising features, these decentralized virtual currency systems  also have some limitations. Some of these include   1.  Difficulty in the exchange with other currencies  2.  Serving  as  a  tool  for  black  market  operation  and  tax   evasion purposes   3.  Prone to potential theft attack of private keys  4.  Expensive electricity consumption in computations  5.  A possible attack by selfish minors who could subvert the  system  for  their  own  benefit   see  Eyal  and  Sirer,  2014,  and Johnson et al., 2014 .   175  With the existence of selfish minors, the decentralized central bank like roles  of  the  network  of  miners  who  keep  public  records  can  make  the  system  inefficient. Hence, to make the ecosystem more robust and co-utile, further  research  work  on  developing  incentive  schemes  that  can  hinder  malicious  agents  from  subverting  the  system  is  needed.  Some  traditional  banks  and  financial institutions are working on using the technology for a cross-border  money transfer and trading  e.g., CBA, Australia, utilizing the Ripple payments .  A detailed discussion on further developments of this distributed currency  system toward the central bank digital currency system is presented in the  section that follows. In order to see the interest rate in the cryptocurrency market, consider, for  example, the arbitrage opportunity in the cryptocurrency exchange market.  Let the spot price of an ETH be 1 USD; crypto investor A wants to short sell  and  hence  borrows  Ether  at  10%  monthly  interest  rate.  Another  crypto  investor  B  wants  to  buy  Ether  in  a  forward  market  with  a  future  monthly  contract of $2 Ether. Crypto investor C wants to use the arbitrage opportunity  in the market and hence borrows $1 at a 6% monthly interest rate to buy  Ether. Then C lends her Ether to A  receiving 1.1 Ether  and sells it forward  to B for $2.2, making $0.6 profit within a month. With  the  speculation  in  the  future  cryptocurrency  price  appreciations,  investors are willing to pay high interest rates. Investors in the P2P platforms  for  the  cryptocurrencies  exploit  this  like  arbitrage  opportunities  in  their  crypto investment. It is important to note that cryptocurrencies like bitcoin  are  highly  volatile  in  prices.  In  the  conventional  cryptocurrency  exchange  market,  the  competition  between  cryptocurrencies   Bitcoin,  Ethereum,  Ripple, Litcoin, Monero, Zcash, Bitcoin Gold, Namecoin, etc.  determines the  price  and  interest  rate  in  the  market  for  each  digital  coin   Iwamura  et  al.,  2014 . Generally, an increase in the money supply, the minting of new tokens  to be circulated in the network, will decrease the interest rate and increase  income.   Toward a Shock-Resistant  Cryptocurrency System: Stablecoins To the other end of the currency system developments, beyond the CBDCs,  is a race toward evolving the distributed cryptocurrency system via a more  stable monetary system. In the sections that follow, I will take you through  the major concerns of volatility and recent developments in the cryptocurrency  world.   176  Chapter 5  Currency Under the Web 3.0 Economy   Winners and Losers of Cryptocurrency Volatility Speculations  in  the  cryptocurrency  market  fuel  their  price  volatility.  This  volatility in monetary values of cryptocurrencies results in fluctuation of the  purchasing power of such currencies, thus making them unstable as a medium  of exchange, a unit of account, and store of value. A typical example of this  can be the temporary price spike for bitcoin during the late 2017 and early  2018.  Cryptocurrency  price  fluctuations  can  result  in  winners  and  losers  within the blockchain community. Given economic transactions that involve  long-term contracts extending over a period of time, inflating cryptocurrency  can, for example, create a bias in returns. For  example,  a  cryptocurrency-denominated  loan  is  normally  specified  in  terms of the current cryptocurrency valuations. A borrower pays a specified  interest rate on loan and the principal over a loan period. This return can be  affected  by  an  inflated  cryptocurrency,  given  its  prior  valuation  during  the  initiation of the loan. Consider a bitcoin denominated 5-year term loan that  was initiated at the current bitcoin inflation rate of 4%. If we assume that  under this loan period, the bitcoin inflation rate remains constant, then the  inflation rate will be zero, which is less than the current inflation rate of 4%.  The real interest rate in bitcoin is the nominal interest rate less the inflation  effect;  the  real  interest  rate  in  bitcoin  will  be  greater  than  the  expected  nominal interest rate. Thus, the cryptocurrency lender will gain in which case  the borrower will repay a return of higher real value at maturity.   The Cryptocurrency World “Gold Standard”:  Stablecoins In an appeal to keep a stable monetary environment and currency valuation,  governments had been using the “gold standard” monetary system in which a  country's currency was linked to the value of gold. This monetary system has  its own flaws and is not functional in modern economies. Recent developments  in  the  cryptocurrency  space,  however,  have  borrowed  this  notion  of  the  monetary system. Volatility in the cryptocurrency valuations has challenged  the pricing of assets through such mediums of exchange. Thus, this has been  one of the main bottlenecks for the potential migration of physical assets to  the blockchain space and broader adoption of this technology. In order to avoid currency risks arising from cryptocurrency price volatilities,  some  traders  use  new  breeds  of  cryptocurrencies,  stablecoins,  when  transacting using cryptocurrencies as a unit of account. Stablecoins refer to  the notion of price-stable cryptocurrencies pegged by other stable assets like  gold or stable fiat currencies like USD or other cryptocurrency denominations.  The  semi collateralized stablecoin business model follows a hedge funding  business model that creates a token for the stablecoin and pools capital from    177  crypto investors that will collateralize the stablecoin in the form of asset, fiat  currency,  or  another  cryptocurrency  through  a  centralized  institution  that  serves as a custodian of reserve assets and issuer of a token, for example,  Gemini Dollar,39 Tether,40 and TrueUSD41  one-to-one fiat-backed centralized  stablecoins   and  MakerDAO42  and  Dai43   crypto-backed  decentralized  stablecoins   and  Basis44  stablecoin,  which  shut  down  due  to  regulatory  constraints  a non-collateralized stablecoin . In  its  raw  sense,  the  fiat-pegged  stablecoins  are  no  more  than  a  digital  representation of the fiat currencies; they are backed on a one-to-one ratio.  For  the  crypto-collateralized  stablecoins,  the  entire  system  is  over  the  blockchain.  The  non-collateralized  stablecoins  replicate  the  idea  of  central  banks  controlling  money  supply  without  any  collateralization.  In  the  same  fashion, business logic that defines the value of programmable money is set in  the  smart  contract  and  guarantees  a  steady  supply  of  the  cryptocurrency  through the forces of supply and demand. Note that cryptocurrency prices  are  unstable  because  the  cryptocurrency  supply  does  not  respond  to  its  demand  see Saito and Iwamura, 2019 .  Figure 5-7.

The  question of whether the stablecoins are steady, as claimed, brings us to the  following key points:   1.  Fiat-pegged  stablecoins:  A  regulated   fiat  currency's  valuation defines the value of the stablecoin it is backing.  Stablecoin  token  issuers  operate  with  accounts  in  the  traditional  banking  system   like  Tether's  account  in  Cathay United Bank and Hwatai Bank in Taiwan . Thus,  the trust in the central financial institution is crucial for  the  stability  of  the  collateralized  stablecoin   Chohan   2019   pegging  cryptocurrencies with the traditional currencies .  constraints   highlights   the   in    2.  Asset-pegged stablecoins and potential risk of insolvency: For  the asset-pegged stablecoins, market risks can arise from  the collateralized assets. If the price of a collateral asset  drops as opposed to the price of the stablecoin, then a  similar  risk  management  strategy  to  the  legacy  banking  and financial systems comes into play. That is, the curator  should  liquidate  the  collateral  to  close  the  position.  A  liquidity  crunch  situation  of  dried  cash  can  limit  the  liquidation  of  the  collateral  asset  as  required.  With  a  small  number  of  blockchain  community,  this  risk  is  inevitable.   3.  Trust  is  built  through  licensed  token  issuers  who  are  subject to regulatory supervision. Such a hedge funding  business  model  of  the  cryptocurrency  market  is  of  no  new  notion  than  creating  big  tech  giants  that  could  potentially monopolize the industry. Thus, a centralized  form of operation, as opposed to the inherent democratic  virtue  of  the  blockchain  system,  will  expose  the  cryptocurrency  ecosystem  to  a  single  point  of  failure,  privacy, and security risks with a non-transparent off the  chain verifications. In  addition  to  regulatory  constraints,  unlike  the  blockchain-based  cryptocurrency,  which  has  instant  transaction  validation  and  transfer  of  values,  the  fiat- pegged  coins  rely  on  the  legacy  payment  channels  like  wire transfer which is time-consuming.   4.    179   5.  Potential manipulation risk  like misrepresentation : With the  limited transparency of how much reserves exist in the  system at a given time, off-chain auditing is risky  e.g., the  Enron scandal of fraudulent accounting practice45 . Such  custodians  might  also  benefit  from  the  exploitation  of  institutional  features  like  exploitation  of  legislative  loopholes  where  the  industry's  practice  is  not  yet  solidified.  For  example,  money  laundering  and  illegal  practices with the anonymous features of the stablecoin   by fully or partially utilizing the innate virtue of blockchain  anonymous  and  censorship-resistant  ledger   or  pricing  manipulation  in  the  case  of  cryptocurrency-backed  fractional  reserve  stablecoins  can  be  some  of  the  underlying problems.   6.  Cryptocurrency-backed stablecoins are volatile with the  underlying currency they are backed with. In the case of  depreciation  of  the  values  of  the  collateral  currency,  blockchain-enabled  instant  liquidation   bank  run   can  make  stablecoin  less  stable  or  even  worthless.  The  collateralization  ratio  used  to  tackle  this  problem  is  inefficient,  where  a  fractional  reserve   not  the  total   is  recovered when exiting the system.   7.  Volatility  in  the  value  of  an  underlying  pegging  asset  currency  can  lead  to  financial  instability  within  the  cryptocurrency  community  where  uncertainty  on  the  value of debts arises for lenders and borrowers  see the  previous  section  for  a  discussion  on  the  winners  and  losers of cryptocurrency price volatility for the distortion  of the relationship between borrowers and lenders .   8.  For  asset-backed   like  precious  metals  or  derivatives   cryptocurrencies,  the  supply  of  the  stablecoin  depends  on the rate of the asset production. When the stock of  the  asset  increases  more  rapidly  than  the  blockchain  nano-economy over which the stablecoin operates, there  is inflation and vice versa.  45 In the early 2000s, Enron  an American energy, commodities, and services company   used a fraudulent accounting practice in collaboration with an accounting and auditing  company,  Arthur  Andersen,  through  techniques  of  “mark-to-market  accounting”  and  strategic transfer of problematic assets to special purpose entities  SPEs , misrepresent- ing its financial condition. The company consistently covered its internal problems and  publicly released dubious financial statements. Enron went bankrupt and collapsed in July  2002.   180  Chapter 5  Currency Under the Web 3.0 Economy  Figure  5-8.  A  simplified  real  asset-collateralized  stablecoin  blockchain  architecture  with  a  centralized group of institutions  trusted nodes  as a custodian institution. Note that, the con- sensus network, is a member of the custodian institution, and there can be a monopolistic  custodian with only one member as a trusted node  Even  though  blockchain  technology  came  with  the  notion  of  distributed  networks,  the  existing  trends  mark  the  creation  of  centralized  company  ownership  of  cryptocurrencies  and  cryptocurrency  exchanges.  Provided  that, owing to the deviation from the genesis notion of a distributed self- governing  network,  are  we  giving  the  monetary  power  to  the  centralized  business models? As a matter of fact, to date, there is poor interconnectedness  of  the  cryptocurrencies  with  the  financial  system.  Bearing  in  mind  the  regulatory frameworks that might arise with time, further developments in  the  sector  have  to  be  with  due  consideration  for  approaches  of  financial  stability in which the conventional and programmable financial systems are  interconnected and co-exist. Equally important with this is the adoption of  robust  models  of  risk  management  for  financial  stability   see  also  the  discussion under the security token offerings in Chapter 3 . Summing up our  discussion on the stablecoins, the following section will present a specific  case of stablecoin by critically analyzing Facebook’s proposed cryptocurrency  initiative, Libra.   181   Facebook’s Cryptocurrency Project Libra With  the  advent  of  the  Internet  and  broader  digital  inclusions,  we  are  experiencing a vast range of developments in financial technologies. This has  brought  a  number  of  tech  giants  to  stare  at  the  payment  systems  and  decentralized global monetary systems. This brings us to several questions  the  conventional  economic  theories  are  not  able  to  address.  Are  financial  infrastructures and currency systems public goods? Is there an implied market  failure  of  financial  inclusion  resulting  from  a  poor  financial  infrastructural  development? Are the market failures to be filled by the private tech giants as  opposed to the legacy monetary system? Are the notions of distributed global  scale digital currencies a substitute or complementary means of payments to  the localized fiat currency systems? Facebook is known for its business model of extracting and merging users’  data for ads and other commercial purposes. The company is now entering  financial  services  through  its  stablecoin.  Recently,  the  company  announced  the launching of its global payment system initiative, Libra.46 On May, 24, 2019,  Forbes  reported  the  company’s  plans  to  launch  a  digital  payment  system   cryptocurrency  dubbed  “GlobalCoin”   in  2020  under  the  Libra  project.47  With the company's worldwide presence and a huge network of users, the  project  has  a  milestone  contribution  to  the  innovation  diffusion  of  cryptocurrencies  and  financial  inclusions.  Libra  is  a  stable  cryptocurrency  operating on the Libra Blockchain48 deemed to facilitate global transactions,  payments, and money transfer over the Internet, enabling further digitization  of assets. It is a stablecoin planned to be pegged to a reserve of assets and  basket of fiat currencies, including the US dollar, euro, and Japanese yen and  short-term government securities guaranteeing the stability of the value of its  digital currency. The monetary system works in such a way that Facebook's Libra Association  being  the  issuer  of  the  digital  currency  distributes  a  cryptographic  token,  Libra,  in  exchange  for  specified  fiat  currency.  The  collateralization  ratio  in  most of the fiat-pegged stablecoins is on a 1-to-1 exchange rate. The exchange  rate, when it comes to the Libra, will depend on the real asset  currency  it is  backed with, in which case it might vary depending on the type of the collateral   given  the  exchange  rate  between  the  fiat  currencies  themselves,  it  is  not   46 An Introduction to Libra, a White Paper from the Libra Association Members, https:    libra.org en-US white-paper , accessed on April 20, 2020.  47 www.theguardian.com technology 2019 may 24 facebook-plans-to-launch-  globalcoin-cryptocurrency-in-2020, accessed on April 20, 2020.  48 See  the  Libra  Blockchain  at  https:  developers.libra.org docs the-libra-  blockchain-paper, accessed on April 20, 2020.   182  Chapter 5  Currency Under the Web 3.0 Economy  rational  to  set  a  1-to-1  collateralization  ratio  both  for  USD  and  euro,  for  example .  I believe it should be as easy to send money to someone as it is to send a  photo.  —Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook Inc.’s annual F8 developers  conference, San Jose, California, April 30, 2019  The company, like all other tech giants, was criticized for free riding consumers'  digital  presence  in  its  network.  Moreover,  there  was  no  compensation  or  reward  framework  to  the  honeypot  of  users  over  which  the  company's  business  model  relies  on.  Its  current  payment  system  is  also  designed  to  reward users for their activities within the network, including viewing of ads,  online  shopping  content  interaction,  and  so  on,  thereupon  enabling  the  transition  from  the  network  users'  business  model  to  that  of  participants.  Given this, such a payment system might have the potential for compensating  the free riding over the Internet. In terms of scalability, the global network of users of Facebook is ideal to  adopt the GlobalCoin as a payment system. Facebook's billions of global users  promise significant network externalities and economies of scope for its new  proposed  payment  system.  Free  riding  over  the  Internet   like  usage  of  customer  data  by  the  tech  companies   is  a  common  phenomenon  of  the  digital economic system. As a result, the company can provide financial service  at a near-zero marginal cost. Thus, the company can benefit from the low  entry cost, but exit costs are questionable. This is mainly due to the implied  political, economic, social, technological, environmental, and regulatory global  financial environment over which the company operates. Libra  has  got  support  from  the  biggest  players  in  the  industry,  including  Mastercard, Visa, PayPal, Uber, Lyft, eBay, Stripe, and Spotify. The project also  plans to work with money transfer firms like MoneyGram and the Western  Union. Facebook charges about $10 million to participate in the network with  the aim to raise about $1 billion from the companies it includes in the network.  Thus, Libra benefits from the huge potential where there is a requirement for  liquidity and pricing of the cryptoasset since the network will be endowed  with  a  sufficient  supply  of  users  posting  collateral  for  the  creation  of  the  pegged  asset,  Libra.  The  company's  established  customer  base  and  brand  recognition are sought to benefit the functionality of this payment system.  Moreover, the payment system is complementary with its core non-financial  business line and to that of participating companies within the Libra network. Libra blockchain is a permissioned blockchain with an identified network of  validators under the Libra Association. A diverse network of 100 validators is  planned to come from a diverse set of industries and geographic coverage,  including tech companies, online marketplaces, telecom, academic institutions,    183  payment service providers, and non-profits.49 The association headquartered  in  Geneva,  Switzerland,  governs  the  system,  and  the  underlying  consensus  mechanism is set based on these networks of nodes. The Libra Association,  through its globally placed institutions, is to act as a central trusted custodian  to store the real collateralized asset  reserve . As it is common for the centralized stablecoin, this business model suffers  from  transparency  and  audit  issues  of  the  required  reserve  in  the  system.  Combined  with  the  privacy  and  security  issues,  this  poses  a  significant  challenge to customer protection. The company entering the financial industry  will be operating in a diverse and highly regulated global financial environment.  The  conventional  payment  channels  over  which  liquidation  and  transfer  of  payments take place also make the business distinct from the serial distributed  blockchain-powered  cryptocurrency  system.  Bridging  the  gap  for  the  digitalization of assets and utilization of the existing  potentially upcoming   fully decentralized payment systems is a thing to be taken into account as far  as the migration of assets to the blockchain ecosystem is in place. This requires  an efficiently framed collateralization ratio and price stabilization policy that  can cope with the highly volatile cryptocurrency world. Facebook's business model, like most of the other big tech companies, is built  on fetching customer data and facilitating a direct peer-to-peer interaction on  its network of customers. When it comes to its new cryptocurrency initiative,  the company faces a significant layer of hurdles both in terms of the exploitation  of its network base and from various regulators. Even if Facebook has a big  network of global users, verifiability and reliability of users' data from a virtual  self of users will be in question when it comes to financial service providers.  Privacy and security of users’ data is another issue to take into account with  the  poor  track  record  the  company  has  in  this  regard.50  The  notion  of  stablecoins  has  yet  to  be  stress-tested,  and  Facebook  in  its  Libra  initiative  might experience a vast range of challenges from the dynamic technological  environment and the financial industry as a whole.  49 In  its  initial  stage,  founding  members  of  the  association  are  identified  as  Mastercard,  PayPal,  PayU   Naspers’  fintech  arm ,  Stripe,  Visa,  Booking  Holdings,  eBay,  Facebook  Calibra, Farfetch, Lyft, MercadoPago, Spotify AB, Uber Technologies, Inc., Iliad, Vodafone  Group,  Anchorage,  Bison  Trails,  Coinbase,  Inc.,  Xapo  Holdings  Limited,  Andreessen  Horowitz,  Breakthrough  Initiatives,  Ribbit  Capital,  Thrive  Capital,  Union  Square  Ventures, Creative Destruction Lab, Kiva, Mercy Corps, and Women’s World Banking.

Lastly, beyond the physical  world  operation,  the  robustness  of  the  underlying  technology   DLTs  in  general   in  its  current  state  of  development  is  questionable  to  power  the  stablecoins. With the major hacks and attacks we experienced, the belief that  considers distributed ledger technologies as trust machines of the information  society is misleading. On the other side, if efficiently designed and implemented, the notion of a  stable  currency  system  might  be  promising  for  financial  stability,  mainly  in  developing countries. Developing countries' currencies are less stable, with  governments continually printing money devaluing their local currencies  e.g.,  Zimbabwe's hyperinflation with a 100TN Zimbabwe dollar equivalent to 40  USD  cents  in  201551 .  Thus,  global  stablecoins  of  this  form  could  have  implications for stabilization of the currencies in the developing countries, but  at the cost of giving the monetary power to the tech giants instead of the  central banks  Fabric Ventures and TokenData report, 2018 . As far as financial  technologies are concerned, regulations opening a common playfield for the  tech giants entering the financial space and that of banks are vital.52 Table 5-1  shows  the  major  global  regulatory  landscape  toward  the  tech  giants.  It  presents four different angles of the tech regulations: limits on the use of data  and restriction on entry for big techs, property rights on data to consumers,  and market entry promotion for big techs.  51 Could  Libra  solve  Zimbabwe’s  hyperinflation  whose  monetary  system  has  been  on  a  roller coaster?

In this  regard, the advent of programmable money like Bitcoin  with all the arguments  going around such distributed cryptocurrencies , CBDCs, and stablecoins are  lending the opportunities to rethink the functionalities of centralized monetary  systems. Accordingly, even if the fundamental principles and functions remain  untouched, currency systems have evolved from the genesis form. Today, the dynamically shifting digital economic environment has facilitated  such  developments  in  the  currency  and  payment  systems.  Moreover,  technological advancements such as the Web 2.0 developments, Blockchain  and  distributed  ledger  technology,  data  analytics,  artificial  intelligence,  and  cloud computing are influencing the evolution in the financial systems.  53 www.bis.org publ arpdf ar2019e3.pdf   186  Chapter 5  Currency Under the Web 3.0 Economy  I think that the Internet is going to be one of the major forces for reducing  the role of government. The one thing that is missing, but that will soon be  developed, is a reliable e-Cash. A method whereby on the internet you can  transfer funds from A to B, without A knowing B or B knowing A.  —Milton Friedman, July 1999  To  this  end,  CBDC  systems  and  stablecoin   though  not  the  ultimate  developments in the field  could be the next breakthrough in the evolution of  currency systems of our digital era.
