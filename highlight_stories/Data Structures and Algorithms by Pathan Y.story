Introduction  Data	Structures	is	a	study	or	a	technique	used	to	understand	how	to	store	a	bunch	of data	in	an	organized	manner,	so	it	can	be	used	in	a	very	sophisticated	manner	for designing	of	programs	and	algorithms.  Data	structure	diagram  Data	structure	is	a	vital	subject	to	the	discipline	of	Information	and	Computer technology. In	simple	words	Data	structure	is	nothing	but	storing	and	then	fetching	of	the	data from	any	part	of	the	memory	of	the	computer	in	an	organized	manner	whenever needed. The	term	Data	Structure	was	first	coined	into	existence	in	year	1976	written	by Niklaus	Wirth	in	his	book	“Algorithms	+	Data	structures	=	Programs”,	which covered	some	fundamental	details	of	computer	programming.  Types	of	data	structures  Arrays:	Simplest	data	structure	which	shows	linearity	as	a	property.	The	elements are	arranged	in	a	linear	manner.	Let	us	choose	X	as	a	name	for	the	array.	And	the elements	are	referenced	respectively	by	numbers		1,2,3,….,n	.Therefore	it	can	be denoted	by  1.	 Subscript	notation:	x1,	x2,	x3,	………,	xn	; 2.	 By	parenthesis	notation:	K 1 ,	K 2 ,	K 3 ,	………,K N ; 3.	 By	bracket	notation:	K[1],	K[2],	K[3],	……,	K[N].  Now	Y	in	K[Y]	is	called	subscript	and	K[Y]	in	whole	is	called	a	subscripted	variable.  Linked	Lists:	In	this	type	of	data	structure	it’s	difficult	to	fetch	data	from	the	data since	it	might	be	massive.	In	this	particular	situation	we	use	the	tools	like	pointer   and	link.	Both	pointer	and	link	have	different	functionality. Pointer:	is	used	when	it’s	needed	for	an	element	in	one	list	to	point	to	an	element	in a	different	list.	Link	is	used	when	an	element	in	a	list	points	to	an	element	in	that same	list. Trees:	This	type	represents	the	whole	data	present	in	a	hierarchical	form	on	the basis	of	the	relationship	between	the	elements	in	that	group	of	data. Stack:	It’s	last	in	first	out.	In	this	type	of	data	structure	the	data	are	inserted	and deleted	from	one	point.	It’s	just	one	way	in	and	out. Queue:	It	is	first	in	first	out.	In	this	data	is	inserted	from	one	side	which	will	be	the front	and	pushed	to	the	other	side	till	it	reaches	the	end	that	is	the	rear	side.	It	has two	ways,	one	way	in	and	another	way	out. Graph:	It	depicts	relationship	between	pairs	of	elements.  Operations	of	data	structures  Traversing:	Accessing	or	visiting	the	record	to	be	processed. Searching:	Finding	the	record	or	the	location	of	the	record	with	the	key	value. Insertion:	Adding	a	record. Deletion:	Removal	of	record. Sorting:	Arranging	records	in	the	needed	order. Merging:	Combining	two	records	into	a	single	file.    Data	Structure	for	Strings Strings	in	data	structure	are	character	data	in	sequence.  Characters	used	are:  Alphabet:	A,	B,	C,….,	Z.  Digit:	0	1	2	…..	9.  Special	characters	are:	+	-	 	*	 		 	,		.	$	=	‘	  Storing	of	strings  String	can	be	stored	in	three	types	of	structures: Fixed-length	structures, Variable-length	structures	with	maximum	limit	set, Three	linked	structures.  Fixed-length	storage  In	this	each	line	is	seen	as	a	record	and	all	records	have	the	same	length.  Main	advantages	of	this	way	of	storing	strings	are:  Easy	to	access	data. Easy	to	update	data.  Main	disadvantages	of	this	kind	of	storing	technique:  Waste	of	time	due	to	inessential	blank	space. Changing	even	a	misspelled	word	leads	to	change	in	the	whole	record.  Variable-length	structure	with	maximum	limit	set  The	storage	can	be	done	in	two	general	ways:  Use	of	a	marker	to	show	the	end	of	the	string. Length	of	the	string	can	be	listed	as	an	item	in	the	pointer	array.   Linked	storage  Record	with	sentinels  In	this	memory	cells	are	assigned	to	a	character	and	also	a	link	that	would	provide	them the	address	of	the	cell	that	has	the	next	character	in	the	string.  Linked	list  Operations	of	string	and	its	data	type  String	oriented	operations	are.  Substring:	To	access	a	substring	there	is	need	of	three	key	values: String	name, Position	of	substring	in	the	string, Substring	length. Indexing:	This	is	done	by	pattern	matching. Concatenation:	It	is	dented	by	  .	For	example	P	and	B	are	two	strings.	P  B	states that	character	of	P	is	followed	by	that	of	B. Length:	Total	number	of	character	in	a	string	depicts	the	length.  Word	processing   Word	processing	just	modifies	the	data.  The	operations	of	word	processing	are	as	follows:  Replace	operation:	Replacing	the	given	string	with	another. REPLACE	 text,	pattern	a,	pattern	b  Insertion:	To	add	or	insert	a	string. INSERT	 text,	location,	string  Delete	operation:	Deletion	of	string. DELETE	 A,	INDEX	 A,	B ,	LENGTH	 B  .  Pattern	matching	algorithms  Pattern	matching	is	the	complexity	that	arises	to	find	out	whether	the	given	string	pattern A	appears	in	a	string	text	D.  Note:	Sometimes	in	pattern	matching	algorithms,	characters	are	denoted	in	lower	case letters	format	such	as	x,	y,	z	…..and	for	denoting	repetition	exponents	are	used.  For	example  x2	y3xy3	for	xxyyyxyyy	and	 pq 3	for	pqpqpq  Empty	string	can	be	denoted	by	Greek	letter	lambda	 ʎ .  First	Pattern	Matching	Algorithm  In	this	kind	of	pattern	matching	algorithm	we	compare	pattern	A	with	each	substring	of pattern	D.	Therefore	moving	the	match	process	is	done	from	left	to	right	till	it	gets	a match	to	that	of	the	pattern.  Algorithm:  A	and	D	are	string	with	length	X	and	Y,	respectively,	where	they	are	stored	as	arrays	with one	character	per	element.	Find	out	the	index	of	A	in	D. STEP	1: Set	B ≔ 1	and	MAX ≔ 	X	–	Y	+	1. STEP	2: REPEAT	THE	STEP	3	TO	5	while	B	≤	MAX:  STEP	3: REPEAT	FOR	Q=1	to	X:  If	A	[Q]≠	D[	B	+	Q	–	1	],	THEN:  STEP	4: Set	INDEX	=	B,	AND	EXIT.	  Success   STEP	5: Set	B ≔ 	B	+	1.	  End	of	step	2	outer	loop     STEP	6: Set	INDEX	=	0.  STEP	7: Exit.  Note:	Complexity	in	this	pattern	states	that	the	time	required	executing	the	algorithm	is	n2. Where	n	=	x	+	y,	when	A	is	x	-	character	string	and	B	is	y	–	character	string.  Second	pattern	matching	algorithm  This	pattern	matching	algorithm	does	use	a	table	which	is	derived	from	particular	pattern A	but	independent	of	the	text	D.  Then	the	D	has	one	of	the	following	three	forms:  Let’s	consider,  A	=	aaaba  D	=	aaab… D	=	aaa…. D	=	aax…  Algorithm: The	pattern	matching	table	F W1,	H 	of	a	pattern	A	is	in	memory,	and	the	input	is	an		Z	– character	string	H=	H1	H2	……Hn.	This	algorithm	finds	the	INDEX	of	A	in	H. STEP	1: Set	B ≔ 	1	and	Y1	=	Q0  STEP	2: Repeat	steps	3	to	5	while	Yk		≠	A	and	B	≤	Z.  STEP	3: Read	Hk. STEP	4: Set	Yk+1 ≔ 	F	 Yk	+	Hk . STEP	5: 	Set	B ≔ 	B	+	1. STEP	6: 	If	YK	=	A,	then:  INDEX	=	B	–	LENGTH	 A .  Else:  INDEX	=	0.  STEP	7: 	Exit.   Note:	In	this	the	pattern	matching	complexity	is	equal	to	n	when	compared	to	that	of	first pattern	matching	algorithm.    Arrays	and	Pointers Array	represents	the	linear	data	structure	with	sequential	memory	allocations.  Linear	arrays  It	is	a	list	of	a	finite	number	of	same	kinds	of	data	element:  Elements	are	stored	in	successive	memory	allocation. Elements	are	referenced	by	index.  Traversing	of	linear	arrays  By	this	we	can	carry	out	a	particular	process	over	the	particular	group	of	elements.			 Suppose	we	want	count	particular	kind	of	element	and	then	print	them.	This	can	be	done using	traversing	a	linear	array.  Algorithm:  This	algorithm	traverses	a	linear	array	A	with	the	upper	bound	U	and	lower	bound	L. STEP	1: 	Repeat	for	B ≔ 	L	to	U. Applying	process	to	A[B].  STEP	2: 	Exit.  Inserting	and	Deleting  It	states	the	operation	of	inserting	i.e.	adding	and	deleting	i.e.	removal	of	element. Deleting	and	inserting	an	element	at	the	end	is	not	difficult	or	complex	but	inserting and	deleting	in	middle	can	be	complex	because	of	the	linear	property	of	the	array.  Insertion	pass   Algorithm:  Deletion	from	array	Delete	 A,	M,	K,	Item   STEP	1: 	Set	item	=	A[K]  STEP	2:	 REPEAT	FOR	j	=	K	TO	M-1  STEP	3: SET	A[j]=	A[J+1]  STEP	4: SET	N	=	N-1  STEP	5: EXIT  Matrix	multiplication A,	B,	M,	C,	M,	N,P   STEP	1: REPEAT	STEP	2	TO	4	FOR	i	=	1	to	N  STEP	2: REPEAT	STEP	3	TO	F	FOR	I	=	1	TO	M  STEP	3: SET	C[I][J]=0  STEP	4: REPEAT	FOR	K=1	TO	P  STEP	5: SET	C[i][j]=	C[i][j]+	A[i][K]	*	B[k][j]  STEP	6: EXIT  	  Sorting  Here	sorting	is	to	rearrange	the	elements	in	such	a	manner	so	that	they	are	in	increasing order.	For	example	the	given	numbers	are	8,	4,	5,	7,	and	1.  Therefore	after	sorting	we	get	1,	4,	5,	7,	and	8.  Sorting	has	a	technique	involved	known	as	bubble	sort.   Procedure	for	bubble	sort:  Bubble	sorting  Compares	and	arranges	them	in	desired	order. P	[M-1]	with	P	[M]	and	arrange	them	so	that	P	[M-1]	<	P	[M]. Repeat	above	procedure	with	one	less	comparison.	Possibly	rearrange	P	[M-2]	with P	[M-1]. Now	repeat	the	first	procedure	with	two	fewer	comparisons.	Possibly	rearrange	P [M-3]	and	P	[M-2]. After	step	[M-1]	the	list	will	be	sorted	in	increasing	order.  Searching	in	data	structure  Linear	search Binary	search  Linear	search  Binary	search  It’s	a	sequential	search	which	goes	from	one	end	to	all	the	way	to	the	last	end	till	it doesn’t	end	up	finding	the	data	that	is	needed	or	the	value	is	for	search.  Therefore	the	binary	search	opens	the	directory	in	the	middle	to	determine	which	half   contains	the	name	being	sought	and	that	particular	half	is	also	divided	into	two	to	see which	part	contains	the	value	being	sought.  Multidimensional	Arrays  Binary	search  This	array	has	more	than	one-dimensional	arrays	i.e.	more	than	one	subscript	references the	elements	of	array.  Pointers	Arrays  Modification	of	two	space-efficient	data	structure	can	be	easily	done	for	the	indexing	of the	individual	group.	For	this	particular	process	pointer	array	can	be	used.	We	have	a value	as	array.	A	variable	X	as	a	pointer	and	if	it	points	out	an	element	in	the	value	and	if B	has	the	address	of	an	element	in	value.	Then	the	variable	B	is	called	a	pointer.  Pointer	array    Linked	Lists A	linked	list	is	a	linear	sequenced	collection	of	data	elements	which	s	named	as	nodes	and theses	are	given	a	linear	arrangement	with	the	help	of	pointers.  Linked	list  Traversing	a	linked	list  Traversing	is	done	using	a	pointer.  Algorithm: STEP	1: SET	POINTER ≔ 	START. STEP	2: Repeat	step	3	and	4	while	POINTER≠	NULL.  STEP	3: Apply	PROCESS	to	INFO	[POINTER]. STEP	4: Set	PTR ≔ 	LINK	[POINTER].	  POINTER	POINTS	TO	NEXT	NODE   STEP	5: 	EXIT.  There	two	conditions	while	we	are	searching	a	list.	It	totally	depends	on	the	nature	of	the list	which	would	determine	the	time	taken	for	the	particular	list	location	to	be	known.  Searching	a	linked	list  The	conditions	are.  If	the	list	is	unsorted. If	list	is	sorted.  Algorithm	for	the	list	if	unsorted: STEP	1: 	Set	POINTER ≔ 	START. STEP	2: 	Repeat	Step	3	while	POINTER	≠	NULL.  STEP	3:	 If	ITEM	=	INFO[POINTER],	Then: Set	LOC ≔ 	POINTER,	and	Exit.   Else: Set	POINTER ≔ 	LINK	[POINTER]. STEP	4: Set	LOC ≔ 	NULL. STEP	5: 	EXIT.  Algorithm	for	the	list	if	sorted: STEP	1: 	Set	POINTER ≔ 	START. STEP	2: Repeat	Step	3	while	POINTER	≠	NULL.  STEP	3:	 If	ITEM	<	INFO	[POINTER],	Then: Set	POINTER ≔ 	LINK	[POINTER]. Else	if	ITEM	=	INFO	[POINTER],	Then: Set	LOC ≔ 	POINTER,	and	Exit. Else: Set	LOC ≔ 	NULL,	and	Exit. STEP	4: Set	LOC ≔ 	NULL. STEP	5: EXIT.  Insertion	into	a	linked	list  Three	ways	to	insert	in	the	list:  Inserting	at	the	beginning	of	a	list-  Algorithm:  STEP	1: If	Avail	=	Null,	then:	Write:	NO	SPACE	and	Exit, STEP	2: Set	New ≔ Avail	and	Avail ≔ 	LINK	[Avail]. STEP	3: Set	INFO	[New] ≔ 	DATA. STEP	4: Set	LINK	[New] ≔ 	Start. STEP	5: START ≔ 	New. STEP	6: EXIT.  Inserting	at	the	given	node-  Algorithm:   STEP	1: If	Avail	=	Null,	then:	Write:	NO	SPACE	and	Exit, STEP	2: Set	New ≔ Avail	and	Avail ≔ 	LINK	[Avail]. STEP	3: Set	INFO	[New] ≔ 	DATA. STEP	4: If	LOC	=	NULL,	THEN: Set	LINK	[New] ≔ Start	and	START ≔ 	New. Else:	Set	LINK	[New] ≔ LINK	[LOC]	and	LINK	[LOC] ≔ 	New. STEP	6: EXIT.  Inserted	into	a	sorted	linked	list-  When	item	is	to	be	inserted	into	the	sorted	linked	list,	then	item	has	to	be	inserted	between two	nodes.  INFO X 	<	ITEM	<	INFO Y   Insertion	of	data	into	the	linked	list  Deletion	of	linked	list  Procedure	of	deletion	from	linked	list:  The	next	pointer	fields	of	node	X	now	points	to	node	Y.	therefore	before	X	pointed to	node	M	which	further	pointed	towards	the	node	Y. The	next	pointer	M	now	points	to	the	original	first	node	in	the	free	pool. AVAIL	now	points	to	the	deleted	node	M.  Header	linked	list  Linked	list	containing	a	header	node,	which	is	positioned	at	the	beginning	of	the	list	is	a special	node	is	called	header	linked	list.   Two	header	linked	list	that	are	most	commonly	used	are.  Grounded	header	list:	This	header	contains	the	last	node	with	null	pointer. Circular	header	list:	This	header	contains	the	last	node	which	points	back	to	the header	node.    Stacks	and	Queues Sometime	the	user	want	to	stop	the	freedom	of	insertion	and	deletion	from	any	part	of	the list	to	maintain	linearity	and	regularity	therefore	at	that	moment	or	situation	stacks	and queues	are	needed.	It	follows	LIFO	which	states	last	in	first	out.  Stacks  Stack	is	a	list	which	permits	the	user	to	only	insert	or	delete	the	elements	in	the	list	from one	end,	know	as	top	of	the	stack.  Two	basis	operations	of	stack	are.  Push:	Term	to	insert	element. Pop:	Term	used	for	removal	of	the	element.  Stack  Algorithm	for	PUSH:  STEP	1: If	Top	=	Max,	Print:	NA,	and	Return, STEP	2: Set	Top ≔ 	Top	+	1. STEP	3: Set	STACK	[TOP] ≔ 	ITEM. STEP	4: RETURN.  Algorithm	for	POP:  STEP	1: 	If	Top	=	0,	Print:	NA,	and	Return, STEP	2: Set	ITEM ≔ 	STACK	[TOP] STEP	3: Set	Top ≔ 	Top	-	1. STEP	4: RETURN.  Note:	Term	minimize	flow	states	the	difference	between	underflow	and	overflow.   Recursion  It	is	the	repetition	or	calling	back	of	the	statement	itself.	For	a	statement	to	be	referred			as recursive	statement	it	should	have	following	two	properties:  There	should	be	a	base	limit	or	criteria	set	so	that	it	should	not	call	itself. Every	time	whenever	directly	or	indirectly	the	procedure	calls	itself	it	should	reach near	to	the	base.  If	the	procedure	has	these	two	properties	then	it	is	said	to	be	a	well	defined	recursive procedure.  Note:	Divide-and	–conquer	algorithm	which	is	a	kind	of	binary	search	can	be	said	to	be	a recursive	procedure	because	it	may	be	viewed	as	calling	itself	when	the	smaller	sets	are considered.  Queue  This	follows	FIFO	that	is	first	in	first	out	just	contrast	from	stack.	In	this	insertion	takes only	in	one	end	which	is	known	as	front	and	deletion	takes	place	in	other	end	that	is known	as	rear.  Priority	Queues  Queue  These	are	elements	which	assigned	with	some	priority	and	when	it	comes	to	the	action	of deletion	or	something	else	the	below	rules	are	to	be	followed:  Anything	with	more	priority	has	to	be	processed	before	than	that	with	less	number of	priorities. When	two	of	them	have	same	priority	then	they	are	processed	in	according	to position	they	are	placed	in	the	queue.  Algorithm:   Traverse	the	one	way	list	until	finding	a	node	with	priority	number	exceeding	N. Insert	the	Item	in	front	of	node. If	node	exists	or	was	discovered	then	insert	as	last	element	of	the	list.  Procedure	for	deleting	and	processing	the	first	element	in	a	priority	queue:  Find	the	smallest	value	such	that	FRONT	[VALUE]	≠	NULL. Delete	and	process	the	front	element	in	row	VALUE	of	QUEUE. Exit.    Trees  Tree	is	defined	as	a	set	or	a	collection	of	nodes.	If	the	tree	is	empty	when	there	are no	nodes	available	then	the	tree	is	stated	as	the	null	tree	or	an	empty	tree. Tree	has	a	special	node	represented	by	R,	which	is	the	root	node.	The	left	side	of	the root	node	is	left	successor	sub	tree	and	the	right	one	is	said	to	be	the	right	successor sub	tree.  Terminology  Tree  The	height	of	the	tree	which	is	also	stated	as	the	depth	of	the	tree	is	the	total	number of	nodes	present	in	the	tree. The	height	of	the	root	is	equal	to	the	height	of	the	tree. A	binary	tree	is	said	to	be	a	full	binary	tree	if	the	nodes	present	in	it	is	exactly	zero or	two. A	binary	tree	which	is	filled	from	right	to	left	with	possible	exception	at	the	bottom level	is	known	as	complete	binary	tree.  Use	of	the	binary	tree  It	represents	the	relationship	between	the	data.   It	can	be	used	to	show	a	hierarchical	structure	of	the	data. It	provides	a	very	effective	and	time	saving	searching	of	data.  Traversing	binary	tree  Three	ways	to	traverse	a	binary	tree	are	as	follows.  Pre-order In-order Post-order  Pre-order  In-order  Post-order  Example:  Root	is	processed. Left	sub	tree	is	traversed	with	respect	to	the	root. Right	sub	tree	is	traversed	with	respect	to	the	root.  Left	sub	tree	with	respect	to	root	is	traversed. Root	is	then	processed. Now	traverse	the	right	sub	tree	with	respect	to	the	root	in	in-order.  Traverse	the	left	sub	tree	with	respect	to	the	root	in	post–order. Now	traverse	the	right	sub	tree	with	respect	to	the	root	in	post	order. Root	is	then	processed.  Provided	a	tree	and	four	traversals: Pre-order:	h,	e,	i,	g,	a,	l,	b,	d,	k,	c.	 In-order:	i,	e,	a,	g,	b,	l,	h,	e,	c,	k.	 Post-order:	i,	a,	b,	l,	g,	f,	c,	k,	d,	h.	 Level-order:	h,	e,	d,	h,	g,	k,	a,	l,	c,	b.   Solution:  For	the	above	example  Binary	search	tree  This	particular	data	structure	provides	search	action	as	its	key	character	and	that	to in	an	average	running	time.   It	also	provides	the	user	to	insert	and	delete	or	remove	elements	in	the	data structure. It	is	a	contrast	structure	when	compared	to	the	sorted	linear	array	and	the	linked	list. It	provides	effective	and	sophisticated	searching,	insertion	and	removal	of	data. To	support	the	binary	search	tree	it	is	necessary	that	the	data	available	in	each	node can	be	compared	with	each	other.  Searching	and	insertion	in	binary	search	tree  We	have	to	compare	the	nodes	of	the	tree	with	the	VALUE	we	have. Now	while	comparing	if	we	get	VALUE<	nodes,	then	we	proceed	to	the	left	child of	the	node. But	if	we	find	that	VALUE	>	nodes,	proceed	to	the	right	side	child	of	the	node. We	will	repeat	the	above	the	above	steps	until	we	meet	the	node	that	is	equal	to	the VALUE	i.e.	VALUE	=	node. Or	we	will	meet	an	empty	sub	tree	which	symbolizes	that	we	have	reached	the	end and	the	search	was	unsuccessful.  public	class	BINARYSTREE	 >  Code  {  {  {  {  }  }  private	Node 	root;  private	class	Node   private	VALUE	data;  private	Node 	left,	right;  public	Node VALUE	data   left	=	right	=	null;  this.data	=	data;   ……  }  Insertion	in	binary	tree  It	is	similar	to	the	searching	process.	If	the	VALUE	is	already	in	existence	in	the tree	then	we	don’t	insert	the	VALUE. New	node	will	always	replace	the	null	reference	area	of	node	provided	in	the	tree. For	example	you	can	refer	the	diagram	in	the	next	page.  Deletion	in	binary	search	tree  Insertion  Deletion	is	complex	method	in	binary	search	tree	as	compared	to	that	of	the	insertion method.	Before	we	delete	a	node	from	the	tree	one	has	to	consider	the	following conditions.  Whether	is	it	in	a	tree	or	not. Is	it	a	leaf	or	not. Has	only	one	child	or	not. Or	has	two	children	or	not.   When	a	child	node	is	deleted  When	root	node	is	deleted  When	the	root	node	is	deleted	then	it	checks	the	most	eligible	contender	in	the	tree	such	as h	had	child	node	as	c	and	h.  And	according	to	the	actual	table	only	e	in	the	whole	tree	satisfies	the	position	of	the	root node	since	it	is	greater	than	c	and	less	than	i.  Therefore	the	after	deletion	of	h,	the	position	of	h	I	swapped	by	e.  Note:	Level	order	traversal	is	nothing	but	in	which	the	nodes	are	processed	level	by	level basis.  For	example:  First	the	root	node	→	then	the	child	node	→	last	the	grandchild	nodes.   Level	order	traversal    Graphs	in	Data	Structures  Graph	is	a	collection	of	points	that	represent	nodes	of	a	tree	which	are	interrelated with	edges. Edges	are	nothing	but	a	connection	between	nodes	which	is	represented	by	an	arrow i.e.		“→	“.  Undirected	and	directed	graph  When	the	edges	have	direction	provided	in	the	graph	then	it	is	called	the	directed	graph and	it	is	also	known	as	digraph.  Suppose	a	directed	graph	with	a	directed	edge	x	=	 a,	b   Then	x	is	also	known	as	arc.  Therefore	for	this	terms	that	are	used	are	as	follows:  x	emerges	from	a	and	dissolves	in	b. Now	a	becomes	the	initial	point	i.e.	the	origin	of	x. And	b	becomes	the	end	or	the	destination	point	of	x. Therefore	in	this	case	a	will	be	the	predecessor	of	b	and	b	will	be	the	successor	of	a, so	both	are	adjacent	to	each	other.  For	an	example:  Graph	with	vertex	and	nodes  Now,  G=   Where,	V=	{	X,	Y,	Z,	P,	Q	}  Traversing	of	graph  L=	{	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	}   There	are	three	states	that	are	key	in	the	execution	of	this	process:  Ready	state	which	is	the	first	or	the	initial	state. Waiting	state	where	nodes	are	in	queue	and	are	waiting	to	be	processed. Third	state	is	the	processing	state	where	nodes	are	processed.  There	are	two	methodology	of	search	in	the	graph:  Breadth-first	search Depth-first	search  Breadth	first	search  Depth	first	search  	  Algorithm:  For	BFS:  STEP	1: Submit	all	nodes	to	ready	state.   STEP	2: 	Put	first	node	in	queue	and	the	status	changes	to	waiting	state.  STEP	3: Repeat	4	and	5	until	the	queue	is	empty.  STEP	4: Process	the	first	node	and	change	then	change	the	status	as	processed	and	then remove	it	from	queue.  STEP	5: 	Add	the	rear	node	of	the	processed	node	and	continue	the	process	4	again.  STEP	6: 	EXIT.  For	DFS:  STEP	1: Submit	all	nodes	to	ready	state.  STEP	2: 	Put	first	node	in	queue	and	the	status	changes	to	waiting	state.  STEP	3: 	Repeat	4	and	5	until	the	queue	is	empty.  STEP	4: 	Process	the	first	node	and	change	then	change	the	status	as	processed	and	then remove	it	from	queue.  STEP	5: 	Add	the	rear	node	of	the	processed	node	and	continue	the	process	4	again.  STEP	6: 	EXIT.  Note:	Breadth-first	search	does	the	search	in	such	a	manner	it	would	cover	the	elements	in breadth	wise	first	and	after	completion	to	last	element	in	breadth	manner	it	would	go	deep and	then	again	it	would	do	the	search	in	the	breadth	manner	and	then	go	deep.	Deep-first search	does	the	search	in	such	a	manner	it	would	cover	the	elements	in	depth	wise	first and	after	completion	to	last	element	in	depth	manner	it	would	go	in	breadth.    Sorting  For	example:  Merging  For	example:  Sort	and	search Sorting	and	searching	are	some	key	operations	in	data	structure	with	vast	database.  To	sort	is	to	arrange	the	data	available	in	an	ascending	or	increasing	order.  1	<	2	<	3<	………	<	n.  Complexity	in	sorting	of	data  Comparing	of	data.	For	example:	a	 	a. Switching	of	the	contents. Assigning	of	the	data.	For	example:	b	=	a	and	then	c	=b	or	c=a.  Merging	can	be	defined	as	the	process	in	which	two	data	are	merged	to	get	a	new	data value.  A	is	a	list	which	has	been	sorted	with	x	elements.	B	is	also	a	sorted	list	with	y	elements. Now	to	form	a	list	C	they	merge	element	x	+	y,	this	is	stated	as	merging.  Two	kind	of	sorts	are	been	introduced	in	revised	versions	of	data	structure	sorting methodology.	Which	are	as	follows:  Merge-sort:	In	this	the	values	are	merged	and	then	the	particular	elements	in	the array	are	sorted.  Radix-sort:	It	is	similar	method	that	is	used	by	a	card	sorter.  Merge-sort   Radix-sort   Searching Searching	techniques	other	than	the	sorted	array,	linked	list	and	the	binary	tree	which	we haven’t	seen	in	the	previous	chapters	is	Hashing.  Hashing  It’s	a	technique	in	which	the	number	of	element	is	ignored	to	search	i.e.	there	so need	of	knowing	total	number	of	element	present	in	the	data. To	find	the	address	of	the	data	there	as	to	be	done	some	modification	in	the	memory addresses	i.e.	form	set	of	keys	into	a	set	of	memory	addresses.  Therefore	to	perform	hashing	two	of	the	procedure	has	to	be	carried	out	that	is	the.  Such	function,  H:	KEYS→MEMORY	AD.  Hash	function Collision	resolution.  Hash	function  Hash	function	is	nothing	the	modification	of	the	memory	by	providing	a	hash	address	to the	element	in	the	data.	It	is	represented	y	H k .  To	evaluate	a	hash	function	following	methods	are	been	performed.  Division	method:	In	this	the	key	is	divided	by	the	larger	number s 	than	the	key k  i.e.  Midsquare	method:	In	this	the	key k 	is	squared	i.e.  Folding	method:	In	this	k	is	folded	or	divided	into	number	of	parts	i.e.  H k 	=k mod	s   H k =	k2  H k =ka	+	kb	+……+		kn.  Collision	resolution  The	process	in	which	there	is	a	need	to	add	a	new	record	but	the	memory	H k 	is	already occupied.	This	situation	is	called	collision.  Methods	to	overcome	collision	are	called	collision	resolution.	Methods	are	as	follows:   Linear	probing:	This	particular	methods	it	carry	outs	a	linear	search	for	the	record	till	it finds	an	empty	location.	Drawback	of	this	probing	is	that	it	tends	to	face	a	problem	i.e. clustering.	This	increases	the	search	time	for	record.	Double	hashing	and	quadratic probing	can	lower	down	or	overcome	the	clustering	issue.  Chaining:	In	this	the	record	is	placed	in	the	first	position	of	the	file	and	then	it	adds	the recorder	to	the	location	that	is	empty	pointed	by	the	pointer.    AVL	Search	Trees When	a	binary	tree	is	empty	it	is	considered	as	AVL	tree.	It	is	named	after	Adelson-Velskii and	Landis	therefore,	it	is	known	as	AVL	trees.  Representation	of	an	AVL	search	tree  AVL	is	a	linked	representation	of	the	node	which	has	to	show	its	balance	factor	therefore the	number	enclosed	in	bracket	near	the	node	represents	its	balance	factor.  Insertion	in	an	AVL	search	tree  AVL	tree	representation  First	it	undergoes	LL	rotation	i.e.	insertion	is	done	left	sub	of	left	sub	tree	of	the node. Second	is	RR	rotation. Third	is	LR	rotation	i.e.	right	sub	of	left	sub	tree	of	the	node. Fourth	is	RL	rotation	i.e.	left	sub	of	right	sub	tree	of	the	node.  Deletion	in	an	AVL	search	tree  Deletion	in	AVL	tree	follows	the	similar	procedure	followed	by	the	binary	tree	but	in	this the	imbalance	that	will	occur	due	to	deletion	is	overcome	by	applying	one	or	more rotation.   For	example:  Deletion	in	AVL	tree  When	b	=0	and	the	rotation	is	executed	and	then	the	next	rotation	executes	when	b=1.  Now	when	b=-1	the	rotation	will	take	place	in	the	form	of	R-1.	Therefore	the	procedure	is  LL	and	r0	is	same.	LL	and	r1	are	also	identical	but	the	outputs	are	different	and	LR	and	r- 1	are	identical.    Warshall’s	Algorithm  This	particular	algorithm	used	to	find	the	shortest	path	in	the	graph. This	Algorithm	is	used	to	find	the	Boolean	graded	path	matrix	of	a	given	graph.  Algorithm:  STEP1: 	Initialize	P If	a	[I,j]=0	then:	set	P[I,	j] ≔ 	0; Else:	set	P	[	I,j] ≔ 1.   	END	OF	LOOP   STEP2: REPEAT	3	AND	4	for	X	=	1,	2,…,	m:	[UPDATE	Q]  STEP3: REPEAT	STEP	4	FOR	I	=	1,	2,…,	m:  STEP4: REPEAT	STEP	4	FOR	J	=	1,	2,…,	m:	set	P[I,j]=	P	[I,j] ᵛ   P	[I,	X]	ᶺ	P[X,j] .  [END	ALL	RUNNING	LOOPS]  STEP5: EXIT.  A	Warshall’s	matrix	weighted	graph  Shortest	path	algorithm  Algorithm:  STEP1: Repeat	fir	a,	b	=	1,	2,	…,	M: W	[a,	b]	=	0,	then:	set	[a,	b] ≔ 	infinity; Else:	set	Q	[a,	b]	=	W	[a,	b]  STEP2: 	Repeat	steps	3	and	4	for	X=	1,	2,	…,m:	[UPDATE	Q]   STEP3:		 Repeat	step	4	for	a	=	1,	2,…m. STEP4: 	Repeat	step	4	for	b	=	1,	2,…m. Set	Q	[a,	b]	=	MIN	 Q	[a,	b],	Q	[a,	X]	+	Q	[X,	b]  [END	OF	ALL	THE	RUNNING	LOOP]  STEP5: EXIT.  Diagraph	and	shortest	path  Shortest	path	represents	the	smallest	path	calculated	between	the	nodes. This	algorithm	is	much	more	much	more	efficient	than	calculating	the	power	of	the given	adjacent	matrix. With	the	help	of	described	graph	we	get	know	the	path	matrix	that	will	help	us	to know	the	paths	between	the	nodes	is	shortest	or	not. In	first	the	Warshall’s	algorithm	was	used	to	describe	the	matrix	but	then	was further	modified	and	then	was	used	to	depict	the	shortest	path.
