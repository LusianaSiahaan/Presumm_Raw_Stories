What they’re saying about Head First  Amazon named Head First Java  a Top Ten Editor’s Choice for  Computer Books of 2003    ﬁrst edition   Software Development Magazine named  Head First Java a ﬁnalist for the 14th Annual  Jolt Cola Product Excellence Awards    “Kathy and Bert’s ‘Head First Java’ transforms the printed page into the closest thing to a GUI you’ve  ever seen. In a wry, hip manner, the authors make learning Java an engaging ‘what’re they gonna do  next?’ experience.”      — Warren Keuffel, Software Development Magazine  “...the only way to decide the worth of a tutorial is to decide how well it teaches. Head First Java excels at  teaching. OK, I thought it was silly... then I realized that I was thoroughly learning the topics as I went  through the book.” “The style of Head First Java made learning, well, easier.”    —  slashdot  honestpuck’s review   “Beyond the engaging style that drags you forward from know-nothing into exalted Java warrior status,  Head First Java covers a huge amount of practical matters that other texts leave as the dreaded “exercise  for the reader...”  It’s clever, wry, hip and practical—there aren’t a lot of textbooks that can make that claim  and live up to it while also teaching you about object serialization and network launch protocols.  ”                      IBM Almaden Research Center  and teaches Artiﬁcial Intelligence at Stanford University   — Dr. Dan Russell, Director of User Sciences and Experience Research   “It’s fast, irreverent, fun, and engaging. Be careful—you might actually learn something!”         —  Ken Arnold, former Senior Engineer at Sun Microsystems       Co-author  with James Gosling, creator of Java , “The Java Programming Language”  “Java technology is everywhere—If you develop software and haven’t learned Java, it’s deﬁnitely  time to dive in—Head First.”    —  Scott McNealy, Sun Microsystems Chairman, President and CEO  “Head First Java is like Monty Python meets the gang of four... the text is broken up so well by puzzles  and stories, quizzes and examples, that you cover ground like no computer book before.”     — Douglas Rowe,  Columbia Java Users Group   Praise for Head First Java  “Read Head First Java and you will once again experience fun in learning...For people who like to learn  new programming languages, and do not come from a computer science or programming background,  this book is a gem... This is one book that makes learning a complex computer language fun. I hope  that there are more authors who are willing to break out of the same old mold of ‘traditional’ writing  styles. Learning computer languages should be fun, not onerous.”  — Judith Taylor, Southeast Ohio Macromedia User Group     “If you want to learn Java, look no further: welcome to the ﬁrst GUI-based technical book! This  perfectly-executed, ground-breaking format delivers beneﬁts other Java texts simply can’t...  Prepare yourself for a truly remarkable ride through Java land.”    —  Neil R. Bauman, Captain & CEO, Geek Cruises  www.GeekCruises.com   “If you’re relatively new to programming and you are interested in Java, here’s your book...Covering  everything from objects to creating graphical user interfaces  GUI , exception  error  handling to net- working  sockets  and multithreading, even packaging up your pile of classes into one installation ﬁle,  this book is quite complete...If you like the style...I’m certain you’ll love the book and, like me, hope  that the Head First series will expand to many other subjects!”     — LinuxQuestions.org  “I was ADDICTED to the book’s short stories, annotated code, mock interviews, and brain exercises.”    — Michael Yuan, author, Enterprise J2ME  “ ‘Head First Java’... gives new meaning to their marketing phrase `There’s an O Reilly for that.` I  picked this up because several others I respect had described it in terms like ‘revolutionary’ and a  described a radically different approach to the textbook. They were  are  right... In typical O’Reilly  fashion, they’ve taken a scientiﬁc and well considered approach. The result is funny, irreverent, topical,  interactive, and brilliant...Reading this book is like sitting in the speakers lounge at a view conference,  learning from – and laughing with – peers... If you want to UNDERSTAND Java, go buy this book.”     — Andrew Pollack, www.thenorth.com  “If anyone in the world is familiar with the concept of ‘Head First,’ it would be me. This  book is so good, I’d marry it on TV!” —  Rick Rockwell, Comedian              The original FOX Television “Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire” groom  “This stuff is so fricking good it makes me wanna WEEP! I’m stunned.”    —  Floyd Jones, Senior Technical Writer Poolboy, BEA   “A few days ago I received my copy of Head First Java by Kathy Sierra and Bert Bates. I’m only part way  through the book, but what’s amazed me is that even in my sleep-deprived state that ﬁrst evening, I found  myself thinking, ‘OK, just one more page, then I’ll go to bed.’ “    — Joe Litton   Praise for other Head First books co-authored by Kathy and Bert  Amazon named Head First Servlets  a Top Ten Editor’s Choice for  Computer Books of 2004   ﬁrst edition   Software Development Magazine named  Head First Servlets and Head First Design  Patterns ﬁnalists for the 15th Annual  Product Excellence Awards    “I feel like a thousand pounds of books have just been lifted off of my head.”                       and founder of the Hillside Group  — Ward Cunningham, inventor of the Wiki  “I laughed, I cried, it moved me.”    — Dan Steinberg, Editor-in-Chief, java.net  “My ﬁrst reaction was to roll on the ﬂoor laughing. After I picked myself up, I realized that not only is the  book technically accurate, it is the easiest to understand introduction to design patterns that I have seen.”                      author of more than a dozen books including C++ for Java Programmers  — Dr. Timothy A. Budd, Associate Professor of Computer Science at Oregon State University  “Just the right tone for the geeked-out, casual-cool guru coder in all of us. The right reference for prac- tical development strategies—gets my brain going without having to slog through a bunch of tired  stale professor-speak.”                        Member of the MIT TR100   — Travis Kalanick, Founder of Scour and Red Swoosh  “FINALLY - a Java book written the way I would’a wrote it if I were me. Seriously though - this book absolutely blows away every other software book I’ve ever read...  A good book is very difﬁcult to write... you have to take a lot of time to make things unfold in a  natural, “reader oriented” sequence. It’s a lot of work. Most authors clearly aren’t up to the challenge.

She  developed much of the Head First format while  teaching New Media Authoring for UCLA  Extension’s Entertainment Studies program.  More recently, she’s been a master trainer for Sun  Microsystems, teaching Sun’s Java instructors how  to teach the latest Java technologies, and a lead  developer of several of Sun’s Java programmer  and developer certiﬁ cation exams. Together  with Bert Bates, she has been actively using the  concepts in Head First Java to teach hundreds of  trainers, developers and even non-programmers.  She is also the founder of one of the largest Java  community websites in the world, javaranch.com,  and the Creating Passionate Users blog. Along with this book, Kathy co-authored Head  First Servlets, Head First EJB, and Head First  Design Patterns. In her spare time she enjoys her new Icelandic  horse, skiing, running, and the speed of light. kathy@wickedlysmart.com  Bert is a software developer and architect, but a  decade-long stint in artiﬁ cial intelligence drove  his interest in learning theory and technology- based training. He’s been teaching programming  to clients ever since. Recently, he’s been a  member of the development team for several of  Sun’s Java Certiﬁ cation exams. He spent the ﬁ rst decade of his software career  travelling the world to help broadcast clients like  Radio New Zealand, the Weather Channel, and  the Arts & Entertainment Network  A & E . One  of his all-time favorite projects was building a full  rail system simulation for Union Paciﬁ c Railroad.  Bert is a hopelessly addicted Go player, and has  been working on a Go program for way too long.  He’s a fair guitar player, now trying his hand at  banjo, and likes to spend time skiing, running,  and trying to train  or learn from  his Icelandic  horse Andi. Bert co-authored the same books as Kathy, and is  hard at work on the next batch of books  check  the blog for updates .

From its humble release to the public as the   wimpy  version 1.02,  Java seduced programmers with its friendly syntax, object-oriented  features, memory management, and best of all—the promise of portability.  We’ll take a quick  dip and write some code, compile it, and run it.  We’re talking syntax, loops, branching, and what  makes Java so cool.  Dive in.

In Chapter 1, we put all of our code  in the main   method.  That’s not exactly object-oriented.  So now we’ve got to leave that  procedural world behind and start making some objects of our own.  We’ll look at what  makes object-oriented  OO  development in Java so much fun.  We’ll look at the difference  between a class and an object.  We’ll look at how objects can improve your life.

There’s gotta be more to life than integers, Strings, and arrays. What if you have a PetOwner  object with a Dog instance variable? Or a Car with an Engine? In this chapter we’ll unwrap  the mysteries of Java types and look at what you can declare as a variable, what you can put  in a variable, and what you can do with a variable. And we’ll finally see what life is truly like  on the garbage-collectible heap.  24 size  int  Dog o bject   fido  Dog reference  Declaring a variable  Java cares about type   Primitive types  “I’d like a double with extra foam, please”   Java keywords  Reference variables  remote control to an object   Object declaration and assignment  Objects on the garbage-collectible heap  Arrays  a ﬁ rst look   Exercises and puzzles   4 How Objects Behave  State affects behavior,  behavior affects state.  We know that objects  have state and behavior, represented by instance variables and  methods.  Now we’ll look  at how state and behavior are related.  An object’s behavior uses an object’s unique state.   In other words, methods use instance variable values.  Like, “if dog weight is less than 14  pounds, make yippy sound, else...”  Let’s go change some state!  pass-by-value means  pass-by-copy  copy of x 0 111 0  0  0  0  0 0 0 0 0111  X int  Z int  foo.go x ;  void go int z { }  Methods use object state  bark different   Method arguments and return types  Pass-by-value  the variable is always copied   Getters and Setters  Encapsulation  do it or risk humiliation   Using references in an array  Exercises and puzzles   50 51 53 54 55 57 59 63  73 74 77 79 80 83 88  xi   5 Extra-Strength Methods  Let’s put some muscle in our methods.  You dabbled with variables,  played with a few objects, and wrote a little code.  But you need more tools.  Like  operators.  And loops.  Might be useful to generate random numbers.  And turn  a String into an int, yeah, that would be cool.  And why don’t we learn it all by building  something real, to see what it’s like to write  and test  a program from scratch.  Maybe a  game, like Sink a Dot Com  similar to Battleship .

You don’t have to  reinvent the wheel if you know how to find what you need from the Java library, commonly  known as the Java API.  You’ve got better things to do. If you’re going to write code, you  might as well write only the parts that are custom for your application. The core Java library  is a giant pile of classes just waiting for you to use like building blocks.  “Good to know there’s an ArrayList in  the java.util package. But by myself, how  would I have ﬁ gured that out?”  - Julia, 31, hand model  Analying the bug in the Simple Dot Com Game  ArrayList  taking advantage of  the Java API   Fixing the DotCom class code  Building the real game  Sink a Dot Com   Prepcode for the real game  Code for the real game   boolean expressions  Using the library  Java API   Using packages  import statements, fully-qualiﬁ ed names   Using the HTML API docs and reference books  Exercises and puzzles   xii   96 98 100 102 103 106 111 112 114 117 117 118  126 132 138 140 144 146 151 154 155 158 161   7 Better Living in Objectville  Plan your programs with the future in mind.  What if you could write  code that someone else could extend, easily? What if you could write code that was flexible,  for those pesky last-minute spec changes? When you get on the Polymorphism Plan, you’ll  learn the 5 steps to better class design, the 3 tricks to polymorphism, the 8 ways to make   flexible code, and if you act now—a bonus lesson on the 4 tips for exploiting inheritance flexible code, and if you act now—a bonus lesson on the 4 tips for exploiting inheritance flexible code, and if you act now—a bonus lesson on the 4 tips for exploiting inheritance.

We need to go beyond simple inheritance to flexibility you can get only by  designing and coding to interfaces. What’s an interface? A 100% abstract class. What’s an  abstract class? A class that can’t be instantiated. What’s that good for? Read the chapter...

You’re in charge. You decide when and  how to construct them. You decide when to abandon them.  The Garbage Collector  gc   reclaims the memory.  We’ll look at how objects are created, where they live, and how to  keep or abandon them efficiently. That means we’ll talk about the heap, the stack, scope,  constructors, super constructors, null references, and gc eligibility.  l s   W h e n   s o m e o n e   c a l t h e   g o       m e t h o d ,   t h i s   D u c k   i s   a b a n d o n e d .

The Java API has methods for absolute value, rounding, min max, etc.   But what about formatting? You might want numbers to print exactly two decimal points,  or with commas in all the right places. And you might want to print and manipulate dates,  too. And what about parsing a String into a number? Or turning a number into a String?  We’ll start by learning what it means for a variable or method to be static.  Static variables  are shared by  all instances of  a class.  static variable:  iceCream  kid instance two  kid instance one  instance variables:   one per instance static variables:   one per class  Math class  do you really need an instance of  it?   static methods  static variables  Constants  static ﬁ nal variables   Math methods  random  , round  , abs  , etc.   Wrapper classes  Integer, Boolean, Character, etc.   Autoboxing  Number formatting  Date formatting and manipulation  Static imports  Exercises and puzzles   xiv   236 237 238 239 240 241 243 247 250 256 258 260 266  274 275 277 282 286 287 289 294 301 307 310   11 Risky Behavior  Stuff happens. The file isn’t there. The server is down. No matter how good a  programmer you are, you can’t control everything.  When you write a risky method, you need  code to handle the bad things that might happen.  But how do you know when a method is  risky? Where do you put the code to handle the exceptional situation? In this chapter, we’re  going to build a MIDI Music Player, that uses the risky JavaSound API, so we better find out.  thr o  w s   an exception back  2  1  calls risky method  class Cow {   void moo   {     if  serverDown {       explode  ;      }    } }  class Bar {   void go   {      moo  ;   }    int stuff   {      x.beep  ;   } }  your code your code  class with a  class with a  risky method  Making a music machine  the BeatBox   What if  you need to call risky code?

Even if you believe that for the rest of your  life you’ll write only server-side code, sooner or later you’ll need to write tools, and you’ll  want a graphical interface.  We’ll spend two chapters on GUIs, and learn more language  features including Event Handling and Inner Classes. We’ll put a button on the screen,  we’ll paint on the screen, we’ll display a jpeg image, and we’ll even do some animation.    class MyOuter  {        class MyInner {       void go   {        }     }   }   The outer and inner objects  are now intimately linked.

Unless you actually care where everything goes.  Swing code looks  easy, but then compile it, run it, look at it and think, “hey, that’s not supposed to go there.”   The thing that makes it easy to code is the thing that makes it hard to control—the Layout  Manager.  But with a little work, you can get layout managers to submit to your will.  In  this chapter, we’ll work on our Swing and learn more about widgets.

Objects have state and behavior.  Behavior lives in the class, but state lives within each individual object. If your program  needs to save state, you can do it the hard way, interrogating each object,  painstakingly  writing the value of each instance variable. Or, you can do it the easy OO way—you simply  freeze-dry the object  serialize it  and reconstitute  deserialize  it to get it back.    ?  s  n  t i o  s  e  u  q     y  A n  serialized  deserialized  xvi   Saving object state  Writing a serialized object to a ﬁle  Java input and output streams  connections and chains   Object serialization  Implementing the Serializable interface  Using transient variables  Deserializing an object  Writing to a text ﬁle  java.io.File  Reading from a text ﬁle  Splitting a String into tokens with split    CodeKitchen  Exercises and puzzles   400 401 403 404 408 411 413 414 416 417 418 424  431 432 433 434 437 439 441 447 452 454 458 462 466   15 Make a Connection  Connect with the outside world. It’s easy.  All the low-level networking  details are taken care of by classes in the java.net library.  One of Java’s best features is  that sending and receiving data over a network is really just I O with a slightly different  connection stream at the end of the chain.

You wrote your code. You tested your code. You refined your code.  You told everyone you know that if you never saw a line of code again, that’d be fine. But in  the end, you’ve created a work of art.  The thing actually runs! But now what? In these final  two chapters, we’ll explore how to organize, package, and deploy your Java code. We’ll look  at local, semi-local, and remote deployment options including executable jars, Java Web  Start, RMI, and Servlets. Relax.

Sure, things are easier  when all the parts of your application are in one place, in one heap, with one JVM to rule  them all.  But that’s not always possible.  Or desirable.  What if your application handles  powerful computations? What if your app needs data from a secure database?

[note from marketing: who took out the part about how  this book is for anyone with a valid credit card? And what  about that “Give the Gift of Java” holiday promotion we  discussed...  -Fred]  xxii   intro   We know what you’re thinking. “How can this be a serious Java programming book?” “What’s with all the graphics?” “Can I actually learn it this way?” “Do I smell pizza?”  And we know what your brain is thinking. Your brain craves novelty. It’s always searching, scanning, waiting for  something unusual. It was built that way, and it helps you stay alive.  Today, you’re less likely to be a tiger snack. But your brain’s still  looking. You just never know. So what does your brain do with all the routine, ordinary, normal  things you encounter? Everything it can to stop them from  interfering with the brain’s real job—recording things that matter.  It  doesn’t bother saving the boring things; they never make it past the  “this is obviously not important” ﬁlter. How does your brain know what’s important? Suppose you’re out for  a day hike and a tiger jumps in front of you, what happens inside your  head?  Neurons ﬁre. Emotions crank up. Chemicals surge.  And that’s how your brain knows... This must be important! Don’t forget it! But imagine you’re at home, or in a library. It’s a safe, warm, tiger-free  zone. You’re studying. Getting ready for an exam. Or trying to learn  some tough technical topic your boss thinks will take a week, ten days  at the most. Just one problem. Your brain’s trying to do you a big favor. It’s  trying to make sure that this obviously non-important content  doesn’t clutter up scarce resources. Resources that are better  spent storing the really big things. Like tigers. Like the danger of  ﬁre. Like how you should never again snowboard in shorts. And there’s no simple way to tell your brain, “Hey brain, thank  you very much, but no matter how dull this book is, and how  little I’m registering on the emotional richter scale right now, I  really do want you to keep this stuff around.”  the intro  your brain thinks  THIS is important.  Great. Only   637 more dull, dry,   boring pages.  h i n t r   w o     a i n n ’ t     s  h     k t  y    r u o T H I S v i n a s  b  r   i s g .  you are here4 xxiii   how to use this book  We think of a “Head First Java” reader as a learner.  So what does it take to learn something? First, you have to get it, then make sure  you don’t forget it.  It’s not about pushing facts into your head. Based on the  latest research in cognitive science, neurobiology, and educational psychology,  learning takes a lot more than text on a page. We know what turns your brain on. needs to call a  method on the  server  Some of  the Head First learning principles: Make it visual. Images are far more memorable than words  alone, and make learning much more effective  Up to 89%  improvement in recall and transfer studies . It also makes  things more understandable.  Put the words within  or near the graphics they relate to, rather than on the  bottom or on another page, and learners will be up to twice  as likely to solve problems related to the content.   Use a conversational and personalized style. In recent studies,   return value  doCalc      r e m o t e    R M I s e r v i c e  It really sucks to be an  abstract method.  You  don’t have a body.  students per formed up to 40% better on post-learning tests if the content spoke  directly to the reader, using a first-person, conversational style rather than  taking a formal tone. Tell stories instead of lecturing. Use casual language. Don’t  take yourself too seriously. Which would you pay more attention to: a stimulating  dinner party companion, or a lecture? Get the lear ner to think more deeply. In other words, unless  you actively flex your neurons, nothing much happens in your head.   A reader has to be motivated, engaged, curious, and inspired to  solve problems, draw conclusions, and generate new knowledge.  And for that, you need challenges, exercises, and thought- provoking questions, and activities that involve both sides  of the brain, and multiple senses.  Does it make sense to  say Tub IS-A Bathroom?  Bathroom IS-A Tub? Or is  it a HAS-A relationship?   abstract void roam  ;  N  E  n.  y !      d o d   b olo o Get—and keep—the reader’s attention.  We’ve all  m ic h t e h   a  se o   m d  it   w it had the “I really want to learn this but I can’t stay awake past  n page one” experience.  Your brain pays attention to things that are out  of the ordinary, interesting, strange, eye-catching, unexpected.   Learning a new,  tough, technical topic doesn’t have to be boring. Your brain will learn much more quickly if it’s not. Touch their emotions. We now know that your ability to remember something is largely  dependent on its emotional content.  You remember what you care about.  You remember when  you feel something. No we’re not talking heart-wrenching stories about a boy and his dog.     We’re talking emotions like surprise, curiosity, fun, “what the...?” , and the feeling of   “I Rule!”  that comes when you solve a puzzle, learn something everybody else thinks is hard, or realize  you know something that “I’m more technical than thou” Bob from engineering doesn’t.   xxiv   intro   Metacognition: thinking about thinking.  If you really want to learn, and you want to learn more quickly and more deeply,  pay attention to how you pay attention. Think about how you think. Learn how  you learn. Most of us did not take courses on metacognition or learning theory when we were  growing up. We were expected to learn, but rarely taught to learn. But we assume that if you’re holding this book, you want to learn Java. And you  probably don’t want to spend a lot of time. To get the most from this book, or any book or learning experience, take  responsibility for your brain. Your brain on that content.  The trick is to get your brain to see the new material you’re learning  as Really Important. Crucial to your well-being. As important as  a tiger. Otherwise, you’re in for a constant battle, with your brain  doing its best to keep the new content from sticking.  So just how DO you get your brain to treat Java like it  was a hungry tiger? There’s the slow, tedious way, or the faster, more effective way. The  slow way is about sheer repetition. You obviously know that you are  able to learn and remember even the dullest of topics, if you keep pounding  on the same thing. With enough repetition, your brain says, “This doesn’t feel  important to him, but he keeps looking at the same thing over and over and over, so  I suppose it must be.” The faster way is to do anything that increases brain activity, especially different types  of brain activity. The things on the previous page are a big part of the solution,  and they’re all things that have been proven to help your brain work in your favor.  For example, studies show that putting words within the pictures they describe  as  opposed to somewhere else in the page, like a caption or in the body text  causes  your brain to try to makes sense of how the words and picture relate, and this  causes more neurons to ﬁre. More neurons ﬁring = more chances for your brain  to get that this is something worth paying attention to, and possibly recording. A conversational style helps because people tend to pay more attention when they  perceive that they’re in a conversation, since they’re expected to follow along and  hold up their end. The amazing thing is, your brain doesn’t necessarily care that  the “conversation” is between you and a book! On the other hand, if the writing  style is formal and dry, your brain perceives it the same way you experience being  lectured to while sitting in a roomful of passive attendees. No need to stay awake. But pictures and conversational style are just the beginning.  the intro  I wonder how I  can trick my brain  into remembering   this stuff...  you are here4 xxv   how to use this book  Here’s what WE did:  We used pictures, because your brain is tuned for visuals, not text. As far as your  brain’s concerned, a picture really is worth 1024 words. And when text and pictures  work together, we embedded the text in the pictures because your brain works  more effectively when the text is within the thing the text refers to, as opposed to in  a caption or buried in the text somewhere. We used repetition, saying the same thing in different ways and with different media  types, and multiple senses, to increase the chance that the content gets coded coded  into more than one area of your brain.  We used concepts and pictures in unexpected ways because your brain is tuned for  novelty, and we used pictures and ideas with at least some emotional content, because  your brain is tuned to pay attention to the biochemistry of emotions. That which  causes you to feel something is more likely to be remembered, even if that feeling is  nothing more than a little humor, surprise, or interest. We used a personalized, conversational style, because your brain is tuned to pay more  attention when it believes you’re in a conversation than if it thinks you’re passively  listening to a presentation. Your brain does this even when you’re reading. We included more than 50 exercises , because your brain is tuned to learn and  remember more when you do things than when you read about things. And we  made the exercises challenging-yet-do-able, because that’s what most people prefer. We used multiple learning styles, because you might prefer step-by-step procedures,  while someone else wants to understand the big picture ﬁrst, while someone else  just wants to see a code example. But regardless of your own learning preference,  everyone beneﬁts from seeing the same content represented in multiple ways. We include content for both sides of your brain, because the more of your brain you  engage, the more likely you are to learn and remember, and the longer you can  stay focused. Since working one side of the brain often means giving the other side  a chance to rest, you can be more productive at learning for a longer period of  time.  And we included stories and exercises that present more than one point of view,  because your brain is tuned to learn more deeply when it’s forced to make  evaluations and judgements.  We included challenges, with exercises, and by asking questions that don’t always have  a straight answer, because your brain is tuned to learn and remember when it has  to work at something  just as you can’t get your body in shape by watching people  at the gym . But we did our best to make sure that when you’re working hard, it’s  on the right things. That you’re not spending one extra dendrite processing a hard-to- understand example, or parsing difﬁcult, jargon-laden, or extremely terse text. We used an 80 20 approach. We assume that if you’re going for a PhD in Java,  this won’t be your only book. So we don’t talk about everything. Just the stuff you’ll  actually use.  xxvi   intro  24 size  int Dog o bject   fido  Dog Dog  BE the compiler  T h i s i s P u z z l eV i  l e  l   BULLET POINTS  Java  Exposed  B r a i n   B a r b e l l brainbarbell   Here’s what YOU can do to bend your  brain into submission. So, we did our part. The rest is up to you. These tips are a  starting point; Listen to your brain and ﬁgure out what works  for you and what doesn’t. Try new things.  the intro  cut this out and stick it  on your refridgerator. ✄  1 Slow down. The more you understand,   6 Drink water. Lots of it.  the less you have to memorize. Don’t just read. Stop and think. When the  book asks you a question, don’t just skip to  the answer. Imagine that someone really is  asking the question. The more deeply you  force your brain to think, the better chance  you have of learning and remembering.  2 Do the exercises. Write your own notes. We put them in, but if we did them for you,  that would be like having someone else  do your workouts for you. And don’t just  look at the exercises. Use a pencil. There’s  plenty of evidence that physical activity  while learning can increase the learning.   3 Read the “There are No Dumb Questions”  That means all of them. They’re not  optional side-bars—they’re part of the core  content! Sometimes the questions are more  useful than the answers.   Your brain works best in a nice bath of ﬂuid.  Dehydration  which can happen before you  ever feel thirsty  decreases cognitive function.  7 Talk about it. Out loud.  Speaking activates a different part of  the brain. If you’re trying to understand  something, or increase your chance of  remembering it later, say it out loud. Better  still, try to explain it out loud to someone  else. You’ll learn more quickly, and you might  uncover ideas you hadn’t known were there  when you were reading about it.  8 Listen to your brain.  Pay attention to whether your brain is getting  overloaded. If you ﬁnd yourself starting to skim  the surface or forget what you just read, it’s  time for a break. Once you go past a certain  point, you won’t learn faster by trying to shove  more in, and you might even hurt the process.  4 Don’t do all your reading in one place. Stand-up, stretch, move around, change  chairs, change rooms. It’ll help your brain  feel something, and keeps your learning from  being too connected to a particular place.   9 Feel something!  Your brain needs to know that this matters. Get  involved with the stories. Make up your own  captions for the photos. Groaning over a bad  joke is still better than feeling nothing at all.  5 Make this the last thing you read before   bed. Or at least the last challenging thing. Part of the learning  especially the transfer  to long-term memory  happens after you put  the book down. Your brain needs time on  its own, to do more processing. If you put in  something new during that processing-time,  some of what you just learned will be lost.   10 Type and run the code.  Type and run the code examples. Then you  can experiment with changing and improving  the code  or breaking it, which is sometimes  the best way to ﬁgure out what’s really  happening . For long examples or Ready-bake  code, you can download the source ﬁles from  headﬁrstjava.com  you are here4 xxvii   how to use this book  What you need for this book:  You do not need any other development tool, such as an Integrated  Development Environment  IDE . We strongly recommend that you not  use anything but a basic text editor until you complete this book  and  especially not until after chapter 16 . An IDE can protect you from some of  the details that really matter, so you’re much better off learning from the  command-line and then, once you really understand what’s happening,  move to a tool that automates some of the process.  ß    SETTING UP JAVA If you don’t already have a 1.5 or greater Java 2 Standard Edition SDK  Software  Development Kit , you need it. If you’re on Linux, Windows, or Solaris, you can get it for free  from java.sun.com  Sun’s website for Java developers . It usually takes no more than two clicks  from the main page to get to the J2SE downloads page. Get the latest non-beta version posted.  The SDK includes everything you need to compile and run Java.  If you’re running Mac OS X 10.4, the Java SDK is already installed. It’s part of OS X, and you  don’t have to do anything else. If you’re on an earlier version of OS X, you have an earlier  version of Java that will work for 95% of the code in this book.  Note: This book is based on Java 1.5, but for stunningly unclear marketing reasons, shortly  before release, Sun renamed it Java 5, while still keeping “1.5” as the version number for the  developer’s kit. So, if you see Java 1.5 or Java 5 or Java 5.0, or "Tiger"  version 5’s original  code-name , they all mean the same thing. There was never a Java 3.0 or 4.0—it jumped from  version 1.4 to 5.0, but you will still find places where it’s called 1.5 instead of 5. Don't ask.   Oh, and just to make it more entertaining, Java 5 and the Mac OS X 10.4 were both given the  same code-name of “Tiger”, and since OS X 10.4 is the version of the Mac OS you need to run  Java 5, you’ll hear people talk about “Tiger on Tiger”.  It just means Java 5 on OS X 10.4 .  ß  The SDK does not include the API documentation, and you need that! Go back to java.sun. com and get the J2SE API documentation. You can also access the API docs online, without  downloading them, but that’s a pain. Trust us, it’s worth the download.  ß  You need a text editor. Virtually any text editor will do  vi, emacs, pico , including the GUI ones  that come with most operating systems. Notepad, Wordpad, TextEdit, etc. all work, as long as  you make sure they don’t append a “.txt” on to the end of your source code.   ß  Once you’ve downloaded and unpacked zipped whatever  depends on which version and for  which OS , you need to add an entry to your PATH environment variable that points to the  bin  directory inside the main Java directory. For example, if the J2SDK puts a directory on your  drive called “j2sdk1.5.0”, look inside that directory and you’ll find the “bin” directory where the  Java binaries  the tools  live. Tha bin directory is the one you need a PATH to, so that when you  type:   % javac  at the command-line, your terminal will know how to find the javac compiler.  Note: if you have trouble with you installation, we recommend you go to javaranch.com, and join  the Java-Beginning forum! Actually, you should do that whether you have trouble or not.  Note: much of the code from this book is available at wickedlysmart.com  xxviii   intro   Last-minute things you need to know: This is a learning experience, not a reference book. We deliberately  stripped out everything that might get in the way of learning whatever it  is we’re working on at that point in the book. And the ﬁ rst time through,  you need to begin at the beginning, because the book makes assumptions  about what you’ve already seen and learned.  We use simple UML-like diagrams.  If we’d used pure UML, you’d be seeing something that looks like Java, but  with syntax that’s just plain wrong. So we use a simpliﬁ ed version of UML  that doesn’t conﬂ ict with Java syntax. If you don’t already know UML, you  won’t have to worry about learning Java and UML at the same time.  We don’t worry about organizing and packaging your own  code until the end of the book. In this book, you can get on with the business of learning Java, without  stressing over some of the organizational or administrative details of  developing Java programs. You will, in the real world, need to know—and  use—these details, so we cover them in depth. But we save them for the end  of the book  chapter 17 . Relax while you ease into Java, gently.  The end-of-chapter exercises are mandatory; puzzles are  optional. Answers for both are at the end of each chapter. One thing you need to know about the puzzles—they’re puzzles. As in logic  puzzles, brain teasers, crossword puzzles, etc. The exercises are here to help  you practice what you’ve learned, and you should do them all. The puzzles  are a different story, and some of them are quite challenging in a puzzle  way. These puzzles are meant for puzzlers, and you probably already know if  you are one. If you’re not sure, we suggest you give some of them a try, but  whatever happens, don’t be discouraged if you can’t solve a puzzle or if you  simply can’t be bothered to take the time to work them out.   The ‘Sharpen Your Pencil’ exercises don’t have answers. Not printed in the book, anyway. For some of them, there is no right  answer, and for the others, part of the learning experience for the Sharpen  activities is for you to decide if and when your answers are right.  Some of  our suggested answers are available on wickedlysmart.com   The code examples are as lean as possible It’s frustrating to wade through 200 lines of code looking for the two lines  you need to understand. Most examples in this book are shown within the  smallest possible context, so that the part you’re trying to learn is clear and  simple. So don’t expect the code to be robust, or even complete. That’s  your assignment for after you ﬁ nish the book.

We’ll dive right in and   write some code, then compile and  run it. We’re talking syntax, looping  and branching, and a look at what  makes Java so cool. You’ll be   coding in no time.  Java takes you to new places. From its humble release to the public as the    wimpy  version 1.02, Java seduced programmers with its friendly syntax, object-oriented features,  memory management, and best of all —the promise of portability. The lure of write-once run- anywhere is just too strong.  A devoted following exploded, as programmers fought against bugs,   limitations, and, oh yeah, the fact that it was dog slow. But that was ages ago.  If you’re just starting in  Java, you’re lucky. Some of us had to walk ﬁ ve miles in the snow, uphill both ways  barefoot , to  get even the most trivial applet to work.   But you, why, you get to ride the sleeker, faster, much  more powerful Java of today.    this is a new chapter  1   the way Java works  The Way Java Works  The goal is to write one application  in this  example, an interactive party invitation  and have  it work on whatever device your friends have.  source code for   the interactive   party invitation.

And why is it Java 5.0 but not Java 2.0?  Q: I see Java 2 and Java 5.0, but was there a Java 3   A: The joys of marketing... when the version of Java   shifted from 1.1 to 1.2, the changes to Java were so  dramatic that the marketers decided we needed a whole  new “name”, so they started calling it Java 2, even though  the actual version of Java was 1.2.  But versions 1.3 and 1.4  were still considered Java 2.  There never was a Java 3 or  4. Beginning with Java version 1.5, the marketers decided   once again that the changes were so dramatic that a  new name was needed  and most developers agreed , so  they looked at the options. The next number in the name  sequence would be “3”, but calling Java 1.5 Java 3 seemed  more confusing, so they decided to name it Java 5.0 to  match the “5” in version “1.5”.    So, the original Java was versions 1.02  the first official  release  through 1.1 were just “Java”.  Versions 1.2, 1.3, and  1.4 were “Java 2”. And beginning with version 1.5, Java is  called “Java 5.0”. But you’ll also see it called “Java 5”  without  the “.0”  and “Tiger”  its original code-name . We have no  idea what will happen with the next release...  you are here4  5   why Java is cool  Sharpen your pencil  answers  Look how easy it  is to write Java.  Don’t worry about whether you understand any of this yet!  Everything here is explained in great detail in the book, most  within the ﬁrst 40 pages .

We’ll get there...  int size = 27; String name = “Fido”; Dog myDog = new Dog name, size ; x = size - 5; if  x < 15  myDog.bark 8 ;   declare an integer variable named ‘size’ and give it the value 27 declare a string of characters variable named ‘name’ and give it the value “Fido” declare a new Dog variable ‘myDog’ and make the new Dog using ‘name’ and ‘size’ subtract 5 from 27  value of ‘size’  and assign it to a variable named ‘x’ if x  value of 22  is less than 15, tell the dog to bark 8 times  while  x > 3  {    myDog.play  ; }  int[] numList = {2,4,6,8}; System.out.print “Hello” ; System.out.print “Dog: “ + name ; String num = “8”; int z = Integer.parseInt num ;  keep looping as long as x is greater than 3... tell the dog to play  whatever THAT means to a dog...  this looks like the end of the loop -- everything in { } is done in the loop  declare a list of integers variable ‘numList’, and put 2,4,6,8 into the list. print out “Hello”... probably at the command-line print out “Hello Fido”  the value of ‘name’ is “Fido”  at the command-line declare a character string variable ‘num’ and give it the value of “8” convert the string of characters “8” into an actual numeric value 8  try {    readTheFile “myFile.txt” ; }  catch FileNotFoundException ex  {    System.out.print “File not found.” ; }  try to do something...maybe the thing we’re trying isn’t guaranteed to work... read a text file named “myFile.txt”  or at least TRY to read the file...  must be the end of the “things to try”, so I guess you could try many things... this must be where you find out if the thing you tried didn’t work... if the thing we tried failed, print “File not found” out at the command-line looks like everything in the { } is what to do if the ‘try’ didn’t work...  6   chapter 1   Code structure in Java  dive In A Quick Dip  Put a class in a source ﬁ le.  Put methods in a class.  Put statements in a method.  What goes in a  source file? A   source code ﬁ le  with the .java  extension  holds one class deﬁ ni- tion. The class represents a piece  of your program, although a very  tiny application might need just  a single class. The class must go  within a pair of curly braces.  public class Dog {  }  class  What goes in a  class? A class has one or more methods.  In the Dog class, the bark method  will hold instructions for how the  Dog should bark. Your methods  must be declared inside a class   in other words, within the curly  braces of the class .  public class Dog {     void bark   {      }   }  method  What goes in a  method? Within the curly braces of a  method, write your instructions  for how that method should be  performed. Method code is basi- cally a set of statements, and for  now you can think of a method  kind of like a function or proce- dure.  public class Dog {     void bark   {       statement1;      statement2;     }   }  statements  you are here4  7   a Java class  Anatomy of a class When the JVM starts running, it looks for the class you give it at the com- mand line. Then it starts looking for a specially-written method that looks  exactly like:    public static void main  String[] args  {           your code goes here       } Next, the JVM runs everything between the curly braces {  } of your main  method. Every Java application has to have at least one class, and at least  one main method  not one main per class; just one main per application .   public so everyone  can access it  this is a class  duh   the name of  this class  opening curly brace  of the class  public class MyFirstApp {   we’ll cover this   one later.   the return type.  void means there’s  no return value.  the name of  this method  arguments to the method.

Don’t worry about memorizing anything right now...  this chapter is just to get you started.  8   chapter 1   dive In A Quick Dip  Writing a class with a main In Java, everything goes in a class. You’ll type your source code ﬁ le  with a  .java extension , then compile it into a new class ﬁ le  with a .class extension .        When you run your program, you’re really running a class.  Running a program means telling the Java Virtual Machine  JVM  to “Load the  Hello class, then start executing its main   method. Keep running ‘til all the  code in main is ﬁ nished.” In chapter 2, we go  deeper into the whole class thing, but for now, all you need to  think is, how do I write Java code so that it will run?  And it all begins with main  . The main   method is where your program starts running. No matter how big your program is  in other words, no matter how many classes  your program uses , there’s got to be a main   method to get the ball rolling.  public class MyFirstApp {     public static void main  String[] args  {      System.out.println “I Rule!” ;      System.out.println “The World” ;    }  public class MyFirstApp {      public static void main   String[] args  {       System.out.print “I Rule!” ;     }  }  MyFirstApp.java  }  o m p il  c  r  e  Method Party     0 aload_0   1  invokespecial 1 <Method  java.lang.Object  >     4 return  Method void  main java.lang.String[]      0 getstatic 2 <Field   MyFirstApp.class MyFirstApp.class    Save    1 MyFirstApp.java    Compile  2 javac MyFirstApp.java  3   Run  File  Edit   Window  Help  Scream %java MyFirstApp I Rule!

You can say all the normal things that you say  in most programming languages to make the computer  do something.  Your code can tell the JVM to:  1 do something  Statements: declarations, assignments,  method calls, etc.  int x = 3; String name = “Dirk”; x = x * 17; System.out.print “x  is ” + x ; double d = Math.random  ;    this is a comment  2 do something again and again  Loops: for and while  while  x  > 12  {     x = x -1; }  for  int x = 0; x < 10; x = x + 1  {    System.out.print “x is now ” + x ; }  3 do something under this condition  Branching: if else tests  if  x == 10  {    System.out.print “x must be 10” ; } else {    System.out.print “x isn’t 10” ; } if   x < 3  &  name.equals “Dirk”    {    System.out.println “Gently” ; } System.out.print “this line runs no matter what” ;  10   chapter 1  Syntax   Fun  ± Each statement must end in a  semicolon. x = x + 1; ± A single-line comment begins   with two forward slashes.  x = 22;    this line disturbs me ± Most white space doesn’t matter.  x      =      3  ;  ± Variables are declared with a   name and a type  you’ll learn about  all the  Java types in chapter 3 .  int weight;   type: int, name: weight ± Classes and methods must be   defined within a pair of curly braces. public void go   {       amazing code here }   dive In A Quick Dip  while  moreBalls == true   {    keepJuggling  ; }  Looping and looping and... Java has three standard looping  constructs: while,  do-while, and for. You’ll get the full     loop scoop later  in the book, but not for awhile, so let’s do while for  now. The syntax  not to mention logic  is so simple  you’re probably asleep already. As long as some  condition is true, you do everything inside the  loop block. The loop block is bounded by a pair of  curly braces, so whatever you want to repeat needs  to be inside that block. The key to a loop is the conditional test. In Java, a  conditional test is an expression that results in a  boolean value —in other words, something that is  either true or false. If you say something like, “While iceCreamInTheTub  is true, keep scooping”, you have a clear boolean  test. There either is ice cream in the tub or there  isn’t.  But if you were to say, “While Bob keep  scooping”, you don’t have a real test. To make  that work, you’d have to change it to something  like, “While Bob is snoring...” or “While Bob is not  wearing plaid...”  Simple boolean tests You can do a simple boolean test by checking  the value of a variable, using a comparison operator  including:   <   less than   >   greater than  ==   equality   yes, that’s two equals signs  Notice the difference between the assignment  operator  a single equals sign  and the equals  operator  two equals signs . Lots of programmers  accidentally type = when they want ==.  But not  you.   int x = 4;    assign 4 to x  while  x > 3  {      loop code will run because      x is greater than 3   x = x - 1;    or we’d loop forever }  int z = 27;     while  z == 17  {      loop code will not run because      z is not equal to 17 }  you are here4  11   Java basics  there are no Dumb Questions Q: Why does everything have   to be in a class?  A: Java is an object-oriented    OO  language. It’s not like the  old days when you had steam- driven compilers and wrote one  monolithic source file with a pile  of procedures. In chapter 2 you’ll  learn that a class is a blueprint for  an object, and that nearly every- thing in Java is an object.  every class I write?  Q: Do I have to put a main in  A: Nope. A Java program   might use dozens of classes  even  hundreds , but you might only  have one with a main method— the one that starts the program  running. You might write test  classes, though, that have main  methods for testing your other  classes.  Q: In my other language I can   do a boolean test on an integer.  In Java, can I say something like: int x = 1; while  x { }    A: No. A boolean and an   integer are not compatible types in  Java. Since the result of a condi- tional test must be a boolean, the  only variable you can directly test   without using a comparison op- erator  is a boolean. For example,  you can say: boolean isHot = true; while isHot  { }  Example of a while loop public class Loopy {    public static void main  String[] args  {      int x = 1;      System.out.println “Before the Loop” ;      while  x < 4  {        System.out.println “In the loop” ;        System.out.println “Value of x is ” + x ;          x = x + 1;      }      System.out.println “This is after the loop” ;    }  this is the output  }  % java Loopy Before the Loop In the loop Value of x is 1 In the loop Value of x is 2 In the loop Value of x is 3 This is after the loop   BULLET POINTS  ß  Statements end in a semicolon ; ß  Code blocks are defined by a pair of curly braces { } ß  Declare an int variable with a name and a type:   int x; ß  The assignment operator is one equals sign = ß  The equals operator uses two equals signs == ß  A while loop runs everything within its block  defined by curly   braces  as long as the conditional test is true.  ß   If the conditional test is false, the while loop code block won’t  run, and execution will move down to the code immediately  after the loop block.  ß  Put a boolean test inside parentheses:                                            while  x == 4  { }  12   chapter 1   Conditional branching In Java, an if test is basically the same as the boolean test in a  while loop – except instead of saying, “while there’s still beer...”,  you’ll say, “if there’s still beer...”   class IfTest {   public static void main  String[] args  {     int x = 3;     if  x == 3  {       System.out.println “x must be 3” ;     }     System.out.println “This runs no matter what” ;   } }  % java IfTest x must be 3 This runs no matter what  code output  The code above executes the line that prints “x must be 3” only  if the condition  x is equal to 3  is true. Regardless of whether  it’s true, though, the line that prints, “This runs no matter what”  will run. So depending on the value of x, either one statement  or two will print out. But we can add an else to the condition, so that we can  say something like, “If there’s still beer, keep coding, else   otherwise  get more beer, and then continue on...”  class IfTest2 {   public static void  main  String[] args  {     int x = 2;     if  x == 3  {       System.out.println “x must be 3” ;     } else {        System.out.println “x is NOT 3” ;     }     System.out.println “This runs no matter what” ;   } }  new output  % java IfTest2 x is NOT 3 This runs no matter what  dive In A Quick Dip  System.out.print  vs.  System.out.println  If you’ve been paying attention  of  course you have  then you’ve noticed us  switching between print and println.

In a nutshell, the program makes three lists of words, then randomly picks one word  from each of the three lists, and prints out the result. Don’t worry if you don’t under- stand exactly what’s happening in each line. For gosh sakes, you’ve got the whole book  ahead of you, so relax. This is just a quick look from a 30,000 foot outside-the-box  targeted leveraged paradigm.  1. The ﬁrst step is to create three  String arrays – the containers that will hold all the   words. Declaring and creating an array is easy;  here’s a small one: String[] pets = {“Fido”, “Zeus”, “Bin”}; Each word is in quotes  as all good Strings must be  and separated by commas.  2. For each of the three lists  arrays , the goal is to pick a random word, so we have   to know how many words are in each list. If there are 14 words in a list, then we need  a random number between 0 and 13  Java arrays are zero-based, so the ﬁrst word is at  position 0, the second word position 1, and the last word is position 13 in a 14-element  array . Quite handily, a Java array is more than happy to tell you its length. You just  have to ask. In the pets array, we’d say: int x = pets.length;  and x would now hold the value 3.  3. We need three random numbers. Java ships out-of-the-box, off-the-shelf, shrink-  wrapped, and core competent with a set of math methods  for now, think of them as  functions . The random   method returns a random number between 0 and not- quite-1, so we have to multiply it by the number of elements  the array length  in the  list we’re using. We have to force the result to be an integer  no decimals allowed!  so  we put in a cast  you’ll get the details in chapter 4 . It’s the same as if we had any ﬂoat- ing point number that we wanted to convert to an integer: int x =  int  24.6;   4. Now we get to build the phrase, by picking a word from each of the three lists,   and smooshing them together  also inserting spaces between words . We use the “+”  operator, which concatenates  we prefer the more technical ‘smooshes’  the String objects  together. To get an element from an array, you give the array the index  number  posi- tion  of the thing you want using: String s = pets[0];    s is now the String “Fido” s = s + “ “ + “is a dog”;    s is now “Fido is a dog”  5.Finally, we print the phrase to the command-line and... voila!

HELLO. I am Java.  I’m the guy who actually makes a program  run. The compiler just gives you a ﬁle. That’s  it. Just a ﬁle. You can print it out and use it  for wall paper, kindling, lining the bird cage  whatever, but the ﬁle doesn’t do anything un- less I’m there to run it.  And that’s another thing, the compiler has  no sense of humor. Then again, if you had to  spend all day checking nit-picky little syntax  violations...  I’m not saying you’re, like, completely useless.  But really, what is it that you do? Seriously. I  have no idea. A programmer could just write  bytecode by hand, and I’d take it. You might  be out of a job soon, buddy.  I don’t appreciate that tone.  Excuse me, but without me, what exactly  would you run? There’s a reason Java was  designed to use a bytecode compiler, for your  information. If Java were a purely interpreted  language, where—at runtime—the virtual  machine had to translate straight-from-a-text- editor source code, a Java program would  run at a ludicrously glacial pace. Java’s had a  challenging enough time convincing people  that it’s ﬁnally fast and powerful enough for  most jobs.  Excuse me, but that’s quite an ignorant  not  to mention arrogant  perspective. While it  is true that—theoretically—you can run any  properly formatted bytecode even if it didn’t  come out of a Java compiler, in practice that’s  absurd. A programmer writing bytecode by  hand is like doing your word processing by  writing raw postscript. And I would appreciate  it if you would not refer to me as “buddy.”   I rest my case on the humor thing.  But you  still didn’t answer my question, what do you  actually do?  18   chapter 1   The Java Virtual Machine  But some still get through! I can throw Class- CastExceptions and sometimes I get people  trying to put the wrong type of thing in an  array that was declared to hold something  else, and—  OK. Sure. But what about security? Look at all  the security stuff I do, and you’re like, what,  checking for semicolons? Oooohhh big security  risk! Thank goodness for you!  Whatever. I have to do that same stuff too,  though,  just to make sure nobody snuck in  after you and changed the bytecode before  running it.  Oh, you can count on it.  Buddy.   dive In A Quick Dip  The Compiler Remember that Java is a strongly-typed lan- guage, and that means I can’t allow variables  to hold data of the wrong type. This is a  crucial safety feature, and I’m able to stop the  vast majority of violations before they ever get  to you. And I also—  Excuse me, but I wasn’t done. And yes, there  are some datatype exceptions that can emerge  at runtime, but some of those have to be  allowed to support one of Java’s other impor- tant features—dynamic binding. At runtime,  a Java program can include new objects that  weren’t even known to the original program- mer, so I have to allow a certain amount of  ﬂexibility. But my job is to stop anything that  would never—could never—succeed at run- time. Usually I can tell when something won’t  work, for example, if a programmer acciden- tally tried to use a Button object as a Socket  connection, I would detect that and thus  protect him from causing harm at runtime.   Excuse me, but I am the ﬁrst line of defense,  as they say. The datatype violations I previous- ly described could wreak havoc in a program  if they were allowed to manifest. I am also  the one who prevents access violations, such  as code trying to invoke a private method, or  change a method that – for security reasons  – must never be changed. I stop people from  touching code they’re not meant to see,  including code trying to access another class’  critical data. It would take hours, perhaps days  even, to describe the signiﬁcance of my work.  Of course, but as I indicated previously, if I  didn’t prevent what amounts to perhaps 99%  of the potential problems, you would grind to  a halt.

We’re  leaving this dusty ol’  procedural town for good.     I’ll send you a postcard.  I was told there would be objects.  In chapter 1, we put all of our code in the   main   method.  That’s not exactly object-oriented. In fact, that’s not object-oriented at all.  Well,   we did use a few objects, like the String arrays for the Phrase-O-Matic, but we didn’t actually   develop any of our own object types.  So now we’ve got to leave that procedural world behind,   get the heck out of main  , and start making some objects of our own.  We’ll look at what makes   object-oriented  OO  development in Java so much fun.  We’ll look at the difference between   a class and an object.  We’ll look at how objects can give you a better life  at least the program-  ming part of your life.  Not much we can do about your fashion sense .  Warning: once you get   to Objectville, you might never go back.  Send us a postcard.  this is a new chapter  27   the spec  once upon a time in Objectville  Chair Wars  or How Objects Can Change Your Life   O    nce upon a time in a software shop, two   programmers were given the same spec and told to  “build it”. The Really Annoying Project Manager  forced the two coders to compete,   by promising that whoever delivers   ﬁrst gets one of those cool Aeron™  chairs all the Silicon Valley guys have.  Larry, the procedural programmer, and  Brad, the OO guy, both knew this would  be a piece of cake.  Larry, sitting in his cube, thought to  himself, “What are the things this program  has to do? What procedures do we need?”.  And he answered himself , “rotate and  playSound.” So off he went to build the  procedures. After all, what is a program if not  a pile of procedures? Brad, meanwhile, kicked back at the cafe  and thought to himself, “What are the things  in this program... who are the key players?”  He  ﬁrst thought of The Shapes. Of course, there  were other objects he thought of like the User, the Sound,  and the Clicking event. But he already had a library of code  for those pieces, so he focused on building Shapes. Read  on to see how Brad and Larry built their programs, and  for the answer to your burning question, “So, who got the  Aeron?”  In Larry’s cube As he had done a gazillion times before, Larry  set about writing his Important Procedures.  He wrote rotate and playSound in no time.      rotate shapeNum  {         make the shape rotate 360º    }    playSound shapeNum  {         use shapeNum to lookup which         AIF sound to play, and play it    }  28   chapter 2  the chair  At Brad’s laptop at the cafe Brad wrote a class for each of the three shapes  }  }  }   classes and objects  Larry thought he’d nailed it. He could almost feel the rolled  steel of the Aeron beneath his...  But wait! There’s been a spec change. “OK, technically you were ﬁ rst, Larry,” said the Manager, “but we have to add just one  tiny thing to the program. It’ll be no problem for crack programmers like you two.” “If I had a dime for every time I’ve heard that one”, thought Larry, knowing that spec- change-no-problem was a fantasy.  “And yet Brad looks strangely serene. What’s up with  that?”  Still, Larry held tight to his core belief that the OO way, while cute, was just  slow. And that if you wanted to change his mind, you’d have to pry it from his cold,  dead, carpal-tunnelled hands.  l  l b e a n a m o e b a s h a p e o n t h e s c r e e n , w i t h t h e o t h e r s .

But playSound would have to change.  And what the heck is a .hif ﬁ le? playSound shapeNum  {       if the shape is not an amoeba,          use shapeNum to lookup which          AIF sound to play, and play it       else          play amoeba .hif sound   } It turned out not to be such a big deal, but it still  made him queasy to touch previously-tested code. Of  all people, he should know that no matter what the  project manager says, the spec always changes.  At Brad’s laptop at the beach Brad smiled, sipped his margarita, and wrote one  new class. Sometimes the thing he loved most  about OO was that he didn’t have to touch code  he’d already tested and delivered. “Flexibility,  extensibility,...” he mused, reﬂ ecting on the  beneﬁ ts of OO.  Amoeba  rotate   {      code to rotate an amoeba   } playSound   {      code to play the new       .hif file for an amoeba  }  you are here4  29   once upon a time in Objectville  Larry snuck in just moments ahead of Brad.  Hah! So much for that foofy OO nonsense . But the smirk on Larry’s face melted when the  Really Annoying Project Manager said  with that tone of disappointment , “Oh, no, that’s not  how the amoeba is supposed to rotate...”  Turns out, both programmers had written their rotate code like this:    1  determine the rectangle that surrounds the shape    2  calculate the center of that rectangle, and rotate the shape around that point. But the amoeba shape was supposed to rotate around a point on one end, like a clock hand. “I’m toast.” thought Larry, visualizing charred Wonderbread™. “Although, hmmmm. I could  just add another if else to the rotate procedure, and then just hard-code the rotation point  code for the amoeba. That probably won’t break anything.”  But the little voice at the back of  his head said, “Big Mistake. Do you honestly think the spec won’t change again?”  i n L a r r y  A m e o b a r o t a t i o n p o i n t a n d B r a d ’ s v e r s i o n :  W h e r e t h e a m e b a r o t a t i o n p o i n t s h o u l d b e :  Back in Larry’s cube He ﬁ gured he better add rotation point arguments  to the rotate procedure. A lot of code was affected.  Testing, recompiling, the whole nine yards all over  again. Things that used to work, didn’t.     rotate shapeNum, xPt, yPt  {       if the shape is not an amoeba,          calculate the center point          based on a rectangle,          then rotate       else          use the xPt and yPt as          the rotation point offset          and then rotate   } 30   chapter 2             At Brad’s laptop on his lawn  chair at the Telluride Bluegrass Festival Without missing a beat, Brad modiﬁ ed the rotate  method, but only in the Amoeba class. He never  touched the tested, working,  compiled code for the other   for the other  parts of   the program. To  give the Amoeba a rota- tion point, he added an  attribute that all Amoebas  that all Amoebas  would have. He modi- ﬁ ed, tested, and delivered  ﬁ ed, tested, and delivered   wirelessly  the revised  program during a single  Bela Fleck set.  int xPoint int yPoint rotate   {      code to rotate an amoeba      using amoeba’s x and y   } playSound   {      code to play the new      .hif file for an amoeba  }  Amoeba   classes and objects  So, Brad the OO guy got the chair, right ? Not so fast. Larry found a ﬂaw in Brad’s approach. And,  since he was sure that if he got the chair he’d also get Lucy  in accounting, he had to turn this thing around. LARRY:  You’ve got duplicated code! The rotate  procedure is in all four Shape things. BRAD:  It’s a method, not a procedure. And they’re classes,  not things. LARRY: Whatever. It’s a stupid design. You have to  maintain four different rotate “methods”. How can that  ever be good? BRAD:  Oh, I guess you didn’t see the ﬁnal design. Let me  show you how OO inheritance works, Larry.   What Larry wanted   figured the chair would impress her   1  Square  Circle  Triangle  Amoeba  rotate   playSound    rotate   playSound    rotate   playSound    rotate   playSound    I looked at what all four classes have in common.  2  They’re Shapes, and they all rotate and playSound. So I abstracted out the common features and put them into a new class called Shape.  Shape  rotate   playSound    You can read this as, “Square inherits from Shape”,  “Circle inherits from Shape”, and so on. I removed  rotate   and playSound   from the other shapes, so now  there’s only one copy to maintain. The Shape class is called the superclass of the other four  classes. The other four are the subclasses of Shape. The  subclasses inherit the methods of the superclass. In other  words, if the Shape class has the functionality, then the  subclasses automatically get that same functionality.  3  Then I linked the other  four shape classes to  the new Shape class,  in a relationship called  inheritance.   superclass  Shape  rotate   playSound    subclasses  Square  Circle  Triangle  Amoeba  you are here4  31   once upon a time in Objectville  What about the Amoeba rotate  ? LARRY:  Wasn’t that the whole problem here — that the amoeba shape  had a completely different rotate and playSound procedure? BRAD: Method. LARRY: Whatever. How can amoeba do something different if  it “inherits” its functionality from the Shape class? BRAD: That’s the last step. The Amoeba class overrides the  methods of the   Shape class. Then at runtime, the JVM knows exactly  which rotate   method to run when someone tells the Amoeba to rotate.  I made the Amoeba class override  the rotate   and playSound    methods of the superclass Shape.    Overriding just means that a  subclass redefines one of its  inherited methods when it needs  to change or extend the behavior  of that method.  {  {  {  {  I can take  care of myself.  I know how an Amoeba   is supposed to rotate  and play a sound.  I know how a Shape is   supposed to behave. Your  job is to tell me what to   do, and my job is to make it happen.  Don’t you worry your little program- mer head about how I do it.  LARRY:  How do you “tell” an Amoeba to  do something? Don’t you have to call the  procedure, sorry—method, and then tell it  which thing to rotate? BRAD: That’s the really cool thing about OO.  When it’s time for, say, the triangle to rotate,  the program code invokes  calls  the rotate    method on the triangle object. The rest of the  program really doesn’t know or care how the  triangle does it. And when you need to add  something new to the program, you just write  a new class for the new object type, so the new  objects will have their own behavior.  32   chapter 2   The suspense is killing me.

You just read a story bout a procedural  programmer going head-to-head with an OO  programmer. You got a quick overview of some  key OO concepts including classes, methods, and  attributes.  We’ll spend the rest of the chapter  looking at classes and objects    we’ll return to  inheritance and overriding in later chapters .  Based on what you’ve seen so far  and what you  may know from a previous OO language you’ve  worked with , take a moment to think about  these questions:  What are the fundamental things you need to  think about when you design a Java class?  What  are the questions you need to ask yourself?  If you could design a checklist to use when  you’re designing a class, what would be on the  checklist?  you are here4  33   thinking about objects  When you design a class, think about the objects that  will be created from that class t ype. Think about:           things the object knows     things the object does  ShoppingCart  cartContents  knows  addToCart   removeFromCart   checkOut    does  Button  label color  setColor   setLabel   dePress   unDepress    knows  does  Alarm Alarm alarmTime alarmTime alarmMode alarmMode  setAlarmTime   setAlarmTime   getAlarmTime   setAlarm   isAlarmSet   isAlarmSet   snooze   snooze    knows knows  does does  Things an object knows about itself are called       instance variables  Things an object can do are called        methods  instance variables  state  methods  behavior   Song  title artist  setTitle   setArtist   play    knows  does  Sharpen your pencil  Fill in what a television object  might need to know and do.  Things an object knows about itself are called instance  variables. They represent an object’s state  the data , and  can have unique values for each object of that type.  Think of instance as another way of saying object.  Things an object can do are called methods. When you  design a class, you think about the data an object will need  to know about itself, and you also design the methods  that operate on that data. It’s common for an object to  have methods that read or write the values of the instance  variables. For example, Alarm objects have an instance  variable to hold the alarmTime, and two methods for  getting and setting the alarmTime. So objects have instance variables and methods, but those  instance variables and methods are designed as part of the  class.  34   chapter 2   classes and objects  What’s the difference between  a class and an object?   A class is not an object.  but it’s used to construct them    A class is a blueprint for an object. It tells the  virtual machine how to make an object of that  particular type. Each object made from that  class can have its own values for the  instance variables of that class.  For  example, you might use the Button  class to make dozens of different  buttons, and each button might have  its own color, size, shape, label, and so on.  JVM  class  Look at it this way...  An object is like one entry in your address book.  One analogy for objects is a packet of unused Rolodex™ cards.   Each card has the same blank fields  the instance variables .  When  you fill out a card you are creating an instance  object , and the  entries you make on that card represent its state.  The methods of the class are the things you do to a particular card;  getName   , changeName   , setName    could all be methods for  class Rolodex.  So, each card can do the same things  getName   , changeName   ,  etc. , but each card knows things unique to that particular card.  you are here4  35   making objects  Making your first object So what does it take to create and use an object? You need two classes. One  class for the type of object you want to use  Dog, AlarmClock, Television,  etc.  and another class to test your new class. The tester class is where you put  the main method, and in that main   method you create and access objects  of your new class type. The tester class has only one job: to try out the meth- ods and variables of your new object class type. From this point forward in the book, you’ll see two classes in many of  our examples. One will be the real class – the class whose objects we  really want to use, and the other class will be the tester class, which we  call   TestDrive. For example, if we make a  Bungee class, we’ll need a BungeeTestDrive class as well. Only the   TestDrive class will have a main   method, and its sole  purpose is to create objects of your new type  the not-the-tester class , and  then use the dot operator  .  to access the methods and variables of the new  objects. This will all be made stunningly clear by the following examples.   1 Write your class class Dog {    int size;   String breed;   String name;  instance variables  a method  DOG  size breed name  bark      void bark   {     System.out.println “Ruff! Ruff!” ;   } }  The Dot Operator  .   The dot operator  .  gives  you access to an object’s  state and behavior  instance  variables and methods .     make a new object  Dog d = new Dog  ;     tell it to bark by using the    dot operator on the     variable d to call bark    d.bark  ;     set its size using the    dot operator  d.size = 40;  d  x     t  o  e  u  h  n  t     e  p       m n n t     e  a  h  a i n g    i n  o  u  j  s     t    m a   e e ’ r  i t i n  w                        p  e  e  d  t  s  o     c  t  2 Write a tester  TestDrive  class class DogTestDrive {    public static void main  String[] args  {         Dog test code goes  here    } }  3 In your tester, make an object and access   the object’s variables and methods  class DogTestDrive {    public static void main  String[] args  {      Dog d = new Dog  ;      d.size = 40;      d.bark  ; r    } }  make a Dog object use the dot operator  .   to set the size of the Dog and to call its bark   method  t  r  a  o  e       o  d p  o  t  36   chapter 2  If you already have some OO savvy,  you’ll know we’re not using encapsulation.  We’ll get there in chapter 4.   Making and testing Movie objects  classes and objects  class Movie {   String title;   String genre;   int rating;    void playIt   {     System.out.println “Playing the movie” ;   } }  public class MovieTestDrive {   public static void main String[] args  {     Movie one = new Movie  ;     one.title = “Gone with the Stock”;     one.genre = “Tragic”;     one.rating = -2;     Movie two = new Movie  ;     two.title = “Lost in Cubicle Space”;     two.genre = “Comedy”;     two.rating = 5;     two.playIt  ;     Movie three = new Movie  ;     three.title = “Byte Club”;     three.genre = “Tragic but ultimately uplifting”;     three.rating = 127;   } }  MOVIE  title genre rating playIt    The MovieTestDrive class creates objects  instances  of  the Movie class and uses the dot operator  .  to set the  instance variables to a specific value. The MovieTestDrive  class also invokes  calls  a method on one of the objects.  Fill in the chart to the right with the values the three  objects  have at the end of main  .  you are here4  37   get the heck out of main  Quick! Get out of main!  As long as you’re in main  , you’re not really in Objectville. It’s ﬁ ne for a test  program to run within the main method, but in a true OO application, you  need objects talking to other objects, as opposed to a static main   method  creating and testing objects.   The t wo uses of main:       to test your real class        to launch start your Java application  A real Java application is nothing but objects talking to other objects. In this  case, talking means objects calling methods on one another. On the previous  page, and in chapter 4 , we look at using a main   method from a separate  TestDrive class to create and test the methods and variables of another class. In  chapter 6 we look at using a class with a main   method to start the ball rolling  on a real Java application  by making objects and then turning those objects  loose to interact with other objects, etc.  As a ‘sneak preview’, though, of how a real Java application might behave,  here’s a little example.   Because we’re still at the earliest stages of learning Java,  we’re working with a small toolkit, so you’ll ﬁ nd this program a little clunky  and inefﬁ cient. You might want to think about what you could do to improve  it, and in later chapters that’s exactly what we’ll do. Don’t worry if some of the  code is confusing; the key point of this example is that objects talk to objects.   The Guessing Game  Summary:  The guessing game involves a ‘game’ object and three ‘player’ objects. The game gen- erates a random number between 0 and 9, and the three player objects try to guess  it.  We didn’t say it was a really exciting game.   Classes: GuessGame.class    Player.class   GameLauncher.class  The Logic: 1  The GameLauncher class is where the application starts; it has the main   method. 2  In the main   method, a GuessGame object is created, and its startGame   method  is called.  3  The GuessGame object’s startGame   method is where the entire game plays out.  It  creates three players, then “thinks” of a random number  the target for the players  to guess . It then asks each player to guess, checks the result, and either prints out  information about the winning player s  or asks them to guess again.  38   chapter 2  GameLauncher  main String[] args  main String[] args   GuessGame  p1 p2 p3  startGame   startGame    Player  number  guess   guess    makes a GuessGame object and tells it to startGame  instance  variables forthe three players  the number this player guessed method for making a  guess   classes and objects  make a ‘target’ number that the  players have to guess  public class GuessGame {    Player p1;    Player p2;    Player p3;     public void startGame   {      p1 = new Player  ;      p2 = new Player  ;      p3 = new Player  ;          int guessp1 = 0;      int guessp2 = 0;      int guessp3 = 0;  GuessGame has three instance  variables for the three Player  objects create three Player objects and  assign them to the three Player  instance variables  declare three variables to hold the  three guesses the Players make       boolean p1isRight = false;      boolean p2isRight = false;      boolean p3isRight = false;  declare three variables to hold a true or  false based on the player’s answer       int targetNumber =  int   Math.random   * 10 ;      System.out.println “I’m thinking of a number between 0 and 9...” ;       while true  {        System.out.println “Number to guess is “ + targetNumber ;         p1.guess  ;        p2.guess  ;        p3.guess  ;  call each player’s guess   method         guessp1 = p1.number;        System.out.println “Player one guessed “ + guessp1 ;         guessp2 = p2.number;        System.out.println “Player two guessed “ + guessp2 ;  get each player’s guess  the result of their  guess   method running  by accessing the  number variable of each player         guessp3 = p3.number;        System.out.println “Player three guessed “ + guessp3 ;             if  guessp1 == targetNumber  {           p1isRight = true;        }        if  guessp2 == targetNumber  {           p2isRight = true;        }        if  guessp3 == targetNumber  {          p3isRight = true;        }  check each player’s guess to see if it matches  the target number.

All objects—no matter when, where,   or how they’re created – live on the  heap. But it’s not just any old memory  heap; the Java heap is actually called the  Garbage-Collectible Heap. When you  create an object,    Java allocates memory  space on the heap according to how  much that particular object needs. An  object with, say, 15 instance variables,  will probably need more space than an  object with only two instance variables.  But what happens when you need to  reclaim that space? How do you get an  object out of the heap when you’re done  with it? Java manages that memory  for you! When the JVM can ‘see’ that an  object can never be used again, that  object becomes eligible for garbage  collection. And if you’re running low on  memory, the Garbage Collector will run,  throw out the unreachable objects, and  free up the space, so that the space can  be reused. In later chapters you’ll learn  more about how this works.  40   chapter 2  Output  it will be different each time you run it    File   Edit   Window  Help   Explode %java GameLauncher I’m thinking of a number between 0 and 9...

How  do I do that if everything has to  go in a class?  A: There isn’t a concept of   ‘global’ variables and methods in  a Java OO program. In practical  use, however, there are times  when you want a method  or  a constant  to be available  to any code running in any  part of your program. Think  of the random   method in  the Phrase-O-Matic app; it’s a  method that should be   callable  from anywhere. Or what about  a constant like pi? You’ll learn  in chapter 10 that marking  a method as public and  static makes it behave much  like a ‘global’. Any code, in any  class of your application, can  access a public static method.  And if you mark a variable as  public, static, and ﬁ nal  – you have essentially made a  globally-available constant.   Q: Then how is this object-  oriented if you can still make  global functions and global  data?  A: First of all, everything   in Java goes in a class. So the  constant for pi and the method  for random  , although both  public and static, are defined  within the Math class.  And you  must keep in mind that these  static  global-like  things are the  exception rather than the rule  in Java. They represent a very  special case, where you don’t  have multiple instances objects.   a Java program?   What do you actually deliver? deliver?  Q: What is a Java program?  A: A Java program is a pile   A Java program is a pile  of classes  or at least one class .  class .  In a Java application, one of  the classes must have a main  the classes must have a main  method, used to start-up the  program. So as a programmer,  program. So as a programmer,  you write one or more classes.  you write one or more classes.  And those classes are what you  And those classes are what you  deliver. If the end-user doesn’t  deliver. If the end-user doesn’t  have a JVM, then you’ll also  need to include that with  your application’s classes,  so that they can run your  program. There are a number  program. There are a number  of installer programs that  let you bundle your classes  with a variety of JVM’s  say, for  with a variety of JVM’s  say, for  different platforms , and put it all  on a CD-ROM. Then the end-user  can install the correct version of  the JVM  assuming they don’t  already have it on their machine.   Q: What if I have a hundred   classes? Or a thousand? Isn’t  that a big pain to deliver  all those individual ﬁ les?  Can I bundle them into one  Application Thing?  A: Yes, it would be a big   pain to deliver a huge bunch of  individual files to your end-users,  but you won’t have to. You can  put all of your application files  into a Java Archive – a .jar file –  that’s based on the pkzip format.   In the jar file, you can include  a simple text file formatted as  something called a manifest, that  defines which class in that jar  holds the main   method that  should run.   classes and objects  Make it Sticki kkk  A class is like a recipe. Objects are like   cookies.   BULLET POINTS  ß  Object-oriented programming lets you extend  a program without having to touch previously- tested, working code.  ß  All Java code is defined in a class.  ß  A class describes how to make an object of  that class type. A class is like a blueprint. ß  An object can take care of itself; you don’t  have to know or care how the object does it.  ß  An object knows things and does things. ß  Things an object knows about itself are called  instance variables. They represent the state  of an object.  ß  Things an object does are called methods.   They represent the behavior of an object.  ß  When you create a class, you may also want   to create a separate test class which you’ll  use to create objects of your new class type. ß  A class can inherit instance variables and  methods from a more abstract superclass. ß  At runtime,  a Java program is nothing more   than objects ‘talking’ to other objects.  you are here4  41   exercise: Be the Compiler  Exercise  BE the compiler Each of the Java files on this page  represents a complete source file.

So far you’ve  used variables in two places—as object state  instance variables , and as local variables    variables declared within a method . Later, we’ll use variables as arguments  values sent to a   method by the calling code , and as return types  values sent back to the caller of the method .    You’ve seen variables declared as simple primitive integer values  type int . You’ve seen   variables declared as something more complex like a String or an array.  But there’s gotta be   more to life than integers, Strings, and arrays. What if you have a PetOwner object with a Dog   instance variable? Or a Car with an Engine? In this chapter we’ll unwrap the mysteries of Java   types and look at what you can declare as a variable, what you can put in a variable, and what you   can do with a variable. And we’ll finally see what life is truly like on the garbage-collectible heap.  this is a new chapter  49   declaring a variable        o b a   s e r a c u t   p n ’ t   a c a v b i t   b   R a  v J a Y o n i     a u a  u t   t y r   G i a b l i a r    . e p a f f e .  e      50   chapter 3  Declaring a variable Java cares about type. It won’t let you do  something bizarre and dangerous like stuff a  Giraffe reference into a Rabbit variable—what  happens when someone tries to ask the so-called  Rabbit to hop  ?  And it won’t let you put a  ﬂoating point number into an integer variable,  unless you acknowledge to the compiler that you  know you might lose precision  like, everything  after the decimal point .  The compiler can spot most problems: Rabbit hopper = new Giraffe  ; Don’t expect that to compile. Thankfully. For all this type-safety to work, you must declare  the type of your variable. Is it an integer? a Dog?  A single character? Variables come in two ﬂavors:  primitive and object reference. Primitives hold  fundamental values  think: simple bit patterns   including integers, booleans, and ﬂoating point  numbers. Object references hold, well, references  to objects  gee, didn’t that clear it up.   We’ll look at primitives ﬁrst and then move  on to what an object reference really means.  But regardless of the type, you must follow two  declaration rules:  variables must have a type  Besides a type, a variable needs a name, so that  you can use that name in code.  variables must have a name  int count;  type  name  Note:  When you see a statement like:  “an object  of type X”, think of type and class as synonyms.    We’ll reﬁne that a little more in later chapters.     “I’d  like a double mocha, no, make it an int.” When you think of Java variables, think of cups. Coffee cups, tea cups, giant  cups that hold lots and lots of beer, those big cups the popcorn comes in at  the movies, cups with curvy, sexy handles, and cups with metallic trim that  you learned can never, ever go in the microwave.  A variable is just a cup.  A container.   It holds something. It has a size, and a type.  In this chapter, we’re going to look ﬁrst at the  variables  cups  that hold primitives, then a little later we’ll look at cups  that hold references to objects. Stay with us here on the whole cup analogy—as  simple as it is right now, it’ll give us a common way to look at things when  the discussion gets more complex. And that’ll happen soon. Primitives are like the cups they have at the coffeehouse. If you’ve been to a  Starbucks, you know what we’re talking about here. They come in different  sizes, and each has a name like ‘short’, ‘tall’, and, “I’d like a  ‘grande’ mocha half-caff with extra whipped cream”. You might see the cups displayed on the counter,  so you can order appropriately:  small    short      tall           grande  And in Java, primitives come in different sizes, and those sizes   have names. When you declare a variable in Java,   you must declare it with a speciﬁc type. The  four containers here are for the four  integer primitives in Java.  long            int         short   byte  Each cup holds a value, so for Java primitives, rather than saying, “I’d like a  tall french roast”, you say to the compiler, “I’d like an int variable with the  number 90 please.” Except for one tiny difference... in Java you also have to  give your cup a name. So it’s actually, “I’d like an int please, with the value  of 2486, and name the variable height.” Each primitive variable has a ﬁxed  number of bits  cup size . The sizes for the six numeric primitives in Java  are shown below:  byte   short     int         long      8         16           32               64                                                    32               64                                 ﬂoat      double     primitives and references  Primitive Types Type       Bit Depth  Value Range  boolean and char  boolean    JVM-specific  true or false char  numeric  all are signed    0 to 65535  16 bits   integer   byte   short     int      8 bits   -128 to 127  16 bits     -32768 to 32767  32 bits   -2147483648                 to 2147483647  long   64 bits     -huge to huge  ﬂoating point  float   32 bits  varies  double  64 bits  varies  Primitive declarations  with assignments: int x;  x = 234;  byte b = 89;  boolean isFun = true;  double d = 3456.98;  char c = ‘f’;  int z = x;  boolean isPunkRock;  isPunkRock = false;  boolean powerOn;  powerOn = isFun;  long big = 3456789;  float f = 32.5f;  .

Be sure the value can ﬁt into the variable.  You can’t put a large value into a  small cup. Well, OK, you can, but you’ll  lose some. You’ll get, as we say,  spillage.  The compiler tries to  help prevent this if it can tell  from your code that something’s  not going to ﬁt in the container   variable cup  you’re using. For example, you can’t pour an  int-full of stuff into a byte-sized  container, as follows:  int x = 24;    byte b = x;      won’t work!!  Why doesn’t this work, you ask? After all, the value of x is 24, and 24 is deﬁnitely  small enough to ﬁt into a byte. You know that, and we know that, but all the  compiler cares about is that you’re trying to put a big thing into a small thing,  and there’s the possibility of spilling. Don’t expect the compiler to know what the  value of x is, even if  you happen to be able to see it literally in your code.  You can assign a value to a variable in one of several ways including:       In the examples below, the literal values are in bold italics: int size = 32;    char initial = ‘j’;  double d = 456.709;      type a literal value after the equals sign  x=12, isGood = true, etc.     assign the value of one variable to another  x = y     use an expression combining the two  x = y + 43   declare a double named d, assign it the value 456.709  declare a char named initial, assign it the value ‘j’  declare an int named size, assign it the value 32  boolean isCrazy;    isCrazy = true;    int y = x + 456;               declare a boolean named isCrazy  no assignment   assign the value true to the previously-declared isCrazy  declare an int named y, assign it the value that is the sum   of whatever x is now plus 456  52   chapter 3  Sharpen your pencil  The compiler won’t let you put  a value from a large cup into  a small one. But what about  the other way—pouring a  small cup into a big one? No  problem.  Based on what you know  about the size and type of the  primitive variables, see if you  can figure out which of these  are legal and which aren’t.  We haven’t covered all the  rules yet, so on some of these  you’ll have to use your best  judgment. Tip: The compiler  always errs on the side of  safety.  From the following list, Circle  the statements that would be  legal if these lines were in a  single method:  1. int x = 34.5;   2. boolean boo = x;   3. int g = 17;   4. int y = g;   5. y = y + 10;   6. short s;   7. s = y;   8. byte b = 3;   9. byte v = b;   10. short n = 12;   11. v = n;   12. byte k = 128;   primitives and references  S t i c k kkk i  i t  i n t    M a k e T h e   e i g h t   p r i m i t i v e   t y p e s   a r e : l o n g   f l o a t   d o u b l e b o o l e a n   c h a r   b y t e   s h o r t   A n d   h e r e ’ s   a   m n e m o n i c   f o r   r e m e m b e r i n g   t h e m :   B e a r s   S h o u l d n ’ t   I n g e s t   L a r g e     s t i c k   e v e n   b e t t e r .  !

No matter what   you hear, do not, I repeat,  do not let me ingest   another large furry dog.  Back away from that keyword! You know you need a name and a type for your variables.  You already know the primitive types. But what can you use as names? The rules are simple. You  can name a class, method, or variable according to the  following rules  the real rules are slightly more ﬂ exible,  but these will keep you safe :     It must start with a letter, underscore  _ , or  dollar sign  $ . You can’t start a name with a  number.     After the ﬁ rst character, you can use numbers as   well. Just don’t start it with a number.     It can be anything you like, subject to those two   rules, just so long as it isn’t one of Java’s reserved  words.      are keywords  and     other things  that the compiler recognizes.  And if you really want to play confuse-a-compiler, then just try  using a reserved word as a name. You’ve already seen some reserved words when we looked at  writing our ﬁ rst main class:  public   static   void  And the primitive types are reserved as well:  boolean char byte short int long ﬂ oat double  But there are a lot more we haven’t discussed yet. Even if you don’t  need to know what they mean, you still need to know you can’t use  ‘em yourself. Do not–under any circumstances–try to memorize these  now.

You use it to get the  object to do something    invoke methods .  object references  Controlling your Dog object You know how to declare a primitive variable and assign it a  value. But now what about non-primitive variables? In other  words, what about objects?      There is actually no such thing as an object variable.      There’s only an object reference variable.      An object reference variable holds bits that represent a       way to access an object. It doesn’t hold the object itself, but it holds something  like a pointer. Or an address. Except, in Java we don’t  really know what is inside a reference variable. We do  know that whatever it is, it represents one and only one  object. And the JVM knows how to use the reference to  get to the object.  You can’t stuff an object into a variable. We often think of  it that way... we say things like, “I passed the String to the  System.out.println   method.” Or, “The method returns a Dog”,  or, “I put a new Foo object into the variable named myFoo.” But that’s not what happens.  There aren’t giant  expandable cups that can grow to the size of any  object. Objects live in one place and one place  only—the garbage collectible heap!  You’ll  learn more about that later in this chapter.   Although a primitive variable is full of  bits representing the actual value of the  variable, an object reference variable is full  of bits representing a way to get to the  object. You use the dot operator  .   on a reference variable to say,  “use the thing before the dot to  get me the thing after the dot.”  For  example: myDog.bark  ; means, “use the object referenced by the variable myDog to  invoke the bark   method.” When you use the dot operator on  an object reference variable, think of it like pressing a button  on the remote control for that object.  54   chapter 3   primitives and references  The 3 steps of object  declaration, creation and  assignment  1  3  2  Dog myDog = new Dog  ;  1 Declare a reference   variable  Dog myDog = new Dog  ;  Tells the JVM to allocate space for a  reference variable, and names that  variable myDog.

Sure, they  might be a pointer to a pointer to... but even  if you know, you still canʼt use the bits for  anything other than accessing an object.

Unless   you’re cozy with someone on the  JVM’s development team, you  don’t know how a reference is  represented. There are pointers  in there somewhere, but you  can’t access them. You won’t  need to.  OK, if you insist, you  might as well just imagine it  to be a 64-bit value.  But when  you’re talking about memory  allocation issues, your Big  Concern should be about how  many objects  as opposed to  object references  you’re creating,  and how big they  the objects   really are.  Q:So, does that mean that   all object references are the  same size, regardless of the size  of the actual objects to which  they refer?  A:Yep. All references for a   given JVM will be the same  size regardless of the objects  they reference, but each JVM  might have a different way of  representing references, so  references on one JVM may be  smaller or larger than references  on another JVM.  Q:Can I do arithmetic on a   reference variable, increment it,  you know – C stuff?  A:Nope. Say it with me again,   “Java is not C.”   56   chapter 3  Java Exposed  This week’s interview: Object Reference  HeadFirst: So, tell us, what’s life like for an object reference?  Reference: Pretty simple, really. I’m a remote control and I can be programmed to  control different objects. HeadFirst: Do you mean different objects even while you’re running? Like, can you  refer to a Dog and then ﬁve minutes later refer to a Car? Reference: Of  course not. Once I’m declared, that’s it. If  I’m a Dog remote control  then I’ll never be able to point  oops – my bad, we’re not supposed to say point  I mean refer  to anything but a Dog. HeadFirst: Does that mean you can refer to only one Dog? Reference: No. I can be referring to one Dog, and then ﬁve minutes later I can refer to  some other Dog. As long as it’s a Dog, I can be redirected  like reprogramming your remote  to a different TV  to it. Unless... no never mind.  HeadFirst: No, tell me. What were you gonna say? Reference: I don’t think you want to get into this now, but I’ll just give you the short  version – if  I’m marked as ﬁnal, then once I am assigned a Dog, I can never be repro- grammed to anything else but that one and only Dog. In other words, no other object can  be assigned to me.  HeadFirst: You’re right, we don’t want to talk about that now. OK, so unless you’re  ﬁnal, then you can refer to one Dog and then refer to a different Dog later. Can you ever  refer to nothing at all? Is it possible to not be programmed to anything? Reference: Yes, but it disturbs me to talk about it. HeadFirst: Why is that?  Reference: Because it means I’m null, and that’s upsetting to me.  HeadFirst: You mean, because then you have no value? Reference: Oh, null is a value. I’m still a remote control, but it’s like you brought  home a new universal remote control and you don’t have a TV. I’m not programmed to  control anything. They can press my buttons all day long, but nothing good happens.  I  just feel so... useless. A waste of  bits. Granted, not that many bits, but still. And that’s not  the worst part. If  I am the only reference to a particular object, and then I’m set to null   deprogrammed , it means that now nobody can get to that object I had been referring to. HeadFirst: And that’s bad because... Reference: You have to ask? Here I’ve developed a relationship with this object, an  intimate connection, and then the tie is suddenly, cruelly, severed. And I will never see  that object again, because now it’s eligible for [producer, cue tragic music] garbage collection.  Sniff. But do you think programmers ever consider that? Snif. Why, why can’t I be a primi- tive? I hate being a reference. The responsibility, all the broken attachments...   Book ob j e ct   2  Life on the garbage-collectible heap  Book b = new Book  ; Book c = new Book  ; Declare two Book reference  variables. Create two new Book  objects. Assign the Book objects to  the reference variables.  The two Book objects are now living  on the heap.   References: 2  Objects: 2  Book d = c; Declare a new Book reference variable.  Rather than creating a new, third Book  object, assign the value of variable c to  variable d.  But what does this mean?  It’s like saying, “Take the bits in c, make a  copy of them, and stick that copy into d.” Both c and d refer to the same  object.   The c and d variables hold  two different copies of the  same value. Two remotes  programmed to one TV.  References: 3  Objects: 2  c = b; Assign the value of variable b to  variable c.  By now you know what  this means. The bits inside variable  b are copied, and that new copy is  stuffed into variable c. Both b and c refer to the  same object.

An array variable is   a remote control to an array object.  int[] nums;  2 Create a new int array with a length  of 7, and assign it to the previously- declared int[] variable nums  nums = new int[7];  7 int variables  3 Give each element in the array  an int value.  Remember, elements in an int  array are just int variables.  7 int variables  nums[0] = 6; nums[1] = 19; nums[2] = 44; nums[3] = 42; nums[4] = 10; nums[5] = 20; nums[6] = 1;  Arrays are objects too  The Java standard library includes  lots of sophisticated data structures  including maps, trees, and sets   see Appendix B , but arrays are  great when you just want a quick,  ordered, efﬁcient list of things.  Arrays give you fast random  access by letting you use an index  position to get to any element in  the array.  Every element in an array is just  a variable.

Anything you  would put in a variable of that type  can be assigned to an array element  of that type. So in an array of type  int   int[] , each element can hold  an int. In a Dog array  Dog[]  each  element can hold... a Dog? No,  remember that a reference variable  just holds a reference  a remote  control , not the object itself. So  in a Dog array, each element can  hold a remote control to a Dog. Of  course, we still have to make the  Dog objects... and you’ll see all that  on the next page.  Be sure to notice one key thing  in the picture above – the array is  an object, even though it’s an array of  primitives.  Arrays are always objects, whether  they’re declared to hold primitives  or object references. But you can  have an array object that’s declared  to hold primitive values. In other  words, the array object can have  elements which are primitives, but  the array itself is never a primitive.

Once you’ve declared an ar ray, you  can’t put anything in it except things  that are of  the declared ar ray type.

Tawny strolled into the programmers’ bullpen like she  owned the place.  She knew that all the programmers would still be hard at work, and she  wanted help.  She needed a new method added to the pivotal class that was to be loaded into the  client’s new top-secret Java-enabled cell phone.  Heap space in the cell phone’s memory was  as tight as Tawny’s top, and everyone knew it.  The normally raucous buzz in the bullpen fell to  silence as Tawny eased her way to the white board.  She sketched a quick overview of the new  method’s functionality and slowly scanned the room.  “Well boys, it’s crunch time”, she purred.   “Whoever creates the most memory efﬁcient version of this method is coming with me to the  client’s launch party on Maui tomorrow...  to help me install the new software.”          The next morning Tawny glided into the bullpen wearing her short Aloha dress.   “Gentlemen”, she smiled, “the plane leaves in a few hours, show me what you’ve  got!”.    Bob went ﬁrst; as he began to sketch his design on the white board Tawny  said, “Let’s get to the point Bob, show me how you handled updating the list of con- tact objects.”  Bob quickly drew a code fragment on the board:            Contact [] ca = new Contact[10];     while   x < 10   {      make 10 contact objects       ca[x] = new Contact  ;       x = x + 1;     }        do complicated Contact list updating stuff with ca         “Tawny I know we’re tight on memory, but your spec said that we had to be able to access  individual contact information for all ten allowable contacts, this was the best scheme I could  cook up”, said Bob.   Kent was next, already imagining coconut cocktails with Tawny, “Bob,”  he said, “your solution’s a bit kludgy don’t you think?” Kent smirked, “Take a look at this  baby”:      Contact refc;     while   x < 10   {      make 10 contact objects       refc = new Contact  ;       x = x + 1;     }        do complicated Contact list updating stuff with refc     “I saved a bunch of reference variables worth of memory, Bob-o-rino, so put away your  sunscreen”, mocked Kent.  “Not so fast Kent!”, said Tawny, “you’ve saved a little memory, but  Bob’s coming with me.”.

It’s true that he didn’t use as many reference  variables as Bob, but there was no way to access any  but the last of the Contact objects that his method cre- ated. With each trip through the loop, he was assign- ing a new object to the one reference variable, so the  previously referenced object was abandoned on the  heap – unreachable. Without access to nine of the ten  objects created, Kent’s method was useless.  The software was a huge success and the client gave Tawny and Bob an extra week  in Hawaii.

State affects behavior,  behavior affects state.  We know that objects  have state and behavior, represented by instance variables and methods. But until now, we   haven’t looked at how state and behavior are related. We already know that each instance of a   class  each object of a particular type  can have its own unique values for its instance variables.   Dog A can have a name “Fido” and a weight of 70 pounds. Dog B is “Killer” and weighs 9 pounds.    And if the Dog class has a method makeNoise  , well, don’t you think a 70-pound dog barks a   bit deeper than the little 9-pounder?  Assuming that annoying yippy sound can be considered   a bark.  Fortunately, that’s the whole point of an object—it has behavior that acts on its state.  In   other words, methods use instance variable values.  Like, “if dog is less than 14 pounds, make   yippy sound, else...” or “increase weight by 5”.    Let’s go change some state.  this is a new chapter  71   objects have state and behavior  Remember: a class describes what an  object knows and what an object does  A class is the blueprint for an object. When you  write a class, you’re describing how the JVM  should make an object of that type. You already  know that every object of that type can have  different instance variable values. But what about  the methods?  Can every object of that type have different  method behavior?  Well... sort of.* Every instance of a particular class has the same  methods, but the methods can behave differently  based on the value of the instance variables.  The Song class has two instance variables, title  and artist. The play   method plays a song, but  the instance you call play   on will play the song   represented by the value of the title instance  variable for that instance. So, if you call the play    method on one instance you’ll hear the song  “Politik”, while another instance plays “Darkstar”.  The method code, however, is the same. void play   {     soundPlayer.playSound title ; }  instance variables  state  methods  behavior   Song  title artist  setTitle   setArtist   play    knows  does     s g  e  n  c  o  t s  s  s  a     n  S   i n c l a  e     f i v f o  Politik Coldplay  My Way Sinatra  Darkstar Grateful  Dead  Sing Travis  My Way Sex Pistols     e  c  n  s  a  t y .    i n p l a  h is   o  t  t        ”  n  g  o      S i n     “  y     p l a e s  u     a  g  c  C  a lli n w ill    t2  Song  t2.play  ;   s3  Song  s3.play  ;  Calling play   on this instance  will cause “My Way” to play.   but not the Sinatra one   Song t2 = new Song  ; t2.setArtist “Travis” ; t2.setTitle “Sing” ; Song s3 = new Song  ; s3.setArtist “Sex Pistols” ;  s3.setTitle “My Way” ;  *Yes, another stunningly clear answer!  72   chapter 4   The size affects the bark A small Dog’s bark is different from a big Dog’s bark.

Ruff!  methods use instance variables  you are here4  73   method parameters  You can send things to a method Just as you expect from any programming language, you can pass values into  your methods. You might, for example, want to tell a Dog object how many  times to bark by calling:  d.bark 3 ; Depending on your programming background and personal  preferences,  you might use the term arguments or perhaps parameters for the values passed  into a method. Although there are formal computer science distinctions that  people who wear lab coats and who will almost certainly not read this book,  make, we have bigger ﬁ sh to fry in this book. So you can call them whatever  you like  arguments, donuts, hairballs, etc.  but we’re doing it like this: A method uses parameters.  A caller passes arguments.  Arguments are the things you pass into the methods.  An argument  a value  like 2, “Foo”, or a reference to a Dog  lands face-down into a...  wait for it...  parameter. And a parameter is nothing more than a local variable. A variable  with a type and a name,   that can be used inside the body of the method. But here’s the important part: If a method takes a parameter, you must pass  it something. And that something must be a value of the appropriate type.  1 Call the bark method on the Dog refer-  ence, and pass in the value 3  as the  argument to the method .  Dog d = new Dog  ; d.bark 3 ;    argument  2 The bits representing the int  value 3 are delivered into the  bark method.  parameter  00000011  int  3 The bits land in the numOfBarks  parameter  an int-sized variable .  4 Use the numOfBarks   parameter as a variable in  the method code.  void bark int numOfBarks  {   while  numOfBarks > 0  {     System.out.println “ruff” ;     numOfBarks = numOfBarks - 1;   } }  74   chapter 4   methods use instance variables              Cute...  but not exactly what I      was expecting.  You can get things back from a method. Methods can return values. Every method is declared with a return  type, but until now we’ve made all of our methods with a void  return type, which means they don’t give anything back.  void go   { } But we can declare a method to give a speciﬁc type of value  back to the caller, such as: int giveSecret   {    return 42; } If you declare a method to return a value, you must  return a value of the declared type!   Or a value  that is compatible with the declared type.  We’ll get  into that more when we talk about polymorphism  in chapter 7 and chapter 8.   Whatever you say  you’ll give back, you  better give back!  e s  h c  p t  y a  h  e s e     u s t  t m  T  m  The compiler won’t let you return the wrong type of thing.  00101010  int  int theSecret = life.giveSecret  ;   int giveSecret   {    return 42; this must fit }  in an int!    r e p r e s e n t i n g   4 2   a r e   r e t u r n e d   f r o m   l a n d   i n   t h e    T h e   b i t s t h e   g i v e S e c r e t       m e t h o d ,   a n d   v a r i a b l e   n a m e d   t h e S e c r e t .  you are here4  75   multiple arguments  You can send more than one thing  to a method  Methods can have multiple parameters. Separate them  with commas when you declare them, and separate the  arguments with commas when you pass them. Most  importantly, if a method has parameters, you must pass  arguments of the right type and order.  Calling a t wo-parameter method, and sending  it t wo arguments. void go   {     TestStuff t = new TestStuff  ;     t.takeTwo 12, 34 ;    void takeTwo int x, int y  {     int z = x + y;     System.out.println “Total is ” + z ;  The arguments you pass land in the same  order you passed them. First argument lands  in the first parameter, second argument in  the second parameter, and so on.  You can pass variables into a method, as long as  the variable t ype matches the parameter t ype.  void go   {     int foo = 7;     int bar = 3;      t.takeTwo foo, bar ;    d  t    i n b i t   e h   o o f   a    ‘ 7 ’  b i t   e  h    s  h  e     i n s h t   d n  i n  e      t    b  e    r .  h  a     a  b   l a r w o n   o s b i t   e g e t  i n t a l      o  n t    i n r e t  d  S  n s.  h t   e h t t i c n  a     r  o    e  o  o f t e a l  o f  i d  e  t r    f m a t i c   n r r a  e  o  r       a  y  n  e  T h   x x  e a l u   y    i d e t a  i n s  p  s  p  e t        v e n a r a   b i t b i t  d    void takeTwo int x, int y  {     int z = x + y;     System.out.println “Total is ” + z ;  W h a t ’ s   t h e   v a l u e   o f   z ?

That means pass-by-copy.  int x = 7;  Declare an int variable and assign it  1  Declare an int variable and assign it  the value ‘7’.

Q:What happens if the argument you want to  A:You’ll learn more about this in later chapters,    but you already know the answer. Java passes  everything by value. Everything. But... value means  bits inside the variable. And remember, you don’t  stuff objects into variables; the variable is a remote  control—a reference to an object. So if you pass a  reference to an object into a method, you’re passing  a copy of the remote control.  Stay tuned, though, we’ll  have lots more to say about this.  Q:Can a method declare multiple return values?   Or is there some way to return more than one  value?  A:Sort of. A method can declare only one return   value. BUT... if you want to return, say, three int values,  then the declared return type can be an int array.  Stuff those ints into the array, and pass it on back.  It’s  a little more involved to return multiple values with  different types; we’ll be talking about that in a later  chapter when we talk about ArrayList.  Q:Do I have to return the exact type I declared? A:You can return anything that can be implicitly   promoted to that type. So, you can pass a byte where  an int is expected. The caller won’t care, because the  byte fits just fine into the int the caller will use for  assigning the result. You must  use an explicit cast  when the declared type is smaller than what you’re  trying to return.  value of a method? Can I just ignore it?  Q:Do I have to do something with the return  A:Java doesn’t require you to acknowledge a   return value. You might want to call a method with  a non-void return type, even though you don’t care  about the return value.  In this case, you’re calling  the method for the work it does inside the method,  rather than for what the method gives returns. In  Java, you don’t have to assign or use the return value.  78   chapter 4  Reminder: Java  cares about type! You can’t return a Giraffe when  the return type is declared  as a Rabbit. Same thing with  parameters. You can’t pass a  Giraffe into a method that  takes a Rabbit.   BULLET POINTS  ß  Classes define what an object knows and what an   ß  Things an object knows are its instance variables   object does.   state .   ß  Things an object does are its methods  behavior .  ß  Methods can use instance variables so that objects   of the same type can behave differently.   ß  A method can have parameters, which means you   can pass one or more values in to the method.   ß  The number and type of values you pass in must   match the order and type of the parameters  declared by the method.  ß  Values passed in and out of methods can be   implicitly promoted to a larger type or explicitly cast  to a smaller type.  ß  The value you pass as an argument to a method  can be a literal value  2, ‘c’, etc.  or a variable of  the declared parameter type  for example, x where  x is an int variable .  There are other things you  can pass as arguments, but we’re not there yet.   ß  A method must declare a return type. A void return   type means the method doesn’t return anything.  ß   If a method declares a non-void return type, it must  return a value compatible with the declared return  type.   Cool things you can do with parameters  and return types  Now that we’ve seen how parameters and return types work, it’s  time to put them to good use: Getters and Setters.  If you’re into  being all formal about it, you might prefer to call them Accessors  and Mutators. But that’s a    waste of perfectly good syllables.  Besides, Getters and Setters ﬁ ts the Java naming convention, so  that’s what we’ll call them. Getters and Setters let you, well, get and set things. Instance vari- able values, usually. A Getter’s sole purpose in life is to send back,  as a return value, the value of whatever it is that particular Getter  is supposed to be Getting. And by now, it’s probably no surprise  that a Setter lives and breathes for the chance to take an argu- ment value and use it to set the value of an instance variable.  methods use instance variables  ElectricGuitar  brand numOfPickups rockStarUsesIt  getBrand   setBrand   getNumOfPickups   setNumOfPickups   getRockStarUsesIt   setRockStarUsesIt       i n g   t h e s e     U s N o t e :   n a m i n g   c o n v e n t i o n s   b e   l l   y o u ’ m e a n s l o w i n g   a n   f o l i m p o r t a n t   J a v a   s t a n d a r d !  class ElectricGuitar {     String brand;    int numOfPickups;    boolean rockStarUsesIt;     String getBrand   {       return brand;    }     void setBrand String aBrand  {       brand = aBrand;    }     int getNumOfPickups   {       return numOfPickups;    }     void setNumOfPickups int num  {       numOfPickups = num;    }     boolean getRockStarUsesIt   {       return rockStarUsesIt;    }     void setRockStarUsesIt boolean yesOrNo  {       rockStarUsesIt = yesOrNo;    } }  you are here4  79   real developers encapsulate  Encapsulation Do it or risk humiliation and  ridicule. Until this most important moment, we’ve  been committing one of the worst OO  faux pas  and we’re not talking minor  violation like showing up without the ‘B’  in BYOB . No, we’re talking Faux Pas with  a capital ‘F’. And ‘P’. Our shameful transgression? Exposing our data! Here we are, just humming along without  a care in the world leaving our data out  there for anyone to see and even touch. You may have already experienced that  vaguely unsettling feeling that comes with  leaving your instance variables exposed. Exposed means reachable with the dot  operator, as in: theCat.height = 27; Think about this idea of using our remote  control to make a direct change to the Cat  object’s size instance variable. In the hands  of the wrong person, a reference variable   remote control  is quite a dangerous  weapon.  Because what’s to prevent:  theCat.height = 0;   This would be a Bad Thing. We need to  build setter methods for all the instance  variables, and ﬁnd a way to force other  code to call the setters rather than access  the data directly.  80   chapter 4  Jen says you’re  well-encapsulated...  c     W e ! s e y i k   h a s e t   t h i l  n ’ t   n ! e p  a p  l   a   s e t t e r   B y   f o r c i n g   e v e r y b o d y   t o   c a l m e t h o d ,   w e   c a n   p r o t e c t   t h e   c a t   f r o m   u n a c c e p t a b l e   s i z e   c h a n g e s .  public void setHeight int ht  {    if  ht > 9  {        height = ht;    } }  We put in checks  to guarantee a  minimum cat height.   Hide the data   Yes it is that simple to go from  an implementation that’s just  begging for bad data to one  that protects your data and  protects your right to modify  your implementation later. OK, so how exactly do you  hide the data? With the  public and private  access modiﬁers. You’re  familiar with public–we use  it with every main method.  Here’s an encapsulation  starter rule of thumb  all stan- dard disclaimers about rules  of thumb are in effect : mark  your instance variables private  and provide public getters  and setters for access control.  When you have more design  and coding savvy in Java, you  will probably do things a little  differently, but for now, this  approach will keep you safe.  Mark instance   variables private.  Mark getters and  setters public.  “Sadly, Bill forgot to  encapsulate his Cat class and  ended up with a flat cat.”  overheard at the water cooler .  methods use instance variables  Java Exposed  This week’s interview: An Object gets candid about encapsulation.   HeadFirst: What’s the big deal about encapsulation?  Object: OK, you know that dream where you’re giving a talk to 500 people when you  suddenly realize– you’re naked? HeadFirst: Yeah, we’ve had that one. It’s right up there with the one about the Pilates  machine and... no, we won’t go there. OK, so you feel naked. But other than being a little  exposed, is there any danger? Object: Is there any danger? Is there any danger? [starts laughing] Hey, did all you other  instances hear that, “Is there any danger?” he asks? [falls on the ﬂoor laughing]  HeadFirst: What’s funny about that? Seems like a reasonable question.  Object: OK, I’ll explain it. It’s [bursts out laughing again, uncontrollably] HeadFirst: Can I get you anything? Water? Object: Whew! Oh boy. No I’m ﬁne, really. I’ll be serious. Deep breath. OK, go on. HeadFirst: So what does encapsulation protect you from? Object: Encapsulation puts a force-ﬁeld around my instance variables, so nobody can set  them to, let’s say, something inappropriate.  HeadFirst: Can you give me an example? Object: Doesn’t take a PhD here. Most instance variable values are coded with certain  assumptions about the boundaries of  the values. Like, think of  all the things that would  break if  negative numbers were allowed. Number of  bathrooms in an ofﬁce. Velocity of   an airplane. Birthdays. Barbell weight. Cell phone numbers. Microwave oven power. HeadFirst: I see what you mean. So how does encapsulation let you set boundaries? Object: By forcing other code to go through setter methods. That way, the setter method  can validate the parameter and decide if  it’s do-able. Maybe the method will reject it and  do nothing, or maybe it’ll throw an Exception  like if  it’s a null social security number  for a credit card application , or maybe the method will round the parameter sent in to  the nearest acceptable value. The point is, you can do whatever you want in the setter  method, whereas you can’t do anything if  your instance variables are public. HeadFirst: But sometimes I see setter methods that simply set the value without check- ing anything. If  you have an instance variable that doesn’t have a boundary, doesn’t that  setter method create unnecessary overhead? A performance  hit? Object: The point to setters  and getters, too  is that you can change your mind later,  without breaking anybody else’s code! Imagine if  half  the people in your com- pany used your class with public instance variables, and one day you suddenly realized,  “Oops– there’s something I didn’t plan for with that value, I’m going to have to switch to a  setter method.” You break everyone’s code. The cool thing about encapsulation is that you  get to change your mind. And nobody gets hurt. The performance gain from using variables  directly is so miniscule and would rarely—if  ever— be worth it.  you are here4  81   how objects behave  Encapsulating the  GoodDog class  class GoodDog {         private int size;       e  n  c e.   a  t  t  a   in s riv p  e    h t b le     e k ria  M a a v     public int getSize   {       return size;  n d   c . b li    p  r    a u  e t t o d s  e h  g t  k  e  t     e  M a e s  t    e h   m e  t  r     }           size = s;     }     public void setSize int s  {  GoodDog  size size  getSize     setSize     bark     Even though the methods don’t really  add new functionality, the cool thing  is that you can change your mind  later. you can come back and make a  method safer, faster, better.     void bark   {       if  size > 60  {          System.out.println “Wooof!

The compiler  complains if you  try to use a local  variable before  the variable is  initialized.  there are no Dumb Questions Q: What about method parameters?   How do the rules about local variables  apply to them?  A: Method parameters are virtually the   same as local variables—they’re declared  inside the method  well, technically they’re  declared in the argument list of the method  rather than within the body of the method,  but they’re still local variables as opposed to   instance variables . But method parameters  will never be uninitialized, so you’ll never get  a compiler error telling you that a parameter  variable might not have been initialized.  But that’s because the compiler will give  you an error if you try to invoke a method  without sending arguments that the method  needs. So parameters are ALWAYS initialized,  because the compiler guarantees that  methods are always called with arguments  that match the parameters declared for the  method, and the arguments are assigned   automatically  to the parameters.  you are here4  85   object equality   Comparing variables  primitives or references   Sometimes you want to know if two primitives are the same. That’s easy  enough, just use the == operator. Sometimes you want to know if two  reference variables refer to a single object on the heap. Easy as well, just use  the == operator. But sometimes you want to know if two objects are equal.  And for that, you need the .equals   method. The idea of equality for  objects depends on the type of object. For example, if two different String  objects have the same characters  say, “expeditious” , they are meaningfully  equivalent, regardless of whether they are two distinct objects on the heap.  But what about a Dog? Do you want to treat two Dogs as being equal if they  happen to have the same size and weight? Probably not. So whether two  different objects should be treated as equal depends on what makes sense for  that particular object type.  We’ll explore the notion of object equality again  in later chapters  and appendix B , but for now, we need to understand that  the == operator is used only to compare the bits in two variables. What those  bits represent doesn’t matter. The bits are either the same, or they’re not.  To compare two primitives, use the == operator  The == operator can be used to compare two variables of any kind, and it  simply compares the bits. if  a == b  {...} looks at the bits in a and b and returns true if the bit pattern  is the same  although it doesn’t care about the size of the variable, so all the    n o extra zeroes on the left end don’t matter . t ,        int a = 3; t    byte b = 3;    if  a == b  {    true }    m o e r a   e r s i d e   e f t l n ’ t   d o   w e   e r e h   t    z e e t o f   e r a c  s e   i n o b  t t b  e t  h u  r    h      u  e a  o  r              a  e h  h t  To see if two references are the same  which means they  refer to the same object on the heap  use the == operator  Remember, the == operator cares only about the pattern of bits in the  variable. The rules are the same whether the variable is a reference or  primitive. So the == operator returns true if two reference variables refer to  the same object! In that case, we don’t know what the bit pattern is  because  it’s dependent on the JVM, and hidden from us  but we do know that whatever  it looks like, it will be the same for two references to a single object.        Foo a =  new Foo  ;    Foo b = new Foo  ;    Foo c = a;    if  a == b  {    false }    if  a == c  {    true }    if  b == c  {    false }  a == c is true a == b is false  86   chapter 4  Use == to compare  two primitives,  or to see if two  references refer to  the same object.  Use the equals    method to see  if two different  objects are equal.   Such as two different  String objects that both  represent the characters  in “Fred”   the bit patterns are the  same, so these two are  equal using == 0 0 0 0 0 011 0 0 0 0 0 011 ==  b  a  int  byte  the bit patterns are the  same for a and c, so they  are equal using ==  a  Foo   b  Foo  C  Foo   methods use instance variables  I always   keep my variables  private.

You’re making it look pretty good Jai, your volume  is up, but I’ve been experiencing, shall we say, a little ‘breach’ lately...” said Leveler.         Jai winced involuntarily, he’d been a top drawer jack-hacker in his day.  Anytime someone  ﬁgured out how to break a street-jack’s security, unwanted attention turned toward Jai.  “No  way it’s me man”, said Jai, “not worth the downside.  I’m retired from hacking, I just move   my stuff and mind my own business”.  “Yeah, yeah”, laughed Leveler, “I’m sure you’re   clean on this one, but I’ll be losing big margins until this new jack-hacker is shut   out!”  “Well, best of luck Leveler, maybe you could just drop me here and I’ll go  move a few more ‘units’ for you before I wrap up today”, said Jai.         “I’m afraid it’s not that easy Jai, Buchanan here tells me that word is you’re   current on J37NE”, insinuated Leveler.  “Neural Edition? sure I play around a bit, so  what?”, Jai responded feeling a little queasy.  “Neural edition’s how I let the stim-junkies  know where the next drop will be”, explained Leveler.  “Trouble is, some stim-junkie’s stayed  straight long enough to ﬁgure out how to hack into my WareHousing database.”  “I need a  quick thinker like yourself Jai, to take a look at my StimDrop J37NE class; methods, instance  variables, the whole enchilada, and ﬁgure out how they’re getting in. It should..”,  “HEY!”,  exclaimed Buchanan, “I don’t want no scum hacker like Jai nosin’ around my code!”  “Easy  big guy”, Jai saw his chance, “I’m sure you did a top rate job with your access modi.. “Don’t  tell me - bit twiddler!”, shouted Buchanan, “I left all of those junkie level methods public,  so they could access the drop site data, but I marked all the critical WareHousing methods  private.  Nobody on the outside can access those methods buddy, nobody!”       “I think I can spot your leak Leveler, what say we drop Buchanan here off at the corner  and take a cruise around the block”, suggested Jai.  Buchanan reached for his twitch-gun but  Leveler’s stunner was already on Buchanan’s neck, “Let it go Buchanan”, sneered Leveler,  “Drop the twitcher and step outside, I think Jai and I have some plans to make”.  What did Jai suspect?    Will he get out of Leveler’s skimmer with all his bones intact?  92   chapter 4   Exercise Solutions  methods use instance variables  B  class Clock {   String time;   void setTime String t  {     time = t;   }   String getTime   {        return time;   } }  class ClockTestDrive {   public static void main String [] args  {     Clock c = new Clock  ;     c.setTime “1245” ;     String tod = c.getTime  ;     System.out.println “time: “ + tod ;   } }     Note:  ‘Getter’ methods have a return            type by deﬁnition.

Jai knew that Buchanan wasn’t the sharpest  pencil in the box.  When Jai heard Buchanan  talk about his code, Buchanan never mentioned  his instance variables.  Jai suspected that  while Buchanan did in fact handle his methods  correctly, he failed to mark his instance variables  private.  That slip up could have easily cost  Leveler thousands.

Let’s put some muscle in our methods.  We dabbled with variables, played   with a few objects, and wrote a little code. But we were weak. We need more tools.  Like   operators. We need more operators so we can do something a little more interesting than, say,   bark. And loops.  We need loops, but what’s with the wimpy while loops? We need for loops   if we’re really serious.  Might be useful to generate random numbers.  And turn a String   into an int, yeah, that would be cool.  Better learn that too.  And why don’t we learn it all by   building something real, to see what it’s like to write  and test  a program from scratch.  Maybe   a game, like Battleships. That’s a heavy-lifting task, so it’ll take two chapters to finish. We’ll build   a simple version in this chapter,  and then build a more powerful deluxe version in chapter 6.  this is a new chapter  95   building a real game  Let’s build a Battleship-style  game:  “Sink a Dot Com” It’s you against the computer, but unlike the real  Battleship game, in this one you don’t place any ships  of your own. Instead, your job is to sink the computer’s  ships in the fewest number of guesses.  Oh, and we aren’t sinking ships. We’re killing  Dot  Coms.  Thus establishing business relevancy so you can  expense the cost of this book . Goal: Sink all of the computer’s Dot Coms in the fewest  number of guesses. You’re given a rating or level, based  on how well you perform. Setup: When the game program is launched, the  computer places three Dot Coms  on a virtual  7 x 7  grid. When that’s complete, the game asks for your ﬁ rst  guess. How you play: We haven’t learned to build a GUI yet, so  this version works at the command-line. The computer  will prompt you to enter a guess  a cell , that you’ll type  at the command-line as “A3”, “C5”, etc. . In response  to your guess, you’ll see a result at the command- line, either “Hit”, “Miss”, or “You sunk Pets.com”  or  whatever the lucky Dot Com of the day is . When  you’ve sent all three Dot Coms to that big 404 in the  sky, the game ends by printing out your rating. b    7 X 7 grid   o x   ll e  ”  c  “  h  a     c     e  i  a s  m o c .  2 o G  A  B  C  D  E  F  G  Pets.com  AskMe.com  0   1   2   3   4   5   6    starts at zero, like Java arrays  96   chapter 5  You’re going to build the  Sink a Dot Com game, with  a 7 x 7 grid and three  Dot Coms.

To answer that, we need more  information about what the game should do. First, we need to ﬁgure out the general ﬂow of the  game. Here’s the basic idea:  1 User starts the game  A  B  Game creates three Dot Coms  Game places the three Dot  Coms onto a virtual grid  A  Prompt user for a guess   “A2”, “C0”, etc.   B Check the user guess against  all Dot Coms to look for a hit,  miss, or kill. Take appropri- ate action: if a hit, delete cell   A2, D4, etc. . If a kill, delete  Dot Com.   3 Game ﬁnishes  Give the user a rating based on  the number of guesses.  Now we have an idea of the kinds of things the  program needs to do. The next step is ﬁguring  out what kind of objects we’ll need to do the  work.

A real ﬂow chart.  you are here4  97   a simpler version of the game     SimpleDotComGame  The “Simple Dot Com Game” a gentler introduction It looks like we’re gonna need at least two classes, a  Game class and a DotCom class. But before we build  the full monty Sink a Dot Com game, we’ll start with  a stripped-down, simpliﬁ ed version, Simple Dot Com  Game. We’ll build the simple version in this chapter,  followed by the deluxe version that we build in the  next chapter. Everything is simpler in this game. Instead of a 2-D  grid, we hide the Dot Com in just a single row. And  instead of three Dot Coms, we use one. The goal is the same, though, so the game still needs  to make a DotCom instance, assign it a location  somewhere in the row, get user input, and when all  of the DotCom’s cells have been hit, the game is over.  This simpliﬁ ed version of the  game gives us a big head start  on building the full game.   If we can get this small one  working, we can scale it up to  the more complex one later. In this simple version, the  game class has no instance  variables, and all the game  code is in the main   method.  In other words, when the  program is launched and  main   begins to run, it will  make the one and only DotCom  instance, pick a location for it  three  consecutive cells on the single virtual  seven-cell row , ask the user for a guess, check the  guess, and repeat until all three cells have been hit.  Keep in mind that the virtual row is... virtual. In other  words, it doesn’t exist anywhere in the program. As  long as both the game and the user know that the  DotCom is hidden in three consecutive cells out of a  possible seven  starting at zero , the row itself doesn’t  have to be represented in code. You might be tempted  to build an array of seven ints and then assign the  DotCom to three of the seven elements in the array,  but you don’t need to. All we need is an array that  holds just the three cells the DotCom occupies. 98   chapter 5  void main void main  int [] locationCells int numOfHits  SimpleDotCom  String checkYourself String guess  void setLocationCells int[] loc   1 Game starts, and creates ONE DotCom  and gives it a location on three cells in  the single row of seven cells.  Instead of “A2”, “C4”, and so on, the  locations are just integers  for example:  1,2,3 are the cell locations in this  picture:   0     1     2     3     4     5     6  2 Game play begins. Prompt user for  a guess, then check to see if it hit  any of the DotCom’s three cells.  If a hit, increment the numOfHits  variable.  3 Game ﬁ nishes when all three cells have  been  hit  the numOfHits variable val- ue is 3 , and tells the  user how many  guesses it took to sink the DotCom.

This is  where we write real Java code. where we write real Java code.  Developing a Class As a programmer, you probably have a methodology  process approach to writing code. Well, so do we. Our  sequence is designed to help you see  and learn  what  we’re thinking as we work through coding a class. It  isn’t necessarily the way we  or you  write code in the  Real World. In the Real World, of course, you’ll follow  the approach your personal preferences, project, or  employer dictate. We, however, can do pretty much  whatever we want. And when we create a Java class as a  “learning experience”, we usually do it like this:  o  Figure out what the class is supposed to do.  o  List the instance variables and methods.  o  Write prepcode for the methods.  You’ll see   this in just a moment.   o  Write test code for the methods.  o  Implement the class.  o  Test the methods.  o  Debug and reimplement as needed.  o  Express gratitude that we don’t have to test   our so-called learning experience app on  actual live users.     A  brain power  Flex those dendrites.  How would you decide which class or classes  to build ﬁ rst, when you’re writing a program?  Assuming that all but the tiniest programs  need more than one class  if you’re following  good OO principles and not having one class  do many different jobs , where do  you start?

It’s sort of half-way between real Java code and a plain  English description of the class. Most prepcode includes three parts: instance  variable declarations, method declarations, method logic. The most important  part of prepcode is the method logic, because it deﬁ nes what has to happen,  which we later translate into how, when we actually write the method code.  DECLARE an int array to hold the location cells. Call it locationCells.  DECLARE an int to hold the number of hits. Call it numOfHits and SET it to 0.  DECLARE a checkYourself   method that takes a String for the user’s guess  “1”, “3”, etc. ,  checks it, and returns a result representing a “hit”, “miss”, or “kill”.  DECLARE a setLocationCells   setter method that takes an int array  which has the three cell  locations as ints  2,3,4, etc. .

For a minute  there I thought you  weren’t gonna write your  test code ﬁ rst. Whoo!  Don’t scare me like that.   prep code       test code test code test code       real code real code  Writing the method  implementations let’s write the real  method code now, and get  this puppy working.  Before we start coding the  methods, though, let’s back  up and write some code to  test the methods. That’s right,  we’re writing the test code  before there’s anything to test!  The concept of writing  the test code ﬁ rst is one of  the practices of Extreme  Programming  XP , and  it can make it easier  and  faster  for you to write your  code. We’re not  necessarily  saying you should use XP,  but we do like the part about  writing tests ﬁ rst. And XP just  sounds cool.  Extreme Programming  XP       Extreme Programming XP  is a newcomer to the software  development methodology world. Considered by many  to be “the way programmers really want to work”, XP  emerged in the late 90’s and has been adopted by  companies ranging from the two-person garage shop  to the Ford Motor Company. The thrust of XP is that the  customer gets what he wants, when he wants it, even  when the spec changes late in the game.   XP is based on a set of proven practices that are all  designed to work together, although many folks do pick  and choose, and adopt only a portion of XP’s rules. These  practices include things like:  Make small, but frequent, releases.  Develop in iteration cycles.  Don’t put in anything that’s not in the spec  no matter  how tempted you are to put in functionality “for the  future” .  Write the test code first.  No killer schedules; work regular hours.  Refactor  improve the code  whenever and wherever you  notice the opportunity.  Don’t release anything until it passes all the tests.  Set realistic schedules, based around small releases.  Keep it simple.  Program in pairs, and move people around so that  everybody knows pretty much everything about the code.  you are here4  101   SimpleDotCom class    prep code       test code test code  test code       real code real code  Writing test code for the SimpleDotCom class  We need to write test code that can make a SimpleDotCom object  and run its methods. For the SimpleDotCom class, we really  care about only the checkYourself   method, although we will have  to implement the setLocationCells   method in order to get the  checkYourself   method to run correctly. Take a good look at the prepcode below for the checkYourself    method  the setLocationCells   method is a no-brainer setter method,  so we’re not worried about it, but in a ‘real’ application we might  want a more robust ‘setter’ method, which we would want to test . Then ask yourself, “If the checkYourself   method were  implemented, what test code could I write that would prove to me  the method is working correctly?”  Based on this prepcode:      METHOD String checkYourself String userGuess        GET the user guess as a String parameter    CONVERT the user guess to an int    REPEAT with each of the location cells in the int array      COMPARE the user guess to the location cell     IF the user guess matches    INCREMENT the number of hits       FIND OUT if it was the last location cell:    IF number of hits is 3, RETURN “Kill” as the result    ELSE  it was not a kill, so RETURN“Hit”    ELSE the user guess did not match, so RETURN “Miss”                                                                                                                                               END IF    END IF    END REPEAT         END METHOD  102  chapter 5  Here’s what we should test:  1.   Instantiate a SimpleDotCom object.  2.   Assign it a location  an array of 3 ints, like   3.   Create a String to represent a user guess   {2,3,4} .   “2”, “0”, etc. .  4.

A:You don’t. We never said   you start by running the test;  you start by writing the test. At  the time you write the test code,  you won’t have anything to run  it against, so you probably won’t  be able to compile it until you  write ‘stub’ code that can com- pile, but that will always cause  the test to fail  like, return null.   Q:Then I still don’t see the   point. Why not wait until the  code is written, and then whip  out the test code?  A:The act of thinking through    and writing  the test code helps  clarify your thoughts about what  the method itself needs to do.  As soon as your implementation  code is done, you already have  test code just waiting to validate  it. Besides, you know if you don’t  do it now, you’ll never do it.  There’s always something more  interesting to do.  Ideally, write a little test code,  then write only the implementa- tion code you need in order to  pass that test. Then write a little  more test code and write only  the new implementation code  needed to pass that new test. At  each test iteration, you run all  the previously-written tests, so  that you always prove that your  latest code additions don’t break  previously-tested code.  writing a program  Test code for the SimpleDotCom class  public class SimpleDotComTestDrive {     public static void main  String[] args  {       a n t i a t e e D o t C o m   c t  s t a i n S i m p l e j b o        int[] locations = {2,3,4};        SimpleDotCom dot = new SimpleDotCom  ;   e k   l o e h o m     t u o invoke the setter  method on the dot com.        dot.setLocationCells locations ;  r o f d   e   i n e   7   .    y a r t   f t i v u s i b l e  t   i n t i o o c     a          m a t c  n c 3    o t  a    f  r o  t  a      n  h  a  p  o  o  n  c  e  s  s  s                    String userGuess = “2”;  make a fake  user guess        String result = dot.checkYourself userGuess ;        String testResult = “failed”;        if  result.equals “hit”    {             testResult = “passed”;         System.out.println testResult ;     invoke the checkYourself    method on the dot com  object, and pass it the  fake guess.  if the fake guess  2  gives  back a “hit”, it’s working  print out the test result   passed or failed”          }      }  }  In the next couple of pages we implement the SimpleDotCom class,  and then later we return to the test class.

And does it  recognize spelled-out numbers,  like “three”?  A:Integer.parseInt   works only   on Strings that represent the ascii  values for digits  0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 .  If you try to parse something like  “two” or “blurp”, the code  will blow  up at runtime.  By blow up, we  actually mean throw an exception,  but we don’t talk about exceptions  until the Exceptions chapter. So for  now, blow up is close enough.   Q:In the beginning of the   book, there was an example of a  for loop that was really different  from this one—are there two  different styles of for loops?  A:Yes! From the first version of   Java there has been a single kind  of for loop  explained later in this  chapter  that looks like this:  for  int i = 0; i < 10; i++  {         do something 10 times  }  You can use this format for any  kind of loop you need. But...  beginning with Java 5.0  Tiger ,  you can also use the enhanced for  loop  that’s the official description   when your loop needs to iterate  over the elements in an array  or  another kind of collection, as you’ll  see in the next chapter . You can  always use the plain old for loop  to iterate over an array, but the  enhanced for loop makes it easier.  106  chapter 5  Final code for SimpleDotCom and SimpleDotComTester  public class SimpleDotComTestDrive {     public static void main  String[] args  {        SimpleDotCom dot = new SimpleDotCom  ;        int[] locations = {2,3,4};        dot.setLocationCells locations ;              String userGuess = “2”;        String result = dot.checkYourself userGuess ;           }  }  public class SimpleDotCom {     int[] locationCells;    int numOfHits = 0;        public void setLocationCells int[] locs  {       locationCells = locs;    }     public String checkYourself String stringGuess  {       int guess = Integer.parseInt stringGuess ;       String result = “miss”;       for  int cell : locationCells  {          if  guess == cell  {             result = “hit”;             numOfHits++;                          break;          }       }    out of the loop        if  numOfHits ==           locationCells.length  {           result = “kill”;       }       System.out.println result ;          return result;     }    close method    }    close class  There’s a little bug lurking here.

When you shift to one side, the other side gets to rest and   recover.

Math.random returns a double,  so we have to cast it to be an int  we  want a nice whole number between 0  and 4 . In this case, the cast lops off  the   fractional part of the double.  The Math.random method   returns a number from zero to  just less than one. So this formula   with the cast , returns a number  from 0 to 4.   i.e. 0 - 4.999..,  cast to an int   int randomNum =  int   Math.random   * 5   We declare an int variable to hold  the random number we get back.

Whatever you pass in here gets  displayed in the terminal just  before the method starts  looking for user input.

We didn’t  want to interrupt your work with some of the details and background info,  so we put it back here. We’ll start with the details of for loops, and if you’re  a C++ programmer, you can just skim these last few pages...  Regular  non-enhanced  for loops  post-increment operator  the code to  repeat goes here   the body   initialization  boolean test  iteration expression  What it means in plain English:  “Repeat 100 times.” How the compiler sees it:    * create a variable i and set it to 0.    * repeat while i is less than 100.    * at the end of each loop iteration, add 1 to i  Part One: initialization Use this part to declare and initialize a variable to use within the loop body.  You’ll most often use this variable as a counter. You can actually initialize more  than one variable here, but we’ll get to that later in the book.  Part Two: boolean test This is where the conditional test goes. Whatever’s in there, it must resolve to a  boolean value  you know, true or false . You can have a test, like  x >= 4 , or you  can even invoke a method that returns  a boolean.  Part Three: iteration expression In this part, put one or more things you want to happen with each trip through  the loop. Keep in mind that this stuff happens at the end of each loop.   114  chapter 5   writing a program  output: File  Edit   Window  Help  Repeat   %java Test 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 done  Trips through a loop for  int i = 0; i < 8; i++  {    System.out.println i ; } System.out.println “done” ;  declare int i set i to 0  false  print “done”  jump below loop   is i < 8?   the boolean   test   true  enter loop   body     print the value   of i  increment i  the iteration  expression   Difference bet ween for and while   A while loop has only the boolean test; it doesn’t have  a built-in  initialization or iteration      expression. A while  loop is good when you don’t know how many times to  loop and just want to keep going while some condi- tion is true. But if you know how many times to loop   e.g. the length of an array, 7 times, etc. , a for loop is  cleaner. Here’s the loop above rewritten using while:  we have to declare and  initialize the counter  int i = 0; while  i < 8  {    System.out.println i ; we have to increment     i++; the counter  } System.out.println “done” ;  ++  --  Pre and Post Increment Decrement Operator  The shortcut for adding or subtracting 1 from a variable.        x++; is the same as:         x = x + 1; They both mean the same thing in this context:  “add 1 to the current value of x” or  “increment x by 1”  And:   x--; is the same as:          x = x - 1; Of course that’s never the whole story. The placement of the  operator  either before or after the variable  can affect the re- sult. Putting the operator before the variable  for example, ++x ,  means, “ﬁ rst, increment x by 1, and then use this new value of x.”   This only matters when the ++x is part of some larger expres- sion rather than just in a single statement.        int x = 0;     int z = ++x; produces:   x is 1, z is  1  But putting the ++ after the x give you a different result:    int x = 0;     int z = x++; produces:   x is 1,  but z is 0!  z gets the value of x and then x is  incremented.  you are here4  115    enhanced for  The enhanced for loop  Beginning with Java 5.0  Tiger , the Java language has a second kind of for loop  called the enhanced for, that makes it easier to iterate over all the elements in an  array or other kinds of collections  you’ll learn about other collections in the next  chapter . That’s really all that the enhanced for gives you—a simpler way to walk  through all the elements in the collection, but since it’s the most common use of a  for loop, it was worth adding it to the language. We’ll revisit the enhanced for loop in  the next chapter, when we talk about collections that aren’t arrays.  Declare an iteration variable  that will hold a single element  in the array.   The colon  :   means “IN”.  The code to  repeat goes here   the body .  for  String name : nameArray  {  }  The elements in the  array MUST be  compatible with the  declared variable type.  With each iteration,  a different element  in the array will  be assigned to the  variable “name”.  lection of elements that you want to iterate over.  ier, the code said: The col Imagine that somewhere earl String[] nameArray = {“Fred”, “Mary”, “Bob”}; With the first iteration, the name variable has the value of  “Fred”, and with the second iteration, a value of “Mary”, etc.  What it means in plain English:  “For each element in nameArray, assign the  element to the ‘name’ variable, and run the body of the loop.”  How the compiler sees it:    * Create a String variable called name and set it to null.     * Assign the first value in nameArray to name.    * Run the body of the loop  the code block bounded by curly braces .      * Assign the next value in nameArray to name.    * Repeat while there are still elements in the array.  Note: depending on the  programming language they’ve  used in the past, some people  refer to the enhanced for as  the “for each” or the “for  in” loop, because that’s how it  reads: “for EACH thing IN the  collection...”  Part One: iteration variable declaration Use this part to declare and initialize a variable to use within the loop body. With each  iteration of the loop, this variable will hold a different element from the collection. The  type of this variable must be compatible with the elements in the array! For example,  you can’t declare an int iteration variable to use with a String[] array.  Part Two: the actual collection This must be a reference to an array or other collection. Again, don’t worry about the  other non-array kinds of collections yet—you’ll see them in the next chapter.  116  chapter 5   Converting a String to an int  int guess = Integer.parseInt stringGuess ;  The user types his guess at the command- line, when the game prompts him. That  guess comes in as a String  “2”, “0”, etc.  ,  and the game passes that String into the  checkYourself   method.  But the cell locations are simply ints in an  array, and you can’t compare an int     to a  String.   For example, this won’t work:  String num = “2”;  int x = 2;  if  x == num       horrible explosion!  Trying to compile that makes the compiler  laugh and mock you:   operator == cannot be applied to          int,java.lang.String        if  x == num  { }                     ^  So to get around the whole apples and  oranges thing, we have to make the String  “2” into the int 2. Built into the Java class  library is a class called Integer  that’s right,  an Integer class, not the int primitive ,  and one of its jobs is to take Strings that  represent numbers and convert them into  actual numbers.   h i p     s  s     t  s  t   s   J a  a  a  h  v  a  c l a   h w i t  takes a String  Integer.parseInt “3”   a method in the Integer  class that knows how to  “parse” a String into the  int it represents.  writing a program  Casting  Casting  primitives primitives  long  can be cast to  short  01011101  but you might  lose something  1101  bits on the left  side were cut off   long y = 42;  int x = y;       won’t compile  In chapter 3 we talked about the sizes of the various primitives, and how you  can’t shove a big thing directly into a small thing:      A long is bigger than an int and the compiler can’t be sure where that long has  been. It might have been out drinking with the other longs, and taking on really  big values.  To force the compiler to jam the value of a bigger primitive variable  into a smaller one, you can use the cast operator.  It looks like this:            long y = 42;        so far so good  int x =  int  y;    x = 42 cool!      Putting in the cast tells the compiler to take the value of y, chop it down to int  size, and set x equal to whatever is left.  If the value of y was bigger than the  maximum value of x, then what’s left will be a weird  but calculable*  number:         long y = 40002;        40002 exceeds the 16-bit limit of a short         short x =  short  y;     x now equals -25534!      Still, the point is that the compiler lets you do it.  And let’s say you have a float- ing point number, and you just want to get at the whole number  int  part of it:      ﬂ oat f = 3.14f;  int x =  int  f;       x will equal 3       And don’t even think about casting anything to a boolean or vice versa—just  walk away.    *It involves sign bits, binary, ‘two’s complement’ and other geekery, all of which  are discussed at the beginning of appendix B.  you are here4  117   exercise: Be the JVM  Exercise  BE the JVM The Java file on this page  represents a complete source  file.

I can lift  We don’t have to  heavy objects. build it ourselves?  Java ships with hundreds of pre-built classes.  You don’t have to   reinvent the wheel if you know how to find what you need in the Java library, known as   the Java API.  You’ve got better things to do. If you’re going to write code, you might as well   write only the parts that are truly custom for your application. You know those programmers   who walk out the door each night at 5 PM? The ones who don’t even show up until 10 AM?           They use the Java API. And about eight pages from now, so will you. The core Java library   is a giant pile of classes just waiting for you to use like building blocks, to assemble your own   program out of largely pre-built code. The Ready-bake Java we use in this book is code you   don’t have to create from scratch, but you still have to type it. The Java API is full of code you   don’t even have to type. All you need to do is learn to use it.  this is a new chapter  125   we still have a bug   In our last chapter, we left you  with the cliff-hanger. A bug.

Make a variable to hold the result we’ll  return. Put “miss” in as the default   i.e. we assume a “miss” .  Here’s where it  goes wrong. We  counted a hit every  time the user  guessed a cell  location, even if  that location had  already been hit!  We need a way to  know that when  a user makes  a hit, he hasn’t  previously hit that  cell. If he has, then  we don’t want to  count it as a hit.      for  int cell : locationCells  {          if  guess == cell  {             result = “hit”;             numOfHits++;  we got a hit!             break;         }    end if  Get out of the loop, no need  to test the other cells.      }    end for      if  numOfHits == locationCells.length  {         result = “kill”;      }    end if  Repeat with each  thing in the array.   Compare the user  guess to this element   cell , in the array.  We’re out of the loop, but  let’s see if we’re now ‘dead’   hit 3 times  and change the  result String to “kill”.      System.out.println result ;      return result;  }    end method  Return the result back to  the calling method.  Display the result for the user  “miss”, unless it was changed to “hit” or “kill” .  you are here4 127   fixing the bug   How do we fix it ?  We need a way to know whether a cell has already been hit. Let’s run  through some possibilities, but ﬁrst, we’ll look at what we know so far...  We have a virtual row of 7 cells, and a DotCom will occupy three  consecutive cells somewhere in that row. This virtual row shows a  DotCom placed at cell locations 4,5 and 6.  0     1     2     3     4     5     6  The DotCom has an instance variable—an int array—that holds that  DotCom object’s cell locations.  The virtual row, with the  3 cell locations for the  DotCom object.  4  5  6  locationCells             instance variable of  the DotCom   0  1  2  The array instance variable that  holds the DotCom’s cell locations.  This DotCom holds the 3 values of  4, 5, and 6. Those are the numbers  the user needs to guess.  1  Option one We could make a second array, and each time the user makes a hit, we  store that hit in the second array, and then check that array each time  we get a hit, to see if that cell has been hit before.  false  false  true  hitCells array                 this would be a  new boolean array  instance variable of  the DotCom   0  1  2  A ‘true’ in a particular index in the array means that  the cell location at that same index in the OTHER  array  locationCells  has been hit.  This array holds three values representing  the ‘state’ of each cell in the DotCom’s  location cells array. For example, if the  cell at index 2 is hit, then set index 2 in  the “hitCells” array to ‘true’.  128  chapter 6   get to know the Java API   Option one is too clunky  Option one seems like more work than you’d expect. It means that each  time the user makes a hit, you have to change the state of the second  array  the ‘hitCells’ array , oh -- but ﬁrst you have to CHECK the ‘hitCells’  array to see if that cell has already been hit anyway. It would work, but  there’s got to be something better...  2 Option t wo  We could just keep the one original array, but change the value of any hit  cells to -1. That way, we only have ONE array to check and manipulate  4  5  -1  a -1 at a particular cell location means that the cell  has already been hit, so we’re only looking for non- negative numbers in the array.  locationCells             instance variable of  the DotCom   0  1  2  Option t wo is a little better, but  still pretty clunky  Option two is a little less clunky than option one, but it’s not very efﬁcient. You’d  still have to loop through all three slots  index positions  in the array, even if  one or more are already invalid because they’ve been ‘hit’  and have a -1 value .  There has to be something better...  you are here4 129   prep code   prep code       prep code       prep code       test code test code  real code  3 Option three  We delete each cell location as it gets hit, and then modify the array to  be smaller. Except arrays can’t change their size, so we have to make a  new array and copy the remaining cells from the old array into the new  smaller array.  4  5  6  locationCells array           BEFORE any cells  have been hit  0  1  2  locationCells array           AFTER cell ‘5’, which  was at index 1 in the  array, has been hit  4  6  0  1  The array starts out with a size  of 3, and we loop through all 3 cells   positions in the array  to look for  a match between the user guess and  the cell value  4,5, 6 . When cell ‘5’ is hit, we make a new,  smaller array with only the remain- ing cell locations, and assign it to the  original locationCells reference.  Option three would be much better if the array could shrink, so that we wouldn’t have  to make a new smaller array, copy the remaining values in, and reassign the reference.  The original prepcode for part of the  checkYourself   method:  Life would be good if only we could  change it to:       REPEAT with each of the location cells in the int array        REPEAT with each of the remaining location cells                               COMPARE the user guess to the location cell            COMPARE the user guess to the location cell     IF the user guess matches    IF the user guess matches    INCREMENT the number of hits        FIND OUT if it was the last location cell:    IF number of hits is 3, RETURN “kill”    ELSE  it was not a kill, so RETURN“hit”    END IF    REMOVE this cell from the array        FIND OUT if it was the last location cell:    IF the array is now empty, RETURN “kill”     ELSE  it was not a kill, so RETURN“hit”    END IF    ELSE  user guess did not match, so RETURN “miss”    ELSE user guess did not match, so RETURN “miss”                                                                                                                                                                                  END IF       END REPEAT                                                                                                                                                                                  END IF       END REPEAT  130  chapter 6   get to know the Java API   If only I could ﬁnd an array   that could shrink when you remove  something. And one that you didn’t have  to loop through to check each element, but  instead you could just ask it if it contains  what you’re looking for. And it would let you  get things out of it, without having to know   exactly which slot the things are in.  That would be dreamy. But I know it’s   just a fantasy...  you are here4 131   when arrays aren’t enough  Wake up and smell the library  As if by magic, there really is such a thing.

ArrayList  myList = new ArrayList   ;  2  Put something in it Egg s = new Egg  ;  myList.add s ;  3  Put another thing in it Egg b = new Egg  ;  myList.add b ;  get to know the Java API   s t   o b j e c t   s I t ’     A   n e w   A r r a y L i c r e a t e d   o n   t h e   h e a p .     e m p t y . s b e c a u s e    i t ’  s  l  i       i t t l e    Now the ArrayList grows a “box”  to hold the Egg object.

A:The question is really,   “How do I know what’s in the  API?”  and that’s the key to your  success as a Java programmer.  Not to mention your key to  being as lazy as possible while  still managing to build software.  You might be amazed at how  much time you can save when  somebody else has already done  most of the heavy lifting, and  all you have to do is step in and  create the fun part.  But we digress...  the short  answer is that you spend some  time learning what’s in the core  API.  The long answer is at the  end of this chapter, where you’ll  learn how to do that.  Q:But that’s a pretty big   issue. Not only do I need to  know that the Java library  comes with ArrayList, but more  importantly I  have to know  that ArrayList is the thing that  can do what I want! So how  do I go from a need-to-do- something to a-way-to-do-it  using the API?  A:Now you’re really at the   heart of it. By the time you’ve  finished this book, you’ll have  a good grasp of the language,  and the rest of your learning  curve really is about knowing  how to get from a problem to  a solution, with you writing the  least amount of code. If you can  be patient for a few more pages,  we start talking about it at the  end of this chapter.  get to know the Java API   Java Exposed  This week’s interview: ArrayList, on arrays  HeadFirst:  So, ArrayLists are like arrays, right? ArrayList: In their dreams! I am an object thank you very much. HeadFirst: If  I’m not mistaken, arrays are objects too. They live on the heap right  there with all the other objects. ArrayList: Sure arrays go on the heap, duh, but an array is still a wanna-be  ArrayList. A poser. Objects have state and behavior, right? We’re clear on that. But  have you actually tried calling a method on an array? HeadFirst: Now that you mention it, can’t say I have. But what method would I  call, anyway? I only care about calling methods on the stuff  I put in the array, not  the array itself. And I can use array syntax when I want to put things in and take  things out of  the array. ArrayList: Is that so? You mean to tell me you actually removed something from an  array?  Sheesh, where do they train you guys? McJava’s?  HeadFirst: Of  course I take something out of  the array. I say Dog d = dogArray[1]  and I get the Dog object at index 1 out of  the array. ArrayList: Allright, I’ll try to speak slowly so you can follow along. You were not,  I repeat not, removing that Dog from the array. All you did was make a copy of  the  reference to the Dog and assign it to another Dog variable. HeadFirst: Oh, I see what you’re saying. No I didn’t actually remove the Dog  object from the array. It’s still there. But I can just set its reference to null, I guess. ArrayList: But I’m a ﬁrst-class object, so I have methods and I can actually, you  know, do things like remove the Dog’s reference from myself, not just set it to null.  And I can change my size, dynamically  look it up .  Just try to get an array to do that! HeadFirst: Gee, hate to bring this up, but the rumor is that you’re nothing more  than a gloriﬁed but less-efﬁcient array. That in fact you’re just a wrapper for an  array, adding extra methods for things like resizing that I would have had to write  myself. And while we’re at it, you can’t even hold primitives! Isn’t that a big limitation? ArrayList: I can’t believe you buy into that urban legend. No, I am not just a less- efﬁcient array. I will admit that there are a few extremely rare situations where an  array might be just a tad, I repeat, tad bit faster for certain things. But is it worth the  miniscule performance gain to give up all this power.  Still, look at all this ﬂexibility. And  as for the primitives, of  course you can put a primtive in an ArrayList, as long as it’s  wrapped in a primitive wrapper class  you’ll see a lot more on that in chapter 10 .  And as of  Java 5.0, that wrapping  and unwrapping when you take the primitive out  again  happens automatically. And allright, I’ll acknowledge that yes, if  you’re using an  ArrayList of  primitives, it probably is faster with an array, because of  all the wrapping  and unwrapping, but still... who really uses primitives these days? Oh, look at the time! I’m late for Pilates. We’ll have to do this again sometime.   you are here4 135   difference between ArrayList and array  Comparing ArrayList to a regular array  ArrayList        ArrayList  myList = new  ArrayList   ;  regular array  String [] myList = new String[2];  String a = new String “whoohoo” ; myList.add a ;  String a = new String “whoohoo” ; myList[0] = a;  String b = new String “Frog” ; myList.add b ;  String b = new String “Frog” ; myList[1] = b;  int theSize = myList.size  ;  int theSize = myList.length;  Object o = myList.get 1 ;  String o = myList[1];  myList.remove 1 ;  myList[1] = null;  boolean isIn = myList.contains b ;  boolean isIn = false;  r  i t     e   w h e o k   l o     t o e r l y   d i f f e     s e ’ r H e s t a r t s e a l r  n t ...        for  String item : myList  {           if  b.equals item   {                isIn = true;               break;           }       }  With an array, you use special array syntax  like  myList[0] = foo  that you won’t use anywhere  else except with arrays. Even though an  array is an object, it lives in its own special  world and you can’t invoke any methods on  it, although you can access its one and only  instance variable, length.  Notice how with ArrayList, you’re working  with an object of type ArrayList, so you’re just  invoking regular old methods on a regular old  object, using the regular old dot operator.  136  chapter 6   Comparing ArrayList to a regular array  get to know the Java API   1 A plain old array has to know its   3 Arrays use array syntax that’s not   size at the time it’s created.  But for ArrayList, you just make an object of  type ArrayList. Every time. It never needs to  know how big it should be, because it grows  and shrinks as objects are added or removed.  new String[2]  Needs a size.  new ArrayList     No size required  although you can  give it a size if you want to .  2 To put an object in a regular array,   you must assign it to a speciﬁc  location.  An index from 0 to one less than the length of  the array.   myList[1] = b;  Needs an index. If that index is outside the boundaries of the  array  like, the array was declared with a size of  2, and now you’re trying to assign something  to index 3 , it blows up at runtime. With ArrayList, you can specify an index us- ing the add anInt, anObject  method, or you  can just keep saying add anObject  and the  ArrayList will keep growing to make room for  the new thing. myList.add b ;  No index.  used anywhere else in Java. But ArrayLists are plain old Java objects, so  they have no special syntax.   myList[1]  The array brackets [ ] are special  syntax used only for arrays.  4  ArrayLists in Java 5.0 are  parameterized. We just said that unlike arrays, ArrayLists  have no special syntax. But they do use  something special that was added to Java 5.0  Tiger—parameterized types.   ArrayList   The   in angle brackets is a “type  parameter”. ArrayList  means simply “a  list of Strings”, as opposed to ArrayList   which means, “a list of Dogs”.  Prior to Java 5.0, there was no way to declare  the type of things that would go in the  ArrayList, so to the compiler, all ArrayLists  were simply heterogenous collections of  objects. But now, using the    syntax, we can declare and create an  ArrayList that knows  and restricts  the  types of objects it can hold. We’ll look at the  details of parameterized types in ArrayLists  in the Collections chapter, so for now, don’t  think too much about the angle bracket    syntax you see when we use ArrayLists.  Just   know that it’s a way to force the compiler to  allow only a speciﬁc type of object  the type in  angle brackets  in the ArrayList.   you are here4 137   the buggy DotCom code   prep code       test code  real code real code real code        Let’s fix the DotCom code.  We’ve renamed the class DotCom now  instead of  SimpleDotCom , for the new advanced version, but this  is the same code you saw in the last chapter.  Remember, this is how the buggy version looks:  public class DotCom {     int[] locationCells;    int numOfHits = 0;        public void setLocationCells int[] locs  {       locationCells = locs;    }     public String checkYourself String stringGuess  {       int guess = Integer.parseInt stringGuess ;       String result = “miss”;        for  int cell : locationCells  {          if  guess == cell  {              result = “hit”;             numOfHits++;                           break;          }       }    out of the loop        if  numOfHits == locationCells.length  {           result = “kill”;       }       System.out.println result ;          return result;     }    close method    }    close class  Where it all went wrong.

Instead of a single row, we’ll  use a grid. And instead of one DotCom, we’ll use  three. Goal: Sink all of the computer’s Dot Coms in the  fewest number of guesses. You’re given a rating level  based on how well you perform. Setup: When the game program is launched, the  computer places three Dot Coms, randomly, on the  virtual  7 x 7 grid. When that’s complete, the game  asks for your ﬁ rst guess. How you play: We haven’t learned to build a GUI  yet, so this version works at the command-line. The  computer will prompt you to enter a guess  a cell ,  which you’ll type at the command-line  as “A3”, “C5”,  etc. . In response to your guess, you’ll see a result at  the command-line, either “hit”, “miss”, or “You sunk  Pets.com”  or whatever the lucky Dot Com of the day  is . When you’ve sent all three Dot Coms to that big  404 in the sky, the game ends by printing out your  rating.  7 X 7 grid         h  a  c     e  i  a s  o x   ll e  ”  b  “  c  m o c .  2 o G  A  B  C  D  E  F  G  Pets.com  AskMe.com  0   1   2   3   4   5   6    starts at zero, like Java arrays  140  chapter 6  You’re going to build the  Sink a Dot Com game, with  a 7 x 7 grid and three  Dot Coms.

We have three classes that need to change: the  DotCom class  which is now called DotCom instead of  SimpleDotCom , the game class  DotComBust  and the  game helper class  which we won’t worry about now .  A DotCom class   §  Add a name variable   to hold the name of the DotCom   “Pets.com”, “Go2.com”, etc.  so each Dot- Com can print its name when it’s killed  see  the output screen on the opposite page .  B DotComBust class  the game  §  Create three DotComs instead of one. §  Give each of the three DotComs a name.  Call a setter method on each DotCom  instance, so that the DotCom can assign the  name to its name instance variable.  get to know the Java API   DotComBust class continued... §  Put the DotComs on a grid rather than  just a single row, and do it for all three  DotComs. This step is now way more complex than  before, if we’re going to place the DotComs  randomly. Since we’re not here to mess  with the math, we put the algorithm for  giving the DotComs a location into the  GameHelper  Ready-bake  class.  §  Check each user guess with all three   DotComs, instead of just one.  §  Keep playing the game  i.e accepting   user guesses and checking them with the  remaining DotComs  until there are no more  live DotComs.  §  Get out of main. We kept the simple one in  main just to... keep it simple. But that’s not  what we want for the real game.  3 Classes:  t  u  p  n  i     r  e  y    a n d  to make DotCom locations   t e s   a n d plays with  us e s f o r   p l a  a  e  r  c DotComBust  The game class.

We will be using more  powerful boolean expressions in some of the Ready-Bake code  you’re about to see, and even though we know you wouldn’t  peek, we thought this would be a good time to discuss how to  energize your expressions.  ‘And’ and ‘Or’ Operators    &&,        Let’s say you’re writing a chooseCamera    method, with lots of rules  about which camera to select.  Maybe you can choose cameras  ranging from $50 to $1000, but in some cases you want to limit the  price range more precisely.  You want to say something like:  ‘If the price range is between $300 and $400 then choose X.’     if  price >= 300 && price < 400  {     camera = “X”; }  Let’s say that of the ten camera brands available, you have some  logic that applies to only a few of the list:   if  brand.equals “A”   brand.equals “B”    {       do stuff for only brand A or brand B }  Boolean expressions can get really big and complicated:   if   zoomType.equals “optical”  &&      zoomDegree >= 3 && zoomDegree <= 8         zoomType.equals “digital”  &&      zoomDegree >= 5 && zoomDegree <= 12    {       do appropriate zoom stuff } If you want to get really technical, you might wonder about the  precedence of these operators.  Instead of becoming an expert  in the arcane world of precedence, we recommend that you use  parentheses to make your code clear.    get to know the Java API   Not equals   !=   and  !     Let’s say that you have a logic like, “of the ten available  camera models, a certain thing is true for all but one. “  if  model != 2000  {        do non-model 2000 stuff } or for comparing objects like strings...   if  !brand.equals “X”   {       do non-brand X stuff }  Short Circuit Operators    && ,     The operators we’ve looked at so far,  && and , are  known as short circuit operators.  In the case of &&,  the expression will be true only if both sides of the &&  are true.  So if the JVM sees that the left side of a &&  expression is false, it stops right there!  Doesn’t even  bother to look at the right side.  Similarly, with , the expression will be true if either side is  true, so if the JVM sees that the left side is true, it declares  the entire statement to be true and doesn’t bother to  check the right side.  Why is this great?  Let’s say that you have a reference  variable and you’re not sure whether it’s been assigned  to an object.  If you try to call a method using this null  reference variable  i.e. no object has been assigned , you’ll  get a NullPointerException.  So, try this:   if  refVar != null &&        refVar.isValidType     {       do ʻgot a valid typeʼ stuff } Non Short Circuit Operators    & ,     When used in boolean expressions, the & and  operators  act like their && and  counterparts, except that  they force the JVM to always check both sides of the  expression.  Typically, & and  are used in another context,  for manipulating bits.  you are here4 151   Ready-bake: GameHelper  Ready-bake  Code  import java.io.*; import java.util.*;  public class GameHelper {  This is the helper class for the game.

And now, as promised,  it’s time to learn how to fool around in the Java library.  In the Java  API, classes  are grouped into     packages.  To use a class in the API, you  have to know which package  the class is in.  Every class in the Java library belongs to a package.  The package has a name, like javax.swing  a  package that holds some of the Swing GUI classes  you’ll learn about soon . ArrayList is in the package  called java.util, which surprise surprise, holds a  pile of utility classes. You’ll learn a lot more about  packages in chapter 16, including how to put your  own classes into your own packages.   For now though,  we’re just looking to use some of the classes that come  with Java. Using a class from the API, in your own code, is  simple. You just treat the class as though you wrote  it yourself... as though you compiled it, and there it  sits, waiting for you to use it. With one big difference:  somewhere in your code you have to indicate the full  name of the library class you want to use, and that  means package name + class name.    Even if you didn’t know it, you’ve already been using  classes from a package. System  System.out.println ,  String, and Math  Math.random   , all belong to the  java.lang package.  154  chapter 6   You have to know the full name*  of the class you want to use in  your code.  ArrayList is not the full name of ArrayList, just as ‘Kathy’  isn’t a full name  unless it’s like Madonna or Cher, but we  won’t go there . The full name of ArrayList is actually:  java.util.ArrayList  package name  n     s  s  l a  c  a m e  You have to tell Java which ArrayList you  want to use. You have two options:  A  IMPORT Put an import statement at the top of your source code ﬁle:  import java.util.ArrayList; public class MyClass {... }  OR   B  TYPE Type the full name everywhere in your code. Each time  you use it. Anywhere you use it.  When you declare and or instantiate it:  java.util.ArrayList  list = new java.util.ArrayList   ;  When you use it as an argument type:  public void go java.util.ArrayList  list  { }  When you use it as a return type:  public java.util.ArrayList  foo   {...}             *Unless the class is in the java.lang package.  get to know the Java API   there are no Dumb Questions Q: Why does there have to   be a full name? Is that the only  purpose of a package?  A: Packages are important   for three main reasons. First, they  help the overall organization of a  project or library. Rather than just  having one horrendously large  pile of classes, they’re all grouped  into packages for specific kinds  of functionality  like GUI, or data  structures, or database stuff, etc.   Second, packages give you a name- scoping, to help prevent collisions  if you and 12 other programmers  in your company all decide to  make a class with the same name.  If you have a class named Set and  someone else  including the Java  API  has a class named Set, you  need some way to tell the JVM  which Set class you’re trying to use.  Third, packages provide a level of  security, because you can restrict  the code you write so that only  other classes in the same package  can access it. You’ll learn all about  that in chapter 16.  Q:OK, back to the name   collision thing. How does a full  name really help? What’s to  prevent two people from giving a  class the same package name?  A:Java has a naming convention   that usually prevents this from  happening, as long as developers  adhere to it. We’ll get into that in  more detail in chapter 16.  you are here4 155   when arrays aren’t enough  Where’d that ‘x’ come from?   or, what does it mean when  a package starts with javax?   In the first and second versions of Java  1.02  and 1.1 , all  classes that shipped with Java  in  other words, the standard library  were in packages  that began with java. There was always java.lang, of course  — the one you don’t have to import.  And there was  java.net,   java.io, java.util  although there was no such thing as ArrayList  way back then , and a few others, including the java.awt  package that held GUI-related classes.  Looming on the horizon, though, were other packages not  included in the standard library. These classes were known as  extensions, and came in two main flavors: standard, and not  standard. Standard extensions were those that Sun considered  official, as opposed to experimental, early access, or beta  packages that might or might not ever see the light of day.  Standard extensions, by convention, all began with an ‘x’  appended to the regular java package starter.  The mother of all  standard extensions was the Swing library.  It included several  packages, all of which began with javax.swing.   But standard extensions can get promoted to first-class, ships- with-Java, standard-out-of-the-box library packages. And that’s  what happened to Swing, beginning with version 1.2  which  eventually became the first version dubbed ‘Java 2’ .   “Cool”, everyone thought  including us . “Now everyone who has  Java will have the Swing classes, and we won’t have to figure  out how to get those classes installed with our end-users.”   Trouble was lurking beneath the surface, however, because  when packages get promoted, well of COURSE they have to  start with java, not javax. Everyone KNOWS that packages in  the standard library don’t have that “x”, and that only extensions  have the “x”.  So, just  and we mean just  before version 1.2  went final, Sun changed the package names and deleted the  “x”  among other changes . Books were printed and in stores  featuring Swing code with the new names. Naming conventions  were intact. All was right with the Java world.  Except the 20,000 or so screaming developers who realized  that with that simple name change came disaster! All of their   Swing-using code had to be changed! The horror!  Think of all  those import statements that started with javax...  And in the final hour, desperate, as their hopes grew thin, the  developers convinced Sun to “screw the convention, save our  code”.  The rest is history.  So when you see a package in the  library that begins with javax, you know it started life as an  extension, and then got a promotion.  156  chapter 6   BULLET POINTS  ß  ArrayList is a class in the Java API. ß  To put something into an ArrayList, use add  . ß  To remove something from an ArrayList  use   remove  .  ß  To find out where something is  and if it is  in an   ArrayList, use indexOf  .  ß  To find out if an ArrayList is empty, use   isEmpty  .  ß  To get the size  number of elements  in an   ArrayList, use the size   method.  ß  To get the length  number of elements  in a   regular old array, remember, you use the length  variable.   ß  An ArrayList resizes dynamically to what- ever size is needed. It grows when objects  are added, and it shrinks when objects are  removed.  ß  You declare the type of the array using a type   parameter, which is a type name in angle  brackets. Example: ArrayList  means  the ArrayList will be able to hold only objects of  type Button  or subclasses of Button as you’ll  learn in the next couple of chapters .  ß  Although an ArrayList holds objects and not   primitives, the compiler will automatically “wrap”   and “unwrap” when you take it out  a primi- tive into an Object, and place that object in the  ArrayList instead of the primitive.  More on this  feature later in the book.   ß  Classes are grouped into packages. ß  A class has a full name, which is a combina-  tion of the package name and the class name.  Class ArrayList is really java.util.ArrayList.  ß  To use a class in a package other than java. lang, you must tell Java the full name of the  class.  ß  You use either an import statement at the top of  your source code, or you can type the full name  every place you use the class in your code.   Q: Does import make my   class bigger? Does it actually  compile the imported class or   package into my code?  A: Perhaps you’re a C pro-  grammer? An import is not       the  same as an include. So the  answer is no and no. Repeat after  me: “an import statement saves  you from typing.” That’s really it.  You don’t have to worry about  your code becoming bloated, or  slower, from too many imports.  An import is simply the way you  give Java the full name of a class.  Q: OK, how come I never had   to import the String class? Or  System?  A: Remember, you get the   java.lang package sort of “pre- imported” for free. Because  the classes in java.lang are so  fundamental, you don’t have to  use the full name. There is only  one java.lang.String class, and one  java.lang.System class, and Java  darn well knows where to find  them.  Q:  Do I have to put my own   classes into packages? How do I  do that? Can I do that?  A: In the real world  which   you should try to avoid , yes, you  will want to put your classes into  packages. We’ll get into that in  detail in chapter 16. For now, we  won’t put our code examples in a  package.  get to know the Java API   Make it Sticki kkk  Roses are red,  apples are ripe, if you don’t import you’ll just have to type You must tell Java the full name of every class  you use, unless that class is in the java.lang  package.  An import statement for the class  or package at the top of your source code is the  easy way. Otherwise, you have to type the full  name of the class, everywhere you use it!

They’re part of  a larger set called the Java 5 Standard Edition  Documentation  which, depending on what  day of the week you look, Sun may be refer- ring to as “Java 2 Standard Edition 5.0” , and  you have to download the docs separately;  they don’t come shrink-wrapped with the Java  5 download. If you have a high-speed internet  connection, or tons of patience, you can also  browse them at java.sun.com. Trust us, you  probably want these on your hard drive.   The API docs are the best reference for get- ting more details about a class and its methods.  Let’s say you were browsing through the refer- ence book and found a class called Calendar,  in java.util. The book tells you a little about it,  enough to know that this is indeed what you  want to use, but you still need to know more  about the methods.   The reference book, for example, tells you  what the methods take, as arguments, and what  they return. Look at ArrayList, for example.  In the reference book, you’ll ﬁ nd the method  indexOf  , that we used in the DotCom class.  But if all you knew is that there is a method  called indexOf   that takes an object and re- turns the index  an int  of that object, you still  need to know one crucial thing: what happens  if the object is not in the ArrayList? Looking  at the method signature alone won’t tell you  how that works. But the API docs will  most of  the time, anyway . The API docs tell you that  the indexOf   method returns a -1 if the object  parameter is not in the ArrayList. That’s how  we knew we could use it both as a way to check  if an object is even in the ArrayList, and to get  its index at the same time, if the object was  there. But without the API docs, we might have  thought that the  indexOf   method would  blow up if the object wasn’t in the ArrayList.  1  Scroll through the packages  and select one  click it   to restrict the list in the  lower frame to only classes  from that package.

But  thanks to the Plan, our future is   bright. Yours can be too!  Plan your programs with the future in mind.  If there were a way to write   Java code such that you could take more vacations, how much would it be worth to you? What   if you could write code that someone else could extend, easily? And if you could write code   that was flexible, for those pesky last-minute spec changes, would that be something you’re   interested in? Then this is your lucky day. For just three easy payments of 60 minutes time, you   can have all this. When you get on the Polymorphism Plan, you’ll learn the 5 steps to better class   design, the 3 tricks to polymorphism, the 8 ways to make flexible code, and if you act now—a   bonus lesson on the 4 tips for exploiting inheritance. Don’t delay, an offer this good will give   you the design freedom and programming flexibility you deserve. It’s quick, it’s easy, and it’s   available now. Start today, and we’ll throw in an extra level of abstraction!  this is a new chapter  165   the power of inheritance  Chair Wars Revisited...  Remember way back in chapter 2, when Larry  procedural guy   and Brad  OO guy  were vying for the Aeron chair? Let’s look at  a few pieces of that story to review the basics of inheritance. LARRY:  You’ve got duplicated code! The rotate procedure  is in all four Shape things. It’s a stupid design. You have to  maintain four different rotate “methods”. How can that  ever be good? BRAD:  Oh, I guess you didn’t see the ﬁnal design. Let me  show you how OO inheritance works, Larry.   Square  Circle  Triangle  Amoeba  rotate   playSound    rotate   playSound    rotate   playSound    rotate   playSound    I looked at what all four classes have in common.  1  2  They’re Shapes, and they all rotate and playSound. So I abstracted out the common features and put them into a new class called Shape.  Shape  rotate   playSound    You can read this as, “Square inherits from Shape”,  “Circle inherits from Shape”, and so on. I removed  rotate   and playSound   from the other shapes, so now  there’s only one copy to maintain. The Shape class is called the superclass of the other four  classes. The other four are the subclasses of Shape. The  subclasses inherit the methods of the superclass. In other  words, if the Shape class has the functionality, then the  subclasses automatically get that same functionality.  166  chapter 7  3  Then I linked the other  four shape classes to  the new Shape class,  in a relationship called  inheritance.   superclass  Shape  rotate   playSound    subclasses  Square  Circle  Triangle  Amoeba   inheritance and polymorphism  What about the Amoeba rotate  ? LARRY:  Wasn’t that the whole problem here — that the amoeba shape  had a completely different rotate and playSound procedure?  How can amoeba do something different if it inherits its  functionality from the Shape class? BRAD: That’s the last step. The Amoeba class overrides the  methods of the Shape class. Then at runtime, the JVM knows  exactly which rotate   method to run when someone tells the  Amoeba to rotate.

Is a domestic cat a specialized  version of a tiger? Which would be the subclass and  which would be the superclass? Or are they both  subclasses to some other class?   How would you design an inheritance structure? What  methods would be overridden?   Think about it. Before you turn the page.  you are here4 167   the way inheritance works  168  chapter 7  Understanding Inheritance When you design with inheritance, you put common code in a class and then tell other more specific classes that the common  more abstract  class is their superclass. When one class inherits from another, the subclass inherits from the superclass. In Java, we say that the subclass extends the superclass. An inheritance relationship means that the subclass inherits the members of the superclass. When we say “members of a class” we mean the instance variables and methods. For example, if PantherMan is a subclass of SuperHero, the PantherMan class automatically inherits the instance variables and methods common to all superheroes including suit, tights, specialPower, useSpecialPowers  , and so on. But the PantherMan subclass can add new methods and instance variables of its own, and it can override the methods it inherits from the superclass SuperHero.      superclass  more abstract   SuperHero  suit tights specialPower  instance variables  state, attributes   useSpecialPower   putOnSuit    methods  behavior   subclasses  more specific   FriedEggMan  PantherMan  Overriding methods  useSpecialPower    putOnSuit    FriedEggMan doesn’t need any behavior that’s unique, so he doesn’t override any methods. The methods and  instance variables in SuperHero are sufficient. PantherMan, though, has specific requirements for his suit and special powers, so useSpecialPower   and putOnSuit   are both overridden in the PantherMan class. Instance variables are not overridden because they don’t need to be. They don’t define any special behavior, so a subclass can give an inherited instance variable any value it chooses. PantherMan can set his inherited tights to purple, while FriedEggMan sets his to white.   inheritance and polymorphism  I inherited my   procedures so I didn’t   bother with medical school.   Relax, this won’t hurt a bit.   now where did I put that   power saw...   An inheritance example: public class Doctor {      boolean worksAtHospital;      void treatPatient   {          perform a checkup      } }  }  public class FamilyDoctor extends Doctor {      boolean makesHouseCalls;     void giveAdvice   {          give homespun advice     }  public class Surgeon extends Doctor{      void treatPatient   {          perform surgery    }     void makeIncision   {          make incision  yikes!     } }  superclass  Doctor  worksAtHospital  one instance variable  treatPatient     one method  subclasses  Surgeon  Overrides the inherited treatPatient   method  treatPatient     Adds one new method  makeIncision    FamilyDoctor  makesHouseCalls  Adds one new instance variable  giveAdvice     Adds one new method  Sharpen your pencil  How many instance variables does  Surgeon have?

We don’t have to code the  thing now, we’re mostly interested in the design.   We’ve been given a list of some of the animals that will be  in the program, but not all. We know that each animal will  be represented by an object, and that the objects will move  around in the environment, doing whatever it is that each  particular type is programmed to do. And we want other programmers to be able to add new  kinds of animals to the program at any time. First we have to ﬁgure out the common, abstract  characteristics that all animals have, and build those  characteristics into a class that all animal classes can extend.  1 Look for objects that have common   attributes and behaviors.  What do these six types have in  common? This helps you to abstract  out behaviors.  step 2   How are these types related? This  helps you to deﬁne the inheritance  tree relationships  step 4-5   170  chapter 7   Using inheritance to avoid  duplicating code in subclasses We have ﬁ ve instance variables: picture – the ﬁ le name representing the JPEG of this animal food – the type of food this animal eats. Right now, there  can be only two values: meat or grass. hunger – an int representing the hunger level of the animal.  It changes depending on when  and how much  the  animal eats. boundaries – values representing the height and width of  the ‘space’  for example, 640 x 480  that the animals will  roam around in. location – the X and Y coordinates for where the animal is  in the space. We have four methods: makeNoise    – behavior for when the animal is supposed to  make noise. eat   – behavior for when the animal encounters its  preferred food source, meat or grass. sleep   – behavior for when the animal is considered asleep.  roam   – behavior for when the animal is not eating or  sleeping  probably just wandering around waiting to bump  into a food source or a boundary .  inheritance and polymorphism  2 Design a class that represents  the common state and behavior. These objects are all animals, so  we’ll make a common superclass  called Animal. We’ll put in methods and instance  variables that all animals might  need.  Animal  picture food hunger boundaries location  makeNoise   eat   sleep   roam    Lion  size picture food prey  Hippo  size picture food prey  Wolf  size picture food prey  Tiger  size picture food prey  Dog  size picture food prey  Cat  size picture food prey  you are here4 171   designing for inheritance   Do all animals eat the same way? Assume that we all agree on one thing: the instance  variables will work for all Animal types. A lion will  have his own value for picture, food  we’re thinking  meat , hunger, boundaries, and location. A hippo  will have different values for his instance variables,  but he’ll still have the same variables that the other  Animal types have. Same with dog, tiger, and so on.  But what about behavior?  Which methods should we override? Does a lion make the same noise as a dog? Does  a cat eat like a hippo? Maybe in your version, but  in ours, eating and making noise are Animal-type- speciﬁ c. We can’t ﬁ gure out how to code those  methods in such a way that they’d work for any  animal. OK, that’s not true. We could write the  makeNoise   method, for example, so that all it does  is play a sound ﬁ le deﬁ ned in an instance variable  for that type, but that’s not very specialized. Some  animals might make different noises  for different situations  like one  for eating, and another when  bumping into an enemy, etc.  So just as with the Amoeba  overriding the Shape class rotate    method, to get more amoeba-speciﬁ c  in  other words, unique  behavior, we’ll have  to do the same for our Animal subclasses.

Looking at the Animal class,  we decide that eat   and  makeNoise   should be overridden  by the individual subclasses.  In the dog   community, barking is an  important part of our cultural  identity. We have a unique sound,  and we want that diversity to  be recognized and respected.  We better override these two methods, eat    and makeNoise  , so that each animal type can  define its own specific behavior for eating and  making noise. For now, it looks like sleep   and  roam   can stay generic.   Looking for more inheritance  opportunities  The class hierarchy is starting to shape up. We  have each subclass override the makeNoise   and  eat   methods, so that there’s no mistaking a Dog  bark from a Cat meow  quite insulting to both  parties . And a Hippo won’t eat like a Lion.  But perhaps there’s more we can do. We have to  look at the subclasses of Animal, and see if two  or more can be grouped together in some way,  and given code that’s common to only that new  group.  Wolf and Dog have similarities. So do  Lion, Tiger, and Cat.  inheritance and polymorphism  4 Look for more opportunities to use  abstraction, by ﬁ nding two or more  subclasses that might need common  behavior.

We’ll use the biological  “families” to organize the animals by making a  Feline class and a Canine class. We decide that Canines could use a common  roam   method, because they tend to move in  packs. We also see that Felines could use a  common roam   method, because they tend to  avoid others of their own kind. We’ll let Hippo  continue to use its inherited roam   method— the generic one it gets from Animal.  So we’re done with the design for now; we’ll  come back to it later in the chapter.

The Wolf class has four methods. One  inherited from Animal, one inherited from  Canine  which is actually an overridden  version of a method in class Animal , and  two overridden in the Wolf class. When  you create a Wolf object and assign it to  a variable, you can use the dot operator  on that reference variable to invoke all  four methods. But which version of  those  methods gets called?  make a new Wolf object  Wolf w = new Wolf  ;  calls the version in Wolf  w.makeNoise  ;  calls the version in Canine  w.roam  ;  calls the version in Wolf  w.eat  ;  calls the version in Animal  w.sleep  ;  When you call a method on an object  reference, you’re calling the most speciﬁ c  version of the method for that object type.  In other words, the lowest one wins!  “Lowest” meaning lowest on the  inheritance tree. Canine is lower than  Animal, and Wolf is lower than Canine,  so invoking a method on a reference  to a Wolf object means the JVM starts  looking ﬁ rst in the Wolf class. If the JVM  doesn’t ﬁ nd a version of the method in  the Wolf class, it starts walking back up  the inheritance hierarchy until it ﬁ nds a  match.  inheritance and polymorphism  Animal  makeNoise   eat   sleep   roam    Canine  roam    Wolf  size size makeNoise   picture picture eat   food food prey prey  you are here4 175   practice designing an inheritance tree  Sharpen your pencil  Draw an inheritance diagram here.  there are no Dumb Questions Q: You said that the JVM starts   walking up the inheritance tree,  starting at the class type you invoked  the method on  like the Wolf example  on the previous page . But what  happens if the JVM doesn’t ever ﬁnd  a match?  176  chapter 7  A: Good question! But you don’t   have to worry about that. The compiler  guarantees that a particular method  is callable for a specific reference type,  but it doesn’t say  or care  from which  class that method actually comes from  at runtime. With the Wolf example, the  compiler checks for a sleep   method,  but doesn’t care that sleep   is actually  defined in  and inherited from  class  Animal. Remember that if a class  inherits a method, it has the method.   Where the inherited method is defined   in other words, in which superclass  it is defined  makes no difference to  the compiler. But at runtime, the JVM  will always pick the right one. And  the right one means, the most specific  version for that particular object.   Using IS-A and HAS-A Remember that when one class  inherits from another, we say that the  subclass extends the superclass. When  you want to know if one thing should  extend another, apply the IS-A test.  Triangle IS-A Shape, yeah, that works. Cat IS-A Feline, that works too. Surgeon IS-A Doctor, still good. Tub extends Bathroom, sounds  reasonable.  Until you apply the IS-A test.  To know if you’ve designed your types  correctly, ask, “Does it make sense to  say type X IS-A type Y?”  If it doesn’t,  you know there’s something wrong  with the design, so if we apply the IS      -A  test, Tub IS-A Bathroom is deﬁ nitely  false.  What if we reverse it to Bathroom  extends Tub?  That still doesn’t work,  Bathroom IS-A Tub doesn’t work. Tub and Bathroom are related, but  not through inheritance.  Tub and  Bathroom are joined by a HAS-A  relationship. Does it make sense to  say “Bathroom HAS-A Tub”?  If yes,  then it means that Bathroom has a  Tub instance variable. In other words,  Bathroom has a reference to a Tub, but  Bathroom does not extend Tub and  vice-versa.  Tub  int size; Bubbles b;  Bathroom Tub bathtub; Sink theSink;  Bubbles  int radius; int colorAmt;  Bathroom HAS-A Tub and Tub HAS-A Bubbles.  But nobody inherits from  extends  anybody else.  inheritance and polymorphism  Does  it  make  sense  to  say a Tub IS-A Bathroom? Or a   Bathroom IS-A Tub? Well it doesn’t to  me. The relationship between my Tub  and my Bathroom is HAS-A. Bathroom  HAS-A Tub. That means Bathroom   h a s a Tub instance variable.   you are here4 177   exploiting the power of objects   But wait! There’s more! The IS-A test works anywhere in the inheritance tree. If your  inheritance tree is well-designed, the IS-A test should make  sense when you ask any subclass if it IS-A any of its supertypes.  If class B extends class A, class B IS-A class A. This is true anywhere in the inheritance tree. If  class C extends class B, class C passes the IS-A  test for both B and A.  Canine extends Animal  Animal  Wolf extends Canine  Wolf extends Animal  makeNoise   eat   sleep   roam    Canine IS-A Animal  Wolf IS-A Canine  Wolf IS-A  Animal  With an inheritance tree like the  one shown here, you’re always  allowed to say “Wolf extends  Animal” or “Wolf IS-A Animal”.  It makes no difference if Animal  is the superclass of the superclass  of Wolf. In fact, as long as Animal  is somewhere in the inheritance  hierarchy above Wolf,  Wolf IS-A  Animal will always be true. The structure of the Animal  inheritance tree says to the world: “Wolf IS-A Canine, so Wolf can do  anything a Canine can do. And  Wolf IS-A Animal, so Wolf can do  anything an Animal can do.”  It makes no difference if Wolf  overrides some of the methods  in Animal or Canine. As far as  the world  of other code  is  concerned, a Wolf can do those  four methods. How he does them,  or in which class they’re overridden  makes no difference.  A Wolf can  makeNoise  , eat  , sleep  , and  roam   because a Wolf extends  from class Animal.  Canine  roam    Wolf  size size makeNoise   picture picture eat   food food prey prey  178  chapter 7   How do you know if you’ve got  How do you know if you’ve got  your inheritance right?  There’s obviously more to it than what we’ve  covered so far, but we’ll look at a lot more OO  issues in the next chapter  where we eventually  reﬁ ne and improve on some of the design work  we did in this chapter . For now, though, a good guideline is to use the  IS-A test. If “X IS-A Y” makes sense, both classes   X and Y  should probably live in the same   inheritance hierarchy. Chances are, they have  the same or overlapping behaviors. Keep in mind that the  inheritance IS-A relationship  works in only one direction! Triangle IS-A Shape makes sense, so you can  have Triangle extend Shape.  But the reverse—Shape IS-A Triangle—does  not make sense, so Shape should not extend  Triangle. Remember that the IS-A relationship  implies that if X IS-A Y, then X can do anything  a Y can do  and possibly more .   inheritance and polymorphism  i s n ’ t   t r u e .  i s - a   S h a p e ,  i t M a k e R o s e s   a r e   r e d , S q u a r e   R o s e s   a r e   r e d , i s - a   D r i n k , B e e r     y o u r   t u r n .

A:A superclass won’t necessarily   know about any of its subclasses.  You might write a class and much  later someone else comes along and  extends it. But even if the superclass  creator does know about  and wants  to use  a subclass version of a method,   there’s no sort of reverse or backwards  inheritance. Think about it, children  inherit from parents, not the other way  around.  Q: In a subclass, what if I want to   use BOTH the superclass version and  my overriding subclass version of a  method?  In other words,  I don’t want  to completely replace the superclass  version, I just want to add more stuff  to it.  A:You can do this! And it’s an   important design feature. Think of the  word “extends” as meaning, “I want  to extend the functionality of the  superclass”.    public void roam   {    super.roam  ;        my own roam stuff }  You can design your superclass  methods in such a way that they  contain method implementations  that will work for any subclass, even  though the subclasses may still need  to ‘append’ more code. In your subclass  overriding method, you can call the  superclass version using the keyword  super. It’s like saying, “first go run the  superclass version, then come back and  finish with my own code...”  this calls the inherited version of  roam  , then comes back to do  your own subclass-specific code  Who gets the Porsche, who gets the porcelain?  how to know what a subclass can  how to know what a subclass can  inherit from its superclass  inherit from it’s superclass   A subclass inherits members of the superclass. Members include instance variables and methods, although later in this book we’ll look at other inherited members. A superclass can choose whether or not it wants a subclass to inherit a particular member by the level of access the particular member is given.  There are four access levels that we’ll cover in this book. Moving from most restrictive to least, the four access levels are:  private  default  protected  public  180  chapter 7  Access levels control who sees what, and are crucial to having well-designed, robust Java code. For now we’ll focus just on public and private. The rules are simple for those two:  public members are inherited private members are not inherited  When a subclass inherits a member, it is as if the subclass defined the member itself. In the Shape example, Square inherited the rotate   and playSound   methods and to the outside world  other code  the Square class simply has a rotate   and playSound   method. The members of a class include the variables and methods defined in the class plus anything inherited from a superclass.  Note: get more details about default and protected in chapter  16  deployment  and appendix B.   When designing with inheritance, are you using or abusing?  Although some of the reasons behind these rules won’t be  revealed until later in this book, for now, simply knowing a  few rules will help you build a better inheritance design.  DO use inheritance when one class is a more speciﬁc type  of a superclass. Example: Willow is a more speciﬁc type of  Tree, so Willow extends Tree makes sense.  DO consider inheritance when you have behavior   implemented code  that should be shared among  multiple classes of the same general type. Example:  Square, Circle, and Triangle all need to rotate and play  sound, so putting that functionality in a superclass Shape  might make sense, and makes for easier maintenance and  extensibility. Be aware, however, that while inheritance is  one of the key features of object-oriented programming,  it’s not necessarily the best way to achieve behavior reuse.  It’ll get you started, and often it’s the right design choice,  but design patterns will help you see other more subtle  and ﬂexible options. If you don’t know about design  patterns, a good follow-on to this book would be Head First  Design Patterns.  DO NOT use inheritance just so that you can reuse  code from another class, if the relationship between the  superclass and subclass violate either of the above two  rules. For example, imagine you wrote special printing  code in the Alarm class and now you need printing code  in the Piano class, so you have Piano extend Alarm so that  Piano inherits the printing code. That makes no sense! A  Piano is not a more speciﬁc type of Alarm.  So the printing  code should be in a Printer class, that all printable objects  can take advantage of via a HAS-A relationship.   DO NOT use inheritance if the subclass and superclass  do not pass the IS-A test. Always ask yourself if the subclass  IS-A more speciﬁc type of the superclass. Example: Tea IS- A Beverage makes sense.  Beverage IS-A Tea does not.  inheritance and polymorphism   BULLET POINTS  ß  A subclass extends a superclass. ß  A subclass inherits all public instance   variables and methods of the superclass, but  does not inherit the private instance variables  and methods of the superclass.  ß   Inherited methods can be overridden; instance  variables cannot be overridden  although they  can be redefined in the subclass, but that’s  not the same thing, and there’s almost never a  need to do it.   ß  Use the IS-A test to verify that your   inheritance hierarchy is valid. If X extends Y,  then X IS-A Y must make sense.  ß  The IS-A relationship works in only one   direction. A Hippo is an Animal, but not all  Animals are Hippos.  ß  When a method is overridden in a subclass,  and that method is invoked on an instance of  the subclass, the overridden version of the  method is called.  The lowest one wins.   ß   If class B extends A, and C extends B,  class  B IS-A class A, and class C IS-A class B, and  class C also IS-A class A.  you are here4 181   1 You avoid duplicate   code. Put common code in one place, and let  the subclasses inherit that code from a  superclass. When you want to change that  behavior, you have to modify it in only  one place, and everybody else  i.e. all the  subclasses  see the change.  2 You deﬁne a common   protocol for a group of  classes.  Um, what   the heck does  THAT mean?  exploiting the power of objects   So what does all this  inheritance really buy you?  You get a lot of OO mileage by designing  with inheritance. You can get rid of duplicate  code by abstracting out the behavior common  to a group of classes, and sticking that code  in a superclass. That way, when you need to  modify it, you have only one place to update,  and the change is magically reﬂected in all the  classes that inherit that behavior. Well, there’s  no magic involved, but it is pretty simple:  make the change and compile the class  again. That’s it. You don’t have to touch the  subclasses! Just deliver the newly-changed superclass, and  all classes that extend it will automatically use  the new version. A Java program is nothing but a pile of classes,  so the subclasses don’t have to be recompiled  in order to use the new version of the  superclass. As long as the superclass doesn’t  break anything for the subclass, everything’s  ﬁne.  We’ll discuss what the word ‘break’  means in this context, later in the book. For  now, think of it as modifying something in  the superclass that the subclass is depending  on, like a particular method’s arguments or  return type, or method name, etc.   182  chapter 7   Inheritance lets you guarantee that  all classes grouped under a certain  supertype have all the methods that  the supertype has.*  In other words, you define a common protocol for a  set of classes related through inheritance.  When you deﬁ ne methods in a superclass, that can be  inherited by subclasses, you’re announcing a kind of  protocol to other code that says, “All my subtypes  i.e.  subclasses  can do these things, with these methods  that look like this...” In other words, you establish a contract.  Class Animal establishes a common protocol for all  Animal subtypes:  Animal  makeNoise   eat   sleep   roam    You’re telling the world that  any Animal can do these four  things. That includes the method  arguments and return types.   And remember, when we say any Animal, we mean  Animal and any class that extends from Animal. Which  again means, any class that has Animal somewhere above it  in the inheritance hierarchy. But we’re not even at the really cool part yet, because  we saved the best—polymorphism—for last. When you deﬁ ne a supertype for a group of classes,  any subclass of that supertype can be substituted where the  supertype is expected.  Say, what? Don’t worry, we’re nowhere near done explaining it.  Two pages from now, you’ll be an expert.  *When we say “all the methods” we mean “all the inheritable methods”, which  for now actually means, “all the public methods”, although later we’ll refine that  definition a bit more.  inheritance and polymorphism  And I care because...  Because you get to take advantage of  polymorphism.  Which matters to me  because...  Because   you get to refer to a subclass  object using a  reference declared as the  supertype.  And that means to me...  You get to write really ﬂ exible code.  Code that’s cleaner  more efﬁ cient,  simpler .  Code that’s not just easier to  develop, but also much, much easier to  extend, in ways you never imagined at  the time you originally wrote your code.  That means you can take that tropical  vacation while your co-workers update  the program, and your co-workers might  not even need your source code.  You’ll see how it works on the next page.   We don’t know about you, but  personally, we ﬁ nd the whole  tropical vacation thing  particularly motivating.  you are here4 183   the way polymorphism works  To see how polymorphism  works, we have to step back  and look at the way we  normally declare a reference  and create an object...  184  chapter 7  The 3 steps of object  declaration and assignment  1  3  2  Dog myDog = new Dog  ;  1 Declare a reference   variable  Dog myDog = new Dog  ;  Tells the JVM to allocate space for a  reference variable. The reference variable  is, forever, of type Dog. In other words,  a remote control that has buttons to  control a Dog, but not a Cat or a Button  or a Socket.   myDog  Dog  2 Create an object  Dog myDog = new Dog  ; Tells the JVM to allocate space for  a new Dog object on the garbage  collectible heap.  3 Link the object   and the reference  Dog myDog = new Dog  ; Assigns the new Dog to the refer- ence variable myDog. In other words,  program the remote control.  Dog object  Dog object  myDog  Dog   inheritance and polymorphism  The important point is that the  reference type AND the object  type are the same.   In this example, both are Dog.  myDog  Dog  Dog obj  e c t   These two are the same type. The reference  variable type is declared as Dog, and the object  is created as new Dog  .  But with polymorphism, the  reference and the object can  be different.  Animal myDog = new Dog  ;  myDog  Animal  Dog obj  e c t   These two are NOT the same type. The  reference variable type is declared as Animal,  but the object is created as new Dog  .  you are here4 185   polymorphism in action  With polymorphism, the reference  type can be a superclass of the  actual object type.  uh... nope.   Still not gettin’ it.  When you declare a reference variable,  any object that passes the IS-A test for the  declared type of the reference variable  can be assigned to that reference. In  other words, anything that extends the  declared reference variable type can  be assigned to the reference  variable. This lets you do  things like make polymorphic  arrays.  OK, OK maybe an example will help.  Animal[] animals = new Animal[5];  animals [0] = new Dog  ;  animals [1] = new Cat  ;  animals [2] = new Wolf  ;  animals [3] = new Hippo  ;  animals [4] = new Lion  ;  ,     r d s   w o r   A n i m a l.  o t h e e p    A n i m a l. e   c t s e o b j    n I   o f   t y  a  r  r    y a a   n   t h a t   w il  p o f   t y   h o l d   l  D e n a  c l a r a     e a     y  r r  But look what you get to do... you can put ANY  subclass of Animal in the Animal array!  And here’s the best polymorphic part  the  raison d’être for the whole example , you  get to loop through the array and call one  of the Animal-class methods, and every  object does the right thing!  for  int i = 0; i < animals.length; i++  {      animals[i].eat  ;      animals[i].roam  ;              }  When ‘i’ is 0, a Dog is at index 0 in the array, so  you get the Dog’s eat   method. When ‘i’ is 1, you  get the Cat’s eat   method Same with roam  .   186  chapter 7   inheritance and polymorphism  But wait! There’s more! You can have polymorphic  arguments and return types.  If you can declare a reference variable  of a supertype, say, Animal, and assign a  subclass object to it, say, Dog, think of how  that might work when the reference is an  argument to a method...  class Vet {  a     public void giveShot Animal a  {          do horrible things to the Animal at           the other end of the ‘a’ parameter       a.makeNoise  ;     }  }  The Animal parameter can take ANY  Animal type as the argument. And when  the Vet is done giving the shot, it tells the  Animal to makeNoise  , and whatever Animal  is really out there on the heap, that’s  whose makeNoise   method will run.  class PetOwner {     public void start   {      Vet v = new Vet  ;        Dog d = new Dog  ;  The Vet’s giveShot   method can take any  Animal you give it. As long as the object  you pass in as the argument is a subclass of  Animal, it will work.          Hippo h = new Hippo  ;         v.giveShot d ;         v.giveShot h ;  Dog’s makeNoise   runs Hippo’s makeNoise   runs    }  }  you are here4 187   exploiting the power of polymorphism  NOW I get it! If I write   my code using polymorphic arguments,   where I declare the method parameter as a   superclass type, I can pass in any subclass object at  runtime. Cool. Because that also means I can write my  code, go on vacation, and someone else can add new  subclass types to the program and my methods will  still work...  the only downside is I’m just making life   easier for that idiot Jim .  With polymorphism, you can write code that doesn’t  have to change when you introduce new subclass  types into the program.  Remember that Vet class? If you write that Vet class using  arguments declared as type Animal, your code can handle any  Animal subclass. That means if others want to take advantage of  your Vet class, all they have to do is make sure their new Animal  types extend class Animal. The Vet methods will still work, even  though the Vet class was written without any knowledge of the  new Animal subtypes the Vet will be working on.   A  brain power  Why is polymorphism guaranteed to work this way? Why is  it always safe to assume that any subclass type will have the  methods you think you’re calling on the superclass type  the  superclass reference type you’re using the dot operator on ?  188  chapter 7   there are no Dumb Questions Q: Are there any practical limits   on the levels of subclassing? How  deep can you go?  A: If you look in the Java API,   you’ll see that most inheritance  hierarchies are wide but not deep.  Most are no more than one or two  levels deep, although there are  exceptions  especially in the GUI  classes . You’ll come to realize that  it usually makes more sense to keep  your inheritance trees shallow, but  there isn’t a hard limit  well, not one  that you’d ever run into .  Q: Hey, I just thought of   something... if you don’t have  access to the source code for a class,  but you want to change the way a  method of that class works, could  you use subclassing to do that? To  extend the “bad” class and override  the method with your own better  code?  A: Yep. That’s one cool feature   of OO, and sometimes it saves you  from having to rewrite the class  from scratch, or track down the  programmer who hid the source code.   inheritance and polymorphism  Q: Can you extend any class? Or   is it like class members where if the  class is private you can’t inherit it...  A: There’s no such thing as a   private class, except in a very special  case called an inner class, that we  haven’t looked at yet. But there are  three things that can prevent a class  from being subclassed.   The first is access control. Even though  a class can’t be marked private, a  class can be non-public  what you  get if you don’t declare the class as  public . A non-public class can be  subclassed only by classes in the  same package as the class. Classes in  a different package won’t be able to  subclass  or even use, for that matter   the non-public class.  The second thing that stops a class  from being subclassed is the keyword  modifier ﬁnal. A final class means  that it’s the end of the inheritance  line. Nobody, ever, can extend a final  class.  The third issue is that if a class has  only private constructors  we’ll  look at constructors in chapter 9 , it  can’t be subclassed.   Q: Why would you ever want to   make a ﬁnal class? What advantage  would there be in preventing a class  from being subclassed?  A: Typically, you won’t make your   classes final. But if you need security  — the security of knowing that the  methods will always work the way  that you wrote them  because they  can’t be overridden ,  a final class  will give you that. A lot of classes in  the Java API are final for that reason.  The String class, for example, is final  because, well, imagine the havoc if  somebody came along and changed  the way Strings behave!  Q: Can you make a method ﬁnal,   without making the whole class  ﬁnal?   A: If you want to protect a specific   method from being overridden, mark  the method with the ﬁnalmodifier.  Mark the whole class as final if you  want to guarantee that none of the  methods in that class will ever be  overridden.  you are here4 189   overriding methods  Keeping the contract: rules for overriding  When you override a method from a superclass, you’re agreeing to  fulﬁ ll the contract. The contract that says, for example, “I take no  arguments and I return a boolean.” In other words, the arguments  and return types of your overriding method must look to the outside  world exactly like the overridden method in the superclass. The methods are the contract. If polymorphism is going to work, the   Toaster’s version of the  overridden method from Appliance has to work at runtime.  Remember, the compiler looks at the reference type to decide  whether you can call a particular method on that reference. With  an Appliance reference to a Toaster, the compiler cares only if class  Appliance has the method you’re invoking on an Appliance reference.  But at runtime, the JVM looks not at the reference type  Appliance  but  at the actual Toaster object on the heap. So if the compiler has already  approved the method call, the only way it can work is if the overriding  method has the same arguments and return types. Otherwise,  someone with an Appliance reference will call turnOn   as a no- arg method, even though there’s a version in Toaster that takes an  int. Which one is called at runtime? The one in Appliance. In other  words, the turnOn int level  method in Toaster is not an override!  1 Arguments must be the same, and return   types must be compatible. The contract of superclass deﬁ nes how other code can use a method.  Whatever the superclass takes as an argument, the subclass over- riding the method must use that same argument. And whatever the  superclass declares as a return type, the overriding method must de- clare either the same type, or a subclass type. Remember, a subclass  object is guaranteed to be able to do anything its superclass declares,  so it’s safe to return a subclass where the superclass is expected.  2 The method can’t be less accessible.  That means the access level must be the same, or friendlier. That  means you can’t, for example, override a public method and make  it private. What a shock that would be to the code invoking what it  thinks  at compile time  is a public method, if suddenly at runtime  the JVM slammed the door shut because the overriding version  called at runtime is private!  So far we’ve learned about two access levels: private and public.  The other two are in the deployment chapter  Release your Code   and appendix B. There’s also another rule about overriding related  to exception handling, but we’ll wait until the chapter on exceptions   Risky Behavior  to cover that.  190  chapter 7     N O T   L E G A L ! l e g a l   n o t   a   s I t ’ o v e r r i d e   b e c a u s e   y o u     s r e s t r i c t e d   t h e   a c c e s l e g a l   i t   a   .

Appliance  public boolean turnOn    public boolean turnOn    Toaster  private boolean turnOn     Overloading a method Method overloading is nothing more than having  two methods with the same name but different  argument lists. Period. There’s no polymorphism  involved with overloaded methods!  Overloading lets you make multiple versions  of a method, with different argument lists, for  convenience to the callers. For example, if you  have a method that takes only an int, the calling  code has to convert, say, a double into an int  before calling your method. But if you overloaded  the method with another version that takes a  double, then you’ve made things easier for the  caller. You’ll see more of this when we look into  constructors in the object lifecycle chapter. Since an overloading method isn’t trying to  fulﬁll the polymorphism contract deﬁned by its  superclass, overloaded methods have much more  ﬂexibility.   inheritance and polymorphism  An overloaded method is  just a different method that  happens to have the same  method name. It has nothing  to do with inheritance and  polymorphism. An overloaded  method is NOT the same as  an overridden method.  1 The return types can be   different. You’re free to change the return types in  overloaded methods, as long as the argument lists  are different.   Legal examples of method  overloading:  public class Overloads {     String uniqueID;  2 You can’t change ONLY the   return type. If only the return type is different, it’s not a  valid overload—the compiler will assume  you’re trying to override the method. And even  that won’t be legal unless the return type is  a subtype of the return type declared in the  superclass. To overload a method, you MUST  change the argument list, although you can  change the return type to anything.  3 You can vary the access   levels in any direction. You’re free to overload a method with a method  that’s more restrictive. It doesn’t matter, since the  new method isn’t obligated to fulﬁll the contract of  the overloaded method.     public int addNums int a, int b  {       return a + b;    }     public double addNums double a, double b  {        return a + b;    }     public void setUniqueID String theID  {          lots of validation code, and then:       uniqueID = theID;    }     public void setUniqueID int ssNumber  {       String numString = “” + ssNumber;       setUniqueID numString ;    } }  you are here4 191   exercise: Mixed Messages  Exercise  the program:      Mixed Messages        a = 6;       56       b = 5;      11     65       a = 5;   A short Java program is listed below.

To exploit polymorphism, we need interfaces    and not the GUI kind . We need to go beyond simple inheritance to a level of flexibility and   extensibility you can get only by designing and coding to interface specifications.  Some of the   coolest parts of Java wouldn’t even be possible without interfaces, so even if you don’t design   with them yourself, you still have to use them. But you’ll want to design with them. You’ll need   to design with them. You’ll wonder how you ever lived without them. What’s an interface? It’s   a 100% abstract class. What’s an abstract class? It’s a class that can’t be instantiated. What’s that   good for? You’ll see in just a few moments. But if you think about the end of the last chapter,   and how we used polymorphic arguments so that a single Vet method could take Animal   subclasses of all types, well, that was just scratching the surface. Interfaces are the poly in   polymorphism. The ab in abstract. The caffeine in Java.  this is a new chapter  197   designing with inheritance   Did we forget about something  when we designed this? The class structure isn’t too bad. We’ve designed  it so that duplicate code is kept to a minimum,  and we’ve overridden the methods that we think  should have subclass-speciﬁ c implementations.  We’ve made it nice and ﬂ exible from a  polymorphic perspective, because we can design  Animal-using programs with Animal arguments   and array declarations , so that any Animal  subtype—including those we never imagined at the  time we wrote our code—can be passed in and used  at runtime. We’ve put the common protocol for  all Animals  the four methods that we want the  world to know all Animals have  in the Animal  superclass, and we’re ready to start making new  Lions and Tigers and Hippos.

And we know we can say:  Animal aHippo = new Hippo  ;  Animal reference to  a Hippo object.  aHippo  Animal  Hippo ob j These two are NOT the same type.   e c t   But here’s where it gets weird:  Animal anim = new Animal  ;  Animal reference to  an Animal object.  anim  Animal  ?  Animal o b j e ct   These two are the same type, but... what the heck does an Animal object look like?  you are here4 199   when objects go bad   What does a new Animal   object  look like?  scary objects   What are the instance variable values?  Some classes just should not be  instantiated!   It makes sense to create a Wolf object or a Hippo  object or a Tiger object, but what exactly is an  Animal object? What shape is it? What color, size,  number of legs... Trying to create an object of type Animal is like a  nightmare Star Trek™ transporter accident. The  one where somewhere in the beam-me--up process  something bad happened to the buffer. But how do we deal with this? We need an Animal  class, for inheritance and polymorphism. But we  want programmers to instantiate only the less  abstract subclasses of class Animal, not Animal itself.  We want Tiger objects and Lion objects, not Animal  objects. Fortunately, there’s a simple way to prevent a class  from ever being instantiated. In other words, to stop  anyone from saying “new” on that type. By marking  the class as abstract, the compiler will stop any  code, anywhere, from ever creating an instance of  that type.   200  chapter 8  You can still use that abstract type as a reference type.  In fact,that’s a big part of why you have that       abstract  class in  the ﬁ rst place  to use it as a polymorphic  argument or return type, or to make a polymorphic  array .  When you’re designing your class inheritance  structure, you have to decide which classes are  abstract and which are concrete. Concrete classes are  those that are speciﬁ c enough to be instantiated. A  concrete class just means that it’s OK to make objects  of that type.  Making a class abstract is easy—put the keyword  abstract before the class declaration:  abstract class Canine extends Animal {    public void roam   { } }   interfaces and polymorphism  The compiler won’t let you instantiate  an abstract class  An abstract class means that nobody can ever make a new  instance of that class. You can still use that abstract class as a  declared reference type, for the purpose of polymorphism, but  you don’t have to worry about somebody making objects of that  type. The compiler guarantees it.    abstract public class Canine extends Animal  {     public void roam   { }  }  public class MakeCanine {     public void go   {        Canine c;         c = new Dog  ;        c = new Canine  ;         c.roam  ;      }  }  File  Edit   Window  Help  BeamMeUp  s     i g n     a s   r e f e r e n c e ,    b e c a u s e   y o u   c a n   a l w a y s s s u p e r c l a s   o b j e c t   t o   a     a b s t r a c t . s i   s s u p e r c l a s    O K , s i   s T h i s s u b c l a s a   i f   t h e   e v e n   class Canine is marked abstract, so the compiler will NOT let you do this.  % javac MakeCanine.java MakeCanine.java:5: Canine is abstract;  cannot be instantiated       c = new Canine  ;           ^ 1 error  An abstract class has virtually* no use, no value, no  purpose in life, unless it is extended.

In the Animal  inheritance tree, if we make  Animal, Canine, and Feline  abstract, that leaves Hippo, Wolf,  Dog, Tiger, Lion, and Cat as the  concrete subclasses.  Flip through the Java API and  you’ll ﬁ nd a lot of abstract classes,  especially in the GUI library. What  does a GUI Component look  like? The Component class is the  superclass of GUI-related classes  for things like buttons, text areas,  scrollbars, dialog boxes, you name  it. You don’t make an instance of  a generic Component and put it on  the screen, you make a JButton. In  other words, you instantiate only a  concrete subclass of Component, but  never Component itself.  A  brain power  Hmmmm... do I  feel like red or  white tonight?    Hmmmm... the Camelot  Vineyards 1997 Pinot   Noir was a pretty  decent  year...  abstract or concrete?  How do you know when a class should be  abstract? Wine is probably abstract. But  what  about Red and White? Again probably abstract   for some of us, anyway .  But at what point in the  hierarchy do things become concrete?   Do you make PinotNoir concrete, or is it abstract  too? It looks like the Camelot Vineyards 1997  Pinot Noir is probably concrete no matter what.   But how do you know for sure?  Look at the Animal inheritance tree above. Do the  choices we’ve made for which classes are abstract  and which are concrete seem appropriate?  Would you change anything about the Animal  inheritance tree  other than adding more Animals,  of course ?  202  chapter 8   interfaces and polymorphism  It really sucks to   be an abstract method.   You don’t have a body.  Abstract methods  Besides classes, you can mark methods abstract, too.  An abstract  class means the class must be extended; an abstract method means  the method must be overridden. You might decide that some  or all   behaviors in an abstract class don’t make any sense unless they’re  implemented by a more speciﬁc subclass. In other words, you can’t  think of any generic method implementation that could possibly be  useful for subclasses. What would a generic eat   method look like?  An abstract method has no body!  Because you’ve already decided there isn’t any code that would make  sense in the abstract method, you won’t put in a method body. So no  curly braces— just end the declaration with a semicolon.  public abstract void eat  ;  No method body !      End  it w ith a sem ico lon .  If you declare an abstract method, you MUST  mark the class abstract as well. You can’t have  an abstract method in a non-abstract class.  If you put even a single abstract method in a class, you have to  make the class abstract. But you can mix both abstract and non- abstract methods in the abstract class.  there are no Dumb Questions  Q: What is the point of an abstract method? I thought   the whole point of an abstract class was to have common  code that could be inherited by subclasses.  A: Inheritable method implementations  in other words,    methods with actual bodies  are A Good Thing to put in a  superclass. When it makes sense. And in an abstract class, it  often doesn’t make sense, because you can’t come up with  any generic code that subclasses would find useful. The  point of an abstract method is that even though you haven’t  put in any actual method code, you’ve still defined part of  the protocol for a group of subtypes  subclasses .  Q: Which is good because... A: Polymorphism! Remember, what you want is the   ability to use a superclass type  often abstract  as a method  argument, return type, or array type. That way, you get to  add new subtypes  like a new Animal subclass  to your  program without having to rewrite  or add  new methods  to deal with those new types. Imagine how you’d have to  change the Vet class, if it didn’t use Animal as its argument  type for methods. You’d have to have a separate method  for every single Animal subclass! One that takes a Lion, one  that takes a Wolf, one that takes a... you get the idea. So with  an abstract method, you’re saying, “All subtypes of this type  have THIS method.” for the benefit of polymorphism.  you are here4 203   you must implement abstract methods  You MUST implement all abstract methods    I have wonderful news,   mother. Joe ﬁnally implemented  all his abstract methods! Now  everything is working just the  way we planned...  Implementing an abstract  method is just like            overriding a method.  Abstract methods don’t have a body; they exist solely for polymorphism. That  means the ﬁrst concrete class in the inheritance tree must implement all abstract  methods. You can, however, pass the buck by being abstract yourself. If both Animal and  Canine are abstract, for example, and both have abstract methods, class Canine  does not have to implement the abstract methods from Animal. But as soon as we  get to the ﬁrst concrete subclass, like Dog, that subclass must implement all of the  abstract methods from both Animal and Canine.  But remember that an abstract class can have both abstract and non-abstract  methods, so Canine, for example, could implement an abstract method from  Animal, so that Dog didn’t have to. But if Canine says nothing about the abstract  methods from Animal, Dog has to implement all of Animal’s abstract methods.  When we say “you must implement the abstract method”, that means you must  provide a body. That means you must create a non-abstract method in your class  with the same method signature  name and arguments  and a return type that is  compatible with the declared return type of the abstract method. What you put in  that method is up to you. All Java cares about is that the method is there, in your  concrete subclass.  204  chapter 8   Sharpen your pencil  interfaces and polymorphism  Abstract vs. Concrete Classes Let’s put all this abstract rhetoric into some concrete use.  In the middle  column we’ve listed some classes.  Your job is to imagine applications  where the listed class might be concrete,  and applications where the listed  class might be abstract.  We took a shot at the ﬁrst few to get you going.  For example, class Tree would be abstract in a tree nursery program, where  differences between an Oak and an Aspen matter.

For the ﬁ rst pass, we’ll give it just an add   method. We’ll use  a simple Dog array  Dog []  to keep the added Dog objects, and give it a  length of 5. When we reach the limit of 5 Dog objects, you can still call the  add   method but it won’t do anything. If we’re not at the limit, the add    method puts the Dog in the array at the next available index   position, then  increments that next available index  nextIndex .  Building our own Dog-speciﬁ c list   Perhaps the world’s worst attempt at making our  own ArrayList kind of class, from scratch.   public class MyDogList {      private Dog [] dogs = new Dog[5];      private int nextIndex = 0;  U s e   a   p l a i n   o l d   D o g   a r r a y   b e h i n d   t h e   s c e n e s . We’ll increment this each  time a new Dog is added.  ve r sio n1  MyDogList  Dog[] dogs Dog[] dogs int nextIndex  add Dog d  add Dog d            public void add Dog d  {         if  nextIndex < dogs.length  {            dogs[nextIndex] = d;  If we’re not already at the limit  of the dogs array, add the Dog  and print a message.            System.out.println “Dog added at “ + nextIndex ;            nextIndex++;        increment, to give us the  next index to use         }     } }  206  chapter 8   interfaces and polymorphism  Uh-oh, now we need to keep Cats, too.  We have a few options here: 1  Make a separate class, MyCatList, to hold Cat objects. Pretty clunky. 2  Make a single class, DogAndCatList, that keeps two different arrays as instance  variables and has two different add   methods: addCat Cat c  and addDog Dog  d . Another clunky solution. 3  Make heterogeneous AnimalList class, that takes any kind of Animal subclass   since we know that if the spec changed to add Cats, sooner or later we’ll have  some other kind of animal added as well . We like this option best, so let’s change  our class to make it more generic, to take Animals instead of just Dogs. We’ve  highlighted the key changes  the logic is the same, of course, but the type has  changed from Dog to Animal everywhere in the code.

Why not make  a class generic enough to take anything?  You know where this is heading. We want to change the  type of the array, along with the add   method argument, to  something above Animal.  Something even more generic, more  abstract than Animal. But how can we do it? We don’t have a  superclass for Animal. Then again, maybe we do... Remember those methods of ArrayList?  Look how the remove, contains, and  indexOf method all use an object of type...  Object!  Every class in Java extends  class Object.   Class Object is the mother of all classes; it’s  the superclass of everything. Even if you take advantage of polymorphism,  you still have to create a class with methods  that take and   return your polymorphic type.  Without a common superclass for everything  in Java, there’d be no way for the developers  of Java to create classes with methods that  could take your custom types... types they never  knew about when they wrote the ArrayList class. So you were making subclasses of class Object  from the very beginning and you didn’t even  know it. Every class you write extends Object,  without your ever having to say it. But you can  think of it as though a class you write looks like  this: public class Dog extends Object { } But wait a minute, Dog already extends something, Canine.  That’s OK. The compiler will make Canine extend Object  instead. Except Canine extends Animal. No problem, then the  compiler will just make Animal extend Object.   Any class that doesn’t explicitly extend another  class, implicitly extends Object. So, since Dog extends Canine, it doesn’t directly extend Object   although it does extend it indirectly , and the same is true  for Canine, but Animal does directly extend Object. 208  chapter 8       m o re    T h e s e   a r e   j u s t   a   f e w   o f   t h e   . t h e r e   m e t h o d s   i n   A r r a y L i s t . a r e   m a n y   m o r e .      .  ve r sio n3  Ar ray L i s t  b o o l e a n   rem ove   O b j e c t   e l em   R e m o v e s   t h e   o b j e c t   a t   t h e   i n d e x   p a r a m e t e r.

Many of the ArrayList methods use the  ultimate polymorphic type, Object. Since  every class in Java is a subclass of Object,  these ArrayList methods can take anything !  Note: as of Java 5.0, the get   and add    ittle different  methods actual than the ones shown here, but for now this  l get into  is the way to think about it. We’ the ful  ittle later.   l story a l  ly look a l  l   interfaces and polymorphism  So what’s in this ultra-super-megaclass Object?  If you were Java, what behavior would you want every  object to have? Hmmmm... let’s see... how about a  method that lets you ﬁ nd out if one object is equal  to another object? What about a method that can  tell you the actual class type of that object? Maybe a  method that gives you a hashcode for the object, so  you can use the object in hashtables  we’ll talk about  Java’s hashtables in chapter 17 and appendix B .  Oh, here’s a good one—a method that prints out a  String message for that object.   And what do you know? As if by magic, class Object  does indeed have methods for those four things.

A: No. Well, not in the formal   Java sense anyway. Object is a  non-abstract class because it’s  got method implementation  code that all classes can inherit  and use out-of-the-box, without  having to override the methods.  the methods in Object?   Q: Then can you override  A: Some of them. But some of   them are marked ﬁnal, which  means you can’t override them.   You’re encouraged  strongly  to  override hashCode  , equals  ,  and toString   in your own  classes, and you’ll learn how to  do that a little later in the book.  But some of the methods, like  getClass  , do things that must  work in a specific, guaranteed  way.   Q: If ArrayList methods are   generic enough to use Object,  then what does it mean to say  ArrayList ? I thought  I was restricting the ArrayList to  hold only DotCom objects?  A: You were restricting it.   Prior to Java 5.0, ArrayLists  couldn’t be restricted. They  were all essentially what you  get in Java 5.0 today if you write  ArrayList . In other  words, an ArrayList restricted  to anything that’s an Object,  which means any object in Java,  instantiated from any class type!  We’ll cover the details of this new    syntax later in the book.  210  chapter 8  Q: OK, back to class Object   being non-abstract  so I guess  that means it’s concrete , HOW  can you let somebody make an  Object object? Isn’t that just  as weird as making an Animal  object?   A: Good question! Why is   it acceptable to  make a new  Object instance? Because  sometimes you just want a  generic object to use as, well, as  an object. A lightweight object. By far, the most common use of  an instance of type Object is for   thread synchronization  which  you’ll learn about in chapter 15 .  For now, just stick that on the  back burner and assume that  you will rarely make objects of  type Object, even though you  can.  Q: So is it fair to say that the   main purpose for type Object  is so that you can use it for a  polymorphic argument and  return type?  Like in ArrayList?   A: The Object class serves   two main purposes: to act as a  polymorphic type for methods  that need to work on any class  that you or anyone else makes,  and to provide real method code  that all objects in Java need at  runtime  and putting them in  class Object means all other  classes inherit them . Some of  the most important methods in  Object are related to threads,  and we’ll see those later in the  book.  Q: If it’s so good to use   polymorphic types, why  don’t you just make ALL your  methods take and return type  Object?  A: Ahhhh... think about what   would happen.  For one thing,  you would defeat the whole  point of  ‘type-safety’, one  of Java’s greatest protection  mechanisms for your code. With  type-safety, Java guarantees that  you won’t ask the wrong object  to do something you meant to  ask of another object type. Like,  ask a Ferrari  which you think is a  Toaster  to cook itself. But the truth is, you don’t have  to worry about that fiery Ferrari  scenario, even if you do use  Object references for everything.  Because when objects are  referred to by an Object  reference type, Java thinks it’s  referring to an instance of type  Object. And that means the  only methods you’re allowed to  call on that object are the ones  declared in class Object! So if  you were to say:  Object o = new Ferrari  ; o.goFast  ;   Not legal!  You wouldn’t even make it past  the compiler.  Because Java is a strongly-typed  language, the compiler checks  to make sure that you’re calling  a method on an object that’s  actually capable of responding.  In other words, you can call a  method on an object reference  only if the class of the reference  type actually has the method.  We’ll cover this in much greater  detail a little later, so don’t worry  if the picture isn’t crystal clear.   interfaces and polymorphism  Using polymorphic  references of type Object has a price...  Before you run off and start using type Object for all your ultra-ﬂ exible argument and return  types, you need to consider a little issue of using type Object as a reference. And keep in mind  that we’re not talking about making instances of type Object; we’re talking about making  instances of some other type, but using a reference of type Object. When you put an object into an ArrayList ,  it goes in as a Dog, and comes out as a Dog:  ArrayList  myDogArrayList = new ArrayList   ;  Dog aDog = new Dog  ;  myDogArrayList.add aDog ;  Make a Dog.  Add the Dog to the list.  Dog d = myDogArrayList.get 0 ;  Assign the Dog from the list to a new Dog reference variable.   Think of it as though the get   method declares a Dog return  type because you used ArrayList .   But what happens when you declare it as   ArrayList ? If you want to make an ArrayList  that will literally take any kind of Object, you declare it like this:  Make an ArrayList declared  to hold Dog objects.  Make an ArrayList declared  to hold any type of Object.  ArrayList  myDogArrayList = new ArrayList   ; Dog aDog = new Dog  ;  Make a Dog.   These two steps are the same.   myDogArrayList.add aDog ;  Add the Dog to the list.  But what happens when you try to get the Dog object and assign it to a Dog reference?  Dog d = myDogArrayList.get 0 ; Dog d = myDogArrayList.get 0 ; Dog d = myDogArrayList.get 0 ; Dog d = myDogArrayList.get 0 ; Dog d = myDogArrayList.get 0 ;  NO!! Won’t compile!! When you use ArrayList , the get   method  returns type Object. The Compiler knows only that the object inherits from  Object  somewhere in its inheritance tree  but it doesn’t know it’s a Dog!!  Everything comes out of an ArrayList  as a reference of type Object, regardless of what the  actual object is, or what the reference type was when you added the object to the list.  The objects go IN  as SoccerBall,  Fish, Guitar, and  Car.  But they come  OUT as though  they were of type  Object.  ArrayList   Object  Object  Object  Object  Objects come out of  an ArrayList   acting like they’re  generic instances  of class Object. The  Compiler cannot  assume the object  that comes out is of  any type other than  Object.  you are here4 211   When a Dog loses its Dogness  When a Dog won’t act like a Dog  The problem with having everything treated  polymorphically as an Object is that the objects  appear to lose  but not permanently  their  true essence. The Dog appears to lose its dogness.  Let’s see what happens when we pass a Dog to  a method that returns a reference to the same  Dog object, but declares the return type as type  Object rather than Dog.  I don’t know what you’re  talking about. Sit? Stay?  bark? Hmmmm... I don’t  recall knowing those.    public void go   {      Dog aDog = new Dog  ;      Dog sameDog = getObject aDog ;      Dog sameDog = getObject aDog ;      Dog sameDog = getObject aDog ;      Dog sameDog = getObject aDog ;      Dog sameDog = getObject aDog ;   }  BAD L  l  i n e    m e t h o d   e n   t h o u g h   t h e   D o g   t h e   E v   w o n ’ t   w o r k ! s a m e e r y   v     t o   t h e e c t       O b j s T h i r e t u r n e d   a   r e f e r e n c e   r e t u r n   t y p e   r e t u r n e d     t h e i g n   t h e a r g u m e n t   r e f e r r e d   t o , s   a s l e t   y o u l e r   w o n ’ t     c o m p i e c t .   t o   a n y t h i n g   b u t   O b j   t h e m e a n s r e f e r e n c e       public Object getObject Object o  {      return o;   }  We’re returning a reference to the same Dog, but as a  return type of Object. This part is perfectly legal. Note:  this is similar to how the get   method works when you have  an ArrayList  rather than an  ArrayList .

So you have an Object  reference to  in this case  a Dog instance.       a  c  s  s  s e .

The Object class has no idea what  it means to bark  . Even though YOU know it’s  really a Dog at that index, the compiler doesn’t..  hashCode    Objects don’t bark.  So now we know that when an object is  referenced by a variable declared as type  Object, it can’t be assigned to a variable  declared with the actual object’s type.  And we know that this can happen when  a return type or argument is declared  as type Object, as would be the case,  for example, when the object is put  into an ArrayList of type Object using  ArrayList . But what are the  implications of this? Is it a problem to   have to use an Object reference variable  to refer to a Dog object? Let’s try to call  Dog methods on our Dog-That-Compiler- Thinks-Is-An-Object:  Object o = al.get index ;  int i = o.hashCode  ;  W o n ’ t   c o m p i  l e !  o.bark  ;  o.bark  ;  o.bark  ;  o.bark  ;  o.bark  ;   The compiler decides whether  you can call a method based  on the reference type, not the  actual object type.  Even if you know the object is capable   “...but it really is a Dog, honest...” , the  compiler sees it only as a generic Object.  For all the compiler knows, you put a  Button object out there. Or a Microwave  object. Or some other thing that really  doesn’t know how to bark. The compiler checks the class of the  reference type—not the object type—to  see if you can call a method using that  reference.      o  Object  Object  equals   getClass   hashCode   toString       Dog ob j  e c t  The method you’re calling on a  reference MUST be in the class of  that reference type. Doesn’t matter  what the actual object is.  o.hashCode  ; The “o” reference was declared as type  Object, so you can call methods only if  those methods are in class Object..  you are here4 213   objects are Objects  He treats me like an  Object. But I can do so  much more...if only he’d see  me for what I really am.  Get in touch with    your inner Object. An object contains everything it inherits from each of its  superclasses. That means every object—regardless of its  actual class type—is also an instance of class Object.That  means any object in Java can be treated not just as a Dog,  Button, or Snowboard, but also as an Object. When you  say new Snowboard  , you get a single object on the  heap—a Snowboard object—but that Snowboard wraps  itself around an inner core representing the Object   capital “O”  portion of itself.  A single object  on the heap.  Snowboard inherits methods  from superclass Object, and  adds four more.  shred   toStrin  e  q  u  a  ls    g  e  t  A  ir    turn         hash  g  C  o  d  e        Object  g e t C l ass    l o s e C ontrol    Snowboard Snowboar d   o b j e  ct  There is only ONE object on the heap here.

You can treat a Snowboard as a  Snowboard or as an Object.  If a reference is like a remote control, the  remote control takes on more and more buttons  as you move down the inheritance tree. A  remote control  reference  of type Object has  only a few buttons—the buttons for the exposed  methods of class Object. But a remote control  of type Snowboard includes all the buttons from  class Object, plus any new buttons  for new  methods  of class Snowboard. The more speciﬁc  the class, the more buttons it may have.  Of course that’s not always true; a subclass might  not add any new methods, but simply override  the methods of its superclass. The key point is  that even if the object is of type Snowboard, an  Object reference to the Snowboard object can’t see  the Snowboard-speciﬁc methods.  Snowboard s = new Snowboard  ; Object o = s;  interfaces and polymorphism  When you put  an object in an  ArrayList , you  can treat it only as an  Object, regardless of  the type it was when  you put it in.  When you get a  reference from an  ArrayList , the  reference is always of  type Object.

It has fewer buttons than the  Snowboard remote control.  you are here4 215   casting objects  Wait a minute... what good   is a Dog if it comes out of an  ArrayList  and it can’t do  any Dog things? There’s gotta be a  way to get the Dog back to a state   of Dogness...  Casting an object reference  back to its real type.  I hope it doesn’t hurt.  And what’s so wrong with   staying an Object? OK, I can’t  fetch, sure, but I can give you   a real nice hashcode.      o  Object     Dog ob j  e c t  It’s really still a Dog object, but if you want to call  Dog-speciﬁc methods, you need a reference declared  as type Dog.  If you’re sure* the object is really a  Dog, you can make a new Dog reference to it by  copying the Object reference, and forcing that  copy to go into a Dog reference variable, using a  cast   Dog . You can use the new Dog reference to  call Dog methods.  Object o = al.get index ; Dog d =  Dog  o; d.roam  ;  c a s t   t h e   O b j e c t   b a c k   t o   a   D o g   w e   k n o w   i s   t h e r e .      o  Object     Dog ob j  e c t  *If you’re not sure it’s a Dog, you can use the  instanceof operator to check. Because if  you’re wrong when you do the cast, you’ll get a  ClassCastException at runtime and come to a  grinding halt.    if  o instanceof Dog  {       Dog d =  Dog  o;    }  Cast the so-called ‘Object’  but  we know he’s actually a Dog  to  type Dog, so that you can treat  him like the Dog he really is.  d  Dog  216  chapter 8   interfaces and polymorphism  So now you’ve seen how much Java  cares about the methods in the  class of the reference variable.  You can call a method on an object only if  the class of the reference variable has that  method.  Think of the public methods in your class as  your contract, your promise to the outside  world about the things you can do.  Account  debit double amt   credit double amt   double getBalance    When you write a class, you almost always expose some  of the methods to code outside the class. To expose a  method means you make a method accessible, usually by  marking it public.  Imagine this scenario: you’re writing code for a small  business accounting program. A custom application  business accounting program. A custom application  for “Simon’s Surf Shop”. The good re- user that you are, you found an Account  class that appears to meet your needs  perfectly, according to its documentation,  anyway. Each account instance represents  an individual customer’s account with the  store. So there you are minding your own  business invoking the credit   and debit    methods on an account object when you realize you  need to get a balance on an account. No problem— there’s a getBalance   method that should do nicely. Except... when you invoke the getBalance   method,  the whole thing blows up at runtime. Forget the  documentation, the class does not have that method.  Yikes! But that won’t happen to you, because everytime you  use the dot operator on a reference  a.doStuff   , the  compiler looks at the reference type  the type ‘a’ was  declared to be  and checks that class to guarantee the  class has the method, and that the method does indeed  take the argument you’re passing and return the kind of  value you’re expecting to get back.  Just remember that the compiler checks the class of the  reference variable, not the class of the actual object at the  other end of the reference.  you are here4 217   modifying a class tree  What if you need to change  the contract?  OK, pretend you’re a Dog. Your Dog class  isn’t the only contract that deﬁnes who you  are. Remember, you inherit accessible  which  usually means public  methods from all of  your superclasses.  True, your Dog class deﬁnes a contract.  But not all of your contract. Everything in class Canine is part of your  contract.  Everything in class Animal is part of your  contract. Everything in class Object is part of your  contract. According to the IS-A test, you are each of  those things—Canine, Animal, and Object. But what if the person who designed your  class had in mind the Animal simulation  program, and now he wants to use you  class  Dog  for a Science Fair Tutorial on Animal  objects.  That’s OK, you’re probably reusable for that. But what if later he wants to use you for a  PetShop program? You don’t have any Pet  behaviors. A Pet needs methods like beFriendly    and play  . OK, now pretend you’re the Dog class  programmer. No problem, right? Just add  some more methods to the Dog class. You  won’t be breaking anyone else’s code by  adding methods, since you aren’t touching  the existing methods that someone else’s code  might be calling on Dog objects. Can you see any drawbacks to that approach   adding Pet methods to the Dog class ?  218  chapter 8  A  brain power  Think about what YOU would do if YOU were  the Dog class programmer and needed to  modify the Dog so that it could do Pet things,  too. We know that simply adding new Pet be- haviors  methods  to the Dog class will work,  and won’t break anyone else’s code.  But... this is a PetShop program. It has more  than just Dogs!  And what if someone wants  to use your Dog class for a program that has  wild Dogs? What do you think your options  might be, and without worrying about how  Java handles things, just try to imagine how  you’d like to solve the problem of modifying  some of your Animal classes to include Pet  behaviors.  Stop right now and think about it,               before you look at the next page where we  begin to reveal everything.   thus rendering the whole exercise completely useless, robbing   you of your One Big Chance to burn some brain calories     Let’s explore some design options  for reusing some of our existing  classes in a PetShop program. On the next few pages, we’re going to walk through  some possibilities. We’re not yet worried about  whether Java can actually do what we come up with.  We’ll cross that bridge once we have a   good idea of  some of the tradeoffs.  1 Option one  We take the easy path, and put pet  methods in class Animal.   Pros: All the Animals will instantly inherit  the pet behaviors. We won’t have to  touch the existing Animal subclasses  at all, and any Animal subclasses  created in the future will also get to  take advantage of inheriting those   methods. That way, class Animal can  be used as the polymorphic type in  any program that wants to treat the  Animals as pets  Cons: So... when was the last time you  saw a Hippo at a pet shop? Lion?  Wolf? Could be dangerous to give  non-pets pet methods.   Also, we almost certainly WILL  have to touch the pet classes  like Dog and Cat, because  in  our house, anyway  Dogs  and Cats tend to imple- ment pet behaviors  VERY differently.

Pros: That would give us all the beneﬁ ts of Option One, but with- out the drawback of having non-pet Animals running around  with pet methods  like beFriendly   . All Animal classes  would have the method  because it’s in class Animal , but  because it’s abstract the non-pet Animal classes won’t  inherit any functionality. All classes MUST override the  methods, but they can make the methods “do-nothings”.  Cons: Because the pet methods in the Animal class are all  abstract, the concrete Animal subclasses are forced to  implement all of them.  Remember, all abstract methods  MUST be implemented by the ﬁ rst concrete subclass  down the inheritance tree.  What a waste of time!  You have to sit there and type in each and every  pet method into each and every concrete non- pet class, and all future subclasses as well.  And while this does solve the problem of  non-pets actually DOING pet things   as they would if they inherited pet  functionality from class Animal , the  contract is bad. Every non-pet  class would be announcing to the  world that it, too, has those  pet methods, even though  the methods wouldn’t  actually DO anything  when called.  Lion  Cat  Feline  This approach doesn’t  look good at all. It just  seems wrong to stuff  everything into class Animal  that more than one Animal type  might need, UNLESS it applies to  ALL Animal subclasses.  220  chapter 8  p  o h t e m t   e e   p o   h   n h t   all  t w i t t   u u n s.

I have the method.   3 Option three  Put the pet methods ONLY in the  classes where they belong.  Pros: No more worries about Hippos greeting you at the  door or licking your face. The methods are where  they belong, and ONLY where they belong. Dogs can  implement the methods and Cats can implement the  methods, but nobody else has to know about them.  Cons: Two Big Problems with this approach. First off, you’d  have to agree to a protocol, and all programmers of  pet Animal classes now and in the future would have  to KNOW about the protocol. By protocol, we mean  the exact methods that we’ve decided all pets should  have. The pet contract without anything to back it up.  But what if one of the programmers gets it just a tiny  bit wrong? Like, a method takes a String when it was  supposed to take an int? Or they named it doFriendly    instead of beFriendly  ? Since it isn’t in a contract,  the compiler has no way to check you to see if you’ve  implemented the methods correctly. Someone  could easily come along to use the pet Animal  classes and ﬁ nd that not all of them work  quite right.  Feline  And second, you don’t get to use  polymorphism for the pet methods.  Every class that needs to use  pet behaviors would have to  know about each and every  class! In other words,  you can’t use Animal  as the polymorphic  type now, because the  compiler won’t let you call  a Pet method on an Animal  reference  even if it’s really a  Dog object  because class Animal  doesn’t have the method.

So what we REALLY need is: Æ  A way to have pet behavior in just the pet classes Æ  A way to guarantee that all pet classes have all of the same   methods defined  same name, same arguments, same return  types, no missing methods, etc. , without having to cross your  fingers and hope all the programmers get it right.  Æ  A way to take advantage of polymorphism so that all pets can have   their pet methods called, without having to use arguments, return  types, and arrays for each and every pet class.

It’s called “multiple inheritance”     and it can be a Really Bad Thing.  That is, if it were possible to do in Java.   But it isn’t, because multiple inheritance has a problem   known as The Deadly Diamond of    Death.

A language that allows the Deadly Diamond of Death can lead to  some ugly complexities, because you have to have special rules to  deal with the potential ambiguities. And extra rules means extra  work for you both in learning those rules and watching out for  those “special cases”. Java is supposed to be simple, with consistent  rules that don’t blow up under some scenarios. So Java  unlike  C++  protects you from having to think about the Deadly Dia- mond of Death. But that brings us back to the original problem!  How do we handle the Animal Pet thing?  you are here4 223   interfaces   Interface to the rescue! Java gives you a solution. An interface. Not a GUI interface, not the generic  use of the word interface as in, “That’s the public interface for the Button  class API,” but the Java keyword interface. A Java interface solves your multiple inheritance problem by giving you  much of the polymorphic beneﬁ ts of multiple inheritance without the pain  and suffering from the Deadly Diamond of Death  DDD . The way in which interfaces side-step the DDD is surprisingly simple: make  all the methods abstract! That way, the subclass must implement the methods   remember, abstract methods must be implemented by the ﬁ rst concrete  subclass , so at runtime the JVM isn’t confused about which of the   two  inherited versions it’s supposed to call.  Pet  abstract void beFriendly  ;  abstract void play  ;  A Java interface is like a  100% pure abstract class.  i n t e r f a c e   a r e   i n   a n       m e t h o d s I S - A     t h a t   l A l s s o   a n y   c l a s . e .   o v e r r i d e   a b s t r a c t ,   i   i m p l e m e n t   P e t   M U S T     o f   P e t .   t h e   m e t h o d s     To DEFINE an interface:  public interface Pet {...}  Use the keyword “interface”  instead of “class”  To IMPLEMENT an interface:  public class Dog extends Canine implements Pet {...}  l o w e d   U s e   t h e   k e y w o r d   “ i m p l e m e n t s ”   f o l b y   t h e   i n t e r f a c e   n a m e .

You SAID you are a Pet, so you MUST  implement the Pet methods. It’s your  contract. Notice the curly braces  instead of semicolons.  public class Dog extends Canine implements Pet {     public void beFriendly   {...}     public void play   {..}     public void roam   {...}     public void eat   {...}  }  These are just normal  overriding methods.    there are no Dumb Questions Q:Wait a minute, interfaces don’t   really give you multiple inheritance,  because you can’t put any  implementation code in them. If all  the methods are abstract, what does  an interface really buy you?  A:Polymorphism, polymorphism,   polymorphism. Interfaces are the  ultimate in flexibility, because if you  use interfaces instead of concrete  subclasses  or even abstract superclass  types  as arguments and return   types, you can pass anything that  implements that interface. And think  about it—with an interface, a class  doesn’t have to come from just one  inheritance tree. A class can extend  one class, and implement an interface.  But another class might implement  the same interface, yet come from a  completely different inheritance tree!  So you get to treat an object by the  role it plays, rather than by the class  type from which it was instantiated.  In fact, if you wrote your code to use  interfaces, you wouldn’t even have to  give anyone a superclass that they had   to extend. You could just give them  the interface and say, “Here,’ I don’t  care what kind of class inheritance  structure you come from, just  implement this interface and you’ll be  good to go.”  The fact that you can’t put in  implementation code turns out not to  be a problem for most good designs,  because most interface methods  wouldn’t make sense if implemented  in a generic way. In other words, most  interface methods would need to  be overridden even if the methods  weren’t forced to be abstract.  you are here4 225   interface polymorphism  Robot  Classes from different inheritance trees  can implement the same interface.  Agent  RoboDog  Class RoboDog doesn’t  come from the Animal  inheritance tree, but it still  gets to be a Pet!   Pet  Animal  Canine  Hippo  Dog  Feline  Tiger  Cat  Lion  Wolf  When you use a class as a polymorphic type  like an  array of type Animal or a method that takes a Canine  argument , the objects you can stick in that type  must be from the same inheritance tree. But not just  anywhere in the inheritance tree; the objects must be  from a class that is a subclass of the polymorphic type.  An argument of type Canine can accept a Wolf and a  Dog, but not a Cat or a Hippo.  But when you use an interface as a polymorphic  type  like an array of Pets , the objects can be  from anywhere in the inheritance tree. The only  requirement is that the objects are from a class that  implements the interface. Allowing classes in different  inheritance trees to implement a common interface  is crucial in the Java API. Do you want an object  to be able to save its state to a ﬁ le? Implement the  Serializable interface. Do you need objects to run   their methods in a separate thread of  execution?  Implement Runnable.  You get the idea. You’ll  learn more about Serializable and Runnable in later  chapters, but for now, remember that classes from  any place in the inheritance tree might need to  implement those interfaces. Nearly any class might  want to be saveable or runnable. Better still, a class can implement   multiple interfaces! A Dog object IS-A Canine, and IS-A Animal, and  IS-A Object, all through inheritance. But a Dog IS-A  Pet through interface implementation, and the Dog  might implement other interfaces as well. You could  say: public class Dog extends Animal implements  Pet, Saveable, Paintable { ... }  226  chapter 8   interfaces and polymorphism    b u t    i m p l e m e n t   t w o .

How do you know whether to make a  class, a subclass, an abstract  class, or  an interface?  $  Make a class that doesn’t extend anything    other than Object  when your new class doesn’t  pass the IS-A test for any other type.  $  Make a subclass  in other words, extend a class   only when you need to make a more speciﬁ c  version of a class and need to override or add  new behaviors.  $  Use an abstract class when you want to deﬁ ne  a template for a group of subclasses, and you  have at least some implementation code that all  subclasses could use. Make the class abstract  when you want to guarantee that nobody can  make objects of that type.  $  Use an interface when you want to deﬁ ne a role  that other classes can play, regardless of where  those classes are in the inheritance tree.   you are here4 227   using super  Invoking the superclass  version of a method  Q: What if you make a concrete subclass   and you need to override a method, but you  want the behavior in the superclass version of  the method? In other words, what if you don’t  need to replace the method with an override,  but you just want to add to it with some  additional speciﬁc code.  A:  Ahhh... think about the meaning of the   word ‘extends’. One area of good OO design looks  at how to design concrete code that’s meant to  be overridden. In other words, you write method  code in, say, an abstract class, that does work  that’s generic enough to support typical concrete  implementations. But, the concrete code isn’t  enough to handle all of the subclass-specific  work. So the subclass overrides the method  and extends it by adding the rest of the code.  The keyword super lets you invoke a superclass  version of an overridden method, from within the  subclass.  If method code inside a  BuzzwordReport subclass says:  super.runReport  ;  the runReport   method inside  the superclass Report will run  super.runReport  ; A reference to the subclass object   BuzzwordReport  will always call  the subclass version of an overridden  method. That’s polymorphism.  But the subclass code can call  super.runReport   to invoke the  superclass version.  228  chapter 8  s  r e v   s c l a s r e p u s e m e t h o d   d o u b c l a s s t h a t    o f   t h e r t a n t   s u l d   u o    s t u f f   e  s  n i o i m p   s e     s    o c  abstract class Report {     void runReport   {            set-up report                            }     void printReport   {           generic printing     } }  class BuzzwordsReport extends Report {          void runReport   {         super.runReport  ;                 buzzwordCompliance  ;         printReport  ;     i o n , v e r s   s u p e r c l a s s   l c a l t h e n   c o m e   b a c k   a n d   s - u b c l a s s s o m e   d o   s t u f f s p e c i f i c        }     void buzzwordCompliance   {...} }  s  u t  b h  l    c e  a s     s  i d e  r  r  e  v  o r     h  o d   v   s  t l  s  s  s     e  n  i  o  a    m e s c r e p u superclass methods   including the overridden  runReport    runReport    buzzwordCompliance    runReport   printReport    Report  BuzzwordReport  The super keyword is really a reference  to the superclass portion of an object.  When subclass code uses super, as in  super.runReport  , the superclass version of  the method will run.     BULLET POINTS  $  When you don’t want a class to be instantiated  in other words, you don’t   want anyone to make a new object of that class type  mark the class with the  abstract keyword.  If a class has even one abstract method, the class must be marked abstract.  $  An abstract class can have both abstract and non-abstract methods. $  $  An abstract method has no body, and the declaration ends with a semicolon  no   curly braces .  $  All abstract methods must be implemented in the first concrete subclass in the   inheritance tree.  $  Every class in Java is either a direct or indirect subclass of class Object  java.lang.  Object .  $  Methods can be declared with Object arguments and or return types.  $  You can call methods on an object only if the methods are in the class  or interface   used as the reference variable type, regardless of the actual object type. So, a  reference variable of type Object can be used only to call methods defined in class  Object, regardless of the type of the object to which the reference refers.  $  A reference variable of type Object can’t be assigned to any other reference type  without a cast. A cast can be used to assign a reference variable of one type to a  reference variable of a subtype, but at runtime the cast will fail if the object on the  heap is NOT of a type compatible with the cast.   Example:  Dog d =  Dog  x.getObject aDog ;  $  All objects come out of an ArrayList  as type Object  meaning, they can be   referenced only by an Object reference variable, unless you use a cast .  $  Multiple inheritance is not allowed in Java, because of the problems associated with  the “Deadly Diamond of Death”. That means you can extend only one class  i.e. you  can have only one immediate superclass .  $  An interface is like a 100% pure abstract class. It defines only abstract methods. $  Create an interface using the interface keyword instead of the word class. $   Implement an interface using the keyword implements   Example: Dog implements Pet  $  Your class can implement multiple interfaces. $  A class that implements an interface must implement all the methods of the  interface, since all interface methods are implicitly public and abstract.  $  To invoke the superclass version of a method from a subclass that’s overridden the   method, use the super keyword. Example: super.runReport  ;  interfaces and polymorphism  Q:There’s still something   strange here... you never  explained how it is that  ArrayList  gives back Dog  references that don’t need to be  cast, yet the ArrayList class uses  Object in its methods, not Dog   or DotCom or anything else .  What’s the special trick going on  when you say ArrayList ?  A: You’re right for calling it a   special trick. In fact it is a special  trick that ArrayList  gives  back Dogs without you having  to do any cast, since it looks like  ArrayList methods don’t know  anything about Dogs, or any type  besides Object.  The short answer is that the  compiler puts in the cast for you!  When you say ArrayList ,  there is no special class that has  methods to take and return Dog  objects, but instead the    is a signal to the compiler that  you want the compiler to let  you put ONLY Dog objects in  and to stop you if you try to add  any other type to the list. And  since the compiler stops you  from adding anything but Dogs  to the ArrayList, the compiler  also knows that its safe to cast  anything that comes out of that  ArrayList do a Dog reference. In  other words, using ArrayList   saves you from having to cast  the Dog you get back. But it’s  much more important than that...  because remember, a cast can  fail at runtime, and wouldn’t you  rather have your errors happen  at compile time rather than, say,  when your customer is using it for  something critical?

Stay with me Joe!”  But it was... too late. The garbage  collector came and... he was gone.   Best object I ever had.   Objects are born and objects die. You’re in charge of an object’s lifecycle.  You decide when and how to construct it. You decide when to destroy it. Except you don’t   actually destroy the object yourself, you simply abandon it. But once it’s abandoned, the   heartless Garbage Collector  gc  can vaporize it, reclaiming the memory that object was   using.  If you’re gonna write Java, you’re gonna create objects. Sooner or later, you’re gonna   have to let some of them go, or risk running out of RAM.  In this chapter we look at how objects   are created, where they live while they’re alive, and how to keep or abandon them efficiently.   That means we’ll talk about the heap, the stack, scope, constructors, super constructors, null   references, and more. Warning: this chapter contains material about object death that some   may find disturbing.  Best not to get too attached.  this is a new chapter  235   the stack and the heap  The Stack and the Heap: where things live Before we can understand what really happens when  you create an object, we have to step back a bit. We  need to learn more about where everything lives   and for how long  in Java. That means we need to  learn more about the Stack and the Heap. In Java, we   programmers  care about two areas of memory—the  one where objects live  the heap , and the one  where method invocations and local variables live   the stack . When a JVM starts up, it gets a chunk of  memory from the underlying OS, and uses it to run  your Java program. How much memory, and whether  or not you can tweak it, is dependent on which  version of the JVM  and on which platform  you’re   running. But usually you won’t have anything to say  about it. And with good programming, you probably  won’t care  more on that a little later . We know that all objects live on the garbage-collectible  heap, but we haven’t yet looked at where variables  live. And where a variable lives depends on what kind  of variable it is. And by “kind”, we don’t mean type   i.e. primitive or object reference . The two kinds of  variables whose lives we care about now are instance  variables and local variables. Local variables are also  known as stack variables, which is a big clue for where  they live.  The Stack  Where method invocations  and local variables live  go    doStuff   main    The Heap   Where ALL objects live    o w n n b r   G a t i b l e c  s    H  g  a  a     k   o a l s e “ T h C o ll e  e - a e  ”  p  Duck ob j e ct  S  nowboar d   obje     t c  Button   o b ject   Instance Variables  Local Variables  Instance variables are declared inside a class but not  inside a method. They represent the “ﬁelds” that each  individual object has  which can be ﬁlled with different  values for each instance of the class . Instance variables  live inside the object they belong to.     int size;  public class Duck { r y   D u e   e c n s t a  E v i n  }  a   s   h a r i a b l e .  k a  c v  i z e  s  ”     “     Local variables are declared inside a method, including  method parameters. They’re temporary, and live only as  long as the method is on the stack  in other words, as long as  the method has not reached the closing curly brace .     int i = x + 3;  public void foo int x  { p   T h e v   t h e r a     boolean b = true;   e     a a a l  }  a m e t e r s r i a b l e   a l c l o   l     r i  v  n d   a   x   n d   b   a r i a b l e  s    a  .  236  chapter 9   constructors and gc  Methods are stacked When you call a method, the method lands on  the top of a call stack. That new thing that’s  actually pushed onto the stack is the stack  frame, and it holds the state of the method  including which line of code is executing, and  the values of all local variables.  The method at the top of the stack is always  the currently-running method for that stack   for now, assume there’s only one stack,but in  chapter 14 we’ll add more.  A method stays on  the stack until the method hits its closing curly  brace  which means the method’s done . If  method foo   calls method bar  , method bar   is  stacked on top of method foo  .

The ﬁrst method  doStuff    calls  the second method  go   , and the second method calls the third   crazy   . Each method declares one local variable within the body  of the method, and method go   also declares a parameter variable   which means go   has two local variables .  3 go   calls crazy  ,   4 crazy   completes,   1 Code from another   class calls doStuff  ,  and doStuff   goes  into a stack frame  at the top of the  stack.The boolean  variable named ‘b’  goes on the doStuff    stack frame.  doStuff   b  2 doStuff   calls go  ,   go   is pushed on  top of the stack.  Variables ‘x’ and ‘z’  are in the go   stack  frame.   x  z go   doStuff   b  crazy   is now on the  top of the stack,  with variable ‘c’ in  the frame.  crazy   c go   z doStuff   b  x  and its stack frame is  popped off the stack.  Execution goes back  to the go   method,  and picks up at the  line following the call  to crazy  .  x  z go   doStuff   b  you are here4 237   object references on the stack  What about local variables that are objects? Remember, a non-primitive variable holds a reference to an  object, not the object itself. You already know where objects  live—on the heap. It doesn’t matter where they’re declared or  created. If the local variable is a reference to an object, only  the variable  the reference remote control  goes on the stack.  The object itself still goes in the heap. c l a e d r e f e   i n d e a b l e  e r n si d   d  s c  n  r  r  e  e        e w   n   a   s e t   i t ’s e c si n     ‘ d ’     l o a   d ,   i t ’s o h k .   c a t s   e  c     a l    a e r c   b l e r i a t   m e e h t   n o  d a h     s  a      o     e  e  g  n v t e  a  b  f c        k c l a r i a  r a D u d v barf   foof    d  public class StackRef {    public void foof   {       barf  ;    }     public void barf   {       Duck d = new Duck 24 ;    } }  there are no Dumb Questions  Q:  One more time, WHY are we learning the   whole stack heap thing? How does this help me?  Do I really need to learn about it?  A: Knowing the fundamentals of the Java   Stack and Heap is crucial if you want to understand  variable scope, object creation issues, memory  management, threads, and exception handling.  We cover threads and exception handling in later  chapters but the others you’ll learn in this one. You  do not need to know anything about how the Stack  and Heap are implemented in any particular JVM  and or platform.  Everything you need to know  about the Stack and Heap is on this page and the  previous one. If you nail these pages, all the other  topics that depend on your knowing this stuff will  go much, much, much easier. Once again, some day  you will SO thank us for shoving Stacks and Heaps  down your throat. 238  chapter 9  a  H  e  Duck  o b j e ct   p No matter WHERE the object  reference variable is declared  inside  a method vs. as an instance variable  of a class  the object always always  always goes on the heap.    BULLET POINTS  $  Java has two areas of memory we care about:   the Stack and the Heap. Instance variables are variables declared  inside a class but outside any method.  $   $  Local variables are variables declared inside a   method or method parameter.   $  All local variables live on the stack, in the   frame corresponding to the method where the  variables are declared.  $  Object reference variables work just like primi- tive variables—if the reference is declared as a  local variable, it goes on the stack.  $  All objects live in the heap, regardless of   whether the reference is a local or instance  variable.   If local variables live on the stack,  where do instance variables live? When you say new CellPhone  , Java has to make  space on the Heap for that CellPhone. But how much  space? Enough for the object, which means enough to  house all of the object’s instance variables. That’s right,  instance variables live on the Heap, inside the object  they belong to. Remember that the values of an object’s instance  variables live inside the object. If the instance variables  are all primitives, Java makes space for the instance  variables based on the primitive type. An int needs  32 bits, a long 64 bits, etc. Java doesn’t care about the  value inside primitive variables; the bit-size of an int  variable is the same  32 bits  whether the value of the  int is 32,000,000 or 32. But what if the instance variables are objects? What if  CellPhone HAS-A Antenna? In other words, CellPhone  has a reference variable of type Antenna. When the new object has instance variables that are  object references rather than primitives, the real  question is: does the object need space for all of  the objects it holds references to? The answer is, not  exactly. No matter what, Java has to make space for the  instance variable values. But remember that a reference  variable value is not the whole object, but merely a remote  control to the object. So if CellPhone has an instance  variable declared as the non-primitive type Antenna,  Java makes space within the CellPhone object only for  the Antenna’s remote control  i.e. reference variable  but  not the Antenna object. Well then when does the Antenna object get space on  the Heap? First we have to ﬁnd out when the Antenna  object itself is created. That depends on the instance  variable declaration. If the instance variable is declared  but no object is assigned to it, then only the space for  the reference variable  the remote control  is created.  private Antenna ant;  No actual Antenna object is made on the heap unless  or until the reference variable is assigned a new  Antenna object. private Antenna ant = new Antenna  ;  constructors and gc  Object with two primitive instance variables.

Remember the three steps  of object declaration and assignment: declare a reference variable,  create an object, and assign the object to the reference. But until now, step two—where a miracle occurs and the new object  is “born”—has remained a Big Mystery. Prepare to learn the facts of  object life. Hope you’re not squeamish.  Review the 3 steps of object  declaration, creation and assignment:     e     c  r  n  o     e  s  r s  e     e f c l a e .  p  r  a  y  n    e w     f o t   e  c    a b l e f    r  a  M a a v i n  e k r i a e t  1 Declare a reference   variable  Duck myDuck = new Duck  ;  myDuck  Duck reference  Create an object  2 Duck myDuck = new Duck  ;  Duck object  3  Link the object and  the reference  Duck myDuck = new Duck  ;  Duck object  myDuck  Duck reference  c l e h  e        r  a s  e .

In  other words, the code that  runs when you say new on  a class type.   Every class you create has  a constructor, even if you  don’t write it yourself.  Are we calling a method named Duck  ?  Because it sure looks like it.  Duck myDuck = new Duck  ;  No.   We’re calling the Duck constructor.  i n g   l i k e   w e ’ r e   c a l l   l o o k s   I t   ,   a   m e t h o d   n a m e d   D u c k   s e   o f   t h e   p a r e n t h e s e s b e c a u  .  A constructor does look and feel a lot like a method, but it’s not  a method. It’s got the code that runs when you say new. In other  words, the code that runs when you instantiate an object. The only way to invoke a constructor is with the keyword new  followed by the class name. The JVM ﬁnds that class and invokes  the constructor in that class.  OK, technically this isn’t the only  way to invoke a constructor. But it’s the only way to do it from  outside a constructor. You can call a constructor from within  another constructor, with restrictions, but we’ll get into all that  later in the chapter.   But where is the constructor?   If we didn’t write it, who did?  You can write a constructor for your class  we’re about to do  that , but if you don’t, the compiler writes one for you!  Here’s what the compiler’s default constructor looks like:  public  Duck   {     }  Notice something missing? How is this  s i   n a m e   different from a method?

If this were a method,  you’d need a return type  between “public” and  “Duck  ”.  you are here4 241   If it Quacks like a  constructor...  constructing a new Duck  Construct a Duck  The key feature of a constructor is that it runs  before the object can be assigned to a reference.  That means you get a chance to step in and  do things to get the object ready for use. In  other words, before anyone can use the remote  control for an object, the object has a chance to  help construct itself. In our Duck constructor,  we’re not doing anything useful, but it still  demonstrates the sequence of events.  public class Duck {     public Duck   {       System.out.println “Quack” ;    } }  c t o  c     r  o d e .  s t r  u  C o  n  The constructor gives  you a chance to step into  the middle of  new.  public class UseADuck {     public static void main  String[] args  {       Duck d = new Duck  ;    } }  This calls the Duck  constructor.

In other words, to make and assign values to the object’s  instance variables.  public Duck   {    size = 34;     } That’s all well and good when the Duck class developer knows  how big the Duck object should be. But what if we want the  programmer who is using Duck to decide how big a particular  Duck should be? Imagine the Duck has a size instance variable, and you want the  programmer using your Duck class to set the size of the new  Duck. How could you do it?  Well, you could add a setSize   setter method to the class. But  that leaves the Duck temporarily without a size*, and forces the  Duck user to write two statements—one to create the Duck, and  one to call the setSize   method. The code below uses a setter  method to set the initial size of the new Duck.  public class Duck {    int size;  i n s t a n c e    v a r i a b l e     public Duck   {       System.out.println “Quack” ;        }  c o n s t r u c t o r       public void setSize int newSize  {       size = newSize;    } }  s e t t e r   m e t h o d  public class UseADuck {     public static void main  String[] args {       Duck d = new Duck  ;              d.setSize 42 ;    } }  There’s a bad thing here. The Duck is alive at  this point in the code, but without a size!*  And then you’re relying on the Duck-user  to KNOW that Duck creation is a two-part  process: one to call the constructor and one  to call the setter.  *Instance variables do have a default value. 0 or  0.0 for numeric primitives, false for booleans, and  null for references.  constructors and gc  there are no Dumb Questions Q:  Why do you need to write   a constructor if the compiler  writes one for you?  A: If you need code to help   initialize your object and get  it ready for use, you’ll have to  write your own constructor.  You  might, for example, be depen- dent on input from the user  before you can finish making  the object ready. There’s another  reason you might have to write  a constructor, even if you don’t  need any constructor code  yourself. It has to do with your  superclass constructor, and we’ll  talk about that in a few minutes.  Q:  How can you tell a con-  structor from a method? Can  you also have a method that’s  the same name as the class?  A: Java lets you declare a   method with the same name as  your class.  That doesn’t make it  a constructor, though. The thing  that separates a method from a  constructor is the return type.  Methods must have a return  type, but constructors cannot  have a return type.  Q:  Are constructors inher-  ited? If you don’t provide a  constructor but your superclass  does, do you get the superclass  constructor instead of the  default?  A: Nope. Constructors are   not inherited. We’ll look at that in  just a few pages.  you are here4 243   initializing object state  Using the constructor to initialize  important Duck state*  If an object shouldn’t be used until one or  more parts of its state  instance variables  have  been initialized, don’t let anyone get ahold of  a Duck object until you’re ﬁ nished initializing!  It’s usually way too risky to let someone make— and get a reference to—a new Duck object that  isn’t quite ready for use until that someone turns  around and calls the setSize   method. How will  the Duck-user even know that he’s required to call  the setter method after making the new Duck? The best place to put initialization code is in the  constructor. And all you need to do is make a  constructor with arguments.  public class Duck {    int size;  Let the user make a new Duck  and set the Duck’s size all in  one call. The call to new.

Think about it. On the previous page, there’s only one Duck  constructor—and it takes an int argument for the size of the  Duck. That might not be a big problem, but it does make it  harder for a programmer to create a new Duck object, especially  if the programmer doesn’t know what the size of a Duck should  be. Wouldn’t it be helpful to have a default size for a Duck, so  that if the user doesn’t know an appropriate size, he can still  make a Duck that works? Imagine that you want Duck users to have TWO options  for making a Duck—one where they supply the Duck  size  as the constructor argument  and one where they  don’t specify a size and thus get your default Duck size.  You can’t do this cleanly with just a single constructor.  Remember, if a method  or constructor—same rules  has  a parameter, you must pass an appropriate argument when  you invoke that method or constructor. You can’t just say, “If  someone doesn’t pass anything to the constructor, then use  the default size”, because they won’t even be able to compile  without sending an int argument to the constructor call. You  could do something clunkly like this:  public class Duck {    int size;     public Duck int newSize  {       if  newSize == 0  {          size = 27;       } else {          size = newSize;       }       } }  e a l u v   r e w   D u r w is e h   e a l u v r e v    a     u  r  c    is k   e o f y        g     e o  s     a  o    d     I f z    e t  d  a  p   g i v u l t r a p si z t i o  e h o ,   a f   e e h o l u     t r h  s  e t  e     r  t    e a m e n e h t   t o e ,   si z   r e t a m e e .   N O T   n .  But that means the programmer making a new Duck object has  to know that passing a “0” is the protocol for getting the default  Duck size. Pretty ugly. What if the other programmer doesn’t  know that? Or what if he really does want a zero-size Duck?   Assuming a zero-sized Duck is allowed. If you don’t want  zero-sized Duck objects, put validation code in the constructor  to prevent it.  The point is, it might not always be possible  to distinguish between a genuine “I want zero for the size”  constructor argument and a “I’m sending zero so you’ll give  me the default size, whatever that is” constructor argument.  constructors and gc  You really want TWO ways to  make a new Duck:  public class Duck2 {    int size;     public Duck2   {          supply default size       size = 27;    }     public Duck2 int duckSize  {          use duckSize parameter       size = duckSize;    } }  To make a Duck when you know the size: Duck2 d = new Duck2 15 ;  To make a Duck when you do not know  the size: Duck2 d2 = new Duck2  ;  So this two-options-to-make-a-Duck idea  needs two constructors. One that takes  an int and one that doesn’t. If you have  more than one constructor in a class,  it means you have overloaded  constructors.  you are here4 245   OK, let’s see here... “You  have the right to your own  constructor.”  Makes sense.    “If you cannot afford a constructor,  one will be provided for you by the   compiler.”  Good to know.     overloaded and default constructors  Doesn’t the compiler always  make a no-arg constructor  for you?  N o  !  You might think that if you write only  a constructor with arguments, the  compiler will see that you don’t have a  no-arg constructor, and stick one in for  you. But that’s not how it works. The  compiler gets involved with constructor- making only if you don’t say anything at all  about constructors.  If you write a constructor that  takes arguments, and you still  want a no-arg constructor,  you’ll have to build the no-arg  constructor yourself!  As soon as you provide a constructor,  ANY kind of constructor, the compiler  backs off and says, “OK Buddy, looks like  you’re in charge of constructors now.”  If you have more than one  constructor in a class, the  constructors MUST have  different argument lists.  The argument list includes the order  and types of the arguments. As long as  they’re different, you can have more  than one constructor. You can do this  with methods as well, but we’ll get to that  in another chapter.   246  chapter 9   constructors and gc  Overloaded constructors means you have  more than one constructor in your class.   To compile, each constructor must have a  different argument list!  The class below is legal because all four constructors have  different argument lists. If you had two constructors that took  only an int, for example, the class wouldn’t compile. What you  name the parameter variable doesn’t count. It’s the variable  type  int, Dog, etc.  and order that matters. You can have two  constructors that have identical types, as long as the order is  different. A constructor that takes a String followed by an int, is  not the same as one that takes an int followed by a String.  Four different constructors  means four different ways to  make a new mushroom.  when you know the size, but you  don’t know if it’s magic  when you don’t know anything  public class Mushroom { public class Mushroom {     public Mushroom int size  { }    public Mushroom     public Mushroom    { }    public Mushroom     public Mushroom boolean isMagic  { }    public Mushroom     public Mushroom boolean isMagic, int size  { }     public Mushroom int size, boolean isMagic  { }  when you know if it’s magic or not,  but don’t know the size when you know  whether or not it’s  magic, AND you know  the size as wel  l  t h e s e   t w o   h a v e   t h e   s a m e   a r g s ,   b u t   i n   d i f f e r e n t   o r d e r ,   s o   i t ’ s   O K  }   BULLET POINTS  $   Instance variables live within the object they belong to, on  the Heap.

But aren’t there times when it’s impossible to  come up with defaults? Are there times when you should  not have a no-arg constructor in your class?     A: You’re right. There are times when a no-arg construc-  tor doesn’t make sense. You’ll see this in the Java API—some  classes don’t have a no-arg constructor. The Color class, for  example, represents a... color. Color objects are used to, for  example, set or change the color of a screen font or GUI  button. When you make a Color instance, that instance is  of a particular color  you know, Death-by-Chocolate Brown,   Blue-Screen-of-Death Blue, Scandalous Red, etc. . If you  make a Color object, you must specify the color in some way.  Color c = new Color 3,45,200 ; 248  chapter 9     class Duck {    int pounds = 6;   ﬂoat ﬂoatability = 2.1F;   String name = “Generic”;   long[] feathers = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7};    boolean canFly = true;   int maxSpeed = 25;     public Duck   {     System.out.println “type 1 duck” ;   }    public Duck boolean ﬂy  {     canFly = ﬂy;     System.out.println “type 2 duck” ;   }    public Duck String n, long[] f  {     name = n;     feathers = f;     System.out.println “type 3 duck” ;   }    public Duck int w, ﬂoat f  {     pounds = w;     ﬂoatability = f;     System.out.println “type 4 duck” ;   }    public Duck ﬂoat density, int max  {     ﬂoatability = density;     maxSpeed = max;     System.out.println “type 5 duck” ;   } }          We’re using three ints for RGB values here.

A: No. Constructors can be public,   private, or default  which means no access  modifier at all . We’ll look more at default   access in chapter 16 and appendix B.  Q:   How could a private constructor   ever be useful? Nobody could ever call it,  so nobody could ever make a new object!  A: But that’s not exactly right. Marking   something private doesn’t mean nobody  can access it, it just means that nobody  outside the class can access it.  Bet you’re  thinking “Catch 22”.  Only code from the  same class as the class-with-private-con- structor can make a new object from that  class, but without first making an object,  how do you ever get to run code from that  class in the first place?  How do you ever get  to anything in that class? Patience grasshop- per. We’ll get there in the next chapter.  you are here4 249   space for an object’s superclass parts  Wait a minute... we never DID talk about  superclasses and inheritance and how that all  fits in with constructors.  Here’s where it gets fun. Remember from the last chapter, the part where we looked at  the Snowboard object wrapping around an inner core representing the Object portion  of the Snowboard class? The Big Point there was that every object holds not just its own  declared instance variables, but also everything from its superclasses  which, at a minimum,  means class Object, since every class extends Object . So when an object is created  because somebody said new; there is no other way to create  an object other than someone, somewhere saying new on the class type , the object  gets space for all the instance variables, from all the way up the inheritance tree. Think  about it for a moment... a superclass might have setter methods    encapsulating a private  variable. But that variable has to live somewhere. When an object is created, it’s almost as  though multiple objects materialize—the object being new’d and one object per  each  superclass. Conceptually, though, it’s much better to think of it like the picture below,  where the object being created has layers of itself representing each superclass.  Object has instance variables  encapsulated by access methods.  Those instance variables are  created when any subclass is  instantiated.  These aren’t the  REAL Object variables, but we  don’t care what they are since  they’re encapsulated   Snowboard also has instance  variables of its own, so to make  a Snowboard object we need  space for the instance variables  of both classes.  Object  Foo a; int b; int c;  equals   getClass   hashCode   toString    Snowboard  Foo x Foo y int z  turn   shred   getAir   loseControl    250  chapter 9  A single  object on  the heap  Y  X  Z  a  b C Object  Snowboard  Snowboar d   o b j e  ct  There is only ONE object on the heap here. A  Snowboard object. But it contains both the  Snowboard parts of itself and the Object parts of  itself. All instance variables from both classes have  to be here.   The role of superclass constructors  in an object’s life.  All the constructors in an object’s inheritance  tree must run when you make a new object.  Let that sink in. That means every superclass has a constructor   because every class has a constructor , and each  constructor up the hierarchy runs at the time an  object of a subclass is created.  Saying new is a Big Deal. It starts the  whole constructor chain reaction.     And yes,  even abstract classes have constructors.  Although you can never say new on an  abstract class, an abstract class is still  a superclass, so its constructor runs  when someone makes an instance of a  concrete subclass. The super constructors run to build  out the superclass parts of the object.  Remember, a subclass might inherit  methods that depend on superclass state   in other words, the value of instance variables  in the superclass . For an object to be fully- formed, all the superclass parts of itself must be  fully-formed, and that’s why the super constructor  must run. All instance variables from every class  in the inheritance tree have to be declared and  initialized. Even if Animal has instance variables  that Hippo doesn’t inherit  if the variables are  private, for example , the Hippo still depends on  the Animal methods that use those variables. When a constructor runs, it immediately calls its  superclass constructor, all the way up the chain  until you get to the class Object constructor.  On the next few pages, you’ll learn how superclass  constructors are called, and how you can call  them yourself. You’ll also learn what to do if your  superclass constructor has arguments!  constructors and gc  X  Y  S  k  a  b  V  C  Object  Animal  Hippo  Object  Animal  HIppo  A single Hippo object on the heap  A new Hippo object also IS-A Animal  and IS-A Object.

The first one, A. The Hippo   constructor is invoked first, but    How do you invoke a superclass constructor?   constructors and gc  You might think that somewhere in, say, a Duck constructor,  if Duck extends Animal you’d call Animal  . But that’s not  how it works:  public class Duck extends Animal {    int size;  B A D !       public Duck int newSize  {       Animal  ;       size = newSize;    } }  NO! This is not legal!  The only way to call a super constructor is by calling super  .  That’s right—super   calls the super constructor.  What are the odds?  public class Duck extends Animal {    int size;     public Duck int newSize  {       super  ;       size = newSize;    } }  you just say super    A call to super   in your constructor puts the superclass  constructor on the top of the Stack. And what do you  think that superclass constructor does? Calls its superclass  constructor. And so it goes until the Object constructor is  on the top of the Stack. Once Object   ﬁnishes, it’s popped  off the Stack and the next thing down the Stack  the  subclass constructor that called Object    is now on top.  That constructor ﬁnishes and so it goes until the original  constructor is on the top of the Stack, where it can now  ﬁnish.  And how is it that we’ve  gotten away without  doing it?  You probably figured that out.  Our good friend the compiler  puts in a call to super   if you  don’t.  So the compiler gets involved in  constructor-making in two ways:  If you don’t provide a constructor  1 The compiler puts one in that looks like:      public ClassName   {          super  ;    }  2  If you do provide a constructor  but you do not put in the call to  super    The compiler will put a call to super   in  each of your overloaded constructors.*  The compiler-supplied call looks like: super  ; It always looks like that.  The compiler- inserted call to super   is always a no-arg  call. If the superclass has overloaded  constructors, only the no-arg one is called.  *Unless the constructor calls another overloaded  constructor  you’ll see that in a few pages .  you are here4 253   object lifecycle  Can the child exist before  the parents? If you think of a superclass as the parent to the subclass child,  you can ﬁgure out which has to exist ﬁrst. The superclass parts  of an object have to be fully-formed  completely built  before the  subclass parts can be constructed. Remember,    the subclass object might depend on things it  inherits from the superclass, so it’s important  that those inherited things be ﬁnished. No  way around it. The superclass constructor  must ﬁnish before its subclass constructor. Look at the Stack series on page 248 again,  and you can see that while the Hippo  constructor is the ﬁrst to be invoked  it’s  the ﬁrst thing on the Stack , it’s the last one  to complete! Each subclass constructor  immediately invokes its own superclass  constructor, until the Object constructor  is on the top of the Stack. Then Object’s  constructor completes and we bounce  back down the Stack to Animal’s  constructor. Only after Animal’s constructor completes  do we ﬁnally come back down to ﬁnish the rest of the Hippo  constructor. For that reason: The call to super   must be the ﬁrst statement      in each constructor!*  Possible constructors for class Boop  ˛  public Boop   {     super  ;  ˛  public Boop int i  {     super  ;     size = i;  }  }  These are OK because  the programmer ex- plicitly coded the call  to super  , as the first  statement.  }  }  }  *There’s an exception to this rule; you’ll learn it on page 252. 254  chapter 9  Eewwww... that   is SO creepy. There’s  no way I could have been  born before my parents.   That’s just wrong.  ˛  public Boop   {  ˛  public Boop int i  {     size = i;  These are OK because  the compiler will put a  call to super   in as the  first statement.  public Boop int i  {     size = i;     super  ;  BAD!!

Can you pass something in to  the super   call? Of course. If you couldn’t, you’d never be able to extend a class  that didn’t have a no-arg constructor.  Imagine this scenario: all animals have a  name. There’s a getName   method in class Animal that returns the value of the  name instance variable. The instance variable is marked private, but the subclass   in this case, Hippo  inherits the getName   method. So here’s the problem:  Hippo has a getName   method  through inheritance , but does not have the name  instance variable. Hippo has to depend on the Animal part of himself to keep the  name instance variable, and return it when someone calls getName   on a Hippo  object. But... how does the Animal part get the name? The only reference Hippo  has to the Animal part of himself is through super  , so that’s the place where  Hippo sends the Hippo’s name up to the Animal part of himself, so that the  Animal part can store it in the private name instance variable.  public abstract class Animal {    private String name;     public String getName   {       return name;    }  All animals  including  subclasses  have a name A getter method that  Hippo inherits     public Animal String theName  {       name = theName;    } }  The constructor that  takes the name and assigns  it the name instance  variable   public class Hippo extends Animal {     public Hippo String name  {       super name ;    } }  it sends the name up the Stack to  the Animal constructor  H i p p o   c o n s t r u c t o r   t a k e s   a   n a m e  public class MakeHippo {    public static void main String[] args  {       Hippo h = new Hippo “Buffy” ;       System.out.println h.getName   ;    } }  Make a Hippo, passing the  name “Buffy” to the Hippo  constructor.

You want whichever  constructor is ﬁ rst invoked to call The Real Constructor  and let The Real Constructor ﬁ nish the job of  construction. It’s simple: just say this  . Or this aString .  Or this 27, x . In other words, just imagine   that the  keyword this is a reference to the current object You can say this   only within a constructor, and it must  be the ﬁ rst statement in the constructor!

An object’s life depends entirely on the life of references  referring to it. If the reference is considered “alive”, the  object is still alive on the Heap. If the reference dies   and we’ll look at what that means in just a moment , the  object will die.  So if an object’s life depends on the reference  variable’s life, how long does a variable live? That depends on whether the variable is a local variable  or an instance variable. The code below shows the life of a  local variable. In the example, the variable is a primitive,  but variable lifetime is the same whether it’s a primitive  or reference variable.  1  A local variable lives only  within the method that  declared the variable.  public void read   {    int s = 42;       ‘s’ can be used only       within this method.       When this method ends,       ‘s’ disappears completely. }  Variable ‘s’ can be used only within the  read   method. In other words, the variable  is in scope only within its own method. No  other code in the class  or any other class   can see ‘s’.  ‘s’ is scoped to the read    method, so it can’t be used  anywhere else  2  An instance variable lives  as long as the object  does. If the object is still  alive, so are its instance  variables.  public class TestLifeOne {     public void read   {       int s = 42;       sleep  ;    }     public void sleep   {       s = 7;    } }  al   o    g  t  t   le e!  o  e  r  N h  B  D !!

When sleep   completes and read   is  on top of the Stack and running again, read   can  still see ‘s’. When read   completes and is popped off  the Stack, ‘s’ is dead. Pushing up digital daisies.  258  chapter 9  public class Life {    int size;     public void setSize int s  {       size = s;          ‘s’ disappears at the           end of this method,          but ‘size’ can be used          anywhere in the class    } }  Variable ‘s’  this time a method parameter   is in scope only within the setSize    method. But instance variable size is  scoped to the life of the object as opposed  to the life of the method.   The difference between life and  scope for local variables:  A local variable is alive as long as its Stack  frame is on the Stack. In other words,  until the method completes.  Life  Scope  A local variable is in scope only within the  method in which the variable was declared.  When its own method calls another, the  variable is alive, but not in scope until its  method resumes. You can use a variable only  when it is in scope.    public void doStuff   {      boolean b = true;      go 4 ;   }   public void go int x  {      int z = x + 24;      crazy  ;         imagine more code here   }   public void crazy   {      char c = ‘a’;   }  doStuff   b  1 doStuff   goes on the  Stack. Variable ‘b’ is  alive and in scope.  x  z go   doStuff   b  crazy   c go   z doStuff   b  x  2  go   plops on top of  the Stack. ‘x’ and ‘z’  are alive and in scope,  and ‘b’ is alive but not  in scope.   3  crazy   is pushed onto  the Stack, with ‘c’ now  alive and in scope. The  other three variables  are alive but out of  scope.  While a local variable is alive, its state persists.  As long as method doStuff   is on the Stack, for  example, the ‘b’ variable keeps its value. But the  ‘b’ variable can be used only while doStuff  ’s  Stack frame is at the top. In other words, you can  use a local variable only while that local variable’s   method is actually running  as opposed to  waiting for higher Stack frames to complete .  constructors and gc  x  z go   doStuff   b  4  crazy   completes and  is popped off the Stack,  so ‘c’ is out of scope  and dead. When go    resumes where it left  off, ‘x’ and ‘z’ are both  alive and back in scope.  Variable ‘b’ is still alive  but out of scope  until  go   completes .  you are here4 259   object lifecycle  What about reference variables? The rules are the same for primtives and references. A reference  variable can be used only when it’s in scope, which means you can’t use  an object’s remote control unless you’ve got a reference variable that’s  in scope. The real question is,  “How does variable life affect object life?” An object is alive as long as there are live references to it. If a reference  variable goes out of scope but is still alive, the object it refers to is still  alive on the Heap. And then you have to ask... “What happens when the  Stack frame holding the reference gets popped off the Stack at the end  of the method?” If that was the only live reference to the object, the object is now  abandoned on the Heap. The reference variable     disintegrated with  the Stack frame, so the abandoned object is now, ofﬁ cially, toast. The  trick is to know the point at which an object becomes eligible for garbage  collection.  Once an object is eligible for garbage collection  GC , you don’t have  to worry about reclaiming the memory that object was using. If your  program gets low on memory, GC will destroy some or all of the eligible  objects, to keep you from running out of RAM. You can still run out of  before all eligible objects have been hauled off to the  memory, but not before all eligible objects have been hauled off to the  dump. Your job is to make sure that you abandon objects  i.e, make  dump. Your job is to make sure that you abandon objects  i.e, make  them eligible for GC  when you’re done with them, so that the garbage  them eligible for GC  when you’re done with them, so that the garbage  collector has something to reclaim. If you hang on to objects, GC can’t  collector has something to reclaim. If you hang on to objects, GC can’t  help you and you run the risk of your program dying a painful  help you and you run the risk of your program dying a painful  out-of-memory death.  An object’s life has  no  value, no meaning, no  point, unless somebody  has a reference to it. If you can’t get to it,  you can’t ask it to do  anything and it’s just a  big fat waste of bits. But if an object is  unreachable, the  Garbage Collector will  ﬁ gure that out. Sooner  or later, that object’s  goin’ down.  An object becomes  eligible for GC when  its last live reference  disappears.  260  chapter 9  Three ways to get rid of an object’s reference:    a t    2 The reference is assigned another object  void go   {   Life z = new Life  ; }  1 The reference goes out of scope, permanently   d i e s ‘ z ’ r e f e r e n c e   e n d   o f   m e t h o d t h e   f i r s t   o b j e c t   w h e n   z   a   n e w   o b j e c t . t h e   f i r s t   o b j e c t   w h e n   z    Life z = new Life  ; z = new Life  ;  Life z = new Life  ; z = null;  3 The reference is explicitly set to null        s  s  s  i  i  i  i  s    a b a n d o n e d     t o    ‘ r e p r o g r a m m e d ’    a b a n d o n e d    ‘ d e p r o g r a m m e d ’  .

If you have an unprogrammed remote  control, in the real world, the buttons don’t  do anything when you press them.

If you  use the dot operator on  a null reference, you’ll get a  NullPointerException at runtime.

I’m there to support an object, usually  throughout the object’s entire life. After all,  what’s an object without state? And what is  state? Values kept in instance variables.  I appreciate your point of view, and I certainly  appreciate the value of object state and all,  but I don’t want folks to be misled. Local  variables are really important. To use your  phrase, “After all, what’s an object without  behavior?” And what is behavior? Algorithms  in methods. And you can bet your bits there’ll  be some local variables in there to make those  algorithms work.  Within the local-variable community, the  phrase “temporary variable” is considered  derogatory. We prefer “local”, “stack”, “auto- matic”, or ”Scope-challenged”. Anyway, it’s true that we don’t have a long  life, and it’s not a particularly good life either.  First, we’re shoved into a Stack frame with  all the other local variables. And then, if the  method we’re part of calls another method,  another frame is pushed on top of us. And if  that method calls another method... and so on.  Sometimes we have to wait forever for all the  other methods on top of the Stack to com- plete so that our method can run again.  Nothing. Nothing at all. It’s like being in  stasis—that thing they do to people in science  ﬁction movies when they have to travel long  distances. Suspended animation, really. We  just sit there on hold. As long as our frame is  still there, we’re safe and the value we hold  is secure, but it’s a mixed blessing when our   No, don’t get me wrong, I do understand your  role in a method, it’s just that your life is so  short. So temporary. That’s why they call you  guys “temporary variables”.  My apologies. I understand completely.   I never really thought about it like that. What  are you doing while the other methods are  running and you’re waiting for your frame to  be the top of the Stack again?  264  chapter 9   constructors and gc  Instance Variable  We saw an educational video about it once.  Looks like a pretty brutal ending. I mean,  when that method hits its ending curly brace,  the frame is literally blown off the Stack! Now  that’s gotta hurt.  I live on the Heap, with the objects. Well, not  with the objects, actually in an object. The  object whose state I store. I have to admit life  can be pretty luxurious on the Heap. A lot of  us feel guilty, especially around the holidays.  OK, hypothetically, yes, if I’m an instance  variable of the Collar and the Collar gets  GC’d, then the Collar’s instance variables  would indeed be tossed out like so many pizza  boxes. But I was told that this almost never  happens.  Local Variable frame gets to run again. On the one hand, we  get to be active again. On the other hand, the  clock starts ticking again on our short lives.  The more time our method spends running,  the closer we get to the end of the method.  We all know what happens then.  Tell me about it. In computer science they use  the term popped as in “the frame was popped  off the Stack”. That makes it sound fun, or  maybe like an extreme sport. But, well, you  saw the footage.  So why don’t we talk about  you? I know what my little Stack frame looks  like, but where do you live?  But you don’t always live as long as the object  who declared you, right? Say there’s a Dog  object with a Collar instance variable. Imagine  you’re an instance variable of the Collar object,  maybe a reference to a Buckle or something,  sitting there all happy inside the Collar object  who’s all happy inside the Dog object. But...  what happens if the Dog wants a new Collar,  or nulls out its Collar instance variable? That  makes the Collar object eligible for GC. So...  if you’re an instance variable inside the Collar,  and the whole Collar is abandoned, what  happens to you?  And you believed it? That’s what they say to  keep us motivated and productive. But aren’t  you forgetting something else? What if you’re  an instance variable inside an object, and that  object is referenced only by a local variable? If  I’m the only reference to the object you’re in,  when I go, you’re coming with me. Like it or  not, our fates may be connected. So I say we  forget about all this and go get drunk while  we still can. Carpe RAM and all that.  They let us drink?   you are here4 265   exercise: Be the Garbage Collector  Exercise  BE the Garbage Collector  Which of the lines of code on the right, if added  to the class on the left at point A, would cause  exactly one additional object to be eligible for the  Garbage Collector?

The readings on the radiator bots, designed to cool the living quarters, seem to be within  spec, so weʼve focused our analysis on the heat retention bots, the bots that help to warm the quar- ters.”  Tom sighed, at ﬁrst it had seemed that nano-technology was going to really put them ahead  of schedule. Now, with only ﬁve weeks left until launch, some of the orbiterʼs key life support  systems were still not passing the simulation gauntlet.    “What ratios are you simulating?”, Tom asked.     “Well if I see where youʼre going, we already thought of that”, Sarah replied.  “Mis- sion control will not sign off on critical systems if we run them out of spec.  We are  required to run the v3 radiator botʼs SimUnits in a 2:1 ratio with the v2 radiatorʼs  SimUnits”, Sarah continued.  “Overall, the ratio of retention bots to radiator bots is  supposed to run 4:3.”     “Howʼs power consumption Sarah?”, Tom asked.  Sarah paused, “Well thatʼs  another thing, power consumption is running higher than anticipated.  Weʼve got a team  tracking that down too, but because the nanos are wireless itʼs been hard to isolate the power  consumption of the radiators from the retention bots.”  “Overall power consumption ratios”, Sarah  continued, “are designed to run 3:2 with the radiators pulling more power from the wireless grid.”   Weʼve got to ﬁnd this problem, and ﬁnd it quick!”   “OK Sarah”, Tom said “Letʼs take a look at some of the simulation initiation code.    import java.util.*; class V2Radiator {   V2Radiator ArrayList list  {     for int x=0; x<5; x++  {        list.add new SimUnit “V2Radiator”  ;     }   } }  class V3Radiator extends V2Radiator {   V3Radiator ArrayList lglist  {     super lglist ;     for int g=0; g<10; g++  {        lglist.add new SimUnit “V3Radiator”  ;     }   } }  class RetentionBot {   RetentionBot ArrayList rlist  {     rlist.add new SimUnit “Retention”  ;    } }  268  chapter 9   constructors and gc  Five-Minute Mystery continued...  public class TestLifeSupportSim {   public static void main String [] args  {     ArrayList aList = new ArrayList  ;     V2Radiator v2 = new V2Radiator aList ;     V3Radiator v3 = new V3Radiator aList ;     for int z=0; z<20; z++  {       RetentionBot ret = new RetentionBot aList ;     }   } }  class SimUnit {   String botType;   SimUnit String type  {     botType = type;   }   int powerUse   {     if  “Retention”.equals botType   {       return 2;     } else {       return 4;      }   } }  Tom gave the code a quick look and a small smile creeped across his lips.

There are a total of 12 active references to  this object right before the main    method completes.   The k.kh variable is valid for a while, but k gets nulled  at the end.

That meant that every time the V3Radiator constructor was called,  it passed an ArrayList in its super   call to the V2Radiator constructor.  That  meant that an extra ﬁve V2Radiator SimUnits were created.  If Tom was right,  total power use would have been 120, not the 100 that Sarahʼs expected ratios  predicted.   Since all the Bot classes create SimUnits, writing a constructor for  the SimUnit class, that printed out a line everytime a SimUnit was created,  would have quickly highlighted the problem!   you are here4 271    10  numbers and statics  Numbers Matter  Do the Math.

You might want your numbers to print with exactly two decimal   places, or you might want to put commas into your large numbers to make them easier to read.   And what about working with dates? You might want to print dates in a variety of ways, or even   manipulate dates to say things like, “add three weeks to today’s date”.  And what about parsing   a String into a number? Or turning a number into a String? You’re in luck. The Java API is full of   handy number-tweaking methods ready and easy to use.  But most of them are static, so we’ll   start by learning what it means for a variable or method to be static, including constants in   Java—static final variables.  this is a new chapter  273   Math methods  MATH methods: as close as you’ll  ever get to a global method  Except there’s no global anything in Java. But think about  this: what if you have a method whose behavior doesn’t  depend on an instance variable value. Take the round    method in the Math class, for example. It does the same  thing every time—rounds a ﬂoating point number the  argument to the method  to the nearest integer.  Every  time. If you had 10,000 instances of class Math, and ran  the round 42.2  method, you’d get an integer value of  42. Every time. In other words, the method acts on the  argument, but is never affected by an instance variable  state. The only value that changes the way the round    method runs is the argument passed to the method! Doesn’t it seem like a waste of perfectly good heap space  to make an instance of class Math simply to run the  round   method? And what about other Math methods  like min  , which takes two numerical primitives and  returns the smaller of the two. Or max  . Or abs  , which  returns the absolute value of a number.  These methods never use instance variable values. In fact the  Math class doesn’t have any instance variables. So there’s  nothing to be gained by making an instance of class  Math. So guess what? You don’t have to. As a matter of  fact, you can’t.  If you try to make an instance of  class Math:  Math mathObject = new Math  ;  You’ll get this error:  File  Edit   Window  Help  IwasToldThereWouldBeNoMath %javac TestMath  TestMath.java:3: Math   has private  access in java.lang.Math       Math mathObject = new Math  ;                        ^ 1 error  274  chapter 10  Methods in the Math class  don’t use any instance  variable values. And because  the methods are ‘static’,  you don’t need to have an  instance of Math. All you  need is the Math class.  int x = Math.round 42.2 ; int y = Math.min 56,12 ; int z = Math.abs -343 ;  These methods never use  instance variables, so their  behavior doesn’t need to  know about a specific object.  This error shows that the Math  constructor is marked private! That  means you can NEVER say ‘new’ on the  Math class to make a new Math object.   numbers and  statics  The difference bet ween regular   non-static  and static methods Java is object-oriented, but once in a while you have a special case,  typically a utility method  like the Math methods , where there is  no need to have an instance of the class. The keyword static lets  a method run without any instance of the class. A static method means  “behavior not dependent on an instance variable, so no instance object  is required. Just the class.”  regular  non-static  method  static method  I n s t a n c e   v a r i a b l e   v a l u e   a f f e c t s   t h e   b e h a v i o r   o f   t h e   p l a y       m e t h o d .  public class Song {    String title;    public Song String t  {      title = t;    }    public void play   {       SoundPlayer player = new SoundPlayer  ;       player.playSound title ;    }  T h e   c u r r e n t   v a l u e   o f   t h e   ‘ t i t l e ’   i n s t a n c e   v a r i a b l e   i s   t h e   s o n g   t h a t   p l a y s   w h e n   y o u   c a l  l   p l a y     .

Often  although not always , a class with static  methods is not meant to be instantiated. In Chapter  8 we talked about abstract classes, and how marking  a class with the abstract modiﬁ er makes it  impossible for anyone to say ‘new’ on that class type.  In other words, it’s impossible to instantiate an abstract  class. But you can restrict other code from instantiating  a non-abstract class by marking the constructor  private. Remember, a method marked private means  that only code from within the class can invoke  the method. A constructor marked private means  essentially the same thing—only code from within  the class can invoke the constructor. Nobody can  say ‘new’ from outside the class. That’s how it works  with the Math class, for example. The constructor  is private, you cannot make a new instance of Math.  The compiler knows that your code doesn’t have  access to that private constructor.  276  chapter 10  This does not mean that a class with one or more  static methods should never be instantiated. In fact,  every class you put a main   method in is a class with  a static method in it! Typically, you make a main   method so that you  can launch or test another class, nearly always by  instantiating a class in main, and then invoking a  method on that new instance. So you’re free to combine static and non-static  methods in a class, although even a single non-static  method means there must be some way to make an  instance of the class. The only ways to get a new  object are through ‘new’ or deserialization  or  something called the Java Reﬂ ection API that we  don’t go into . No other way. But exactly who says new  can be an interesting question, and one we’ll look at  a little later in this chapter.   numbers and  statics  If you try to use an  instance variable from  inside a static method,  the compiler thinks,  “I don’t know   which  object’s instance variable  you’re talking about!”  If you have ten Duck  objects on the heap, a  static method doesn’t  know about any of them.  I’m sure they’re  talking about MY  size variable.  No, I’m pretty sure  they’re talking about  MY size variable.  Static methods can’t use non-static   instance  variables! Static methods run without knowing about any particular  instance of the static method’s class. And as you saw on  the previous pages, there might not even be any instances  of that class. Since a static method is called using the class   Math.random    as opposed to an instance reference  t2.play   ,  a static method can’t refer to any instance variables of the  class. The static method doesn’t know which instance’s variable  value to use.  If you try to compile this code:  public class Duck {     private int size;  c    D u s i z    e  h s     ?  k  e  ?  W h i c o W h     public static void main  String[] args  {       System.out.println “Size of duck is “ + size ;    }  If there’s a Duck on  the heap somewhere, we  don’t know about it.     public void setSize int s  {       size = s;    }    public int getSize   {        return size;    } }     You’ll get this error:  File  Edit   Window  Help  Quack % javac Duck.java Duck.java:6: non-static variable  size cannot be referenced from a  static context       System.out.println “Size  of duck is “ + size ;                ^  you are here4 277   static methods  Static methods can’t use non-static  methods, either!  What do non-static methods do? They usually use instance  variable state to affect the behavior of the method. A getName    method returns the value of the name variable. Whose name?  The object used to invoke the getName   method.  This won’t compile: Calling getSize   just postpones  the inevitable—getSize   uses  the size instance variable.  public class Duck {     private int size;     public static void main  String[] args  {       System.out.println “Size is “ + getSize   ;    }     public void setSize int s  {       size = s;    }    public int getSize   {        return size;    } }     B a c k   t o   t h e   s a m e   p r o b l e m . w h o s e   s  i z e ?  .    .

Will the compiler allow  that?  A: No. The compiler knows that   whether you do or do not use instance  variables in a non-static method, you can.  And think about the implications... if you  were allowed to compile a scenario like  that, then what happens if in the future  you want to change the implementation  of that non-static method so that one day  it does use an instance variable? Or  worse,  what happens if a subclass overrides the  method and uses an instance variable in  the overriding version?  Q: I could swear I’ve seen code that   calls a static method using a reference  variable instead of the class name.  A: You can do that, but as your mother   always told you, “Just because it’s legal  doesn’t mean it’s good.” Although it works   to call a static method using any instance  of the class, it makes for misleading  less- readable  code. You can say, Duck d = new Duck  ; String[] s = {}; d.main s ;  This code is legal, but the compiler just  resolves it back to the real class anyway   “OK,  d is of type Duck, and main   is static,  so I’ll call the static main   in class Duck” .  In other words, using d to invoke main    doesn’t imply that main   will have any  special knowledge of the object that d is  referencing. It’s just an alternate way to  invoke a static method, but the method is  still static!   Static variable: value is the same for ALL  instances of the class                     Imagine you wanted to count how many Duck  instances are being created while your program is  running. How would you do it? Maybe an instance  variable that you increment in the constructor? class Duck {    int duckCount = 0;     public Duck   {        duckCount++;    } }  this would always set  duckCount to 1 each time  a Duck was made  No, that wouldn’t work because duckCount is an  instance variable, and starts at 0 for each Duck. You  could try calling a method in some other class, but  that’s kludgey. You need a class that’s got only a single  copy of the variable, and all instances share that one  copy.  That’s what a static variable gives you: a value shared  by all instances of a class. In other words, one value  per class, instead of one value per instance.  numbers and  statics  s  c  t    n u k C o   O N L Y   u d   t i c a t d e     i n i t i a li z e T h   i s   t b l e s f i r r i a     i s a v s c l a   a t i m e e h t     n h e c w h a e d ,   N O T   e . d e   m a d a l o   i s e c n t s e w   i n n  a  s        public class Duck {     private int size;    private static int duckCount = 0;        public Duck   {        duckCount++;    }  Now it will keep  incrementing each time  the Duck constructor runs,  because duckCount is static  and won’t be reset to 0.     public void setSize int s  {       size = s;    }    public int getSize   {       return size;    } }  e  a f a  o w n   s   i t p c t i c ,   D u u   i t .

In other words,  only code from within the class can make a new  instance of a class with a private constructor.   There’s  a kind of chicken-and-egg problem here.     What if you want to write a class in such a way that  only ONE instance of it can be created,  and anyone  who wants to use an instance of the class will always  use that one, single instance?    Initializing a static variable  Static variables are initialized when a class is loaded. A class is  loaded because the JVM decides it’s time to load it. Typically,  the JVM loads a class because somebody’s trying to make a  new instance of the class, for the ﬁrst time, or use a static  method or variable of the class. As a programmer, you also  have the option of telling the JVM to load a class, but you’re  not likely to need to do that. In nearly all cases, you’re better  off letting the JVM decide when to load the class. And there are two guarantees about static initialization: Static variables in a class are initialized before any object of that  class can be created. Static variables in a class are initialized before any static method  of the class runs. class Player {     static int playerCount = 0;     private String name;     public Player String n  {         name = n;         playerCount++;     } }  numbers and  statics  All static variables  in a class are  initialized before  any object of  that class can be  created.  The playerCount is initialized when the class is loaded.  We explicitly initialized it to 0, but we don’t need  to since 0 is the default value for ints. Static vari- ables get default values just like instance variables.  Default values for declared but uninitialized  static and instance variables are the same: primitive integers  long, short, etc. : 0 primitive floating points  float, double : 0.0 boolean: false object references: null  public class PlayerTestDrive {     public static void main String[] args  {         System.out.println Player.playerCount ;         Player one = new Player “Tiger Woods” ;         System.out.println Player.playerCount ;     } }  Access a static variable just like a static  method—with the class name.  Static variables are initialized when the class is loaded. If you  don’t explicitly initialize a static variable  by assigning it a  value at the time you declare it , it gets a default value, so int  variables are initialized to zero, which means we didn’t need  to explicitly say “playerCount = 0”. Declaring, but not initial- izing, a static variable means the static variable will get the de- fault value for that variable type, in exactly the same way that  instance variables are given default values when declared.

In other words, the value of the static ﬁnal variable  will stay the same as long as the class is loaded. Look up Math.PI  in the API, and you’ll ﬁnd: public static ﬁnal double PI = 3.141592653589793; The variable is marked public so that any code can access it.  The variable is marked static so that you don’t need an  instance of class Math  which, remember, you’re not allowed to  create .  The variable is marked ﬁnal because PI doesn’t change  as far as  Java is concerned .  There is no other way to designate a variable as a constant, but  there is a naming convention that helps you to recognize one.  Constant variable names should be in all caps!  A static initializer is a block  of code that runs when a  class is loaded, before any  other code can use the  class, so it’s a great place  to initialize a static final  variable. class Foo {     ﬁnal static int x;     static {       x = 42;     } }  Initialize a ﬁnal static variable:  1  At the time you declare it: public class Foo {    public static ﬁnal int FOO_X = 25; }  notice the naming convention -- static  final variables are constants, so the  name should be all uppercase, with an  underscore separating the words  OR  2  In a static initializer: public class Bar {    public static ﬁnal double BAR_SIGN;     static {        BAR_SIGN =  double  Math.random  ;    } }  this code runs as soon as the class  is loaded, before any static method  is called and even before any static  variable can be used.  282  chapter 10  If you don’t give a value to a ﬁnal variable  in one of those two places:  public class Bar {    public static ﬁnal double BAR_SIGN;  }  no initialization!

You can use the keyword ﬁnal to modify non- static variables too, including instance variables,  local variables, and even method parameters.

But can a non-static  method access a static variable?  A: Of course. A non-static method in a   class can always call a static method in the  class or access a static variable of the class.  Q: Why would I want to make a class   ﬁnal? Doesn’t that defeat the whole  purpose of OO?  A: Yes and no. A typical reason for   making a class final is for security. You  can’t, for example, make a subclass of the  String class. Imagine the havoc if someone  extended the String class and substituted  their own String subclass objects,  polymorphically, where String objects  are expected.  If you need to count on a  particular implementation of the methods  in a class, make the class final.  the methods ﬁnal if the class is ﬁnal?  Q: Isn’t it redundant to have to mark  A: If the class is final, you don’t need to   mark the methods final. Think about it—if  a class is final it can never be subclassed,  so none of the methods can ever be  overridden.  On the other hand, if you do want to allow  others to extend your class, and you want  them to be able to override some, but not  all, of the methods, then don’t mark the  class final but go in and selectively mark  specific methods as final. A final method  means that a subclass can’t override that  particular method.  284  chapter 10   BULLET POINTS  ß  A static method should be called using the class    name rather than an object reference variable:  Math.random   vs. myFoo.go    ß  A static method can be invoked without any instances   of the method’s class on the heap.  ß  A static method is good for a utility method that does  not  and will never  depend on a particular instance  variable value.  ß  A static method is not associated with a particular  instance—only the class—so it cannot access any  instance variable values of its class.

The method is overloaded, so  if you pass it an int it returns an int. Pass it a  double it returns a double.  int x = Math.abs -240 ;     returns 240 double d = Math.abs 240.45 ;     returns  240.45  Math.round    Returns an int or a long  depending on  whether the argument is a ﬂoat or a double   rounded to the nearest integer value.  int x = Math.round -24.8f ;     returns -25 int y = Math.round 24.45f ;     returns 24  Remember, floating point literals are assumed  to be doubles unless you add the ‘f’.  Math.min    Returns a value that is the minimum of the  two arguments. The method is overloaded to  take ints, longs, ﬂoats, or doubles. int x = Math.min 24,240 ;     returns 24 double y = Math.min 90876.5, 90876.49 ;     returns 90876.49  Math.max    Returns a value that is the maximum of the  two arguments. The method is overloaded to  take ints, longs, ﬂoats, or doubles. int x = Math.max 24,240 ;     returns 240 double y = Math.max 90876.5, 90876.49 ;     returns 90876.5   Wrapping a primitive Sometimes you want to treat a primitive like  an object. For example, in all versions of Java  prior to 5.0, you cannot put a primitive directly  into a collection like ArrayList or HashMap:  int x = 32; ArrayList list = new ArrayList  ; list.add x ;  This won’t work unless you’re using Java 5.0 or  greater!! There’s no add int  method in ArrayList  that takes an int!  ArrayList only has add   methods  that take object references, not primitives.   There’s a wrapper class for every primitive type,  and since the wrapper classes are in the  java. lang package, you don’t need to import them.  You can recognize wrapper classes because  each one is named after the primitive type it  wraps, but with the ﬁrst letter capitalized to  follow the class naming convention. Oh yeah, for reasons absolutely nobody on the  planet is certain of, the API designers decided  not to map the names exactly from primitive  type to class type. You’ll see what we mean:  Boolean Character   Byte Short Integer Long Float Double  Watch out! The names aren’t  mapped exactly to the primitive  types. The class names are fully  spelled out.  wrapping a value  int i = 288; Integer iWrap = new Integer i ;  unwrapping a value  int unWrapped = iWrap.intValue  ;  Give the primitive to the  wrapper constructor. That’s it.  All the wrappers work  like this. Boolean has a  booleanValue  , Character  has a charValue  , etc.  numbers and  statics  object  primitive When you need to treat  a primitive like an object,  wrap it. If you’re using any  version of Java before 5.0,  you’ll do this when you  need to store a primitive  value inside a collection like  ArrayList or HashMap.  e  v  i n t   p r i m i t i Integer object  t   int  Integer o bjec  Note: the picture at the top is a chocolate in a foil wrapper. Get  it? Wrapper? Some people think it looks like a baked potato, but  that works too.   you are here4 287   static methods  This is stupid. You mean I can’t  just make an ArrayList of ints??? I   have to wrap every single frickin’ one in a new  Integer object, then unwrap it when I try  to access that value in the ArrayList?  That’s a waste of time and an error   waiting to happen...  Before Java 5.0, YOU had to do the work...  She’s right. In all versions of Java prior to 5.0, primitives were primitives  and object references were object references, and they were NEVER  treated interchangeably. It was always up to you, the programmer, to do  the wrapping and unwrapping. There was no way to pass a primitive to a  method expecting an object reference, and no way to assign the result of a  method returning an object reference directly to a primitive variable—even  when the returned reference is to an Integer and the primitive variable is  an int. There was simply no relationship between an Integer and an int,  other than the fact that Integer has an instance variable of type int  to hold  the primitive the Integer wraps . All the work was up to you.  An ArrayList of primitive ints  Without autoboxing  Java versions before 5.0   public void doNumsOldWay   {      ArrayList listOfNumbers = new ArrayList  ;           listOfNumbers.add new Integer 3  ;      Integer one =  Integer  listOfNumbers.get 0 ;  Make an ArrayList.  Remember, before 5.0 you could not  specify the TYPE, so all ArrayLists were lists of Objects.  You can’t add the primitive ‘3’ to the list,  so you have to wrap it in an Integer first. It comes out as type  Object, but you can cast  the Object to an Integer.      int intOne = one.intValue  ; }  Finally you can get the primitive  out of the Integer.  288  chapter 10   numbers and  statics  Autoboxing: blurring the line  bet ween primitive and object  The autoboxing feature added to Java 5.0 does  the conversion from primitive to wrapper object  automatically! Let’s see what happens when we want to make an  ArrayList to hold ints.   An ArrayList of primitive ints  With autoboxing  Java versions 5.0 or greater   public void doNumsNewWay   {  Make an ArrayList of type Integer.      ArrayList  listOfNumbers = new ArrayList   ;      listOfNumbers.add 3 ;  Just add it!      int num = listOfNumbers.get 0 ;     }  And the compiler automatically unwraps  unboxes   the Integer object so you can assign the int value  directly to a primitive without having to call the  intValue   method on the Integer object.  Although there is NOT a method in ArrayList  for add int , the compiler does all the wrapping   boxing  for you. In other words, there really IS  an Integer object stored in the ArrayList, but  you get to “pretend” that the ArrayList takes  ints.  You can add both ints and Integers to an  ArrayList .   hold ints?  Q: Why not declare an ArrayList  if you want to  A: Because... you can’t. Remember, the rule for generic   types is that you can specify only class or interface types, not  primitives.  So ArrayList  will not compile. But as you can  see from the code above, it doesn’t really matter, since the  compiler lets you put ints into the ArrayList . In fact,  there’s really no way to prevent you from putting primitives  into an ArrayList where the type of the list is the type of that  primitive’s wrapper, if you’re using a Java 5.0-compliant com- piler, since autoboxing will happen automatically. So, you can  put boolean primitives in an ArrayList  and chars  into an ArrayList .  you are here4 289   static methods  Autoboxing works almost everywhere  Autoboxing lets you do more than just the obvious wrapping and   unwrapping to use primitives in a collection... it also lets you use  either a primitive or its wrapper type virtually anywhere one or the  other is expected. Think about that!  Fun with autoboxing  Method arguments  If a method takes a wrapper type, you  can pass a reference to a wrapper or  a primitive of the matching type. And  of course the reverse is true—if a  method takes a primitive, you can  pass in either a compatible primitive  or a reference to a wrapper of that  primitive type.  Return values  If a method declares a primitive  return type, you can return either a  compatible primitive or a reference  to the wrapper of that primitive type.  And if a method declares a wrapper  return type, you can return either a  reference to the wrapper type or a  primitive of the matching type.  3 Integer    o  bject   3  int  void takeNumber Integer i  { }  int giveNumber   {    return x; }  3 Integer    o  bject   3  int  Boolean expressions  Any place a boolean value is expected,  you can use either an expression that  evaluates to a boolean  4 > 2 , or a  primitive boolean, or a reference to a  Boolean wrapper.  true boolean   o  bject   true  boolean  if  bool  {    System.out.println “true” ; }  290  chapter 10   Operations on numbers  This is probably the strangest one—yes, you  can now use a wrapper type as an operand  in operations where the primitive type is  expected. That means you can apply, say,  the increment operator against a reference  to an Integer object! But don’t worry—this is just a compiler trick.  The language wasn’t modiﬁed to make the  operators work on objects; the compiler  simply converts the object to its primitive  type before the operation. It sure looks  weird, though. Integer i = new Integer 42 ;  i++; And that means you can also do things like: Integer j = new Integer 5 ;  Integer k = j + 3;  Assignments  You can assign either a wrapper or primitive  to a variable declared as a matching wrapper  or primitive. For example, a primitive int  variable can be assigned to an Integer  reference variable, and vice-versa—a  reference to an Integer object can be  assigned to a variable declared as an int  primitive.  Sharpen your pencil  Will this code compile? Will it run? If it runs,  what will it do? Take your time and think about this one; it  brings up an implication of autoboxing that  we didn’t talk about.  You’ll have to go to your compiler to find  the answers.  Yes, we’re forcing you to  experiment, for your own good of course.   numbers and  statics  3 Integer    o  bject   3  int  i++;  3 Integer    o  bject   3  int  Double d = x;  public class TestBox {     Integer i;    int j;     public static void main  String[] args  {       TestBox t = new TestBox  ;       t.go  ;    }      public void go   {       j=i;       System.out.println j ;       System.out.println i ;    } }  you are here4 291   wrapper methods  But wait! There’s more! Wrappers   have static utility methods too!  Besides acting like a normal class, the wrappers have a  bunch of really useful static methods. We’ve used one in  this book before—Integer.parseInt  . The parse methods take a String and give you back a  primitive value.   Converting a String to a  primitive value is easy:  No problem to parse  “2” into 2.  String s = “2”; int x = Integer.parseInt s ; double d = Double.parseDouble “420.24” ;  boolean b = new Boolean “true” .booleanValue  ;  You’d think there would be a  Boolean.parseBoolean   wouldn’t you? But there  isn’t. Fortunately there’s a Boolean constructor  that takes  and parses  a String, and then you  just get the primitive value by unwrapping it.  But if you try to do this:  String t = “two”; int y = Integer.parseInt t ;  Uh-oh. This compiles just fine, but  at runtime it blows up. Anything  that can’t be parsed as a number  will cause a NumberFormatException  You’ll get a runtime exception:  File  Edit   Window  Help  Clue % java Wrappers Exception in thread “main”  java.lang.NumberFormatException: two at java.lang.Integer.parseInt Integer.java:409  at java.lang.Integer.parseInt Integer.java:458  at Wrappers.main Wrappers.java:9   Every method or  constructor that parses  a String can throw a  NumberFormatException.  It’s a runtime exception,  so you don’t have to  handle or declare it.       But you might want to.   We’ll talk about Exceptions in the  next chapter.   292  chapter 10   numbers and  statics  And now in reverse... turning a  primitive number into a String  There are several ways to turn a number into a String.  The easiest is to simply concatenate the number to an  existing String.  double d = 42.5; String doubleString = “” + d;  double d = 42.5; String doubleString = Double.toString d ;  Yeah,   but how do I make it   look like money? With a dollar  sign and two decimal places  like $56.87 or what if I want  commas like 45,687,890 or   what if I want it in...  Remember the ‘+’ operator is overloaded  in Java  the only overloaded operator  as a  String concatenator. Anything added to a  String becomes Stringified.  Another way to do it using a static  method in class Double.  Where’s my printf   like I have in C? Is  number formatting part of  the I O classes?  you are here4 293   number formatting  Number formatting In Java, formatting numbers and dates doesn’t have to be coupled with I O. Think  about it. One of the most typical ways to display numbers to a user is through a  GUI. You put Strings into a scrolling text area, or maybe a table. If formatting was  built only into print statements, you’d never be able to format a number into a nice  String to display in a GUI. Before Java 5.0, most formatting was handled through  classes in the java.text package that we won’t even look at in this version of the  book, now that things have changed. In Java 5.0, the Java team added more powerful and ﬂexible formatting through a  Formatter class in java.util. But you don’t need to create and call methods on the  Formatter class yourself, because Java 5.0 added convenience methods to some of  the I O classes  including printf    and the String class. So it’s a simple matter of  calling a static String.format   method and passing it the thing you want formatted  along with formatting instructions.  Of course, you do have to know how to supply the formatting instructions, and  that takes a little effort unless you’re familiar with the printf   function in C C++.  Fortunately, even if you don’t know printf   you can simply follow recipes for the  most basic things  that we’re showing in this chapter . But you will want to learn  how to format if you want to mix and match to get anything you want.  We’ll start here with a basic example, then look at how it works.  Note: we’ll revisit  formatting again in the I O chapter.   Formatting a number to use commas  public class TestFormats {  The number to format  we  want it to have commas .     public static void main  String[] args  {               String s = String.format “%, d”, 1000000000 ;        System.out.println s ;    } }  The formatting instructions for how to format the  second argument  which in this case is an int value .  Remember, there are only two arguments to this method  here—the first comma is INSIDE the String literal, so  it isn’t separating arguments to the format method.   1,000,000,000  Now we get commas inserted into the number.  294  chapter 10   Formatting deconstructed... At the most basic level, formatting consists of two main parts   there is more, but we’ll start with this to keep it cleaner :  1  2  Formatting instructions You use special format specifiers that describe how  the argument should be formatted.  The argument to be formatted.  Although there can be more than one argument, we’ll  start with just one. The argument type can’t be just  anything... it has to be something that can be formatted  using the format specifiers in the formatting instructions.  For example, if your formatting instructions specify a  floating point number, you can’t pass in a Dog or even a  String that looks like a floating point number.  D o   t h i  ...  s  1  to this.  2  format “%, d”, 1000000000 ;  Use these instructions... on this argument.  What do these instructions actually say? “Take the second argument to this method, and  format it as a decimal integer and insert commas.”  How do they say that?  On the next page we’ll look in more detail at what the syntax “%,  d” actually means, but for starters, any time you see the percent  sign  %  in a format String  which is always the ﬁrst argument  to a format   method , think of it as representing a variable,  and the variable is the other argument to the method. The rest  of the characters after the percent sign describe the formatting  instructions for the argument.   numbers and  statics  Note: if you already know printf    from c C++, you can probably just  skim the next few pages. Otherwise,  read careful  ly!  you are here4 295   the format   method   The percent  %  says, “insert argument here”   and format it using these instructions   The ﬁrst argument to a format   method is called the format String, and it  can actually include characters that you just want printed as-is, without extra  formatting. When you see the % sign, though, think of the percent sign as a  variable that represents the other argument to the method.  Format specifiers for the  second argument to the  method  the number .   Characters to include in  the final String returned  from format  . format “I have %.2f bugs to ﬁx.”, 476578.09876 ;  More characters to  include in the String after  the second argument is  formatted and inserted.  Argument to be  formatted.  O u t p u t  I have 476578.10 bugs to ﬁx.  Notice we lost some of the numbers  after the decimal point. Can you guess  what the “.2f” means?  The “%” sign tells the formatter to insert the other method argument  the  second argument to format  , the number  here, AND format it using the  “.2f” characters after the percent sign. Then the rest of the format String,  “bugs to ﬁx”, is added to the ﬁnal output.  Adding a comma  format “I have %,.2f bugs to ﬁx.”, 476578.09876 ;  I have 476,578.10 bugs to ﬁx.  By changing the format instructions  from “%.2f” to %,.2f”, we got a  comma in the formatted number.  296  chapter 10   numbers and  statics  But how does it even KNOW  where the instructions end and the   rest of the characters begin? How come  it doesn’t print out the “f” in “%.2f”? Or   the “2”? How does it know that the .2f  was part of the instructions and NOT   part of the String?  The format String uses its  own little language syntax  You obviously can’t put just anything after the “%”  sign. The syntax for what goes after the percent  sign follows very speciﬁc rules, and describes  how to format the argument that gets inserted at  that point in the result  formatted  String. You’ve already seen two examples: %, d  means “insert commas and format the  number as a decimal integer.” and %.2f  means “format the number as a ﬂoating  point with a precision of two decimal places.” and %,.2f  means “insert commas and format the  number as a ﬂoating point with a precision of  two decimal places.” The real question is really, “How do I know what  to put after the percent sign to get it to do what  I want?” And that includes knowing the symbols   like “d” for decimal and “f” for ﬂoating point   as well as the order in which the instructions  must be placed following the percent sign. For  example, if you put the comma after the “d” like  this: “%d,” instead of “%,d” it won’t work! Or will it? What do you think this will do:  String.format “I  have %.2f, bugs to ﬁx.”, 476578.09876 ;   We’ll answer that on the next page.   you are here4 297   format specifier  The format specifier Everything after the percent sign up to and including the type indicator  like  “d” or “f”  are part of the formatting instructions. After the type indicator, the  formatter assumes the next set of characters are meant to be part of the output  String, until or unless it hits another percent  %  sign. Hmmmm... is that even  possible? Can you have more than one formatted argument variable? Put that  thought on hold for right now; we’ll come back to it in a few minutes. For now,  let’s look at the syntax for the format speciﬁers—the things that go after the  percent  %  sign and describe how the argument should be formatted.  A format speciﬁer can have up to ﬁve different parts  not  including the “%” . Everything in brackets [ ] below is optional, so  only the percent  %  and the type are required. But the order is  also mandatory, so any parts you DO use must go in this order.  %[argument number][ﬂags][width][.precision]type We’ll get to this later...  it lets you say WHICH  argument if there’s more  than one.  Don’t worry  about it just yet.   T h e s e   a r e   f o r   s p e c i a l   f o r m a t t i n g   i k e   i n s e r t i n g   o p t i o n s   l c o m m a s ,   o r   p u t t i n g   n e g a t i v e   n u m b e r s   i n   p a r e n t h e s e s ,   o r   t o   m a k e   t h e   n u m b e r s   l e f t   j u s t i f i e d .    This defines the  MINIMUM number  of characters that  will be used. That’s  *minimum* not  TOTAL. If the number  is longer than the  width, it’ll still be used  in full, but if it’s less  than the width, it’ll be  padded with zeroes.  You already know  this one...it defines  the precision. In  other words, it  sets the number  of decimal  places.  Don’t forget to  include the “.” in  there.  Type is mandatory   see the next page   and will usually be  “d” for a decimal  integer or “f” for  a floating point  number.  %[argument number][ﬂags][width][.precision]type  format “%,6.1f”, 42.000 ;  There’s no “argument number”  specified in this format String,  but all the other pieces are there.  298  chapter 10   numbers and  statics  The only required specifier is for TYPE Although type is the only required speciﬁer, remember that if you do put  in anything else, type must always come last! There are more than a dozen  different type modiﬁers  not including dates and times; they have their own  set , but most of the time you’ll probably use %d  decimal  or %f  ﬂoating  point . And typically you’ll combine %f with a precision indicator to set the  number of decimal places you want in your output.  The TYPE is mandatory, everything else is optional.  %d  decimal  format “%d”, 42 ;  42  A 42.25 would not work! It  would be the same as trying to  directly assign a double to an  int variable.  The argument must be compatible with an int, so that means  only byte, short, int, and char  or their wrapper types .  %f   ﬂoating point format “%.3f”, 42.000000 ;  42.000  Here we combined the “f”  with a precision indicator  “.3” so we ended up with  three zeroes.  The argument must be of a ﬂoating point type, so that  means only a ﬂoat or double  primitive or wrapper  as well  as something called BigDecimal  which we don’t look at in  this book .  You must include a  type in your format  instructions, and if you  specify things besides  type, the type must  always come last.  Most of the time,  you’ll probably format  numbers using either  “d” for decimal or “f”  for f loating point.  %x  hexadecimal  format “%x”, 42 ;  2a  *  The argument must be a byte, short, int, long  including  both primitive and wrapper types , and BigInteger.   %c  character  format “%c”, 42 ;  The number 42 represents  the char “*”.  The argument must be a byte, short, char, or int  including  both primitive and wrapper types .  you are here4 299   format arguments  What happens if I have more than one argument?  Imagine you want a String that looks like this: “The rank is 20,456,654 out of 100,567,890.24.” But the numbers are coming from variables. What do you do? You simply add two  arguments after the format String  ﬁrst argument , so that means your call to format    will have three arguments instead of two. And inside that ﬁrst argument  the format  String , you’ll have two different format speciﬁers  two things that start with “%” . The  ﬁrst format speciﬁer will insert the second argument to the  method, and the second  format speciﬁer will insert the third argument to the method. In other words, the  variable insertions in the format String use the order in which the other arguments are  passed into the format   method.  int one = 20456654; double two = 100567890.248907; String s = String.format “The rank is %,d out of %,.2f”, one, two ;  The rank is 20,456,654 out of 100,567,890.25  We added commas to both variables,  and restricted the floating point  number  the second variable  to two  decimal places.  When you have more than one  argument, they’re inserted  using the order in which you  pass them to the format    method.  As you’ll see when we get to date formatting, you might actually want to apply different  formatting speciﬁers to the same argument. That’s probably hard to imagine until you  see how date formatting  as opposed to the number formating we’ve been doing  works.  Just know that in a minute, you’ll see how to be more speciﬁc about which format  speciﬁers are applied to which arguments.  Q: Um, there’s something REALLY strange going on here.  Just how many arguments can I   pass? I mean, how many overloaded format   methods are IN the String class? So, what happens  if I want to pass, say, ten different arguments to be formatted for a single output String?  A: Good catch. Yes, there is something strange  or at least new and different  going on, and   no there are not a bunch of overloaded format   methods to take a different number of possible  arguments.  In order to support this new formatting  printf-like  API in Java, the language needed  another new feature—variable argument lists  called varargs for short . We’ll talk about varargs  only in the appendix because outside of formatting, you probably won’t use them much in a well- designed system.  300  chapter 10   numbers and  statics  So much for numbers, what about dates?  Imagine you want a String that looks like this: “Sunday, Nov 28 2004” Nothing special there, you say? Well, imagine that all you have to start with is a variable  of type Date—A Java class that can represent a timestamp, and now you want to take that  object  as opposed to a number  and send it through the formatter. The main difference between number and date formatting is that date formats use a  two-character type that starts with “t”  as opposed to the single character “f” or “d”, for  example . The examples below should give you a good idea of how it works:  The complete date and time   %tc  String.format “%tc”, new Date   ; Sun Nov 28 14:52:41 MST 2004  Just the time   %tr  String.format “%tr”, new Date   ;  03:01:47 PM  Day of the week, month and day     %tA  %tB  %td  There isn’t a single format speciﬁer that will do exactly what we  want, so we have to combine three of them for day of the week   %tA , month  %tB , and day of the month  %td .  Date today = new Date  ; String.format “%tA, %tB %td”,today,today,today ;        The comma is not part of the formatting... it’s  just the character we want printed after the  first inserted formatted argument.  But that means we have to  pass the Date object in three  times, one for each part of the  format that we want. In other  words, the %tA will give us just  the day of the week, but then  we have to do it again to get  just the month and again for the  day.of the month.  Sunday, November 28  Same as above, but without duplicating the arguments   %tA  %tB  %td  Date today = new Date  ; String.format “%tA, %<tB %<td”,today ;        You can think of this as kind of like calling three  different getter  methods on the Date object, to  get three different pieces of data from it.  The angle-bracket “<” is just another  flag in the specifier that tells the  formatter to “use the previous argument  again.” So it saves you from repeating the  arguments, and instead you format the  same argument three different ways.  you are here4 301   Let’s see... how many work  days will there be if the  project starts on Feb 27th and  ends on August 5th?  Working with Dates You need to do more with dates than just get  today’s date. You need your programs to adjust  dates, ﬁnd elapsed times, prioritize schedules,  heck, make schedules. You need industrial  strength date manipulation capabilities.  You could make your own date routines of  course...  and don’t forget about leap years!   And, ouch, those occasional, pesky leap- seconds. Wow, this could get complicated. The  good news is that the Java API is rich with  classes that can help you manipulate dates.  Sometimes it feels a little too rich...  manipulating dates  302  chapter 10   numbers and  statics  For a time-stamp of “now”,  use Date. But for everything  else, use Calendar.  Moving backward and forward in time Let’s say your company’s work schedule is Monday through Friday.  You’ve been assigned the task of ﬁguring out the last work day in  each calendar month this year...   It seems that java.util.Date is actually... out of date  Earlier we used java.util.Date to ﬁnd today’s date, so it seems  logical that this class would be a good place to start looking for  some handy date manipulation capabilities, but when you check  out the API you’ll ﬁnd that most of Date’s methods have been  deprecated!  The Date class is still great for getting a “time stamp”—an object  that represents the current date and time, so use it when you want  to say, “give me NOW”.  The good news is that the API recommends java.util.Calendar  instead, so let’s take a look:  Use java.util.Calendar for your date manipulation  The designers of the Calendar API wanted to think globally,  literally. The basic idea is that when you want to work with dates,  you ask for a Calendar  through a static method of the Calendar  class that you’ll see on the next page , and the JVM hands you back  an instance of a concrete subclass of Calendar.  Calendar is actually  an abstract class, so you’re always working with a concrete subclass.  More interesting, though, is that the kind of calendar you get  back will be appropriate for your locale. Much of the world uses the  Gregorian calendar, but if you’re in an area that doesn’t use a  Gregorian calendar you can get Java libraries to handle other  calendars such as Buddhist, or Islamic or Japanese. The standard Java API ships with java.util.GregorianCalendar, so  that’s what we’ll be using here. For the most part, though, you  don’t even have to think about the kind of Calendar subclass you’re  using, and instead focus only on the methods of the Calendar class.  you are here4 303   getting a Calendar  Getting an object that extends Calendar How in the world do you get an “instance” of an abstract class?  Well you don’t of course, this won’t work:  This WON’T work: Calendar cal = new Calendar  ;  The compiler won’t allow this!  Instead, use the static “getInstance  ” method: Calendar cal = Calendar.getInstance  ;  This syntax should look familiar at this  point - we’re invoking a static method.  Wait a minute.   If you can’t make an  instance of the Calendar  class, what exactly are you  assigning to that Calendar   reference?  You can’t get an instance of Calendar,  but you can can get an instance of a  concrete Calendar subclass.  Obviously you can’t get an instance of Calendar, because  Calendar is abstract. But you’re still free to call static methods  on Calendar, since static methods are called on the class,  rather than on a particular instance. So you call the static  getInstance   on Calendar and it gives you back... an instance  of a concrete subclass. Something that extends Calendar   which means it can be polymorphically assigned to Calendar   and which—by contract—can respond to the methods of class  Calendar. In most of the world, and by default for most versions of Java,  you’ll be getting back a java.util.GregorianCalendar instance.  304  chapter 10   numbers and  statics  Working with Calendar objects There are several key concepts you’ll need to understand in   order to work with Calendar objects: ß  Fields hold state - A Calendar object has many ﬁelds that are used to   represent aspects of its ultimate state, its date and time. For instance, you  can get and set a Calendar’s year or month.  ß  Dates and Times can be incremented - The Calendar class has methods that  allow you to add and subtract values from various ﬁelds, for example “add  one to the month”, or “subtract three years”.  ß  Dates and Times can be represented in milliseconds - The Calendar class  lets you convert your dates into and out of a millisecond representation.   Speciﬁcally, the number of milliseconds that have occured since January  1st, 1970.  This allows you to perform precise calculations such as “elapsed  time between two times” or “add 63 hours and 23 minutes and 12 seconds  to this time”.  An example of working with a Calendar object:      Calendar c = Calendar.getInstance  ;      c.set 2004,0,7,15,40 ;      long day1 = c.getTimeInMillis  ;     1 5 : 4 0 .   e d .    7 , n t h      J a n .   m o    2 0 0 4   a t   o - b a s   t o S e t   t i m e   z e s i   t h e e   N o t i c ’  Convert this to a big ol iseconds. amount of mi  r  l  l      day1 += 1000 * 60 * 60;      c.setTimeInMillis day1 ;  Add an hour’s worth of millis, then update the time.    Notice the “+=”, it’s like day1 = day1 + ... .       System.out.println “new hour “ + c.get c.HOUR_OF_DAY  ;      c.add c.DATE, 35 ;      c.roll c.DATE, 35 ;      c.set c.DATE, 1 ;      System.out.println “add 35 days “ + c.getTime   ;      System.out.println “roll 35 days “ + c.getTime   ;      System.out.println “set to 1 “ + c.getTime   ;  Add 35 days to the date, which  should move us into February.  “Roll” 35 days onto this date. This  “rolls” the date ahead 35 days, but  DOES NOT change the month! We’re not incrementing here, just  doing a “set” of the date.

This is a big API, so  we’re showing only a few of the most common ﬁ elds  and methods that you’ll use. Once you get a few of  these it should be pretty easy to bend the rest of the  this API to your will.  Key Calendar Methods  Adds or subtracts time from the calendar’s field.  add int ﬁ  eld, int amount    get int ﬁ  eld   Returns the value of the given calendar field.  getInstance    Returns a Calendar, you can specify a locale.  getTimeInMillis    Returns this Calendar’s time in millis, as a long.  roll int ﬁ  eld, boolean up   Adds or subtracts time without changing larger fields. Adds or subtracts time without changing larger fields.  set int ﬁ  eld, int value   Sets the value of a given Calendar field.  set year, month, day, hour, minute    all ints  A common variety of set to set a complete time.  setTimeInMillis long millis   Sets a Calendar’s time based on a long milli-time.     more...  306  chapter 10  Key Calendar Fields  DATE     DAY_OF_MONTH Get   set the day of month   HOUR   HOUR _OF_DAY   MILLISECOND  Get   set the milliseconds.

Even more Statics!... static imports New to Java 5.0... a real mixed blessing. Some people love  this idea, some people hate it. Static imports exist only to save  you some typing. If you hate to type, you might just like this  feature. The downside to static imports is that - if you’re not  careful - using them can make your code a lot harder to read.  The basic idea is that whenever you’re using a static class, a  static variable, or an enum  more on those later , you can  import them, and save yourself some typing.  Some old-fashioned code:  import java.lang.Math;  class NoStatic {    public static void main String [] args  {      System.out.println “sqrt “ + Math.sqrt 2.0  ;      System.out.println “tan “ + Math.tan 60  ;    }  }    }  }  Same code, with static imports:  import static java.lang.System.out;  import static java.lang.Math.*;  class WithStatic {    public static void main String [] args  {      out.println “sqrt “ + sqrt 2.0  ;      out.println “tan “ + tan 60  ;  Static imports in action.     s.  n  t  e  r  h  o  w  p  s    e  i m  o  u   t i c  t  a     t  x  s     a  g  y  t  n r i n  e  s   c l a  T h d  e  numbers and  statics  Use Carefully: static imports can  make your code  confusing to read   Caveats & Gotchas  ß   If you’re only going to use a static member  a few times, we think you should avoid  static imports, to help keep the code more  readable.  ß   If you’re going to use a static member a lot,   like doing lots of Math calculations , then  it’s probably OK to use the static import. ß  Notice that you can use wildcards  .* , in   your static import declaration.  ß  A big issue with static imports is that it’s   not too hard to create naming conflicts. For  example, if you have two different classes  with an “add  ” method, how will you and  the compiler know which one to use?  you are here4 307   static vs. instance  Tonight’s Talk: An instance variable  takes cheap shots at a static variable  Static Variable  Instance Variable I don’t even know why we’re doing this.  Everyone knows static variables are just used  for constants. And how many of those are  there? I think the whole API must have, what,  four? And it’s not like anybody ever uses  them.  Full of it. Yeah, you can say that again. OK,  so there are a few in the Swing library, but  everybody knows Swing is just a special case.   Ok, but besides a few GUI things, give me an  example of just one static variable that anyone  would actually use. In the real world.  Well, that’s another special case. And nobody  uses that except for debugging anyway.  You really should check your facts. When  was the last time you looked at the API? It’s  frickin’ loaded with statics! It even has entire  classes dedicated to holding constant values.  There’s a class called SwingConstants, for  example, that’s just full of them.  It might be a special case, but it’s a really  important one! And what about the Color  class? What a pain if you had to remember the  RGB values to make the standard colors? But  the color class already has constants deﬁned  for blue, purple, white, red, etc. Very handy.  How’s System.out for starters? The out in  System.out is a static variable of the System  class. You personally don’t make a new  instance of the System, you just ask the System  class for its out variable.  Oh, like debugging isn’t important?  And here’s something that probably never  crossed your narrow mind—let’s face it, static  variables are more efﬁcient. One per class  instead of one per instance. The memory  savings might be huge!  308  chapter 10   numbers and  statics  Instance Variable Um, aren’t you forgetting something?   Static Variable  What?  Static variables are about as un-OO as it gets!!  Gee why not just go take a giant backwards  step and do some procedural programming  while we’re at it.  You’re like a global variable, and any  programmer worth his PDA knows that’s  usually a Bad Thing.  What do you mean un-OO?   I am NOT a global variable. There’s no such  thing. I live in a class! That’s pretty OO you  know, a CLASS. I’m not just sitting out there  in space somewhere; I’m a natural part of the  state of an object; the only difference is that  I’m shared by all instances of a class. Very  efﬁcient.  Alright just stop right there. THAT is  deﬁnitely not true. Some static variables are  absolutely crucial to a system. And even the  ones that aren’t crucial sure are handy.  Why do you say that? And what’s wrong with  static methods?  Sure, I know that objects should be the focus  of an OO design, but just because there are  some clueless programmers out there... don’t  throw the baby out with the bytecode. There’s  a time and place for statics, and when you  need one, nothing else beats it.  Yeah you live in a class, but they don’t call  it Class-Oriented programming. That’s just  stupid. You’re a relic. Something to help the  old-timers make the leap to java.  Well, OK, every once in a while sure, it makes  sense to use a static, but let me tell you, abuse  of static variables  and methods  is the mark  of an immature OO programmer. A designer  should be thinking about object state, not class  state.  Static methods are the worst things of all,  because it usually means the programmer is  thinking procedurally instead of about objects  doing things based on their unique object  state.  Riiiiiight.

Stuff happens. The file isn’t there. The server is down. No matter how   good a programmer you are, you can’t control everything. Things can go wrong. Very wrong.   When you write a risky method, you need code to handle the bad things that might happen.    But how do you know when a method is risky? And where do you put the code to handle the   exceptional situation? So far in this book, we haven’t really taken any risks. We’ve certainly had   things go wrong at runtime, but the problems were mostly flaws in our own code. Bugs. And   those we should fix at development time. No, the problem-handling code we’re talking about   here is for code that you can’t guaranatee will work at runtime. Code that expects the file to be   in the right directory, the server to be running, or the Thread to stay asleep. And we have to do   this now. Because in this chapter, we’re going to build something that uses the risky JavaSound   API.  We’re going to build a MIDI Music Player.  this is a new chapter  315   building the MIDI Music Player  Let’s make a Music Machine Over the next three chapters, we’ll build a few different sound  applications, including a BeatBox Drum Machine. In fact,  before the book is done, we’ll have a multi-player version so  you can send your drum loops to another player, kind of like  a chat room. You’re going to write the whole thing, although  you can choose to use Ready-bake code for the GUI parts.  OK, so not every IT department is looking for a new BeatBox  server, but we’re doing this to learn more about Java. Building  a BeatBox is just a way to have fun while we’re learning Java. The finished BeatBox looks something like this:  You make a beatbox loop  a 16-beat drum pattern   by putting checkmarks in the boxes.   dance beat  Andy: groove 2  Chris: groove2 revised  Nigel: dance beat  ,     s a g e ,      t h a t   g e t s y o u r   m e s   p l a y e r s s e n t   t o   t h e   o t h e r   a l o n g   w i t h   y o u r   c u r r e n t     w h e n   y o u   b e a t   p a t t e r n , “ S e n d I t ” h i t    incoming messages from  other players. Click one  to load the pattern that  goes with it, and then click  ‘Start’ to play it.  Put checkmarks in the boxes for each of the 16 ‘beats’. For example, on beat  1  of 16  the Bass drum and the Maracas will play, on beat 2 nothing, and  on beat 3 the Maracas and Closed Hi-Hat... you get the idea. When you hit  ‘Start’, it plays your pattern in a loop until you hit ‘Stop’. At any time, you  can “capture” one of your own patterns by sending it to the BeatBox server   which means any other players can listen to it . You can also load any of the  incoming patterns by clicking on the message that goes with it.  316  chapter 11   We’ll start with the basics Obviously we’ve got a few things to learn before the whole  program is ﬁnished, including how to build a Swing GUI, how  to connect to another machine via networking, and a little I O  so we can send something to the other machine. Oh yeah, and the JavaSound API. That’s where we’ll start in this  chapter. For now, you can forget the GUI, forget the networking  and the I O, and focus only on getting some MIDI-generated  sound to come out of your computer. And don’t worry if you  don’t know a thing about MIDI, or a thing about reading or  making music. Everything you need to learn is covered here.  You can almost smell the record deal.  The JavaSound API JavaSound is a collection of classes and interfaces added to  Java starting with version 1.3. These aren’t special add-ons;  they’re part of the standard J2SE class library. JavaSound is split  into two parts: MIDI and Sampled. We use only MIDI in this  book. MIDI stands for Musical Instrument Digital Interface,  and is a standard protocol for getting different kinds of  electronic sound equipment to communicate. But for  our BeatBox app, you can think of MIDI as a kind of  sheet music that you feed into some device you can think  of like a high-tech ‘player piano’. In other words, MIDI  data doesn’t actually include any sound, but it does  include the instructions that a MIDI-reading instrument  can play back. Or for another analogy, you can think of  a MIDI ﬁle like an HTML document, and the instrument  that renders the MIDI ﬁle  i.e. plays it  is like the Web  browser.  MIDI data says what to do  play middle C, and here’s how hard  to hit it, and here’s how long to hold it, etc.  but it doesn’t say  anything at all about the actual sound you hear. MIDI doesn’t  know how to make a ﬂute, piano, or Jimmy Hendrix guitar  sound. For the actual sound, we need an instrument  a MIDI  device  that can read and play a MIDI ﬁle. But the device is  usually more like an entire band or orchestra of instruments. And  that instrument might be a physical device, like the electronic  keyboard synthesizers the rock musicians play, or it could  even be an instrument built entirely in software, living in your  computer.  For our BeatBox, we use only the built-in, software-only  instrument that you get with Java. It’s called a synthesizer  some  folks refer to it as a software synth  because it creates sound.  Sound that you hear.   exception handling  MIDI file     n  e  a  b  o r m a t i n f o i   s a h   e l d   u o h s   g n o s   a o w   v h n ’ t   s e i t   d o u t   b k i   I t ’ s n d   d a t a .   u o s c t i u s t r n i   c i s e t   m u e o . n r - p i a e y l a p      f il M I D I h u t   o b a e d ,   y l a p   a l c t u a h s e li k a   f o    r    a   e n d   n o  s    y n o f      t  n  e  m  u  r  t  s    I n  b l e  a  p  a  c  M I D I -  r  e  k  a  e  p  S  MIDI device knows how to  ‘read’ a MIDI file and play back  the sound. The device might  be a synthesizer keyboard or  some other kind of instrument.  Usually, a MIDI instrument  can play a LOT of different  sounds  piano, drums, violin,  etc. , and all at the same time.  So a MIDI file isn’t like sheet  music for just one musician in  the band -- it can hold the  parts for ALL the musicians  playing a particular song.   you are here4  317   but it looked so simple  First we need a Sequencer Before we can get any sound to play, we need a Sequencer object. The  sequencer is the object that takes all the MIDI data and sends it to the right  instruments. It’s the thing that plays the music.  A sequencer can do a lot of  different things, but in this book, we’re using it strictly as a playback device. Like  a CD-player on your stereo, but with a few added features. The Sequencer class  is in the javax.sound.midi package  part of the standard Java library as of version  1.3 . So let’s start by making sure we can make  or get  a Sequencer object.  n d . m i d i  o  s  u  a  k  e  g  c  a  p     j     v  o  a  a x .  i m p  r t   t h e  import javax.sound.midi.*;  We need a Sequencer object. It’s the  main part of the MIDI device instrument  we’re using. It’s the thing that, well,  public class MusicTest1 {   sequences all the MIDI information into       . But we don’t make a brand      public void play   { a ‘song’ new one ourselves -- we have to ask the          Sequencer sequencer = MidiSystem.getSequencer  ;                 MidiSystem to give us one.         System.out.println “We got a sequencer” ;          }    close play      public static void main String[] args  {         MusicTest1 mt = new MusicTest1  ;         mt.play  ;     }    close main }    close class  Something’s wrong!

I failed.”  Java’s exception-handling mechanism is a clean, well-lighted way to handle “exceptional  situations” that pop up at runtime; it lets you put all your error-handling code in one  easy-to-read place. It’s based on you knowing that the method you’re calling is risky   i.e. that the method might generate an exception , so that you can write code to deal  with that possibility. If you know you might get an exception when you call a particular  method, you can be prepared for—possibly even recover from—the problem that  caused  the exception.  So, how do you know if a method throws an exception?  You ﬁ nd a throws clause in the  risky method’s declaration.  The getSequencer   method takes a risk. It can fail at runtime.        So it must  ‘declare’ the risk you take when you call it.

That compiler doesn’t care how you  handle it; it cares only that you say you’re taking  care of it.  import javax.sound.midi.*;  public class MusicTest1 {        public void play   {  Dear Compiler,    I know I’m taking a risk here, but  don’t you think it’s worth it?

An exception is an object... of type Exception.  Which is fortunate, because it would be much harder  to remember if exceptions were of type Broccoli.   Remember from your polymorphism chapters that  an object of type Exception can be an instance of any  subclass of Exception.  Because an Exception is an object, what you catch is an  object. In the following code, the catch argument  is declared as type Exception, and the parameter  reference variable is ex.   try {       do risky thing  li k s t   u j   s i t ’ o d     m e t h a } catch Exception ex  {       try to recover }  g     l a c   d e u m e g r  e a  r i n n t .  This code only runs if an  Exception is thrown.  What you write in a catch block depends on the  exception that was thrown. For example, if a server  is down you might use the catch block to try another  server. If the ﬁ le isn’t there, you might ask the user  for help ﬁ nding it.  Don’t try this at home.

IOException  InterruptedException  322  chapter 11   If it’s your code that catches the exception,  then whose code throws it? You’ll spend much more of your Java coding time handling  exceptions than you’ll spend creating and throwing them yourself.  For now, just know that when your code calls a risky method—a  method that declares an exception—it’s the risky  method that  throws the exception back to you, the caller.  In reality, it might be you who wrote both classes. It really  doesn’t matter who writes the code... what matters is knowing  which method throws the exception and    which method catches it. When somebody writes code  that could throw an exception, they  must declare the exception.  1  Risky, exception-throwing code:    m e t h o d   M U S T   t e l s i t   t h r r i n c l a    public void takeRisk   throws BadException {      if  abandonAllHope  {        throw new BadException  ;      }   }    t h a t    t h i d e  g     create a new Exception  object and throw it.  exception handling  thr o  w s   an exception back  2  1  calls risky method  class Cow {   void moo   {     if  serverDown {       explode  ;      }    } }  class Bar {   void go   {      moo  ;   }    int stuff   {      x.beep  ;   } }  your code your code  class with a  class with a  risky method    b y   r l d     w o e   B a d E x c  p t i o  n    t h e l a   o w s  One method will  catch what another  method throws. An  exception is always  thrown back to the  caller. The method that  throws has to declare  that it might throw  the exception.  2  Your code that calls the risky method:      public void crossFingers   {      try {        anObject.takeRisk  ;      } catch  BadException ex  {        System.out.println “Aaargh!” ;        ex.printStackTrace  ;   }    If you can’t recover from the exception, at LEAST  get a stack trace using the printStackTrace   method  that all exceptions inherit.  you are here4  323   checked and unchecked exceptions  Exceptions that are NOT subclasses of  RuntimeException are checked for by  the compiler. They’re called “checked  exceptions”  Exception  IOException  InterruptedException  RuntimeException  The compiler checks for everything  except RuntimeExceptions. The compiler guarantees:  1  2  If you throw an exception in your code you must declare it using  the throws keyword in your method declaration.  If you call a method that throws an exception  in other words,  a method that declares it throws an exception , you must  acknowledge that you’re aware of the exception possibility.     One way to satisfy the compiler is to wrap the call in a try catch.   There’s a second way we’ll look   at a little later in this chapter.

ClassCastException  NullPointerException  Q: Wait just a minute! How come this is the FIRST time   we’ve had to try catch an Exception? What about the  exceptions I’ve already gotten like NullPointerException  and the exception for DivideByZero. I even got a  NumberFormatException from the Integer.parseInt    method. How come we didn’t have to catch those?  A: The compiler cares about all subclasses of Exception,   unless they are a special type, RuntimeException. Any  exception class that extends RuntimeException gets a  free pass. RuntimeExceptions can be thrown anywhere,  with or without throws declarations or try catch blocks.  The compiler doesn’t bother checking whether a method  declares that it throws a RuntimeException, or whether the  caller acknowledges that they might get that exception at  runtime.  Q: I’ll bite. WHY doesn’t the compiler care about those   runtime exceptions? Aren’t they just as likely to bring the  whole show to a stop?  A: Most RuntimeExceptions come from a problem in   your code logic, rather than a condition that fails at runtime  in ways that you cannot predict or prevent. You cannot  guarantee the file is there. You cannot guarantee the server  is up. But you can make sure your code doesn’t index off the  end of an array  that’s what the .length attribute is for .   You WANT RuntimeExceptions to happen at development  and testing time. You don’t want to code in a try catch, for  example, and have the overhead that goes with it, to catch  something that shouldn’t happen in the first place.   A try catch is for handling exceptional situations, not flaws  in your code. Use your catch blocks to try to recover from  situations you can’t guarantee will succeed. Or at the very   least, print out a message to the user and a stack trace, so  somebody can figure out what happened.  324  chapter 11    BULLET POINTS  ß  A method can throw an exception when something fails at runtime. ß  An exception is always an object of type Exception.  Which, as you   remember from the polymorphism chapters means the object is from a  class that has Exception somewhere up its inheritance tree.    ß  The compiler does NOT pay attention to exceptions that are of   type RuntimeException. A RuntimeException does not have to be  declared or wrapped in a try catch  although you’re free to do either or  both of those things   ß  All Exceptions the compiler cares about are called ‘checked   exceptions’ which really means compiler-checked exceptions. Only  RuntimeExceptions are excluded from compiler checking. All other  exceptions must be acknowledged in your code, according to the  rules.  ß  A method throws an exception with the keyword throw, followed by   a new exception object:         throw new NoCaffeineException  ; ß  Methods that might throw a checked exception must announce it with   a throws Exception declaration.  ß   ß   ß   If your code calls a checked-exception-throwing method, it must  reassure the compiler that precautions have been taken.   If you’re prepared to handle the exception, wrap the call in a try catch,  and put your exception handling recovery code in the catch block.  If you’re not prepared to handle the exception, you can still make the  compiler happy by officially ‘ducking’ the exception. We’ll talk about   ducking a little later in this chapter.

If you try to cook something, you start by turning on  the oven.  If the thing you try is a complete failure,  you have to turn off the oven.  Are you sure  you want to try   this?  No matter what, do NOT let  me forget to turn off the  oven! Last time I torched half   the neighborhood.   If the thing you try succeeds,   you have to turn off the oven. You have to turn off the oven no matter what!  A ﬁnally block is where you put  code that must run regardless  of an exception.       try {        turnOvenOn  ;        x.bake  ;             } catch  BakingException ex  {                   ex.printStackTrace  ;      } ﬁnally {           turnOvenOff  ;      }  Without ﬁnally, you have to put the  turnOvenOff   in both the try and the catch  because you have to turn off the oven no matter  what. A ﬁnally block lets you put all your  important cleanup code in one place instead of  duplicating it like this:       try {        turnOvenOn  ;        x.bake  ;        turnOvenOff  ;      } catch  BakingException ex  {                   ex.printStackTrace  ;           turnOvenOff  ;      }       If the try block fails  an exception , flow  control immediately moves to the catch block.  When the catch block completes, the finally  block runs. When the finally block completes,  the rest of the method continues on.   If the try block succeeds  no exception ,  flow control skips over the catch block and  moves to the finally block. When the finally  block completes, the rest of the method  continues on.  If the try or catch block has a return  statement, ﬁnally will still run! Flow  jumps to the finally, then back to the return.  you are here4  327   Look at the code to the left.

A method can throw multiple exceptions if it darn well needs to. But  a method’s declaration must declare all the checked exceptions it can  throw  although if two or more exceptions have a common superclass, the  method can declare just the superclass.   Catching multiple exceptions The compiler will make sure that you’ve handled all the checked excep- tions thrown by the method you’re calling. Stack the catch blocks under  the try, one after the other. Sometimes the order in which you stack the  catch blocks matters, but we’ll get to that a little later.  public class Laundry {     public void doLaundry   throws PantsException,     LingerieException { ‘ e m ,            code that could throw either exception  LingerieException         }  }    t w o ,  e  s  r  o  u  c     n t      m e t h o d   d e p t i o e x c  e  n  s T h i T W O    c l a   . s  if doLaundry   throws a  PantsException, it lands in the  PantsException catch block.  public class Foo {      public void go   {         Laundry laundry = new Laundry  ;        try {             laundry.doLaundry  ;         } catch PantsException pex  { } catch PantsException pex  {                 recovery code          } catch LingerieException lex  { } catch LingerieException lex  {                 recovery code         }     } }      t h r o w s    a   i f   d o L a u n d r y     i n   t h e   L i n g e r i e E x c e p t i o n ,   i t   l a n d s L i n g e r i e E x c e p t i o n   c a t c h   b l o c k .  you are here4  329   polymorphic exceptions   Exceptions are polymorphic Exceptions are objects, remember. There’s nothing all that  special about one, except that it is a thing that can be thrown.  So like all good objects, Exceptions can be referred to  polymorphically. A LingerieException object, for example,  could be assigned to a ClothingException reference. A  PantsException could be assigned to an Exception reference.  You get the idea. The beneﬁ t for exceptions is that a method  doesn’t have to explicitly declare every possible exception it  might throw; it can declare a superclass of the exceptions.  Same thing with catch blocks—you don’t have to write a catch  for each possible exception as long as the catch  or    catches   you have can handle any exception thrown.  1  You can DECLARE exceptions using  a supertype of the exceptions you  throw.      public void doLaundry   throws ClothingException {  {           Declaring a ClothingException lets you throw  any subclass of ClothingException . That means  doLaundry   can throw a PantsException,  LingerieException, TeeShirtException, and  DressShirtException without explicitly declaring them  individually.

You could write your exception-handling code so that  you specify only one catch block, using the supertype  Exception in the catch clause, so that you’ll be able to  catch any exception that might be thrown.     laundry.doLaundry  ;  } catch Exception ex  {          recovery code...        try {  }       l R e c o v e r y   f r o m   W H A T ?

For example, if your code deals with  or recovers  from  a TeeShirtException differently than it handles a  LingerieException, write a catch block for each. But if you  treat all other types of ClothingException in the same way,  then add a ClothingException catch to handle the rest.  try {     laundry.doLaundry  ;  } catch TeeShirtException tex  {         recovery from TeeShirtException  } catch LingerieException lex  { } catch LingerieException lex  {         recovery from LingerieException  } catch ClothingException cex  { } catch ClothingException cex  {         recovery from all others  }  d     d  s k  n  e u  e    c     h s .     s  n  a  n   o y b l o  s        p  t i o t i o s e ,   c t  p  a  n o h  e  e  d c  t E x h i r r i e E x e c   y r e t n e r e  v f  c  c  o     S g  e T e L i n c e r d i f  o     t  e e  r s  n     e u  d i f u l d  o  f     All other ClothingExceptions  are caught here.  you are here4  331   order of multiple catch blocks  Multiple catch blocks must be ordered  from smallest to biggest  ClothingException  catch TeeShirtException tex   PantsException PantsException  LingerieException  ShirtException  UniformException UniformException UniformException  catch ShirtException sex   TeeShirtException  DressShirtException  r  e  t     h  a  o        r  e    s n t i o p e c o n   t u b e ,  f i t . w ill     t E x r e h   s n t i o  h i r t p  h  e  T e c e  a  e  u  x  S g c  s t  w ill    a ll      n t i o   t h g  h  u  c  t i o p e b e ,  r e c t E x   e r a  c  e  n  u  p  a  h  t E x   t e h i r S s e s  s     e .  r  e  h i r g     r c l a  r  e  S e h  b  T e n o  e  e t  v  u  s  s  o  n  t i o p e h a l t e ,  a   n t i o p w ill    n     n  n  h  e  u  g  d  e     v     r     g E x h i n t e h   t h g u c t E x h i r p e c t E x f   h is t    a  c  r e t i o r .  a  A ll  C l o c   e r a S e T e h i r S t e g  The higher up the inheritance tree, the bigger the  catch ‘basket’. As you    move down the inheritance  tree, toward more and more specialized Exception  classes, the catch ‘basket’ is smaller. It’s just plain old  polymorphism.  A ShirtException catch is big enough to take  a TeeShirtException or a DressShirtException   and any future subclass of anything that extends  ShirtException . A ClothingException is even bigger   i.e. there are more things that can be referenced  using a ClothingException type . It can take an  exception of type ClothingException duh , and  any ClothingException subclasses:  PantsException,  UniformException, LingerieException, and  ShirtException. The mother of all catch arguments  is type Exception; it will catch any exception,  including runtime  unchecked  exceptions, so you  probably won’t use it outside of testing.  catch ClothingException cex   332  chapter 11   You can’t put bigger baskets  above smaller baskets.  Well, you can but it won’t compile. Catch  blocks are not like overloaded methods  where the best match is picked. With catch  blocks, the JVM simply starts at the ﬁ rst one  and works its way down until it ﬁ nds a catch  that’s broad enough  in other words, high  enough on the inheritance tree  to handle  the exception. If your ﬁ rst catch block is  catch Exception ex , the compiler  knows there’s no point in adding any  others—they’ll never be reached.  h is!  t     o  d     n ’ t  D o  try {    laundry.doLaundry  ; laundry.doLaundry  ;   }  catch ClothingException cex  {  }  catch ClothingException cex  {         recovery from ClothingException   }  catch LingerieException lex  {  }  catch LingerieException lex  {        recovery from LingerieException   }  catch ShirtException sex  {  }  catch ShirtException sex  {         recovery from ShirtException   }            exception handling  Size matters when  you have multiple catch   blocks. The one with the biggest  basket has to be on the bottom.   Otherwise, the ones with  smaller baskets are useless.  Siblings can be in any order, because they  can’t catch one another’s exceptions.   You could put ShirtException above  LingerieException and nobody would mind.   Because even though ShirtException is a bigger   broader  type because it can catch other classes   its own subclasses , ShirtException can’t catch a  LingerieException so there’s no problem.  you are here4  333   Assume the try catch block here is legally coded. Your task is to draw  two different class diagrams that can accurately reﬂ ect the Exception  classes. In other words, what class inheritance structures would make the  try catch blocks in the sample code legal?  Your task is to create two different legal try   catch structures  similar to  the one above left , to accurately represent the class diagram shown on  the left.

There is NO way I’m   catching that thing. I’m gettin’   out of the way-- somebody   behind me can handle it.  When you don’t want to handle  an exception... an exception...  j u s t   d u c k    i t  If you don’t want to handle an  exception, you can duck it by  declaring it. When you call a risky method, the compiler  needs you to acknowledge it. Most of the time,  that means wrapping the risky call in a try  catch. But you have another alternative, simply  duck it and let the method that called you catch  the exception.   It’s easy—all you have to do is declare that  you throw the exceptions. Even though,  technically, you aren’t the one doing the  throwing, it doesn’t matter. You’re still the one  letting the exception whiz right on      by.  But if you duck an exception, then you don’t  have a try catch, so what happens when the  risky method  doLaundry    does throw the  exception?  When a method throws an exception, that  method is popped off the stack immediately,  and the exception is thrown to the next  method down the stack—the caller. But if the  caller is a ducker, then there’s no catch for it so  the caller pops off the stack immediately, and  the exception is thrown to the next method  and so on... where does it end? You’ll see a  little later.  public void foo   throws ReallyBadException {       call risky method without a try catch    laundry.doLaundry  ; }  u    b u t   i t , o w   r n ’ t   R E A L L Y   t h   h a t c y   c   d o   t r Y o a   e v a h n ’ t     d o   a ll, u o c y     u e o c y i n o d   s   m e t h y o d ” k s r i   m e t h   e   t h y r k f o s r i “   e o w   t h   Y O U   n   e a s Y O U   a ll c   r e v e o   w h o w , n . n p t i o   e s u e a e x c c B e   e   t h   w i t h a l   d e   t o s a h  r  .     you are here4  335   handle or declare  Ducking  by declaring  only  delays the inevitable  Sooner or later, somebody has to  deal with it.

But foo   doesn’t have a  try catch, so...  main  foo   pops off the  stack immediately and  the exception is thrown  back to... who? What?  There’s  nobody left  but the JVM, and it’s  thinking, “Don’t expect  ME to get you out of  this.”  We’re using the tee-shirt to represent a Clothing  Exception. We know, we know... you would  have preferred the blue jeans.  336  chapter 11   exception handling  Handle or Declare. It’s the law.   So now we’ve seen both ways to satisfy the compiler  when you call a risky  exception-throwing  method.  1  HANDLE Wrap the risky call in a try catch  try {    laundry.doLaundry  ; } catch ClothingException cex  {         recovery code }      This had better be a big enough catch to  handle all exceptions that doLaundry    might throw. Or else the compiler will  still complain that you’re not catching all  of the exceptions.  2  DECLARE  duck it  Declare that YOUR method throws the same exceptions  as the risky method you’re calling.  void foo   throws ClothingException {    laundry.doLaundry  ; }       a     m e t h o d   t h r o w s   T h e   d o L a u n d r y     b u t   b y   d e c l a r i n g   t h e   C l o t h i n g E x c e p t i o n ,   t o     m e t h o d   g e t s     t h e   f o o   e x c e p t i o n ,   N o   t r y   c a t c h . d u c k   t h e   e x c e p t i o n .  But now this means that whoever calls the foo   method  has to follow the Handle or Declare law. If foo   ducks  the exception  by declaring it , and main   calls foo  , then  main   has to deal with the exception.   public class Washer {     Laundry laundry = new Laundry  ;      public void foo   throws ClothingException {           laundry.doLaundry  ;     }     public static void main  String[] args  {        Washer a = new Washer  ;        a.foo  ;    } }  Because the foo   method ducks the  ClothingException thrown by doLaundry  ,  main   has to wrap a.foo   in a try catch,  or main   has to declare that it, too,  throws ClothingException!        n  TROUBLE!! a e ,   o m p il c n ’ t     w o p t i o N o w   m a i e e x c r t e d   o p e r o c u   r ’ s   n a e e t   o m p il g c   e   t h a   a o w s   r   f a r o d   t h A s   m e t h   o   f o e t h n . p t i o e e x c  n s  “        n d   w e r e   ” n n r e c n n     r .   o r e d ,    you are here4  337   fixing the Sequencer code   Getting back to our music code... Now that you’ve completely forgotten, we started this chapter  with a ﬁrst look at some JavaSound code. We created a Se- quencer object but it wouldn’t compile because the method  Midi.getSequencer   declares a checked exception  MidiUnavail- ableException . But we can ﬁx that now by wrapping the call in a  try catch.  public void play   {         try {              Sequencer sequencer = MidiSystem.getSequencer  ;               System.out.println “Successfully got a sequencer” ;          } catch MidiUnavailableException ex  {             System.out.println “Bummer” ;           }                 }    close play       Exception Rules  e e t S e q u i t   e d   p p  n  c i n    g li n   w r e  g a    ,       t r  r a  e    y    a l c e m   o b l r p   N o v o w   t h a t   w e ’ n k . c a t c h   b l o  c  The catch parameter has to be  the ‘right’ exception. If we said  ‘catch FileNot FoundException f , the  code would not compile, because poly- morphically a MidiUnavilableException  won’t fit into a FileNotFoundException.  Remember it’s not enough to have a  catch block... you have to catch the  thing being thrown!  1  You cannot have a catch or ﬁnally  without a try  3  A try MUST be followed by either a  catch or a ﬁnally  void go   {    Foo f = new Foo  ;    f.foof  ;    catch FooException ex  { }  }  N O T   L E G A L !   t r   t h e W h e  e ’  r  s  y ?  try {    x.doStuff  ; } ﬁnally {        cleanup }  LEGAL because you  have a finally, even  though there’s no catch.  But you cannot have a  try by itself.  2  You cannot put code between the  try and the catch  4  A try with only a ﬁnally  no catch   must still declare the exception.  NOT LEGAL! You can’t put  code between the try and  the catch.  try {    x.doStuff  ; } int y = 43; } catch Exception ex  { }  void go   throws FooException {     try {        x.doStuff  ;     } ﬁnally { } }  c   a u t     w i t h o y A   t r   t h e s f y a t i s n ’ t   s e d o   e r c l a   d e r o   e n d l h a  a t c h     l a w  338  chapter 11   exception handling  Code Kitchen  But why don’t  you just use  Ready-bake code?  There is NO way  I’m letting Betty win the  code-off this year, so I’m  gonna make it myself from  scratch.  You don’t have to do it  yourself, but it’s a lot  more fun if you do. The rest of this chapter  is optional; you can use  Ready-bake code for all  the music apps. But if you want to learn  more about JavaSound,  turn the page.  you are here4  339   JavaSound MIDI classes  Making actual sound Remember near the beginning of the chapter, we looked at how MIDI data holds  the instructions for what should be played  and how it should be played  and we  also said that MIDI data doesn’t actually create any sound that you hear. For sound  to come out of the speakers, the MIDI data has to be sent through some kind of  MIDI device that takes the MIDI instructions and renders them in sound, either  by triggering a hardware instrument or a ‘virtual’ instrument  software synthe- sizer . In this book, we’re using only software devices, so here’s how it works in  JavaSound:  You need FOUR things:  1 The thing that  plays the music  2 The music to be  played...a song.   3 The part of the   Sequence that  holds the actual  information  4 The actual music   information:  notes to play,  how long, etc.  Sequencer  Sequence  Track  plays  has a  holds  For this book, we only  need one Track, so just  imagine a a music CD  with only one song.

Remember, the  Track lives in the Sequence, and the MIDI data  lives in the Track.  Put some MidiEvents into the Track. This part  is mostly Ready-bake code. The only thing you’ll  have to care about are the arguments to the  setMessage   method, and the arguments to  the MidiEvent constructor. We’ll look at those  arguments on the next page.   Making a MidiEvent  song data  A MidiEvent is an instruction for part of a song. A series of MidiEvents is  kind of like sheet music, or a player piano roll. Most of the MidiEvents we  care about describe a thing to do and the moment in time to do it. The moment  in time part matters, since timing is everything in music. This note follows  this note and so on. And because MidiEvents are so detailed, you have to say  at what moment to start playing the note  a NOTE ON event  and at what  moment to stop playing the notes  NOTE OFF event . So you can imagine  that ﬁring the “stop playing note G”  NOTE OFF message  before the “start  playing Note G”  NOTE ON  message wouldn’t work.  The MIDI instruction actually goes into a Message object; the MidiEvent is  a combination of the Message plus the moment in time when that message  should ‘ﬁre’. In other words, the Message might say, “Start playing Middle  C” while the MidiEvent would say, “Trigger this message at beat 4”. So we always need a Message and a MidiEvent.  The Message says what to do, and the MidiEvent says when to do it.  exception handling  A MidiEvent says  what to do and  when to do it.  Every instruction  must include the  timing for that  instruction.  In other words, at  which beat that  thing should happen.   1 Make a Message   ShortMessage a = new ShortMessage  ;  2  Put the Instruction in the Message a.setMessage 144, 1, 44, 100 ;  3 Make a new MidiEvent using the Message MidiEvent noteOn = new MidiEvent a, 1 ;  4 Add the MidiEvent to the Track  track.add noteOn ;  s t a r t   p l a y i n g   n o t e   4 4 ”   o n   t h e       s a y s  ,     “  s a g e     m e s l o o k   a t   t h e   o t h e r   n u m b e r s s T h i   l l   w e ’ n e x t   p a g e   The instructions are in the message, but the Midi- Event adds the moment in time when the instruction  should be triggered. This MidiEvent says to trigger  message ‘a’ at the first beat  beat 1 .  A Track holds all the MidiEvent objects. The Sequence organizes  them according to when each event is supposed to happen, and then  the Sequencer plays them back in that order. You can have lots of  events happening at the exact same moment in time. For example,  you might want two notes played simultaneously, or even different  instruments playing different sounds at the same time.  you are here4  343   contents of a Midi event  MIDI message: the heart of a MidiEvent A MIDI message holds the part of the event that says what to do. The actual instruction  you want the sequencer to execute. The ﬁrst argument of an instruction is always the type  of the message.The values you pass to the other three arguments depend on the type of  message. For example, a message of type 144 means “NOTE ON”.  But in order to carry  out a NOTE ON, the sequencer needs to know a few things. Imagine the sequencer saying,  “OK, I’ll play a note, but which channel? In other words, do you want me to play a Drum  note or a Piano note? And which note? Middle-C? D Sharp? And while we’re at it, at which  velocity should I play the note?   To make a MIDI message, make a ShortMessage instance and invoke setMessage  , passing  in the four arguments for the message. But remember, the message says only what to do, so  you still need to stuff the message into an event that adds when that message should ‘ﬁre’. Anatomy of a message The ﬁrst argument to setMessage   always  represents the message ‘type’, while the other  three arguments represent different things  depending on the message type.   The Message says what to do, the  MidiEvent says when to do it.  a.setMessage 144,  1,  44,  100 ;  note to play velocity  message type channel The last 3 args vary depending on the message  type. This is a NOTE ON message, so the  other args are for things the Sequencer needs  to know in order to play a note.  Channel Think of a channel like a musician in  a band. Channel 1 is musician 1  the  keyboard player , channel 9 is the  drummer, etc.  Note to play A number from 0 to 127, going  from low to high notes.  1  2  1  0  8  7  6  5  4  3  1 2 7  2  3  4  Velocity How  fast  and  hard  did  you  press  the  key?    0  is so soft you  probably won’t hear anything, but 100 is a  good default.  1 Message type  144 means  NOTE ON   start playing  128 means  NOTE OFF  stop playing  344  chapter 11   exception handling  Change a message Now that you know what’s in a Midi message, you can start experimenting. You  can change the note that’s played, how long the note is held, add more notes,  and even change the instrument.  1  Change the note Try a number between 0 and 127 in the note  on and note off messages. a.setMessage 144, 1, 20, 100 ;  1 2 7  8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1  0  2  Change the duration of the note Change the note off event  not the message  so  that it happens at an earlier or later beat.  b.setMessage 128, 1, 44, 100 ; MidiEvent noteOff = new MidiEvent b, 3  ;  3  Change the instrument Add a new message, BEFORE the note-playing message,  that sets the instrument in channel 1 to something other  than the default piano. The change-instrument message  is ‘192’, and the third argument represents the actual  instrument  try a number between 0 and 127   ﬁ rst.setMessage 192, 1, 102, 0 ;  change-instrument message in channel 1  musician 1   to instrument 10 2  you are here4  345   change the instrument and note  Version 2: Using command-line args to experiment with sounds This version still plays just a single note, but you get to use command-line argu- ments to change the instrument and note. Experiment by passing in two int values  from 0 to 127. The ﬁrst int sets the instrument, the second int sets the note to play.  import javax.sound.midi.*;  public class MiniMusicCmdLine {      this is the ﬁrst one            public static void main String[] args  {         MiniMusicCmdLine mini = new MiniMusicCmdLine  ;         if  args.length < 2  {             System.out.println “Don’t forget the instrument and note args” ;         } else {             int instrument = Integer.parseInt args[0] ;             int note = Integer.parseInt args[1] ;             mini.play instrument, note ;         }    }    close main     public void play int instrument, int note  {        try {            Sequencer player = MidiSystem.getSequencer  ;                   player.open  ;               Sequence seq = new Sequence Sequence.PPQ, 4 ;                   Track track = seq.createTrack  ;                    MidiEvent event = null;           ShortMessage ﬁrst = new ShortMessage  ;          ﬁrst.setMessage 192, 1, instrument, 0 ;          MidiEvent changeInstrument = new MidiEvent ﬁrst, 1 ;           track.add changeInstrument ;           ShortMessage a = new ShortMessage  ;          a.setMessage 144, 1, note, 100 ;          MidiEvent noteOn = new MidiEvent a, 1 ;           track.add noteOn ;           ShortMessage b = new ShortMessage  ;          b.setMessage 128, 1, note, 100 ;          MidiEvent noteOff = new MidiEvent b, 16 ;           track.add noteOff ;          player.setSequence seq ;           player.start  ;        } catch  Exception ex  {ex.printStackTrace  ;}    }    close play }    close class  346  chapter 11  Run it with two int args from 0  to 127.

Chapter 12: MIDI events This CodeKitchen lets us build a little  “music video”  bit of a stretch to call it  that...  that draws random rectangles to  the beat of the MIDI music. We’ll learn  how to construct and play a lot of MIDI  events  instead of just a couple, as we do  in the current chapter .  Chapter 13: Stand-alone  BeatBox Now we’ll actually build the real BeatBox,  GUI and all. But it’s limited—as soon as you  change a pattern, the previous one is lost.  There’s no Save and Restore feature, and  it doesn’t communicate with the network.   But you can still use it to work on your  drum pattern skills.   Chapter 14: Save and  Restore You’ve made the perfect pattern, and  now you can save it to a ﬁle, and reload it  when you want to play it again. This gets  us ready for the ﬁnal version  chapter 15 ,  where instead of writing the pattern to a  ﬁle, we send it over a network to the chat  server.  you are here4  347   exercise: True or False  Exercise  This chapter explored the wonderful world of  exceptions.  Your job is to decide whether each of the  following exception-related statements is true or false.  CTrue or FalseD  1.  A try block must be followed by a catch and a ﬁnally block.  2.  If you write a method that might cause a compiler-checked exception, you  must wrap that risky code in a try   catch block.  3.  Catch blocks can be polymorphic.  4.  Only ‘compiler checked’ exceptions can be caught.  5.  If you deﬁne a try   catch block, a matching ﬁnally block is optional.  6.  If you deﬁne a try block, you can pair it with a matching catch or ﬁnally block,  or both.  7.  If you write a method that declares that it can throw a compiler-checked ex- ception, you must also wrap the exception throwing code in a try   catch block.  8.  The main    method in your program must handle all unhandled exceptions  thrown to it.  9.  A single try block can have many different catch blocks.  10.  A method can only throw one kind of exception.  11. A ﬁnally block will run regardless of whether an exception is thrown.  12.  A ﬁnally block can exist without a try block.  13.  A try block can exist by itself, without a catch block or a ﬁnally block.  14.  Handling an exception is sometimes referred to as ‘ducking’.  15.  The order of catch blocks never matters.  16.  A method with a try block and a ﬁnally block, can optionally declare the  exception.  17.  Runtime exceptions must be handled or declared.  348  chapter 11   Exercise  exception handling  Code Magnets  A working Java program is scrambled up on the fridge.

This looks great.  I guess presentation  really is everything.  I heard your   ex-wife could only cook  command-line meals.  Face it, you need to make GUIs. If you’re building applications that other   people are going to use, you need a graphical interface. If you’re building programs for yourself,   you want a graphical interface.  Even if you believe that the rest of your natural life will be   spent writing server-side code, where the client user interface is a web page, sooner or later   you’ll need to write tools, and you’ll want a graphical interface.  Sure, command-line apps are   retro, but not in a good way. They’re weak, inflexible, and unfriendly. We’ll spend two chapters   working on GUIs, and learn key Java language features along the way including Event   Handling and Inner Classes. In this chapter, we’ll put a button on the screen, and make it do   something when you click it. We’ll paint on the screen, we’ll display a jpeg image, and we’ll even   do some animation.    this is a new chapter  353   your first gui   It all starts with a window A JFrame is the object that represents  a window on the screen. It’s where you  put all the interface things like buttons,  checkboxes, text ﬁelds, and so on. It can  have an honest-to-goodness menu bar  with menu items. And it has all the little  windowing icons for whatever platform  you’re on, for minimizing, maximizing, and  closing the window.  The JFrame looks different depending on  the platform you’re on. This is a JFrame on  Mac OS X:  Put widgets in the window Once you have a JFrame, you can put  things  ‘widgets’  in it by adding them  to the JFrame.  There are a ton of Swing  components you can add; look for them  in the javax.swing package. The most  common include JButton, JRadioButton,  JCheckBox, JLabel, JList, JScrollPane,  JSlider, JTextArea, JTextField, and  JTable. Most are really simple to use, but  some  like JTable  can be a bit more  complicated.   354  chapter 12  “If I see one more   command-line app,  you’re fired.”    r a b u t t o  u     b     n     a  a  a m e   J F r n d   t w o r   a n d   a    w i t h   ‘ w i d g b   a d i o    m e a     e t s ’   n u t t o  n    a  Making a GUI is easy:  Make a frame  a JFrame  JFrame frame = new JFrame  ;  Make a widget  button, text ﬁeld, etc.  JButton button = new JButton “click me” ;  1  2  3  Add the widget to the frame frame.getContentPane  .add button ;  You don’t add things to the frame  directly.Think of the frame as the  trim around the window, and you add  things to the window pane.  4  Display it  give it a size and make it visible  frame.setSize 300,300 ; frame.setVisible true ;   getting gui  Your first GUI: a button on a frame  import javax.swing.*;  don’t forget to import this  swing package  public class SimpleGui1 {     public static void main  String[] args  {  m a        JFrame frame = new JFrame  ;        JButton button = new JButton “click me” ;  k  e     a  u t t o  n  n d    a     a     b  a m e    f r  you can pass the button constructor  the text you want on the button          frame.setDefaultCloseOperation JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE ;  this line makes the program quit as soon as you  close the window  if you leave this out it will  just sit there on the screen forever          frame.getContentPane  .add button ;         frame.setSize 300,300 ;         frame.setVisible true ;     } }  add the button to the frame’s  content pane  give the frame a size, in pixels  finally, make it visible!!  if you forget  this step, you won’t see anything when  you run this code   Let’s see what happens when we run it:  %java SimpleGui1  Whoa!

Later we’ll learn to control  where  and how big  the  button is on the frame.  you are here4 355   user interface events  But nothing happens when I click it... That’s not exactly true. When you press the button it shows that  ‘pressed’ or ‘pushed in’ look  which changes depending on the  platform look and feel, but it always does something to show when  it’s being pressed . The real question is, “How do I get the button to do something  speciﬁ c when the user clicks it?”   We need two things:  1  2  A method to be called when the user  clicks  the thing you want to happen as  a result of the button click . A way to know when to trigger  that method. In other words, a way  to know when the user clicks the  button!  When the user clicks, we want  to know. We’re interested in the user- takes-action-on-a-button event.  356  chapter 12  Q: Will a button look like a   Windows button when you run on  Windows?  A: If you want it to. You can   choose from a few “look and  feels”—classes in the core library  that control what the interface looks  like. In most cases you can choose  between at least two different looks:  the standard Java look and feel, also  known as Metal, and the native look  and feel for your platform. The Mac  OS X screens in this book use either  the OS X Aqua look and feel, or the  Metal look and feel.  Q: Can I make a program look   like Aqua all the time? Even when  it’s running under Windows?  A: Nope. Not all look and feels   are available on every platform. If  you want to be safe, you can either  explicitly set the look and feel to  Metal, so that you know exactly what  you get regardless of where the app  is running, or don’t specify a look  and feel and accept the defaults.  Q: I heard Swing was dog-slow   and that nobody uses it.  A: This was true in the past,   but isn’t a given anymore. On weak  machines, you might feel the pain of  Swing. But on the newer desktops,  and with Java version 1.3 and be- yond, you might not even notice the  difference between a Swing GUI and  a native GUI. Swing is used heavily  today, in all sorts of applications.   getting gui  Getting a user event Imagine you want the text on the button to  change from click me to I’ve been clicked when  the user presses the button. First we can write a  method that changes the text of the button  a  quick look through the API will show you the  method :  First, the button needs to know  that we care.  Hey button, I care about  what happens to you.  1  public void changeIt   {      button.setText “I’ve been clicked!” ; }  your code  But now what? How will we know when this  method should run? How will we know when the  button is clicked?  In Java, the process of getting and handling a  user event is called event-handling. There are  many different event types in Java, although  most involve GUI user actions. If the user clicks  a button, that’s an event. An event that says  “The user wants the action of this button to  happen.” If it’s a “Slow Tempo” button, the user  wants the slow-tempo action to occur. If it’s a  Send button on a chat client, the user wants the  send-my-message action to happen. So the most  straightforward event is when the user clicked  the button, indicating they want an action to  occur.  With buttons, you usually don’t care about any  intermediate events like button-is-being-pressed  and button-is-being-released. What you want to  say to the button is, “I don’t care how the user  plays with the button, how long they hold the  mouse over it, how many times they change their  mind and roll off before letting go, etc. Just tell  me when the user means business! In other words,  don’t call me unless the user clicks in a way that  indicates he wants the darn button to do what it  says it’ll do!”     b ject  button    o  2 The user clicked me!  Second, the button needs a way  to call us back when a button- clicked event occurs.  A  brain power  1  How could you tell a button object that you  care about its events? That you’re a concerned  listener?  2  How will the button call you back? Assume  that there’s no way for you to tell the button the  name of your unique method  changeIt   . So  what else can we use to reassure the button that  we have a specific method it can call when the  event happens? [hint: think Pet]  you are here4 357   event listeners  If you care about the button’s events,  implement an interface that says,       “I’m listening for your events.”   A listener interface is the bridge between the  listener  you  and event source  the button .   The Swing GUI components are event sources. In Java terms,  an event source is an object that can turn user actions  click  a mouse, type a key, close a window  into events. And like  virtually everything else in Java, an event is represented as an  object. An object of some event class. If you scan through the  java.awt.event package in the API, you’ll see a bunch of event  classes  easy to spot—they all have Event in the name . You’ll  ﬁ nd MouseEvent, KeyEvent, WindowEvent, ActionEvent, and  several others.   An event source  like a button  creates an event object when the  user does something that matters  like click the button . Most  of the code you write  and all the code in this book  will receive  events rather than create events.  In other words, you’ll spend  most of your time as an event    listener rather than an event source.  Every event type has a matching listener interface. If you want  MouseEvents, implement the MouseListener interface. Want  WindowEvents? Implement WindowListener. You get the idea.  And remember your   interface rules—to implement an interface  you declare that you implement it  class Dog implements Pet ,  which means you must write implementation methods for every  method in the interface.  Some interfaces have more than one method because the  event itself comes in different ﬂ avors. If you implement  MouseListener, for example, you can get events for  mousePressed, mouseReleased, mouseMoved, etc. Each of  those mouse events has a separate method in the interface,  even though they all take a MouseEvent. If you implement  MouseListener, the mousePressed   method is called when the  user  you guessed it  presses the mouse. And when the user lets  go, the mouseReleased   method is called. So for mouse events,  there’s only one event object, MouseEvent, but several different  event methods, representing the different types of mouse events.  358  chapter 12  When you implement a  listener interface, you give  the button a way to call  you back. The interface is  where the call-back method  is declared.   > ActionListener actionPerformed ActionEvent ev     >   > I t e m L i s t e n e r  t e m S t a t e C h a n g e d   I  i  t e m E v e n t    e v     >  > KeyListener keyPressed KeyEvent ev  keyReleased KeyEvent ev  keyTyped KeyEvent ev    How the listener and source  communicate:  “Button, please add me to  your list of listeners and call  my actionPerformed   method  when the user clicks you.”  getting gui  “OK, you’re an ActionListener,  so I know how to call you back  when there’s an event -- I’ll call  the actionPerformed   method  that I know you have.”  d  d A c tionListener this   butto n.a  actionPerforme d    t h e  n t   v e  E  The Listener  If your class wants to know about  a button’s ActionEvents, you  implement the ActionListener  interface. The button needs to  know you’re interested, so you   register with the button by calling its  addActionListener this  and passing an  ActionListener reference to it  in this case,  you are the ActionListener so you pass  this .The button needs a way to call you  back when the event happens,  so it calls  the method in the listener interface.  As an  ActionListener, you must implement the  interface’s sole method, actionPerformed  .   The compiler guarantees it.  The Event Source  A button is a source of ActionEvents,  so it has to know which objects are  interested listeners. The button has an  addActionListener   method to give  interested objects  listeners  a way to  tell the button they’re interested.   When the button’s  addActionListener   runs  because   a potential listener invoked it , the  button takes the parameter  a  reference to the listener object  and  stores it in a list. When the user clicks  the button, the button ‘ﬁres’ the event  by calling the actionPerformed    method on each listener in the list.  you are here4 359   getting events  Getting a button’s ActionEvent  1  2  3  Implement the ActionListener interface  Register with the button  tell it you  want to listen for events   Deﬁne the event-handling method  implement  the actionPerformed   method from the  ActionListener interrface   1  a new import statement for the package that  ActionListener and ActionEvent are in. t   t n I m p l e m e c n a s  i n n a “ n L is t i o A c t t u b   e   T h n L is t i o A c  h    t  t  e  e  e  o  o   i n   f  c  a  f  e .

The button calls this method to let you know an event  happened. It sends you an ActionEvent object as the  argument, but we don’t need it.

No matter how much you fancy yourself the center of your social  universe.   Get used to it. Your job is to be a good listener.   Which, if you do it sincerely, can improve your social life.   As a listener, my job is to  implement the interface,   register with the button, and  provide the event-handling.  As an event source, my job is to   accept registrations  from listeners ,  get events from the user. and          call the listener’s event-handling  method  when the user clicks me   Listener GETS the  event  Source SENDS  the event  Hey, what about me? I’m a player too, you  know! As an event object, I’m the argument   to the event call-back method  from the   interface  and my job is to carry data about   the event back to the listener.  Event object  HOLDS DATA  about the event  Event o b j ect   you are here4 361   event handling  there are no Dumb Questions Q: Why can’t I be a source of events? A: You CAN. We just said that most of the time   you’ll be the receiver and not the originator of the  event  at least in the early days of your brilliant Java  career . Most of the events you might care about  are ‘fired’ by classes in the Java API, and all you have  to do is be a listener for them. You might, however,  design a program where you need a custom event, say,  StockMarketEvent thrown when your stock market  watcher app finds something it deems important. In  that case, you’d make the StockWatcher object be an  event source, and you’d do the same things a button    or any other source  does—make a listener interface  for your custom event, provide a registration method   addStockListener   , and when somebody calls it, add  the caller  a listener  to the list of listeners. Then, when  a stock event happens, instantiate a StockEvent object   another class you’ll write  and send it to the listeners  in your list by calling their stockChanged StockEvent  ev  method. And don’t forget that for every event type  there must be a matching listener interface  so you’ll  create a StockListener interface with a stockChanged     method .  Sharpen your pencil  Q: I don’t see the importance of the event object   that’s passed to the event call-back methods. If  somebody calls my mousePressed method, what  other info would I need?  A: A lot of the time, for most designs, you don’t   need the event object. It’s nothing more than a little  data carrier, to send along more info about the event.  But sometimes you might need to query the event for  specific details about the event. For example, if your  mousePressed   method is called, you know the mouse  was pressed. But what if you want to know exactly  where the mouse was pressed? In other words, what if  you want to know the X and Y screen coordinates for  where the mouse was pressed?   Or sometimes you might want to register the same  listener with multiple objects. An onscreen calculator,  for example, has 10 numeric keys and since they all do  the same thing, you might not want to make a separate  listener for every single key. Instead, you might  register a single listener with each of the 10 keys, and  when you get an event  because your event call-back  method is called  you can call a method on the event  object to find out who the real event source was. In  other words, which key sent this event.  Each of these widgets  user interface objects  are the  source of one or more events. Match the widgets with  the events they might cause. Some widgets might be a  source of more than one event, and some events can be  generated by more than one widget.  Widgets  Event methods  check box  text ﬁeld  scrolling list  button  dialog box  radio button  menu item  362  chapter 12  windowClosing    actionPerformed    itemStateChanged    keyTyped    mouseExited    focusGained    How do you KNOW if  an object is an event  source?  Look in the API. OK. Look for what? A method that starts with  ‘add’, ends with ‘Listener’,  and takes a listener inter- face argument. If you see:  you know that a class  with this method is a  source of KeyEvents.  There’s a naming pattern.  mousePressed    addKeyListener KeyListener k    getting gui  Getting back to graphics... Now that we know a little about how events work  we’ll learn  more later , let’s get back to putting stuff on the screen.  We’ll spend a few minutes playing with some fun ways to get  graphic, before returning to event handling.   Three ways to put things on your GUI:  Put widgets on a frame  Add buttons, menus, radio buttons, etc. frame.getContentPane  .add myButton ; The javax.swing package has more than a dozen  widget types.  1  2  Draw 2D graphics on a widget Use a graphics object to paint shapes. graphics.ﬁllOval 70,70,100,100 ; You can paint a lot more than boxes and circles;  the Java2D API is full of fun, sophisticated  graphics methods.

You plop that widget  on the frame, just like a button or any other widget, but when it  shows up it will have your images on it. You can even make those  images move, in an animation, or make the colors on the screen  change every time you click a button.  It’s a piece of cake. Make a subclass of JPanel and override one  method, paintComponent  .  All of your graphics code goes inside the paintComponent    method. Think of the paintComponent   method as the method  called by the system to say,  “Hey widget, time to paint yourself.”  If you want to draw a circle, the paintComponent   method will  have code for drawing a circle. When the frame holding your  drawing panel is displayed, paintComponent   is called and your  circle appears. If the user iconiﬁes minimizes the window, the  JVM knows the frame needs “repair” when it gets de-iconiﬁed,  so it calls paintComponent   again. Anytime the JVM thinks the  display needs refreshing, your paintComponent   method will be  called.  One more thing, you never call this method yourself! The argument  to this method  a Graphics object  is the actual drawing canvas  that gets slapped onto the real display. You can’t get this by  yourself; it must be handed to you by the system. You’ll see  later, however, that you can ask the system to refresh the display   repaint   , which ultimately leads to paintComponent   being  called.   e  s  e  h  t     f  o     h  t  o  b     d  e  e  n     u  o  y  import java.awt.*; import javax.swing.*;  class MyDrawPanel extends JPanel {            public void paintComponent Graphics g  {           g.setColor Color.orange ;           g.ﬁllRect 20,50,100,100 ;       } }  364  chapter 12    a   w i d g e t   ,   o f   J P a n e l i k e   l j u s t   s s u b c l a s t h a t   y o u   c a n   a d d   t o   a   f r a m e   M a k e   a     y o u r   s i   o n e   s   E x c e p t   t h i s e . a n y t h i n g   e l o w n   c u s t o m i z e d   w i d g e t .

Imagine that ‘g’ is a painting machine. You’re  telling it what color to paint with and then  what shape to paint  with coordinates for  where it goes and how big it is   l   getting gui  Fun things to do in paintComponent   Let’s look at a few more things you can do in paintComponent  .  The most fun, though, is when you start experimenting yourself.  Try playing with the numbers, and check the API for class  Graphics  later we’ll see that there’s even more you can do besides  what’s in the Graphics class .  Display a JPEG  public void paintComponent Graphics g  {     s  e  h  g     o  r  e  e  a m e  n     f il e     r  u  o  y      Image image = new ImageIcon “catzilla.jpg” .getImage  ;      g.drawImage image,3,4,this ;           }  The x,y coordinates for where the picture’s top  left corner should go. This says “3 pixels from  the left edge of the panel and 4 pixels from the  top edge of the panel”. These numbers are always  relative to the widget  in this case your JPanel  subclass , not the entire frame.  Paint a randomly-colored circle  on a black background        public void paintComponent Graphics g  {  d                      g.ﬁllRect 0,0,this.getWidth  , this.getHeight   ;  e  h  t  f ill   h t                      int red =  int   Math.random   * 255 ;          int green =  int   Math.random   * 255 ;          int blue =  int   Math.random   * 255 ;           Color randomColor = new Color red, green, blue ;          g.setColor randomColor ;          g.ﬁllOval 70,70,100,100 ;       }  start 70 pixels from the left, 70 from  the top, make it 100 pixels wide, and  100 pixels tall.     k  c  b l a     h  e l   w i t    n  a p o l o    c  e    e  e     r  e f  t i r n u l t a The first two args define the  x,y  upper left  corner, relative to the panel, for where drawing  starts, so 0, 0 means “start 0 pixels from the  left edge and 0 pixels from the top edge.” The  other two args say, “Make the width of this  rectangle as wide as the panel  this.width   , and  make the height as tall as the panel  this.height ” You can make a color by passing in 3 ints  to represent the RGB values.   you are here4 365   drawing gradients with Graphics2D  Behind every good Graphics reference  is a Graphics2D object.  The argument to paintComponent   is declared as type  Graphics  java.awt.Graphics .    public void paintComponent Graphics g  { }  So the parameter ‘g’ IS-A Graphics object. Which means it  could be a subclass of Graphics  because of polymorphism .  And in fact, it is.  The object referenced by the ‘g’ parameter is actually an  instance of the Graphics2D class.  Why do you care? Because there are things you can do with  a Graphics2D reference that you can’t do with a Graphics  reference. A Graphics2D object can do more than a Graphics  object, and it really is a Graphics2D object lurking behind the  Graphics reference. Remember your polymorphism. The compiler decides which  methods you can call based on the reference type, not the  object type.  If you have a Dog object referenced by an Animal  reference variable: Animal a = new Dog  ; You can NOT say: a.bark  ; Even though you know it’s really a Dog back there. The  compiler looks at ‘a’, sees that it’s of type Animal, and ﬁnds  that there’s no remote control button for bark   in the Animal  class. But you can still get the object back to the Dog it really is  by saying: Dog d =  Dog  a; d.bark  ; So the bottom line with the Graphics object is this: If you need to use a method from the Graphics2D class, you  can’t use the the paintComponent parameter  ‘g’  straight  from the method. But you can cast it with a new Graphics2D  variable. Graphics2D g2d =  Graphics2D  g;  366  chapter 12  Methods you can call on a  Graphics reference:  drawImage    drawLine    drawPolygon  drawRect    drawOval    ﬁllRect    ﬁllRoundRect    setColor    To cast the Graphics2D object to  a Graphics2D reference:  Graphics2D g2d =  Graphics2D  g;  Methods you can call on  a Graphics2D reference:  ﬁll3DRect    draw3DRect    rotate    scale    shear    transform    setRenderingHints     these are not complete method lists,  check the API for more    getting gui  Because life’s too short to paint the  circle a solid color when there’s a  gradient blend waiting for you.  public void paintComponent Graphics g  {      Graphics2D g2d =  Graphics2D  g;  e  s 2 D   o b j  c t     G r a p h i c  s     l y   a   G r a p h i c   r e a l s i t ’ e r a d i n g m a s q u c t . e o b j    a s    a   m e r e  cast it so we can call something that  Graphics2D has but Graphics doesn’t      GradientPaint gradient = new GradientPaint 70,70,Color.blue, 150,150, Color.orange ;  starting point this sets the virtual paint brush to a  gradient instead of a solid color  starting color ending point  ending color        }      g2d.setPaint gradient ;      g2d.ﬁ llOval 70,70,100,100 ;  l        m e t h o d   r e a l l O v a l t h e   f i t h e   o v a l   w i t h   w h a t e v e r   i . e .   t h e   g r a d i e n t   ” p a i n t b r u s h     i  l  l   l y   m e a n s   “ f i s   l o a d e d   o n   y o u r    public void paintComponent Graphics g  {     Graphics2D g2d =  Graphics2D  g;                        int red =  int   Math.random   * 255 ;     int green =  int   Math.random   * 255 ;     int blue =  int   Math.random   * 255 ;     Color startColor = new Color red, green, blue ;      red =  int   Math.random   * 255 ;     green =  int   Math.random   * 255 ;     blue =  int   Math.random   * 255 ;     Color endColor = new Color red, green, blue ;  l  i k e s t   u j   s i   s t h i i t   m a k e e p t   e x c s t a r t   a n d     t h e   T r y   g r a d i e n t .    e ,   a b o v   o n e   t h e   f o r   c o l o r s   r a n d o m     s   o f   t h e c o l o r s s t o p     i t !

YOU NEVER CALL IT YOURSELF. The argu- ment to paintComponent   is a Graphics object that  gives you a surface to draw on, which will end up on  the screen. You cannot construct that object yourself.  ß  Typical methods to call on a Graphics object  the paint-  Component paramenter  are:  graphics.setColor Color.blue ;  g.ﬁllRect 20,50,100,120 ;  ß  To draw a .jpg, construct an Image using:   Image image = new ImageIcon “catzilla. jpg” .getImage  ;   and draw the imagine using:  g.drawImage image,3,4,this ;  ß  The object referenced by the Graphics parameter  to paintComponent   is actually an instance of the  Graphics2D class. The Graphics 2D class has a variety  of methods including:  ﬁll3DRect  , draw3DRect  , rotate  , scale  , shear  ,  transform    ß  To invoke the Graphics2D methods, you must cast the   parameter from a Graphics object to a Graphics2D  object:  Graphics2D g2d =  Graphics2D  g;   events and graphics   BULLET POINTS   EVENTS  ß  To make a GUI, start with a window, usually a JFrame   JFrame frame = new JFrame  ;  ß  You can add widgets  buttons, text fields, etc.  to the   JFrame using:  frame.getContentPane  .add button ;  ß  Unlike most other components, the JFrame doesn’t let  you add to it directly, so you must add to the JFrame’s  content pane.    ß  To make the window  JFrame  display, you must give it   a size and tell it be visible:  frame.setSize 300,300 ;  frame.setVisible true ;  ß  To know when the user clicks a button  or takes some  other action on the user interface  you need to listen for  a GUI event.  ß  To listen for an event, you must register your interest   with an event source. An event source is the thing  but- ton, checkbox, etc.  that ‘fires’ an event based on user  interaction.  ß  The listener interface gives the event source a way  to call you back, because the interface defines the  method s  the event source will call when an event  happens.  ß  To register for events with a source, call the source’s   ß   registration method. Registration methods always take  the form of: add Listener. To register for a  button’s ActionEvents, for example, call:  button.addActionListener this ; Implement the listener interface by implementing all of  the interface’s event-handling methods. Put your event- handling code in the listener call-back method. For  ActionEvents, the method is:  public void actionPerformed ActionEvent                              event  {        button.setText “you clicked!” ;    } ß  The event object passed into the event-handler method  carries information about the event, including the source  of the event.  368  chapter 12   getting gui  We can get an event. We can paint graphics. But can we paint graphics when we get an event? Let’s hook up an event to a change in our drawing panel. We’ll make the circle  change colors each time you click the button.  Here’s how the program ﬂows:  Start the app   1  The frame is built with the two widgets   your drawing panel and a button . A  listener is created and registered with  the button. Then the frame is displayed  and it just waits for the user to click.  2  The user clicks the button and the  button creates an event object and  calls the listener’s event handler.  3  The event handler calls repaint   on the  frame. The system calls paintComponent    on the drawing panel.   4  Voila! A new color is painted because  paintComponent   runs again, ﬁlling the  circle with a random color.   you are here4 369   building a GUI frame  Wait a minute...how   do you put TWO  things on a frame?   GUI layouts: putting more than one  widget on a frame  We cover GUI layouts in the next chapter, but we’ll do a  quickie lesson here to get you going. By default, a frame  has ﬁve regions you can add to. You can add only one thing  to each region of a frame, but don’t panic! That one thing  might be a panel that holds three other things including a  panel that holds two more things and... you get the idea. In  fact, we were ‘cheating’ when we added a button to the frame  using:  frame.getContentPane  .add button ;  frame.getContentPane  .add BorderLayout.CENTER, button ;  s    t h e   b e t t e r    l y     a n d   u s u a l   s   w a y   t o   a d d   t o   a   f r a m e ’ i   s T h i s p e c i f y     m a n d a t o r y     A l w a y s d e f a u l t   c o n t e n t   p a n e .   y o u   w a n t   t h e     w h i c h   r e g i o n   W H E R E   w i d g e t   t o   g o . i n g l e - a r g   a d d   s   t h e     s h o u l d n ’ t   u s e   l W h e n   y o u   c a l   t h e   o n e   w e   l a n d   l y     a u t o m a t i c a l m e t h o d   l l t h e   w i d g e t   w i   i o n . t h e   c e n t e r   r e g s  i n    default region  west  center  east  north  south  370  chapter 12  This isn’t really the way you’re supposed  to do it  the one-arg add method .  we call the two-argument add method,  that takes a region  using a constant   and the widget to add to that region.

Is that even possible? How do  you get two events when you  have only one actionPerformed    method?  This button changes the text  on the opposite side  This button changes the color  of the circle  372  chapter 12   getting gui  How do you get action events for t wo different buttons,  when each button needs to do something different?   1 option one  Implement two actionPerformed   methods  class MyGui implements ActionListener {        lots of code here and then:      public void actionPerformed ActionEvent event  {         frame.repaint  ;     }  But this is impossible!      public void actionPerformed ActionEvent event  {         label.setText “That hurt!” ;     } }  Flaw: You can’t! You can’t implement the same method twice in a Java class. It won’t compile.   And even if you could, how would the event source know which of the two methods to call?  2 option two  Register the same listener with both buttons.  class MyGui implements ActionListener {        declare a bunch of instance variables here      public void go   {           build gui        colorButton = new JButton  ;        labelButton = new JButton  ;        colorButton.addActionListener this ;        labelButton.addActionListener this ;           more gui code here ...     }     Register the same listener  with both buttons     public void actionPerformed ActionEvent event  {         if  event.getSource   == colorButton  {             frame.repaint  ;         } else {                        label.setText “That hurt!” ;         }     } }  Q u e r y   t h e   e v e n t   o b j e c t   t o   f i n d   o u t   w h i c h   b u t t o n   l y   f i r e d   i t ,   a n d   u s e   a c t u a l t h a t   t o   d e c i d e   w h a t   t o   d o .  Flaw: this does work, but in most cases it’s not very OO. One event handler  doing many different things means that you have a single method doing many different things.  If you need to change how one source is handled, you have to mess with everybody’s event  handler. Sometimes it is a good solution, but usually it hurts maintainability and extensibility.  you are here4 373   multiple listeners  How do you get action events for t wo different buttons,  when each button needs to do something different?  3 option three  Create two separate ActionListener classes  class MyGui  {    JFrame frame;    JLabel label;    void gui   {          code to instantiate the two listeners and register one             with the color button and the other with the label button    }  }    close class  class ColorButtonListener implements ActionListener {     public void actionPerformed ActionEvent event  {         frame.repaint  ;     } }  Won’t work! This class doesn’t have a reference to  the ‘frame’ variable of the MyGui class  class LabelButtonListener implements ActionListener {     public void actionPerformed ActionEvent event  {         label.setText “That hurt!” ;     } }  Problem! This class has no reference to the variable ‘label’  Flaw: these classes won’t have access to the variables they need  to act on, ‘frame’ and ‘label’. You could ﬁx it, but you’d have to give each of the  listener classes a reference to the main GUI class, so that inside the actionPerformed    methods the listener could use the GUI class reference to access the variables of the GUI  class.  But that’s breaking encapsulation, so we’d probably need to make getter methods  for the gui widgets  getFrame  , getLabel  , etc. .  And you’d probably need to add a  constructor to the listener class so that you can pass the GUI reference to the listener at  the time the listener is instantiated. And, well, it gets messier and more complicated.  There has got to be a better way!  374  chapter 12   getting gui  Wouldn’t it be wonderful if you   could have two different listener classes,  but the listener classes could access the  instance variables of the main GUI class,  almost as if the listener classes belonged  to the other class. Then you’d have the best  of both worlds. Yeah, that would be dreamy.   But it’s just a fantasy...  you are here4 375   An inner class can  use all the methods  and variables of the  outer class, even the  private ones. The inner class gets  to use those variables  and methods just  as if the methods  and variables were  declared within the  inner class.  inner classes  Inner class to the rescue! You can have one class nested inside another. It’s easy.  Just make sure that the deﬁnition for the inner class is  inside the curly braces of the outer class.  Simple inner class:  class MyOuterClass  {        class MyInnerClass {       void go   {        }     }   }   u ll y e t  r        s  s  c l a  f  u     o    is y     s  b  s     c l a d e  s     r e c l o  I  n e  n n  An inner class gets a special pass to use the outer class’s stuff. Even  the private stuff. And the inner class can use those private variables  and methods of the outer class as if the variables and members  were deﬁned in the inner class. That’s what’s so handy about inner  classes—they have most of the beneﬁts of a normal class, but with  special access rights.  Inner class using an outer class variable  class MyOuterClass  {      private int x;        class MyInnerClass {       void go   {          x = 42;        }     }    close inner class  }    close outer class  use ‘x’ as if it were a variable  of the inner class!  376  chapter 12   getting gui  An inner object  shares a special  bond with an  outer object.  An inner class instance must be tied to  an outer class instance*.  Remember, when we talk about an inner class accessing  something in the outer class, we’re really talking about an  instance of the inner class accessing something in an instance of  the outer class. But which instance?  Can any arbitrary instance of the inner class access the methods  and variables of any instance of the outer class?  No!

For  example, if code within a method instantiates the inner class, the inner  object will bond to the instance whose method is running. Code in an outer class can instantiate one of its own inner classes, in exactly  the same way it instantiates any other class... new MyInner    class MyOuter  {     private int x;  T h e   o u t e r   c l a s s   h a s   a   p r i v a t e   i n s t a n c e   v a r i a b l e   ‘ x ’     MyInner inner = new MyInner  ;  Make an instance of the  inner class  call a method on the  inner class     public void doStuff   {       inner.go  ;     }         class MyInner {       void go   {          x = 42;        }     }    close inner class  }    close outer class  The method in the inner class uses the  outer class instance variable ‘x’, as if ‘x’  belonged to the inner class.   Side bar  You can instantiate an inner instance from code running outside the outer class, but you  have to use a special syntax. Chances are you’ll go through your entire Java life and never  need to make an inner class from outside, but just in case you’re interested...    class Foo {        public static void main  String[] args  {           MyOuter outerObj = new MyOuter  ;           MyOuter.MyInner innerObj = outerObj.new MyInner  ;        }     }  378  chapter 12  x int  x int  outer  MyOuter     c i a l n d  s p e b o  outer  MyOuter  inner  MyInner   getting gui  Now we can get the two-button  code working public class TwoButtons {  the main GUI class doesn’t  implement ActionListener now      JFrame frame;     JLabel label;      public static void main  String[] args  {        TwoButtons gui = new TwoButtons   ;        gui.go  ;     }      public void go   {        frame = new JFrame  ;        frame.setDefaultCloseOperation JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE ;         JButton labelButton = new JButton “Change Label” ;        labelButton.addActionListener new LabelListener   ;         JButton colorButton = new JButton “Change Circle” ;        colorButton.addActionListener new ColorListener   ;         label = new JLabel “I’m a label” ;               MyDrawPanel drawPanel = new MyDrawPanel  ;                frame.getContentPane  .add BorderLayout.SOUTH, colorButton ;        frame.getContentPane  .add BorderLayout.CENTER, drawPanel ;        frame.getContentPane  .add BorderLayout.EAST, labelButton ;        frame.getContentPane  .add BorderLayout.WEST, label ;  N o w   w e   g e t   t o   h a v e   TWO  A c t i o nL i s t e n e r s   i n   a   s i n g l e   c l a s s  !         frame.setSize 300,300 ;        frame.setVisible true ;     }           class LabelListener implements ActionListener {         public void actionPerformed ActionEvent event  {             label.setText “Ouch!” ;         }      }    close inner class  inner class knows  about ‘label’       class ColorListener implements ActionListener {         public void actionPerformed ActionEvent event  {             frame.repaint  ;         }      }     close inner class     }  the inner class gets to use the ‘frame’  instance variable, without having an  explicit reference to the outer class  object.  s     t o   t h e   i n g     t h i s i n s t e a d   o f   p a s s t r a t i o n   s t e n e r   r e g i i s   a   n e w   i n s t a n c e   o f   b u t t o n ’ s   l m e t h o d ,   p a s s . s t e n e r   c l a s i t h e   a p p r o p r i a t e   l  TwoButtons   object r e  t  u  o  r  e  n  i n  LabelListener   object  r  e  n  i n  ColorListener   object  you are here4 379   inner classes  Java Exposed  This weeks interview: Instance of an Inner Class  HeadFirst: What makes inner classes important?  Inner object: Where do I start? We give you a chance to  implement the same interface more than once in a class.  Remember, you can’t implement a method more than  once in a normal Java class. But using inner classes, each  inner class can implement the same interface, so you can  have all these different implementations of  the very same  interface methods.  HeadFirst: Why would you ever want to implement the  same method twice? Inner object: Let’s revisit GUI event handlers. Think  about it... if  you want three buttons to each have a  different event behavior, then use three inner classes, all  implementing ActionListener—which means each class  gets to implement its own actionPerformed method. HeadFirst: So are event handlers the only reason to use  inner classes?   Inner object: Oh, gosh no. Event handlers are just an  obvious example. Anytime you need a separate class, but  still want that class to behave as if  it were part of  another  class, an inner class is the best—and sometimes only—way  to do it.  HeadFirst: I’m still confused here. If  you want the inner  class to behave like it belongs to the outer class, why have  a separate class in the ﬁrst place? Why wouldn’t the inner  class code just be in the outer class in the ﬁrst place? Inner object: I just gave you one scenario, where you  need more than one implementation of  an interface. But  even when you’re not using interfaces, you might need  two different classes because those classes represent two  different things. It’s good OO. HeadFirst: Whoa. Hold on here. I thought a big part of   OO design is about reuse and maintenance. You know, the  idea that  if  you have two separate classes, they can each  be modiﬁed and used independently, as opposed to stufﬁng  it all into one class yada yada yada. But with an inner class,  you’re still just working with one real class in the end, right?  The enclosing class is the only one that’s reusable and   380  chapter 12  separate from everybody else. Inner classes aren’t exactly  reusable. In fact, I’ve heard them called “Reuseless— useless over and over again.” Inner object: Yes it’s true that the inner class is not as  reusable, in fact sometimes not reusable at all, because it’s  intimately tied to the instance variables and methods of   the outer class.  But it— HeadFirst: —which only proves my point! If  they’re not  reusable, why bother with a separate class? I mean, other  than the interface issue, which sounds like a workaround  to me. Inner object: As I was saying, you need to think about  IS-A and polymorphism.  HeadFirst: OK. And I’m thinking about them because... Inner object: Because the outer and inner classes  might need to pass different IS-A tests!  Let’s start with the  polymorphic GUI listener example. What’s the declared  argument type for the button’s listener registration  method? In other words, if  you go to the API and check,  what kind of  thing  class or interface type  do you have to  pass to the addActionListener   method? HeadFirst: You have to pass a listener. Something that  implements a particular listener interface, in this case  ActionListener. Yeah, we know all this. What’s your point? Inner object: My point is that polymorphically, you have  a method that takes only one particular type. Something  that passes the IS-A test for ActionListener. But—and  here’s the big thing—what if  your class needs to be an IS- A of  something that’s a class type rather than an interface? HeadFirst: Wouldn’t you have your class just extend the  class you need to be a part of ? Isn’t that the whole point  of  how subclassing works? If  B is a subclass of  A, then  anywhere an A is expected a B can be used. The whole  pass-a-Dog-where-an-Animal-is-the-declared-type thing.   Inner object: Yes! Bingo! So now what happens if  you  need to pass the IS-A test for two different classes? Classes  that aren’t in the same inheritance hierarchy?   HeadFirst: Oh, well you just... hmmm. I think I’m get- ting it. You can always implement more than one interface,  but you can extend only one class. You can only be one kind  of  IS-A when it comes to class types. Inner object: Well done! Yes, you can’t be both a Dog  and a Button. But if  you’re a Dog that needs to some- times be a Button  in order to pass yourself  to methods  that take a Button , the Dog class  which extends Animal  so it can’t extend Button  can have an inner class that acts  on the Dog’s behalf  as a Button, by extending Button,  and thus wherever a Button is required the Dog can  pass his inner Button instead of  himself. In other words,  instead of  saying x.takeButton this , the Dog object calls  x.takeButton new MyInnerButton   . HeadFirst: Can I get a clear example? Inner object: Remember the drawing panel we used,  where we made our own subclass of  JPanel? Right now,  that class is a separate, non-inner, class. And that’s ﬁne,  because the class doesn’t need special access to the instance  variables of  the main GUI. But what if  it did? What if   we’re doing an animation on that panel, and it’s getting its  coordinates from the main application  say, based on some- thing the user does elsewhere in the GUI . In that case, if   we make the drawing panel an inner class, the drawing  panel class gets to be a subclass of  JPanel, while the outer  class is still free to be a subclass of  something else.  HeadFirst: Yes I see! And the drawing panel isn’t reus- able enough to be a separate class anyway, since what it’s  actually painting is speciﬁc to this one GUI application. Inner object: Yes! You’ve got it!  HeadFirst: Good. Then we can move on to the nature of   the relationship between you and the outer instance. Inner object: What is it with you people? Not enough  sordid gossip in a serious topic like polymorphism? HeadFirst: Hey, you have no idea how much the public is  willing to pay for some good old tabloid dirt. So, someone  creates you and becomes instantly bonded to the outer  object, is that right? Inner object: Yes that’s right. And yes, some have  compared it to an arranged marriage. We don’t have a say  in which object we’re bonded to. HeadFirst: Alright, I’ll go with the marriage analogy.  Can you get a divorce and remarry something else? Inner object: No, it’s for life.   getting gui  HeadFirst: Whose life? Yours? The outer object? Both? Inner object: Mine. I can’t be tied to any other outer  object. My only way out is garbage collection. HeadFirst: What about the outer object? Can it be  associated with any other inner objects?  Inner object: So now we have it. This is what you really  wanted. Yes, yes. My so-called ‘mate’ can have as many  inner objects as it wants. HeadFirst: Is that like, serial monogamy? Or can it have  them all at the same time? Inner object: All at the same time. There. Satisﬁed? HeadFirst: Well, it does make sense. And let’s not  forget, it was you extolling the virtues of  “multiple  implementations of  the same interface”. So it makes sense  that if  the outer class has three buttons, it would need  three different inner classes  and thus three different inner  class objects  to handle the events. Thanks for everything.  Here’s a tissue.  He thinks he’s   got it made, having two  inner class objects. But we  have access to all his private  data, so just imagine the damage  we could do...        you are here4 381   inner classes  Using an inner class for animation We saw why inner classes are handy for event listeners, because  you get to implement the same event-handling method more  than once. But now we’ll look at how useful an inner class is when  used as a subclass of something the outer class doesn’t extend. In  other words, when the outer class and inner class are in different  inheritance trees! Our goal is to make a simple animation, where the circle moves  across the screen from the upper left down to the lower right.  start  finish  How simple animation works  1  Paint an object at a particular x and y coordinate  g.ﬁllOval 20,50,100,100 ;  20 pixels from the left,  50 pixels from the top  2 Repaint the object at a different x and y coordinate  g.ﬁllOval 25,55,100,100 ;  25 pixels from the left, 55  pixels from the top  the object moved a little  down and to the right     3 Repeat the previous step with changing x and y values   for as long as the animation is supposed to continue.  382  chapter 12  there are no Dumb Questions Q:Why are we learning about   animation here? I doubt if I’m  going to be making games.   A:You might not be making   games, but you might be  creating simulations, where  things change over time to show  the results of a process. Or you  might be building a visualization  tool that, for example, updates  a graphic to show how much  memory a program is using,  or to show you how much  traffic is coming through  your load-balancing server.  Anything that needs to take a  set of continuously-changing  numbers and translate them into  something useful for getting  information out of the numbers.  Doesn’t that all sound business- like? That’s just the “official  justification”, of course. The real  reason we’re covering it here is  just because it’s a simple way  to demonstrate another use  of inner classes.  And because  we just like animation, and our  next Head First book is about  J2EE and we know we can’t get  animation in that one.    getting gui  What we really want is something like...  class MyDrawPanel extends JPanel {           public void paintComponent Graphics g  {          g.setColor Color.orange ;          g.ﬁllOval x,y,100,100 ;      } }  s   e a c h   t i m e   p a i n t C o m p o n e n t       i l e d ,   t h e   o v a l   g e t s   p a i n t e d   a t   a   c a l d i f f e r e n t   l o c a t i o n    Sharpen your pencil  But where do we get the new x and y  coordinates?

Let’s make a music video. We’ll use Java-generated random  graphics that keep time with the music beats. Along the way we’ll register  and listen for  a new kind of  non-GUI event, triggered by the music itself.  Remember, this part is all optional. But we think it’s good for you.  And you’ll like it. And you can use it to impress people.   Ok, sure, it might work only on people who are really easy to impress,  but still...    386  chapter 12   Listening for a non-GUI event OK, maybe not a music video, but we will make  a program that draws random graphics on the  screen with the beat of the music. In a nutshell,  the program listens for the beat of the music  and draws a random graphic rectangle with each  beat.  That brings up some new issues for us. So far,  we’ve listened for only GUI events, but now  we need to listen for a particular kind of MIDI  event. Turns out, listening for a non-GUI event is  just like listening for GUI events: you implement  a listener interface, register the listener with an  event source, then sit back and wait for the event  source to call your event-handler method  the  method deﬁned in the listener interface . The simplest way to listen for the beat of the  music would be to register and listen for the  actual MIDI events, so that whenever the  sequencer gets the event, our code will get it  too and can draw the graphic. But... there’s a  problem. A bug, actually, that won’t let us listen  for the MIDI events we’re making  the ones for  NOTE ON . So we have to do a little work-around. There  is another type of MIDI event we can listen  for, called a ControllerEvent. Our solution  is to register for ControllerEvents, and then  make sure that for every NOTE ON event,  there’s a matching ControllerEvent ﬁred at  the same ‘beat’. How do we make sure the  ControllerEvent is ﬁred at the same time? We  add it to the track just like the other events! In  other words, our music sequence goes like this: BEAT 1 - NOTE ON, CONTROLLER EVENT BEAT 2 - NOTE OFF BEAT 3 - NOTE ON, CONTROLLER EVENT BEAT 4 - NOTE OFF and so on. Before we dive into the full program, though,  let’s make it a little easier to make and add MIDI  messages events since in this program, we’re  gonna make a lot of them.  getting gui  What the music art program  needs to do:  1 Make a series of MIDI messages   events to play random notes on a piano   or whatever instrument you choose   2 Register a listener for the events  3 Start the sequencer playing  4 Each time the listener’s event   handler method is called, draw a  random rectangle on the drawing  panel, and call repaint.  We’ll build it in three iterations:  1 Version One: Code that simpliﬁes mak- ing and adding MIDI events, since we’ll  be making a lot of them.  2 Version Two: Register and listen for   the events, but without graphics.  Prints a message at the command-line  with each beat.  4 Version Three: The real deal. Adds   graphics to version two.  you are here4 387   utility method for events  An easier way to make  messages   events  Right now, making and adding messages and  events to a track is tedious. For each message,  we have to make the message instance  in this  case, ShortMessage , call setMessage  , make a  MidiEvent for the message, and add the event  to the track. In last chapter’s code, we went  through each step for every message. That  means eight lines of code just to make a note  play and then stop playing! Four lines to add a  NOTE ON event, and four lines to add a NOTE  OFF event.   ShortMessage a = new ShortMessage  ; a.setMessage 144, 1, note, 100 ; MidiEvent noteOn = new MidiEvent a, 1 ;  track.add noteOn ;  ShortMessage b = new ShortMessage  ; b.setMessage 128, 1, note, 100 ; MidiEvent noteOff = new MidiEvent b, 16 ;  track.add noteOff ;  Things that have to happen for  each event: 1 Make a message instance  ShortMessage ﬁrst = new ShortMessage  ;  2 Call setMessage   with the instructions ﬁrst.setMessage 192, 1, instrument, 0   3 Make a MidiEvent instance for the message MidiEvent noteOn = new MidiEvent ﬁrst, 1 ;  4 Add the event to the track  track.add noteOn ;  Let’s build a static utility method that  makes a message and returns a MidiEvent  n t s     r a     m e  u  r  e  u m e e g a  s  g  s    f o   t h  r  e  t h f o  The event ‘tick’ for  WHEN this message  should happen        public static MidiEvent makeEvent int comd, int chan, int one, int two, int tick  {           MidiEvent event = null;           try {              ShortMessage a = new ShortMessage  ;              a.setMessage comd, chan, one, two ;              event = new MidiEvent a, tick ;                        }catch Exception e  { }           return event;        }  whoo!

The point of this code is simply to learn  how to use our new makeEvent   method. The code for the next  two versions is much smaller and simpler thanks to this method.  import javax.sound.midi.*;  public class MiniMusicPlayer1 {           public static void main String[] args  {          don’t forget the import        try {    e          Sequencer sequencer = MidiSystem.getSequencer  ;                   sequencer.open  ;                             Sequence seq = new Sequence Sequence.PPQ, 4 ;          Track track = seq.createTrack  ;                      for  int i = 5; i < 61; i+= 4  {       m a  k  make a sequence  and a track  make a bunch of events to make the notes keep  going up  from piano note 5 to piano note 61     n  e        p  o  s     a  q  e  n d    a     e  c  r  e  u  n           track.add makeEvent 144,1,i,100,i  ;          track.add makeEvent 128,1,i,100,i + 2  ;         }    end loop                         sequencer.setSequence seq ;           sequencer.setTempoInBPM 220 ;           sequencer.start  ;       } catch  Exception ex  {ex.printStackTrace  ;}   }    close main  start it running  call our new makeEvent   method to make the  message and event, then add the result  the  MidiEvent returned from makeEvent    to  the track.

Swing is easy. Unless you actually care where things end up on the screen.  Swing code   looks easy, but then you compile it, run it, look at it and think, “hey, that’s not supposed to go   there.”  The thing that makes it easy to code is the thing that makes it hard to control—the   Layout Manager. Layout Manager objects control the size and location of the widgets in a   Java GUI. They do a ton of work on your behalf, but you won’t always like the results. You want   two buttons to be the same size, but they aren’t.  You want the text field to be three inches long,   but it’s nine. Or one. And under the label instead of next to it. But with a little work, you can get   layout managers to submit to your will.  In this chapter, we’ll work on our Swing and in addition   to layout managers, we’ll learn more about widgets. We’ll make them, display them  where we   choose , and use them in a program. It’s not looking too good for Suzy.  this is a new chapter  399   A widget is technically  a Swing Component.  Almost every thing  you can stick in a  GUI extends from  javax.swing.JComponent.  components and containers  Swing components Component is the more correct term for what we’ve been calling a widget.  The things you put in a GUI. The things a user sees and interacts with. Text  ﬁelds, buttons, scrollable lists, radio buttons, etc. are all components. In  fact, they all extend  javax.swing.JComponent.   Components can be nested In Swing, virtually all components are capable of holding other  components. In other words, you can stick just about anything into anything  else. But most of the time, you’ll add user interactive components such as  buttons and lists into background components such as frames and panels.  Although it’s possible to put, say, a panel inside a button, that’s pretty  weird, and won’t win you any usability awards.  With the exception of JFrame, though, the distinction between interactive  components and background components is artiﬁcial. A JPanel, for  example, is usually used as a background for grouping other components,  but even a JPanel can be interactive. Just as with other components, you  can register for the JPanel’s events including mouse clicks and keystrokes.

In this GUI, I’m the one who decided  how big these buttons should be, and  where they are relative to each   other and the  frame.  Layout Managers A layout manager is a Java object associated  with a particular component, almost always a  background component. The layout manager  controls the components contained within the  component the layout manager is associated  with. In other words, if a frame holds a panel,  and the panel holds a button, the panel’s layout  manager controls the size and placement of  the button, while the frame’s layout manager  controls the size and placement of the  panel. The button, on the other hand,  doesn’t need a layout manager because the  button isn’t holding other components.  If a panel holds ﬁve things, even if those  ﬁve things each have their own layout  managers, the size and location of the ﬁve  things in the panel are all controlled by the  panel’s layout manager. If those ﬁve things,  in turn, hold other things, then those other  things are placed according to the layout  manager of the thing holding them. When we say hold we really mean add as in, a  panel holds a button because the button was  added to the panel using something like: myPanel.add button ; Layout managers come in several ﬂavors, and  each background component can have its own  layout manager. Layout managers have their  own policies to follow when building a layout.  For example, one layout manager might insist  that all components in a panel must be the same  size, arranged in a grid, while another layout  manager might let each component choose its  own size, but stack them vertically. Here’s an  example of nested layouts:     t  n  e m e  c     r e g p l a   s.  a d  n  n n  o    m a a   e t u  t  t u si z b    o     e  y  e  e   l a t h t     h  r  e l  B ’s o ls r t   e h t    P  c  n  n f  o  a  o  Panel A’s layout manager  controls the size and  placement of Panel B.  button 1  button 2  button 3  Panel B  JPanel panelA = new JPanel  ; JPanel panelB = new JPanel  ; panelB.add new JButton “button 1”  ; panelB.add new JButton “button 2”  ; panelB.add new JButton “button 3”  ; panelA.add panelB ;  Panel A  Panel A’s layout manager has NOTHING to  say about the three buttons. The hierarchy  of control is only one level—Panel A’s layout  manager controls only the things added directly  to Panel A, and does not control anything  nested within those added components.   you are here4 401   layout managers  How does the layout manager decide? Different layout managers have different policies for arranging  components  like, arrange in a grid, make them all the same size,  stack them vertically, etc.  but the components being layed out do  get at least some small say in the matter. In general, the process of  laying out a background component looks something like this:  A layout scenario:  Make a panel and add three buttons to it.  1  2  3  4  5  6  The panel’s layout manager asks each button how big  that button prefers to be.  The panel’s layout manager uses its layout policies to decide  whether it should respect all, part, or none of the buttons’  preferences.  Add the panel to a frame.  The frame’s layout manager asks the panel how big the panel  prefers to be.  The frame’s layout manager uses its layout policies to decide  whether it should respect all, part, or none of the panel’s  preferences.  Different layout managers have different policies  Some layout managers respect the size the component wants to  be. If the button wants to be 30 pixels by 50 pixels, that’s what the  layout manager allocates for that button. Other layout managers  respect only part of the component’s preferred size. If the button  wants to be 30 pixels by 50 pixels, it’ll be 30 pixels by however  wide the button’s background panel is. Still other layout managers  respect the preference of only the largest of the components  being layed out, and the rest of the components in that panel  are all made that same size. In some cases, the work of the layout  manager can get very complex, but most of the time you can  ﬁgure out what the layout manager will probably do, once you get  to know that layout manager’s policies.  402  chapter 13  Let’s see here... the   ﬁrst button wants to be   30 pixels wide, and the text ﬁeld   needs 50, and the frame is 200 pixels  wide and I’m supposed to arrange   everything vertically...  e  g  r  a  n    m a  t  u  o  l a  y   The Big Three layout managers:  border, flow, and box.  BorderLayout A BorderLayout manager divides a background  component into ﬁve regions. You can add only one  component per region to a background controlled  by a BorderLayout manager. Components laid out  by this manager usually don’t get to have their  preferred size. BorderLayout is the default layout  manager for a frame!  FlowLayout A FlowLayout manager acts kind of like a word  processor, except with components instead of  words. Each component is the size it wants to be,  and they’re laid out left to right in the order that  they’re added, with “word-wrap” turned on. So  when a component won’t ﬁt horizontally, it drops  to the next “line” in the layout. FlowLayout is the  default layout manager for a panel!  BoxLayout A BoxLayout manager is like FlowLayout in that  each component gets to have its own size, and  the components are placed in the order in which  they’re added. But, unlike FlowLayout, a BoxLayout  manager can stack the components vertically  or  horizontally, but usually we’re just concerned with  vertically . It’s like a FlowLayout but instead of  having automatic ‘component wrapping’, you can  insert a sort of ‘component return key’ and force  the components to start a new line.  using swing  o n e   c o m p o n e n t   p e r   r e g i o n  components added left  to right, wrapping to a  new line when needed  c o m p o n e n t s   a d d e d   t o p   i n e ’ l t o   b o t t o m ,   o n e   p e r   ‘  you are here4 403   border layout  BorderLayout cares  about five regions:      east, west, north,  south, and center  Let’s add a button to the east region:  import javax.swing.*; import java.awt.*;  BorderLayout is in java.awt package  public class Button1 {      public static void main  String[] args  {        Button1 gui = new Button1  ;        gui.go  ;    }     public void go   { c e p        JFrame frame = new JFrame  ;        JButton button = new JButton “click me” ;              frame.getContentPane  .add BorderLayout.EAST, button ;        frame.setSize 200,200 ;        frame.setVisible true ;   } }  i f y  s     e  h  e  r  t     i  g  o  n  brainbarbell Brain Barbell  How did the BorderLayout manager come up with  this size for the button?  What are the factors the layout manager has to  consider?

Since it’s in the east  region of a border layout,   I’ll respect its preferred width. But  I don’t care how tall it wants to be;  it’s gonna be as tall as the frame,   because that’s my policy.  I have a lot of words  now, so I’d prefer to be  60 pixels wide and 25   pixels tall.   Button   o b ject   Next time  I’m goin’ with ﬂow  layout.

The button is already as wide  as it can ever be—as wide as the frame.

And  if I’m in north or south, it’s just the  opposite—I get my preferred height, but   not width.  Button   o b ject   But what happens  in the center region?  The center region gets whatever’s left!   except in one special case we’ll look at later      public void go   {        JFrame frame = new JFrame  ;            JButton east = new JButton “East” ;        JButton west = new JButton “West” ;        JButton north = new JButton “North” ;        JButton south = new JButton “South” ;        JButton center = new JButton “Center” ;               frame.getContentPane  .add BorderLayout.EAST, east ;        frame.getContentPane  .add BorderLayout.WEST, west ;        frame.getContentPane  .add BorderLayout.NORTH, north ;        frame.getContentPane  .add BorderLayout.SOUTH, south ;        frame.getContentPane  .add BorderLayout.CENTER, center ;         frame.setSize 300,300 ;        frame.setVisible true ;   }  Components in the center get  whatever space is left over,  based on the frame dimensions   300 x 300 in this code . Components in the east and  west get their preferred width. Components in the north and  south get their preferred  height.  s l e x i p   0 0 3  When you put something  in the north or south, it  goes all the way across  the frame, so the things  in the east and west  won’t be as tall as they  would be if the north and  south regions were empty.  300 pixels  you are here4 407   flow layout  FlowLayout cares  about the ﬂow of the  components: left to right, top to bottom, in  the order they were added.  Let’s add a panel to the east region:  A JPanel’s layout manager is FlowLayout, by default. When we add  a panel to a frame, the size and placement of the panel is still  under the BorderLayout manager’s control. But anything inside the  panel  in other words, components added to the panel by calling  panel.add aComponent   are under the panel’s FlowLayout  manager’s control. We’ll start by putting an empty panel in the frame’s  east region, and on the next pages we’ll add things to the panel.  The panel doesn’t have anything  in it, so it doesn’t ask for much  width in the east region.  import javax.swing.*; import java.awt.*;  public class Panel1 {      public static void main  String[] args  {        Panel1 gui = new Panel1  ;        gui.go  ;    }     public void go   {        JFrame frame = new JFrame  ;              JPanel panel = new JPanel  ;        panel.setBackground Color.darkGray ;         frame.getContentPane  .add BorderLayout.EAST, panel ;        frame.setSize 200,200 ;        frame.setVisible true ;   } }      Make the panel gray so we can see  where it is on the frame.  408  chapter 13   using swing  Let’s add a button to the panel    public void go   {        JFrame frame = new JFrame  ;              JPanel panel = new JPanel  ;        panel.setBackground Color.darkGray ;          JButton button = new JButton “shock me” ;         panel.add button ;        frame.getContentPane  .add BorderLayout.EAST, panel ;         frame.setSize 250,200 ;        frame.setVisible true ;   }  Add the button to the panel and add the  ’s layout manager  panel to the frame.

It keeps components  stacked, even if there’s room  to put them side by side.  Unlike FlowLayout, BoxLayout can force a  ‘new line’ to make the components wrap to  the next line, even if there’s room for them  to ﬁt horizontally.  But now you’ll have to change the panel’s layout manager from the  default FlowLayout to BoxLayout.     public void go   {        JFrame frame = new JFrame  ;              JPanel panel = new JPanel  ;        panel.setBackground Color.darkGray ;          panel.setLayout new BoxLayout panel, BoxLayout.Y_AXIS  ;          C h a n g e   t h e   i n s t a n c e   o f   B o x L a y o u t .     l a y o u t   m a n a g e r   t o   b e   a   n e w           JButton button = new JButton “shock me” ;        JButton buttonTwo = new JButton “bliss” ;              panel.add button ;        panel.add buttonTwo ;        frame.getContentPane  .add BorderLayout.EAST, panel ;        frame.setSize 250,200 ;        frame.setVisible true ;   }  The BoxLayout constructor needs to know  the component its laying out  i.e., the panel   and which axis to use  we use Y_AXIS for a  vertical stack .  i  s         n a r r o w e r   a g a i n ,   i t   d o e s n ’ t   n e e d   t o   f i t   b o t h   b u t t o n s N o t i c e   h o w   t h e   p a n e l   t o l d   t h e   f r a m e   s e     S o   t h e   p a n e l b e c a u l a r g e s t   i t   n e e d e d   e n o u g h   r o o m   f o r   o n l y   t h e   l y . h o r i z o n t a l s h o c k   m e ’ ‘   b u t t o n ,  .  you are here4 411   layout managers  you can to a panel?    there are no Dumb Questions Q: How come you can’t add directly to a frame the way  A: A JFrame is special because it’s where the rubber   meets the road in making something appear on the screen.  While all your Swing components are pure Java, a JFrame  has to connect to the underlying OS in order to access the  display. Think of the content pane as a 100% pure Java layer  that sits on top of the JFrame. Or think of it as though JFrame  is the window frame and the content pane is the... glass. You  know, the window pane. And you can even swap the content  pane with your own JPanel, to make your JPanel the frame’s  content pane, using,  myFrame.setContentPane myPanel ;  Q: Can I change the layout manager of the frame?   What if I want the frame to use ﬂow instead of border?  A:The easiest way to do this is to make a panel, build   the GUI the way you want in the panel, and then make that  panel the frame’s content pane using the code in the previ- ous answer  rather than using the default content pane .  Q: What if I want a different preferred size? Is there a   setSize   method for components?  A:Yes, there is a setSize  , but the layout managers will   ignore it. There’s a distinction between the preferred size of  the component and the size you want it to be. The preferred  size is based on the size the component actually needs   the component makes that decision for itself  . The layout  manager calls the component’s getPreferredSize   method,  and that method doesn’t care if you’ve previously called  setSize   on the component.   Q:Can’t I just put things where I want them? Can I turn   the layout managers off?  A:Yep. On a component by component basis, you can call   setLayout null  and then it’s up to you to hard-code  the exact screen locations and dimensions. In the long run,  though, it’s almost always easier to use layout managers.  412  chapter 13   BULLET POINTS  ß  Layout managers control the size and location of   components nested within other components.  ß  When you add a component to another component   sometimes referred to as a background component,  but that’s not a technical distinction , the added  component is controlled by the layout manager of the  background component.  ß  A layout manager asks components for their   preferred size, before making a decision about  the layout. Depending on the layout manager’s  policies, it might respect all, some, or none of the  component’s wishes.  ß  The BorderLayout manager lets you add a   component to one of five regions. You must specify  the region when you add the component, using the  following syntax:  add BorderLayout.EAST, panel ;  ß  With BorderLayout, components in the north and   south get their preferred height, but not width.  Components in the east and west get their preferred  width, but not height. The component in the center  gets whatever is left over  unless you use pack   .  ß  The pack   method is like shrink-wrap for the   components; it uses the full preferred size of the  center component, then determines the size of the  frame using the center as a starting point, building  the rest based on what’s in the other regions.  ß  FlowLayout places components left to right, top to   bottom, in the order they were added, wrapping to a  new line of components only when the components  won’t fit horizontally.  ß  FlowLayout gives components their preferred size in   both dimensions.  ß  BoxLayout lets you align components stacked   vertically, even if they could fit side-by-side. Like  FlowLayout, BoxLayout uses the preferred size of  the component in both dimensions.  ß  BorderLayout is the default layout manager for a   ß   frame; FlowLayout is the default for a panel. If you want a panel to use something other than flow,  you have to call setLayout   on the panel.   using swing  Playing with Swing components You’ve learned the basics of layout managers, so now let’s try out a  few of the most common components: a text ﬁeld, scrolling text area,  checkbox, and list. We won’t show you the whole darn API for each of  these, just a few highlights to get you started.  JTextField  el  b  a  L  J  JTextField  Constructors  JTextField ﬁeld = new JTextField 20 ;  JTextField ﬁeld = new JTextField “Your name” ;    . s   n o t   2 0   p i x e l   2 0   c o l u m n s   t h e   p r e f e r r e d   w i d t h   o f    ,  2 0   m e a n s   d e f i n e s s T h i t h e   t e x t   f i e l d .

It  takes a little conﬁguration to make one, because it doesn’t come out of  the box with scroll bars or line wrapping. To make a JTextArea scroll, you  have to stick it in a ScrollPane. A ScrollPane is an object that really loves  to scroll, and will take care of the text area’s scrolling needs. i n e s 1 0     2 0   m e a n s  s e t s       2 0   c o l u m n s  1 0   m e a n s  Constructor        l  JTextArea text = new JTextArea 10,20 ;    t h e   p r e f e r r e d   h e i g h t      t h e   p r e f e r r e d   w i d t h    s e t s  How to use it  1  Make it have a vertical scrollbar only  JScrollPane scroller = new JScrollPane text ; text.setLineWrap true ;  Turn on line wrapping  e n ll P a   i t ’ s t a  a g        r    J S c   t a e r  o  h  e k M a e x t t  a a          t o  e      f o  h ll     i t c s  e o  g  v i   t     r  r .  n d   g n i o Tell the scroll pane to use only  a vertical scrollbar  scroller.setVerticalScrollBarPolicy ScrollPaneConstants.VERTICAL_SCROLLBAR_ALWAYS ; scroller.setHorizontalScrollBarPolicy ScrollPaneConstants.HORIZONTAL_SCROLLBAR_NEVER ;  panel.add scroller ;  Important!! You give the text area to the scroll pane  through the  scroll pane constructor , then add the scroll pane to the panel. You  don’t add the text area directly to the panel!  2  Replace the text that’s in it  text.setText “Not all who are lost are wandering” ;  3  Append to the text that’s in it  text.append “button clicked” ;  4  Select Highlight the text in the ﬁeld  text.selectAll  ;  5  Put the cursor back in the ﬁeld  so the user  can just start typing   text.requestFocus  ;  414  chapter 13   using swing  JTextArea example  import javax.swing.*; import java.awt.*; import java.awt.event.*;  public class TextArea1 implements ActionListener {      JTextArea text;      public static void main  String[] args  {        TextArea1 gui = new TextArea1  ;        gui.go  ;    }     public void go   {       JFrame frame = new JFrame  ;       JPanel panel = new JPanel  ;       JButton button = new JButton “Just Click It” ;       button.addActionListener this ;       text = new JTextArea 10,20 ;       text.setLineWrap true ;               JScrollPane scroller = new JScrollPane text ;       scroller.setVerticalScrollBarPolicy ScrollPaneConstants.VERTICAL_SCROLLBAR_ALWAYS ;       scroller.setHorizontalScrollBarPolicy ScrollPaneConstants.HORIZONTAL_SCROLLBAR_NEVER ;              panel.add scroller ;               frame.getContentPane  .add BorderLayout.CENTER, panel ;       frame.getContentPane  .add BorderLayout.SOUTH, button ;               frame.setSize 350,300 ;       frame.setVisible true ;    }        public void actionPerformed ActionEvent ev  {       text.append “button clicked \n ” ;    } }         Insert a new line so the words go on a  separate line each time the button is  clicked.

If I have to go to all this  trouble, I might as well just hard- code the size and coordinates for  where everything should go.  A: Getting the exact layout   you want from a layout man- ager can be a challenge. But think  about what the layout manager  is really doing for you. Even the  seemingly simple task of figuring  out where things should go on  the screen can be complex. For  example, the layout manager takes  care of keeping your components  from overlapping one another.  In other words, it knows how to  manage the spacing between  components  and between the  edge of the frame . Sure you can  do that yourself, but what happens  if you want components to be  very tightly packed? You might get  them placed just right, by hand,  but that’s only good for your JVM!  Why? Because the components  can be slightly different from  platform to platform, especially if  they use the underlying platform’s  native ‘look and feel’. Subtle things  like the bevel of the buttons can  be different in such a way that  components that line up neatly  on one platform suddenly squish  together on another.   And we’re still not at the really Big  Thing that layout managers do.  Think about what happens when  the user resizes the window! Or  your GUI is dynamic, where com- ponents come and go. If you had  to keep track of re-laying out all  the components every time there’s  a change in the size or contents of  a background component...yikes!   JList  using swing  Constructor  String [] listEntries = {“alpha”, “beta”, “gamma”, “delta”,     “epsilon”, “zeta”, “eta”, “theta “};           list = new JList listEntries ;  How to use it  1  Make it have a vertical scrollbar  JList constructor takes an array of any object  type.

In the Saving Objects chapter, we’ll learn how to  save and restore drum patterns. Finally, in the networking  chapter  Make a Connection , we’ll turn the BeatBox into a  working chat client.  418  chapter 13   Making the BeatBox This is the full code listing for this version of the BeatBox, with buttons for starting,  stopping, and changing the tempo. The code listing is complete, and fully- annotated, but here’s the overview:  using swing  1  2  3  4  Build a GUI that has 256 checkboxes  JCheckBox  that start out  unchecked, 16 labels  JLabel  for the instrument names, and four  buttons.  Register an ActionListener for each of the four buttons. We don’t  need listeners for the individual checkboxes, because we aren’t  trying to change the pattern sound dynamically  i.e. as soon as the  user checks a box . Instead, we wait until the user hits the ‘start’  button, and then walk through all 256 checkboxes to get their state  and make a MIDI track.  Set-up the MIDI system  you’ve done this before  including getting  a Sequencer, making a Sequence, and creating a track. We are using  a sequencer method that’s new to Java 5.0, setLoopCount   . This  method allows you to specify how many times you want a sequence  to loop. We’re also using the sequence’s tempo factor to adjust the  tempo up or down, and maintain the new tempo from one iteration of  the loop to the next.  When the user hits ‘start’, the real action begins. The event-handling  method for the ‘start’ button calls the buildTrackAndStart   method.  In that method, we walk through all 256 checkboxes  one row at  a time, a single instrument across all 16 beats  to get their state,  then use the information to build a MIDI track  using the handy  makeEvent   method we used in the previous chapter . Once the track  is built, we start the sequencer, which keeps playing  because we’re  looping it  until the user hits ‘stop’.  you are here4 419   BeatBox code  import java.awt.*; import javax.swing.*; import javax.sound.midi.*; import java.util.*; import java.awt.event.*;  public class BeatBox {      JPanel mainPanel;     ArrayList  checkboxList;     Sequencer sequencer;     Sequence sequence;     Track track;     JFrame theFrame;  We store the checkboxes in an ArrayList  These are the names of the instruments, as a String  array, for building the GUI labels  on each row       String[] instrumentNames = {“Bass Drum”, “Closed Hi-Hat”,         “Open Hi-Hat”,”Acoustic Snare”, “Crash Cymbal”, “Hand Clap”,         “High Tom”, “Hi Bongo”, “Maracas”, “Whistle”, “Low Conga”,         “Cowbell”, “Vibraslap”, “Low-mid Tom”, “High Agogo”,         “Open Hi Conga”};     int[] instruments = {35,42,46,38,49,39,50,60,70,72,64,56,58,47,67,63};           public static void main  String[] args  {         new BeatBox2  .buildGUI  ;     }        public void buildGUI   {         theFrame = new JFrame “Cyber BeatBox” ;         theFrame.setDefaultCloseOperation JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE ;         BorderLayout layout = new BorderLayout  ;         JPanel background = new JPanel layout ;         background.setBorder BorderFactory.createEmptyBorder 10,10,10,10  ;  These represent the actual drum ‘keys’.

He   knows I can save whole objects, but   does he let me? NO, that would be  too easy. Well, we’ll just see how   he feels after I...  Objects can be flattened and inflated. Objects have state and behavior.   Behavior lives in the class, but state lives within each individual object. So what happens when   it’s time to save the state of an object? If you’re writing a game, you’re gonna need a Save   Restore Game feature. If you’re writing an app that creates charts, you’re gonna need a Save   Open File feature.  If your program needs to save state, you can do it the hard way, interrogating   each object, then painstakingly writing the value of each instance variable to a file, in a   format you create. Or, you can do it the easy OO way—you simply freeze-dry flatten persist   dehydrate the object itself, and reconstitute inflate restore rehydrate it to get it back. But you’ll   still have to do it the hard way sometimes, especially when the file your app saves has to be read   by some other non-Java application, so we’ll look at both in this chapter.  this is a new chapter  429   saving objects  Capture the Beat You’ve made the perfect pattern. You want to save the pattern.  the pattern.  You could grab a piece of paper and start scribbling it down, but  You could grab a piece of paper and start scribbling it down, but  instead you hit the Save button  or choose Save from the File   button  or choose Save from the File  menu . Then you give it a name, pick a directory,  and exhale knowing that your masterpiece won’t go  out the window with the blue screen of death.  You have lots of options for how to save the state of  your Java program, and what you choose will probably  depend on how you plan to use the saved state. Here  are the options we’ll be looking at in this chapter.  If your data will be used by only the Java  program that generated it:  Use serialization Write a ﬁ le that holds ﬂ attened  serialized   objects. Then have your program read the  serialized objects from the ﬁ le and inﬂ ate them  serialized objects from the ﬁ le and inﬂ ate them  back into living, breathing, heap-inhabiting objects.  If your data will be used by other programs:  Write a plain text ﬁ le Write a ﬁ le, with delimiters that other programs can parse.  For example, a tab-delimited ﬁ le that a spreadsheet or  database application can use.  These aren’t the only options, of course. You can save data in any  format you choose. Instead of writing characters, for example,  you can write your data as bytes. Or you can write out any kind  of Java primitive as a Java primitive—there are methods to write  ints, longs, booleans, etc. But regardless of the method you use,  the fundamental I O techniques are pretty much the same:  write some data to something, and usually that something is either  a ﬁ le on disk or a stream coming from a network connection.  Reading the data is the same process in reverse: read some data  from either a ﬁ le on disk or a network connection. And of course  everything we talk about in this part is for times when you aren’t  using an actual database. 430  chapter 14  1  2   Saving State Imagine you have a program, say, a fantasy  adventure game, that takes more than one  session to complete. As the game progresses,  characters in the game become stronger, weaker,  smarter, etc., and gather and use  and lose   weapons. You don’t want to start from scratch  each time you launch the game—it took you  forever to get your characters in top shape for  a spectacular battle. So, you need a way to save  the state of the characters, and a way to restore  the state when you resume the game. And since  you’re also the game programmer, you want the  whole save and restore thing to be as easy  and  foolproof  as possible.  1  2  Option one Write the three serialized  character objects to a ﬁ le Create a ﬁ le and write three serialized  character objects. The ﬁ le won’t make  sense if you try to read it as text:   ̈ÌsrGameCharacter  ̈%gê8MÛIpowerLjava lang  String;[weaponst[Ljava lang  String;xp2tlfur[Ljava.lang.String;≠“VÁ È{Gxptbowtswordtdustsq~»tTrolluq~tb are handstbig axsq~xtMagicianuq~tspe llstinvisibility  Option two Write a plain text ﬁ le Create a ﬁ le and write three lines of text,  one per character, separating the pieces  of state with commas:  50,Elf,bow, sword,dust 200,Troll,bare hands,big ax 120,Magician,spells,invisibility  serialization and  file I O  Imagine you  have three game  characters to save...

For example, imagine all the ways in which  you could accidentally read back the values in the wrong  order.! The type might become “dust” instead of “Elf”,  while the Elf becomes a weapon...   you are here4 431   saving objects  Writing a serialized object to a file Here are the steps for serializing  saving  an object. Don’t bother  memorizing all this; we’ll go into more detail later in this chapter.  1 Make a FileOutputStream  FileOutputStream ﬁleStream = new FileOutputStream “MyGame.ser” ;  le “MyGame.ser” doesn’t  l be created automatical l  ly.  If the fi exist, it wi  Make a FileOutputStream object. FileOutputStream  knows how to connect to  and create  a file.  2 Make an ObjectOutputStream  ObjectOutputStream os = new ObjectOutputStream ﬁleStream ;  ObjectOutputStream lets you write objects,  le.

This is actual needs to be fed a ‘helper’ led ‘chaining’ one stream to another.  cal  3 Write the object  os.writeObject characterOne ; os.writeObject characterTwo ; os.writeObject characterThree ;  izes the objects referenced by character- One, characterTwo, and characterThree, and  serial writes them to the fi  le “MyGame.ser”.  4 Close the ObjectOutputStream  os.close  ;  Closing the stream at the top closes the ones  underneath, so the FileOutputStream  and the  file  will close automatically.  432  chapter 14   Data moves in streams from one place to another.  Destination  serialization and  file I O  Connection  streams represent  a connection  to a source or  destination  file,  socket, etc.  while  chain streams  can’t connect on  their own and must  be chained to a  connection stream.  Source  The Java I O API has connection streams, that represent connections to destinations and  sources such as ﬁ les or network sockets, and chain streams that work only if chained to  other streams.  Often, it takes at least two streams hooked together to do something useful—one to  represent the connection and   another to call methods on. Why two? Because connection  streams are usually too low-level. FileOutputStream  a connection stream , for example,  has methods for writing bytes. But we don’t want to write bytes! We want to write objects, so  we need a higher-level chain stream. OK, then why not have just a single stream that does exactly what you want? One that lets  you write objects but underneath converts them to bytes? Think good OO. Each class  does one thing well. FileOutputStreams write bytes to a ﬁ le. ObjectOutputStreams turn  objects into data that can be written to a stream. So we make a FileOutputStream that lets  us write to a ﬁ le, and we hook an ObjectOutputStream  a chain stream  on the end of it.  When we call writeObject   on the ObjectOutputStream, the object gets pumped into the  stream and then moves to the FileOutputStream where it ultimately gets written as bytes  to a ﬁ le. The ability to mix and match different combinations of connection and chain streams  gives you tremendous ﬂ exibility! If you were forced to use only a single stream class, you’d  be at the mercy of the API designers, hoping they’d thought of everything you might ever  want to do. But with chaining, you can patch together your own custom chains.  object is ﬂ attened  serialized   object is written as bytes to  is written to  Object  is chained to  011010010110111001  ObjectOutputStream   a chain stream   FileOutputStream         a connection stream   s t i n a t i o n  d e  01101001 01101110 01  File  you are here4 433   serialized objects  What really happens to an object  when it’s serialized?  1 Object on the heap  2 Object serialized  Objects on the heap have state—the  value of the object’s   instance  variables. These values make one  instance of a class different from  another instance of the same class.  Serialized objects save the values  of the instance variables, so that  an identical instance  object  can be  brought back to life on the heap.  t w o   b l e r i a     p s.    w i t v   e  c  h  a  O b i n  e  t  j  s  t n  c a     e  r i m i t i v 0 010 0101  010 0 0110  width  height  T h e   v a l u e s   a r e   s u c k e d   o u t   a n d   p u m p e d   i n t o   t h e   s t r e a m .  0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1  0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0  foo.ser  The instance variable values  for width and height are  saved to the file “foo.ser”,  along with a little more info  the JVM needs to restore  the object  like what its  class type is .

Foo myFoo = new Foo  ; myFoo.setWidth 37 ; myFoo.setHeight 70 ;  434  chapter 14   serialization and  file I O  But what exactly IS an object’s state?  What needs to be saved? Now it starts to get interesting. Easy enough to save the primitive  values 37 and 70. But what if an object has an instance variable  that’s an object reference? What about an object that has ﬁve  instance variables that are object references? What if those object  instance variables themselves have instance variables? Think about it. What part of an object is potentially unique?  Imagine what needs to be restored in order to get an object that’s  identical to the one that was saved. It will have a different memory  location, of course, but we don’t care about that. All we care about  is that out there on the heap, we’ll get an object that has the same  state the object had when it was saved.  brainbarbell Brain Barbell  What has to happen for the Car  object to be saved in such a way  that it can be restored back to its  original state?  Think of what—and how—you  might need to save the Car.    And what happens if an Engine  object has a reference to a  Carburator? And what’s inside the  Tire [] array object?  The Car object has two  instance variables that  reference two other  objects.

And all the objects those objects  refer to are serialized. And all the objects those  objects refer to are serialized... and the best  part is, it happens automatically!  This Kennel object has a reference to a Dog [] array object. The  Dog [] holds references to two Dog objects. Each Dog object holds  a reference to a String and a Collar object. The String objects  have a collection of characters and the Collar objects have an int. When you save the Kennel, all of this is saved!  Serialization saves the  entire object graph.  All objects referenced  by instance variables,  starting with the  object being serialized.  “Fido”  String o b  j  ect   name  String  col  Collar  Dog ob j e c t   size  int  Collar o b j e ct   “Spike”  String o b  j  ect   size  int  Collar o b j e ct   name  String  col  Collar  Dog ob j e c t   dogs  Dog [ ]  ct   j     k  c  a  e  b     Kennel  o b   o t   r e  h  o       s a d r   K e e .   t  e a  E v b r  t v o  t  y a t        e e  r  s  s  o  e  t  g   i n t s    h t     h i n d e   e r h is  o  t e l    n  n  436  chapter 14  foof  barf  Dog  Dog  Dog[ ]  arr a y  o     b ject    serialization and  file I O  If you want your class to be serializable,  implement Serializable The Serializable interface is known as a marker or tag interface,  because the interface doesn’t have any methods to implement. Its  sole purpose is to announce that the class implementing it is, well,  serializable. In other words, objects of that type are saveable through  the serialization mechanism. If any superclass of a class is serializable,  the subclass is automatically serializable even if the subclass doesn’t  explicitly declare implements Serializable.  This is how interfaces always  work. If your superclass “IS-A” Serializable, you are too .  objectOutputStream.writeObject myBox ;  i m p l e m e n t     a t   r u n t i m e .

Tell it to write the object.  you are here4 437   serialized objects  Serialization is all or nothing.   Can you imagine what would  happen if some of the object’s  state didn’t save correctly?  Eeewww! That   creeps me out just thinking   about it! Like, what if a Dog comes  back with no weight. Or no ears. Or  the collar comes back size 3 instead  of 30. That just can’t be allowed!  Either the entire  object graph is   serialized correctly  or serialization fails.  You can’t serialize  a Pond object if  its Duck instance  variable refuses to  be serialized  by  not implementing  Serializable .   import java.io.*;  public class Pond implements Serializable {      private Duck duck = new Duck  ;  Pond objects can be serialized.  C la s s  Pond  ha s  one   in stance   var iab le ,  a  Duck .      public static void main  String[] args  {        Pond myPond = new Pond  ;              try {          FileOutputStream fs = new FileOutputStream “Pond.ser” ;            ObjectOutputStream os = new ObjectOutputStream fs ;                    os.writeObject myPond ;          os.close  ;  When you serialize myPond  a Pond  object , its Duck instance variable  automatically gets serialized.        } catch Exception ex  {           ex.printStackTrace  ;       }    } }  Yikes!! Duck is not serializable!  It doesn’t implement Serializable,  so when you try to serialize a  Pond object, it fails because the  Pond’s Duck instance variable  can’t be saved.   public class Duck {       duck code here }  438  chapter 14  When you try to run the main in class Pond: File  Edit   Window  Help  Regret java.io.NotSerializableException: Duck % java Pond          a t   P o n d . m a i n   P o n d . j a v a : 1 3     serialization and  file I O  It’s hopeless,   then? I’m completely  screwed if the idiot who   wrote the class for my instance  variable forgot to make it   Serializable?   Mark an instance variable as transient  if it can’t  or shouldn’t  be saved.  If you want an instance variable to be skipped by the  serialization process, mark the variable with the transient  keyword.  a v  t r a s s  e       g i t .  n ’ t   “ d o   , a y s s n t   i e r i n s n   d u r i a b l e a v   s   t h i k i p e s s t   u j   n , i z a t i o r i a l userName variable  will be saved as part  of the object’s state  during serialization.  ”     import java.net.*; class Chat implements Serializable {     transient String currentID;          String userName;         more code }  If you have an instance variable that can’t be saved because  it isn’t serializable, you can mark that variable with the  transient keyword and the serialization process will skip right  over it.  So why would a variable not be serializable? It could be  that the class designer simply forgot to make the class  implement Serializable. Or it might be because the object  relies on runtime-speciﬁc information that simply can’t be  saved. Although most things in the Java class libraries are  serializable, you can’t save things like network connections,  threads, or ﬁle objects. They’re all dependent on  and  speciﬁc to  a particular runtime ‘experience’. In other words,  they’re instantiated in a way that’s unique to a particular run  of your program, on a particular platform, in a particular  JVM. Once the program shuts down, there’s no way to bring  those things back to life in any meaningful way; they have to  be created from scratch each time.  you are here4 439   serialized objects  there are no Dumb Questions Q: If serialization is so important,   why isn’t it the default for all classes?  Why doesn’t class Object implement  Serializable, and then all subclasses  will be automatically Serializable.  A: Even though most classes will,   and should, implement Serializable,  you always have a choice.  And you  must make a conscious decision on  a class-by-class basis, for each class  you design, to ‘enable’ serialization  by implementing Serializable.  First of all, if serialization were the  default, how would you turn it off?  Interfaces indicate functionality, not  a lack of functionality, so the model  of polymorphism wouldn’t work  correctly if you had to say, “implements  NonSerializable” to tell the world that  you cannot be saved.    Q: Why would I ever write a class   that wasn’t serializable?  A: There are very few reasons, but   you might, for example, have a security  issue where you don’t want a password  object stored. Or you might have an  object that makes no sense to save,  because its key instance variables are  themselves not serializable, so there’s  no useful way for you to make your  class serializable.  Q: If a class I’m using isn’t   serializable, but there’s no good  reason  except that the designer just  forgot or was stupid , can I subclass  the ‘bad’ class and make the subclass  serializable?  440  chapter 14  A: Yes! If the class itself is   extendable  i.e. not final , you can  make a serializable subclass, and just  substitute the subclass everywhere  your code is expecting the superclass  type.  Remember, polymorphism  allows this.  Which brings up another  interesting issue: what does it mean if  the superclass is not serializable?  Q: You brought it up: what does it   mean to have a serializable subclass  of a non-serializable superclass?  A: First we have to look at what   happens when a class is deserialized,   we’ll talk about that on the next few  pages . In a nutshell, when an object  is deserialized and its superclass is not  serializable, the superclass constructor  will run just as though a new object of  that type were being created. If there’s  no decent reason for a class to not  be serializable, making a serializable  subclass might be a good solution.  Q: Whoa! I just realized   something big... if you make a  variable ‘transient’, this means the  variable’s value is skipped over  during serialization. Then what  happens to it? We solve the problem  of having a non-serializable instance  variable by making the instance  variable transient, but don’t we NEED  that variable when the object is  brought back to life? In other words,  isn’t the whole point of serialization  to preserve an object’s state?  A: Yes, this is an issue, but   fortunately there’s a solution. If you  serialize an object, a transient reference  instance variable will be brought back   as null, regardless of the value it had  at the time it was saved. That means  the entire object graph connected to  that particular instance variable won’t  be saved. This could be bad, obviously,  because you probably need a non-null  value for that variable.  You have two options:  1  When the object is brought back,  reinitialize that null instance variable  back to some default state. This  works if your deserialized object isn’t  dependent on a particular value for  that transient variable. In other words,  it might be important that the Dog  have a Collar, but perhaps all Collar  objects are the same so it doesn’t  matter if you give the resurrected Dog  a brand new Collar; nobody will know  the difference.  2  If the value of the transient variable  does matter  say, if the color and design  of the transient Collar are unique for  each Dog  then you need to save the  key values of the Collar and use them  when the Dog is brought back to  essentially re-create a brand new Collar  that’s identical to the original.  Q: What happens if two objects in   the object graph are the same object?  Like, if you have two different Cat  objects in the Kennel, but both Cats  have a reference to the same Owner  object. Does the Owner get saved  twice? I’m hoping not.  A: Excellent question! Serialization   is smart enough to know when two  objects in the graph are the same. In  that case, only one of the objects is  saved, and during deserialization, any  references to that single object are  restored.    Deserialization: restoring an object The whole point of serializing an object is so that you can  restore it back to its original state at some later date, in a  different ‘run’ of the JVM  which might not even be the same  JVM that was running at the time the object was serialized .  Deserialization is a lot like serialization in reverse.  1 Make a FileInputStream  FileInputStream ﬁleStream = new FileInputStream “MyGame.ser” ;  serialization and  file I O  serialized  deserialized  le “MyGame.ser” doesn’t  l get an exception. l  If the fi exist, you’  Make a FileInputStream object. The FileInputStream  knows how to connect to an existing file.  2 Make an ObjectInputStream  ObjectInputStream os = new ObjectInputStream ﬁleStream ;  ObjectInputStream lets you read objects,  le.  but it can’t directly connect to a fi It needs to be chained to a connection  leInputStream. stream, in this case a Fi  3 read the objects  Object one = os.readObject  ; Object two = os.readObject  ; Object three = os.readObject  ;  Each time you say readObject  , you get the next  object in the stream. So you’ll read them back in  the same order in which they were written. You’ll  get a big fat exception if you try to read more  objects than you wrote.  4 Cast the objects   GameCharacter elf =  GameCharacter  one; GameCharacter troll =  GameCharacter  two; GameCharacter magician =  GameCharacter  three;  The return value of  readObject   is type Object  ike with ArrayList , so   just l you have to cast it back to  ly is. the type you know it real  5 Close the ObjectInputStream  os.close  ;  Closing the stream at the top closes the ones  underneath, so the FileInputStream  and the  file  will close automatically.  you are here4 441   deserializing objects  What happens during deserialization? When an object is deserialized, the JVM attempts to bring  the object back to life by making a new object on the heap  that has the same state the serialized object had at the time it  was serialized. Well, except for the transient variables, which  come back either null  for object references  or as default  primitive values.    t h r o w   a n   e x c e p t i o n   l o a d   t h e   c l a s  s  !     l l s t e p   w i s T h i c a n ’ t   f i n d   o r    i f   t h e   J V M    01101001 01101110 01  File  is read by  is chained to  object is read as bytes  011010010110111001  FileInputStream         a connection stream   class is found and loaded, saved  instance variables reassigned   ObjectInputStream   a chain stream   Object  1 The object is read from the stream.  2 The JVM determines  through info stored with  the serialized object  the object’s class type.   3 The JVM attempts to ﬁ nd and load the ob-  ject’s class. If the JVM can’t ﬁ nd and or load  the class, the JVM throws an exception and  the deserialization fails.  4 A new object is given space on the heap, but   the serialized object’s constructor does  NOT run! Obviously, if the constructor ran, it  would  restore the state of the object back  to its original ‘new’ state, and that’s not what  we want. We want the object to be restored  to the state it had when it was serialized, not  when it was ﬁ rst created.  442  chapter 14   serialization and  file I O  5 If the object has a non-serializable class   somewhere up its inheritance tree, the  constructor for that non-serializable class  will run along with any constructors above  that  even if they’re serializable . Once the  constructor chaining begins, you can’t stop it,  which means all superclasses, beginning with  the ﬁrst non-serializable one, will reinitialize  their state.  6 The object’s instance variables are given the   values from the serialized state. Transient  variables are given a value of null for object  references and defaults  0, false, etc.  for  primitives.  there are no Dumb Questions  Q:Why doesn’t the class get saved as part of the ob-  ject? That way you don’t have the problem with whether  the class can be found.  A:Sure, they could have made serialization work that   way. But what a tremendous waste and overhead. And  while it might not be such a hardship when you’re using  serialization to write objects to a file on a local hard drive,  serialization is also used to send objects over a network  connection. If a class was bundled with each serialized   shippable  object, bandwidth would become a much larger  problem than it already is.   For objects serialized to ship over a network, though, there  actually is a mechanism where the serialized object can be  ‘stamped’ with a URL for where its class can be found. This  is used in Java’s Remote Method Invocation  RMI  so that  you can send a serialized object as part of, say, a method   argument, and if the JVM receiving the call doesn’t have  the class, it can use the URL to fetch the class from the  network and load it, all automatically.  We’ll talk about RMI  in chapter 17.   Q:What about static variables? Are they serialized? A:Nope. Remember, static means “one per class” not   “one per object”. Static variables are not saved, and when an  object is deserialized, it will have whatever static variable  its class currently has. The moral: don’t make serializable ob- jects dependent on a dynamically-changing static variable!  It might not be the same when the object comes back.  you are here4 443   serialization example  import java.io.*;  Saving and restoring the game characters  public class GameSaverTest {    public static void main String[] args  {      GameCharacter one = new GameCharacter 50, “Elf”, new String[] {“bow”, “sword”, “dust”} ;      GameCharacter two = new GameCharacter 200, “Troll”, new String[] {“bare hands”, “big ax”} ;      GameCharacter three = new GameCharacter 120, “Magician”, new String[] {“spells”, “invisibility”} ;  Make some characters...          imagine code that does things with the characters that might change their state values        try {         ObjectOutputStream os = new ObjectOutputStream new FileOutputStream “Game.ser”  ;        os.writeObject one ;        os.writeObject two ;        os.writeObject three ;         os.close  ;     } catch IOException ex  {        ex.printStackTrace  ;     }     one = null;     two = null;     three = null;  We set them to null so we can’t  access the objects on the heap.

You do not need to call methods on the  FileOutputStream.  $  To be serialized, an object must implement the Serializable interface.  If a superclass of the class implements Serializable, the subclass will  automatically be serializable even if it does not specifically declare  implements Serializable.  $  When an object is serialized, its entire object graph is serialized. That   means any objects referenced by the serialized object’s instance  variables are serialized, and any objects referenced by those  objects...and so on. If any object in the graph is not serializable, an exception will be  thrown at runtime, unless the instance variable referring to the object  is skipped.  $   $  Mark an instance variable with the transient keyword if you want   serialization to skip that variable. The variable will be restored as null   for object references  or default values  for primitives .  $  During deserialization, the class of all objects in the graph must be   $  You read objects in  using readObject    in the order in which they   available to the JVM.  were originally written.  $  The return type of readObject   is type Object, so deserialized   objects must be cast to their real type.  $  Static variables are not serialized! It doesn’t make sense to save  a static variable value as part of a specific object’s state, since all  objects of that type share only a single value—the one in the class.  446  chapter 14   serialization and  file I O  What the game character data  might look like if you wrote it  out as a human-readable text file.  50,Elf,bow, sword,dust 200,Troll,bare hands,big ax 120,Magician,spells,invisibility  Writing a String to a Text File Saving objects, through serialization, is the    easiest way to save and  restore data between runnings of a Java program. But sometimes you  need to save data to a plain old text ﬁ le. Imagine your Java program  has to write data to a simple text ﬁ le that some other  perhaps non- Java  program needs to read. You might, for example, have a servlet   Java code running within your web server  that takes form data the  user typed into a browser, and writes it to a text ﬁ le that somebody else  loads into a spreadsheet for analysis.  Writing text data  a String, actually  is similar to writing an object,  except you write a String instead of an object, and you use a  FileWriter instead of a FileOutputStream  and you don’t chain it to an  ObjectOutputStream .

What? Think of  a File object as something more like a pathname of a ﬁ le   or even a directory  rather than The Actual File Itself.  The File class does not, for example, have methods for  reading and writing. One VERY useful thing about a File  object is that it offers a much safer way to represent a  ﬁ le than just using a String ﬁ le name. For example, most  classes that take a String ﬁ le name in their constructor   like FileWriter or FileInputStream  can take a File  object instead. You can  construct a File object, verify  that you’ve got a valid path, etc. and then give that File  object to the FileWriter or FileInputStream.  Some things you can do with a File object:  1  Make a File object representing an  existing ﬁ le File f = new File “MyCode.txt” ;   Make a new directory File dir = new File “Chapter7” ;  dir.mkdir  ;  List the contents of a directory if  dir.isDirectory    {       String[] dirContents = dir.list  ;       for  int i = 0; i < dirContents.length; i++  {           System.out.println dirContents[i] ;       } }  Get the absolute path of a ﬁ le or directory System.out.println dir.getAbsolutePath   ;  Delete a ﬁ le or directory  returns true if  successful  boolean isDeleted = f.delete  ;  452  chapter 14  2  3  4  5   A File object represents the name  and path of a ﬁ le or directory on  disk, for example:   Users Kathy   Data GameFile.txt  But it does NOT represent, or give  you access to, the data in the ﬁ le!  An address is NOT the  same as the actual  le object is  house !

You’d have to  carry each thing out to your car, one soup  can or toilet paper roll at a time.  buffers give you a temporary holding  place to group things until the holder   like the cart  is full. You get     to make  far fewer trips when you use a buffer.  s t i n a t i o n  d e  Aspen Denver Boulder  File  “Boulder”  String  is written to  String is put into a buffer  with other Strings “Boulder”  “Aspen”  “Denver”  BufferedWriter  a chain stream that  works with characters   When the buffer is full, the  Strings are all written to  is chained to  “Aspen Denver Boulder”  FileWriter  a connection stream  that writes characters  as opposed to bytes   BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter new FileWriter aFile  ; Notice that we don’t even  need to keep a reference to  the FileWriter object. The  only thing we care about is the  BufferedWriter, because that’s  the object we’ll call methods  on, and when we close the  BufferedWriter,  it will take  care of the rest of the chain.  The cool thing about buffers is that they’re much more efﬁ cient than  working without them. You can write to a ﬁ le using FileWriter alone, by  calling write someString , but FileWriter writes each and every thing you  pass to the ﬁ le each and every time. That’s overhead you don’t want or  need, since every trip to the disk is a Big Deal compared to manipulating  data in memory. By chaining a BufferedWriter onto a FileWriter, the  BufferedWriter will hold all the stuff you write to it until it’s full. Only when  the buffer is full will the FileWriter actually be told to write to the ﬁ le on disk.  If you do want to send data before the buffer is full, you do have control.  Just Flush It. Calls to writer.ﬂ ush   say, “send whatever’s in the buffer, now!”  you are here4 453   reading files  Reading from a Text File Reading text from a ﬁ le is simple, but this time we’ll use a File  object to represent the ﬁ le, a FileReader to do the actual reading,  and a BufferedReader to make the reading more efﬁ cient. The read happens by reading lines in a while loop, ending the loop  when the result of a readLine   is null.      That’s the most common  style for reading data  pretty much anything that’s not a Serialized  object : read stuff in a while loop  actually a while loop test ,  terminating when there’s nothing left to read  which we know  because the result of whatever read method we’re using is null .  A file with two lines of text.

How the heck do  million classes in the java.io package. How the heck do  you know which ones to use?  A:The I O API uses the modular ‘chaining’ concept so   that you can hook together connection streams and chain  that you can hook together connection streams and chain  streams  also called ‘filter’ streams  in a wide range of  combinations to get just about anything you could want.  combinations to get just about anything you could want.

Most of the time, though, you’ll use the same  small handful of classes. If you’re writing text files,  BufferedReader and BufferedWriter  chained to FileReader  BufferedReader and BufferedWriter  chained to FileReader  and FileWriter  are probably all you need. If you’re writing  serialized objects, you can use ObjectOutputStream and  ObjectInputStream  chained to FileInputStream and  FileOutputStream .  In other words, 90% of what you might typically do with  Java I O can use what we’ve already covered.   Q:What about the new I O nio classes added in 1.4? A:The java.nio classes bring a big performance   improvement and take greater advantage of native  capabilities of the machine your program is running  on. One of the key new features of nio is that you have  direct control of buffers. Another new feature is non- blocking I O, which means your I O code doesn’t just sit  there, waiting, if there’s nothing to read or write. Some  of the existing classes  including FileInputStream and  FileOutputStream  take advantage of some of the new  features, under the covers. The nio classes are more  complicated to use, however, so unless you really need the  new features, you might want to stick with the simpler  versions we’ve used here. Plus, if you’re not careful, nio can  lead to a performance loss. Non-nio I O is probably right  for 90% of what you’ll normally do, especially if you’re just  getting started in Java.  But you can ease your way into the nio classes, by using  FileInputStream and accessing its channel through the  getChannel   method  added to FileInputStream as of  version 1.4 .  serialization and  file I O  Make it Sticki kkk Ro se s  a re   f i r s t, v io le t s  a re  nex t.

A String with one  separator will have two tokens, one on each  side of the separator.

But  there’s one issue you might really care about.  Version Control is crucial! If you serialize an object, you must have the class in order to  deserialize and use the object. OK, that’s obvious. But what might  be less obvious is what happens if you change the class in the  meantime? Yikes. Imagine trying to bring back a Dog object when  one of its instance variables  non-transient  has changed from a  double to a String. That violates Java’s type-safe sensibilities in a Big  Way. But that’s not the only change      that might hurt compatibility.  Think about the following:  Changes to a class that can hurt deserialization: Deleting an instance variable Changing the declared type of an instance variable Changing a non-transient instance variable to transient Moving a class up or down the inheritance hierarchy Changing a class  anywhere in the object graph  from Serializable  to not Serializable  by removing ‘implements Serializable’ from a  class declaration  Changing an instance variable to static  Changes to a class that are usually OK: Adding new instance variables to the class  existing objects will  deserialize with default values for the instance variables they didn’t  have when they were serialized  Adding classes to the inheritance tree Removing classes from the inheritance tree Changing the access level of an instance variable has no affect on  the ability of deserialization to assign a value to the variable Changing an instance variable from transient to non-transient   previously-serialized objects will simply have a default value for the  previously-transient variables   460  chapter 14  1 You write a Dog class e r s  i o n    I D  101101  101101  101101  101101  10101000010  10101000010  1010 10 0  01010  1  1010101  10101010  1001010101   Dog.class  v   s c l a s  3 4 3  2 You serialize a Dog object   using that class  Dog ob j  e ct   Dog ob j  e c t      s  i e c t   O b j s t a m p e d   w i t h   i o n    3 4 3 e r s v  3 You change the Dog class c l a s s   v e r s i o n   I D  7 2 8  101101  101101  101101  101101  101000010  101000010  1010 10 0  01010  1  100001 1010  0 00110101  1 0 1 10 10  Dog.class  4 You deserialize a Dog object   using the changed class  Dog ob j  e c t   Object is  stamped with  version 343  101101  101101  101101  101101  101000010  101000010  1010 10 0  01010  1  100001 1010  0 00110101  1 0 1 10 10  Dog.class i o n   v   s c l a s  7 2 8  e r s  i  s     5 Serailization fails!!  The JVM says, “you can’t  teach an old Dog new code”.   Using the serialVersionUID  Each time an object is serialized, the object  including  every object in its graph  is ‘stamped’ with a version  ID number for the object’s class. The ID is called  the serialVersionUID, and it’s computed based on  information about the class structure. As an object is  being deserialized, if the class has changed since the  object was serialized, the class could have a different  serialVersionUID, and deserialization will fail! But you  can control this.  If you think there is ANY possibility that  your class might evolve, put a serial version  ID in your class. When Java tries to deserialize an object, it compares  the serialized object’s serialVersionUID with that of the  class the JVM is using for deserializing the object. For  example, if a Dog instance was serialized with an ID of,  say 23  in reality a serialVersionUID is much longer ,  when the JVM deserializes the Dog object it will ﬁrst  compare the Dog object serialVersionUID with the  Dog class serialVersionUID. If the two numbers don’t  match, the JVM assumes the class is not compatible  with the previously-serialized object, and you’ll get an  exception during deserialization. So, the solution is to put a serialVersionUID  in your class, and then as the class evolves, the  serialVersionUID will remain the same and the JVM  will say, “OK, cool, the class is compatible with this  serialized object.” even though the class has actually  changed. This works only if you’re careful with your class  changes! In other words, you are taking responsibility  for any issues that come up when an older object is  brought back to life with a newer class.  To get a serialVersionUID for a class, use the serialver  tool that ships with your Java development kit.

For example, be  sure that your new Dog class can deal with  an old Dog being deserialized with default  values for instance variables added to the  class after the Dog was serialized.  you are here4 461   Code Kitchen  Code Kitchen  Let’s make the BeatBox save and  restore our favorite pattern  462  chapter 14  l     i z e I t ” ,   l  i c k   “ s e r i a l W h e n   y o u   c l t h e   c u r r e n t   p a t t e r n   w i s a v e d . b e   “restore” loads the saved  pattern back in, and resets  the checkboxes.   serialization and  file I O  Saving a BeatBox pattern Remember, in the BeatBox, a drum pattern is nothing more than a bunch of  checkboxes. When it’s time to play the sequence, the code walks through the  checkboxes to ﬁgure out which drums sounds are playing at each of the 16  beats. So to save a pattern, all we need to do is save the state of the checkboxes. We can make a simple boolean array, holding the state of each of the 256  checkboxes.  An array object is serializable as long as the things in the array are  serializable, so we’ll have no trouble saving an array of booleans. To load a pattern back in, we read the single boolean array object  deserialize  it , and restore the checkboxes. Most of the code you’ve already seen, in the  Code Kitchen where we built the BeatBox GUI, so in this chapter, we look at  only the save and restore code. This CodeKitchen gets us ready for the next chapter, where instead of writing  the pattern to a ﬁle, we send it over the network to the server. And instead of  loading a pattern in from a ﬁle, we get patterns from the server, each time a  participant sends one to the server.  Serializing a pattern  This is an inner class inside  the BeatBox code.  public class MySendListener implements ActionListener {      public void actionPerformed ActionEvent a  {           boolean[] checkboxState = new boolean[256];           for  int i = 0; i < 256; i++  {  It all happens when the user clicks the  button and the ActionEvent fires. Make a boolean array to hold the  state of each checkbox.               JCheckBox check =  JCheckBox  checkboxList.get i ;              if  check.isSelected    {                 checkboxState[i] = true;              }          }  Walk through the checkboxList   ArrayList of checkboxes , and  get the state of each one, and  add it to the boolean array.           try {             FileOutputStream ﬁleStream = new FileOutputStream new File “Checkbox.ser”  ;             ObjectOutputStream os = new ObjectOutputStream ﬁleStream ;             os.writeObject checkboxState ;          } catch Exception ex  {              ex.printStackTrace  ;          }  This part’s a piece of cake.

Your Java program can reach out and touch a   program on another machine.  It’s easy.  All the low-level networking details are taken care of by   classes in the java.net library.  One of Java’s big benefits is that sending and receiving data over   a network is just I O with a slightly different connection stream at the end of the chain. If you’ve   got a BufferedReader, you can read. And the BufferedReader could care less if the data came   out of a file or flew down an ethernet cable. In this chapter we’ll connect to the outside world   with sockets. We’ll make client sockets. We’ll make server sockets. We’ll make clients and servers.   And we’ll make them talk to each other. Before the chapter’s done, you’ll have a fully-functional,   multithreaded chat client. Did we just say multithreaded?

So you don’t just get to read the other  participants’ messages, you get to load and  play a beat pattern simply by clicking the  message in the incoming messages area. In this chapter we’re going to  learn what it  takes to make a chat client like this. We’re  even going to learn a little about making a  chat server. We’ll save the full Beat Box Chat  for the Code Kitchen, but in this chapter you  write a Ludicrously Simple Chat Client and  will write a Ludicrously Simple Chat Client and  Very Simple Chat Server that send and receive  Very Simple Chat Server that send and receive  text messages.

But we’re  lucky, because the Java API networking package  java.net  makes it a piece of cake  for programmers. You’ll see a lot more GUI code than networking and I O code. And that’s not all. Lurking within the simple chat client is a problem we haven’t faced so far in this  book: doing two things at the same time. Establishing a connection is a one-time  operation  that either works or fails . But after that, a chat participant wants to  send outgoing messages and simultaneously receive incoming messages from the other  participants  via the server . Hmmmm... that one’s going to take a little thought, but  we’ll get there in just a few pages.   1  Connect Client connects to the server by  establishing a Socket connection.

A Socket   java.net.Socket class  is an object that represents  a network connection between two machines. What’s a  connection? A relationship between two machines, where two  pieces of software know about each other. Most importantly,  those two pieces of software know how to communicate with  each other. In other words, how to send bits to each other.  We don’t care about the low-level details, thankfully, because  they’re handled at a much lower place in the ‘networking  stack’. If you don’t know what the ‘networking stack’ is, don’t  worry about it. It’s just a way of looking at the layers that  information  bits  must travel through to get from a Java  program running in a JVM on some OS, to physical hardware   ethernet cables, for example , and back again on some other  machine. Somebody has to take care of all the dirty details.  But not you. That somebody is a combination of OS-speciﬁc  software and the Java networking API. The part that you have  to worry about is high-level—make that very high-level—and  shockingly simple. Ready?  networking and  threads  To make a Socket  connection, you need  to know two things  about the server: who  it is, and which port  it’s running on. In other words,  IP address and TCP  port number.  TCP port number  Socket chatSocket = new Socket “196.164.1.103”, 5000 ;  The chat server is at   196.164.1.103, port 5000.

When I need to talk to  him, that’s where I’ll send   the message.  Client  Server  A Socket connection means the two machines have  information about each other, including network  location  IP address  and TCP port.   you are here4 475   well-known ports  A TCP port is just a number.         A 16-bit number that identifies  a specific program on the server.  Your internet web  HTTP  server runs on port 80. That’s a  standard. If you’ve got a Telnet server, its running on port  23. FTP? 20. POP3 mail server? 110. SMTP? 25. The Time  server sits at 37. Think of port numbers as unique identiﬁers.  They represent a logical connection to a particular piece of  software running on the server. That’s it. You can’t spin your  hardware box around and ﬁnd a TCP port. For one thing,  you have 65536 of them on a server  0 - 65535 . So they  obviously don’t represent a place to plug in physical devices.  They’re just a  number representing an application. Without port numbers, the server would have no way of  knowing which application a client wanted to connect to.  And since each application might have its own unique  protocol, think of the trouble you’d have without these  identiﬁers. What if your web browser, for example, landed  at the POP3 mail server instead of the HTTP server? The  mail server won’t know how to parse an HTTP request! And  even if it did, the POP3 server doesn’t know anything about  servicing the HTTP request.  When you write a server program, you’ll include code that  tells the program which port number you want it to run on   you’ll see how to do this in Java a little later in this chapter .  In the Chat program we’re writing in this chapter, we picked  5000. Just because we wanted to. And because it met the  criteria that it be a number between 1024 and 65535. Why  1024? Because 0 through 1023 are reserved for the well- known services like the ones we just talked about. And if you’re writing services  server programs  to run on  a company network, you should check with the sys-admins  to ﬁnd out which ports are already taken. Your sys-admins  might tell you, for example, that you can’t use any port  number below, say, 3000. In any case, if you value your limbs,  you won’t assign port numbers with abandon. Unless it’s  your home network. In which case you just have to check with  your kids.   Well-known TCP port numbers  for common server applications  F T P  Telnet  S M T P 23 25 Server  37  20  Time  110  443  80 HTTP HTTPS A server can have up to 65536  different server apps running,  one per port.  POP3  The TCP port  numbers from 0 to 1023  are reserved for well- known services. Don’t  use them for your own  server programs!* The chat server we’re  writing uses port  5000. We just picked a   number between 1024  and 65535.  *Well, you might be able to use one of  these, but the sys-admin where you  work will probably kill you.  476  chapter 15   Q: How do you know the port   number of the server program you  want to talk to?   A: That depends on whether the   program is one of the well-known  services. If you’re trying to connect  to a well-known service, like the ones  on the opposite page  HTTP, SMTP,  FTP, etc.  you can look these up on  the internet  Google “Well-Known  TCP Port” . Or ask your friendly  neighborhood sys-admin.  But if the program isn’t one of the  well-known services, you need to  find out from whoever is deploying  the service. Ask him. Or her. Typically,  if someone writes a network service  and wants others to write clients for  it, they’ll publish the IP address, port  number, and protocol for the service.  For example, if you want to write a  client for a GO game server, you can  visit one of the GO server sites and  find information about how to write a  client for that particular server.  Q: Can there ever be more than   one program running on a single  port? In other words, can two  applications on the same server have  the same port number?  A: No! If you try to bind a program   to a port that is already in use, you’ll  get a BindException. To bind a program  to a port just means starting up a  server application and telling it to run  on a particular port. Again, you’ll learn  more about this when we get to the  server part of this chapter.  networking and  threads  IP address is the mall  Port number is the specific  store in the mall  IP address is like specifying a  particular shopping mall, say,  “Flatirons Marketplace”  Port number is like naming  a speciﬁ c store, say,  “Bob’s CD Shop”  Brain Barbell  OK, you got a Socket connection. The client and the  server know the IP address and TCP port number for  each other. Now what? How do you communicate  over that connection? In other words, how do you  move bits from one to the other? Imagine the kinds of  messages your chat client needs to send and receive.   How do these two  ly talk to  actual each other?  Client  Chat server  program  Server  you are here4 477   reading from a socket  To read data from a Socket, use a  BufferedReader To communicate over a Socket connection, you use streams.  Regular old I O streams, just like we used in the last chapter. One  of the coolest features in Java is that most of your I O work won’t  care what your high-level chain stream is actually connected to. In  other words, you can use a BufferedReader just like you did when  you were writing to a ﬁle, the difference is that the underlying  connection stream is connected to a Socket rather than a File!  1 Make a Socket connection to the server  Socket chatSocket = new Socket “127.0.0.1”, 5000 ;  input and output streams  to and from the Socket  connections   The port number, which you know  because we TOLD you that 5000 is  the port number for our chat server. 127.0.0.1 is the IP address for “localhost”, in  other words, the one this code is running on. You  can use this when you’re testing your client and  server on a single, stand-alone machine.  All we have to do is ASK the socket for  an input stream! It’s a low-level connection  stream, but we’re just gonna chain it to  something more text-friendly. Chain the BufferedReader to the  InputStreamReader which was chained to the low- level connection stream we got from the Socket.   2 Make an InputStreamReader chained to the Socket’s   low-level  connection  input stream  InputStreamReader stream = new InputStreamReader chatSocket.getInputStream   ;  InputStreamReader is a ‘bridge’ between a low- ike the one coming from the  level byte stream  l ike  Socket  and a high-level character stream  l the BufferedReader we’re after as our top of  the chain stream .  3 Make a BufferedReader and read!

Just a  couple of Sockets. Yes, a couple as in two. A ServerSocket,  which waits for client requests  when a client makes a  new Socket    and a plain old Socket socket to use for  communication with the client.  How it Works:  1 Server application makes a ServerSocket, on a speciﬁc port     ServerSocket serverSock = new ServerSocket 4242 ;  This starts the server application listening  for client requests coming in for port 4242.  2 Client makes a Socket connection to the server application    Socket sock = new Socket “190.165.1.103”, 4242 ;  Client knows the IP address and port number   published or given to him by whomever  conﬁgures the server app to be on that port   3 Server makes a new Socket to communicate with this client    Socket sock = serverSock.accept  ;  The accept   method blocks  just sits there  while  it’s waiting for a client Socket connection. When a  client ﬁnally tries to connect, the method returns  a plain old Socket  on a different port  that knows  how to communicate with the client  i.e., knows the  client’s IP address and port number . The Socket is on  a different port than the ServerSocket, so that the  ServerSocket can go back to waiting for other clients.  e t  k  c  S o  e t  k  c  S o  networking and  threads  e t  k  c  r S o  e  v  r  S e  4242  e t  k  c  r S o  e  v  r  S e  4242  g       w a i t i n n t   c li e  e t   k e x t    c n  v  r S o e   t h e     S e f o  r  r  4242  2789 Socket  you are here4 483   writing a server  DailyAdviceServer code This program makes a ServerSocket and waits for client requests.

The server makes a PrintWriter   using the Socket’s output stream  and sends a message to the client.  import java.io.*; import java.net.*;  r e m e m b e r   t h e  i m p o r t s     public class DailyAdviceServer {  ly advice comes from this array  dai   remember, these Strings  were word-wrapped by  the code editor.

The client knows the IP address and port  number of the server, but how is the server  able to make a Socket connection with the  client  and make input and output streams ?  Think about how   when   where the server  gets knowledge about the client.  there are no Dumb Questions Q: The advice server code on the opposite   page has a VERY serious limitation—it looks  like it can handle only one client at a time!  A:Yes, that’s right. It can’t accept a request   from a client until it has finished with the  current client and started the next iteration of  the infinite loop  where it sits at the accept    call until a request comes in, at which time it  makes a Socket with the new client and starts  the process over again .  Q: Let me rephrase the problem: how can   you make a server that can handle multiple  clients concurrently??? This would never  work for a chat server, for instance.  A:Ah, that’s simple, really. Use separate   threads, and give each new client Socket to a  new thread.  We’re just about to learn how to  do that!  networking and  threads   BULLET POINTS  ß  Client and server applications communicate over a Socket   connection.  ß  A Socket represents a connection between two applications  which may  or may not  be running on two different physical  machines.  ß  A client must know the IP address  or domain name  and   TCP port number of the server application.  ß  A TCP port is a 16-bit unsigned number assigned to a   specific server application. TCP port numbers allow different  clients to connect to the same machine but communicate  with different applications running on that machine.  ß  The port numbers from 0 through 1023 are reserved for   ‘well-known services’ including HTTP, FTP, SMTP, etc.  ß  A client connects to a server by making a Server socket   Socket s = new Socket “127.0.0.1”, 4200 ;   ß  Once connected, a client can get input and output streams  from the socket. These are low-level ‘connection’ streams.  sock.getInputStream  ;  ß  To read text data from the server, create a BufferedReader,  chained to an InputStreamReader, which is chained to the  input stream from the Socket.  ß   InputStreamReader is a ‘bridge’ stream that takes in  bytes and converts them to text  character  data. It’s used  primarily to act as the middle chain between the high-level  BufferedReader and the low-level Socket input stream.  ß  To write text data to the server, create a PrintWriter chained   directly to the Socket’s output stream. Call the print   or  println   methods to send Strings to the server.  ß  Servers use a ServerSocket that waits for client requests on   a particular port number.  ß  When a ServerSocket gets a request, it ‘accepts’ the request   by making a Socket connection with the client.  you are here4 485   a simple chat client  Writing a Chat Client We’ll write the Chat client application in two stages.

First, start the server in one terminal.  Next, use another terminal to start  this client.  you are here4 487   improving the chat client  Version Two: send  and receive  incoming  messages  outgoing message  The Server sends a message to all  client participants, as soon as the  message is received by the server.  When a client sends a message, it  doesn’t appear in the incoming  message display area until the  server sends it to everyone.  Big Question: HOW do you get messages from the server? Should be easy; when you set up the networking make an input stream as well   probably a BufferedReader . Then read messages using readLine  .  Bigger Question: WHEN do you get messages from the server? Think about that. What are the options?  1 Option One: Poll the server every 20 seconds   Pros: Well, it’s do-able  Cons: How does the server know what you’ve seen and what you haven’t? The server  would have to store the messages, rather than just doing a distribute-and-forget each time  it gets one. And why 20 seconds? A delay like this affects usability, but as you reduce the  delay, you risk hitting your server needlessly. Inefﬁcient.  2 Option Two: Read something in from the server each time the user   sends a message.  Pros: Do-able, very easy  Cons: Stupid. Why choose such an arbitrary time to check for messages? What if a user is  a lurker and doesn’t send anything?  3 Option Three: Read messages as soon as they’re sent from the server  Pros: Most efﬁcient, best usability  Cons: How do you do you do two things at the same time? Where would you put this code?  You’d need a loop somewhere that was always waiting to read from the server. But where  would that go? Once you launch the GUI, nothing happens until an event is ﬁred by a GUI  component.  488  chapter 15   networking and  threads  In Java you really CAN  walk and chew gum at  the same time.  Multithreading in Java  Java has multiple threading built right  into the fabric of the language. And it’s a  snap to make a new thread of execution: Thread t = new Thread  ; t.start  ; That’s it. By creating a new Thread object,  you’ve launched a separate thread of  execution, with its very own call stack. Except for one problem. That thread doesn’t actually do anything,  so the thread “dies” virtually the instant  it’s born. When a thread dies, its new  stack disappears again. End of story. So we’re missing one key component— the thread’s job. In other words, we need  the code that you want to have run by a  separate thread. Multiple threading in Java means we  have to look at both the thread and the job  that’s run by the thread. And we’ll also  have to look at the Thread class in the  java.lang package.  Remember, java.lang  is the package you get imported for  free, implicitly, and it’s where the classes  most fundamental to the language live,  including String and System.   you are here4 489  You know by now that we’re  going with option three.  We want something to run  continuously,  checking for messages from the server,  but without interrupting the user’s ability to  interact with the GUI! So while the user is  happily typing new messages or scrolling  through the incoming messages, we  want something behind the scenes to keep  reading in new input from the server. That means we ﬁ nally need a new thread.  A new, separate stack We want everything we did in the Send- Only version  version one  to work the  same way, while a new process runs along  side that reads information from the  server and displays it in the incoming text  area. Well, not quite. Unless you have multiple  processors on your computer, each new  Java thread is not actually a separate  process running on the OS. But it almost  feels as though it is.   threads and Thread  Java has multiple threads but only  one Thread class  We can talk about thread with a lower-case ‘t’ and Thread  with a capital ‘T’. When you see thread, we’re talking  about a separate thread of execution. In other words,  a separate call stack. When you see Thread, think of  the Java naming convention. What, in Java, starts with a  capital letter? Classes and interfaces. In this case,  Thread  is a class in the java.lang package. A Thread object  represents a thread of execution; you’ll create an instance of  class Thread each time you want to start up a new  thread  of execution.  thread  x.baz    y.bar    x.foo    main     doMore     go     doStuff     run     A thread is a separate  ‘thread of execution’.  In other words, a  separate call stack.  A Thread is a Java  class that represents  a thread. To make a thread,  make a Thread.  Thread  Thread  void join   void start    static void sleep    main thread  another thread   started by the code  A thread  lower-case ‘t’  is a separate thread of execution.  That means a separate call stack. Every Java application  starts up a main thread—the thread that puts the  main   method on the bottom of the stack. The JVM  is responsible for starting the main thread  and other  threads, as it chooses, including the garbage collection  thread . As a programmer, you can write code to start  other threads of your own.  java.lang.Thread   class  Thread  capital ‘T’  is a class that  represents a thread of execution.  It has methods for starting a  thread, joining one thread with  another, and putting a thread to  sleep.  It has more methods; these  are just the crucial ones we need  to use now .  490  chapter 15   networking and  threads  What does it mean to have more than  one call stack?  With more than one call stack, you get the appearance of having  multiple things happen at the same time. In reality, only a true  multiprocessor system can actually do more than one thing at a  time, but with Java threads, it can appear that you’re doing several  things simultaneously. In other words, execution can move back  and forth between stacks so rapidly that you feel as though all stacks  are executing at the same time. Remember, Java is just a process  running on your underlying OS. So ﬁrst, Java itself has to be ‘the  currently executing process’ on the OS. But once Java gets its  turn to execute, exactly what does the JVM run? Which bytecodes  execute?  Whatever is on the top of the currently-running stack!  And in 100 milliseconds, the currently executing code might switch  to a different method on a different stack.  One of the things a thread must do is keep track of which statement   of which method  is currently executing on the thread’s stack.  It might look something like this:  1 The JVM calls the main   method.  public static void main String[] args  { ...  }   2 main   starts a new thread. The main   thread is temporarily frozen while the new  thread starts running.  Runnable r = new MyThreadJob  ; Thread t = new Thread r ; t.start  ; Dog d = new Dog  ;    you’ll learn what  this means in just  a moment...  3 The JVM switches between the new   thread  user thread A  and the original  main thread, until both threads complete.  the active thread  main    main thread  a new thread starts  and becomes the active  thread  run    t.start   main    main thread  user thread A  h  t     e  e  r  t i v  c  a     e  h  t  g  a  a i n  a d   Dog    main    x.go   run    main thread  user thread A  you are here4 491   launching a thread  How to launch a new thread:  1  Make a Runnable object  the thread’s job  Runnable threadJob = new MyRunnable  ; Runnable is an interface you’ll learn about on the next page.  You’ll write a class that implements the Runnable interface,  and that class is where you’ll deﬁne the work that a thread  will perform. In other words, the method that will be run  from the thread’s new call stack.     R  unnable   o bject  2  Make a Thread object  the worker  and  give it a Runnable  the job   Thread myThread = new Thread threadJob ;  Pass the new Runnable object to the Thread constructor.  This tells the new Thread object which method to put on  the bottom of the new stack—the Runnable’s run   method.   3  Start the Thread myThread.start  ; Nothing happens until you call the Thread’s  start   method. That’s when you go from  having just a Thread instance to having a new  thread of execution. When the new thread  starts up, it takes the Runnable object’s  run   method and puts it on the bottom of  the new thread’s stack.  b ject   Thread   o  run    b ject   Thread   o  Runnabl e   o     bject  492  chapter 15   Every Thread needs a job to do.

A Runnable  is the job a thread is  supposed to run. A Runnable holds the  method that goes on  the bottom of the new  thread’s stack: run  .  Thread  A Thread object needs a job. A job the thread will run when the  thread is started. That job is actually the ﬁrst method that goes on  the new thread’s stack, and it must always be a method that looks  like this:               code that will be run by the new thread    public void run   {  }  How does the thread know which method to put at the bottom of  the stack? Because Runnable deﬁnes a contract. Because Runnable  is an interface. A thread’s job can be deﬁned in any class that  implements the Runnable interface. The thread cares only that you  pass the Thread constructor an object of a class that implements  Runnable. When you pass a Runnable to a Thread constructor, you’re really  just giving the Thread a way to get to a run   method. You’re giving  the Thread its job to do.    e i t ’ s r d l a     n  s  a  e  s           s  l y n o   e n   d e f i e   R e m e m b   .     r   c b li u p   s i o d   a t   w a   t h n i i t    n    o r , g e y .     e c r f a n t e i n u r o i d   v   c   m e t h e   t h   e p   t y o y  u    e b li o s   r  b l u    e  n  a n   R u e T h p   o d , m e t h e c r f a n t e i e t h o f   w h .  you are here4 493   Runnable interface  To make a job for your thread,  implement the Runnable interface  R u n n a b l e   i s   i n   t h e   j a v a . s o   y o u   d o n ’ t   n e e d   t o   i m p o r t   i t .  l a n g   p a c k a g e ,    public class MyRunnable implements Runnable {     public void run   {       go  ;    }  2     public void go   {       doMore  ;    }  Runnable has only one method to  implement: public void run    with no  arguments . This is where  you put the  JOB the thread is supposed to run.

In other words, there is a  Thread object, but no thread  of execution.  t.start  ; When you start the thread, it  moves into the runnable state.  This means the thread is ready  to run and just waiting for its  Big Chance to be selected for  execution. At this point, there is  a new call stack for this thread.  But there’s more. Once the thread becomes  runnable, it can move back and forth between  runnable, running, and an additional state:  temporarily not runnable  also known as ‘blocked’ .  This is the state all threads lust  after! To be The Chosen One.  The Currently Running Thread.  Only the JVM thread scheduler  can make that decision. You  can sometimes inﬂuence that  decision, but you cannot force a  thread to move from runnable  to running. In the running  state, a thread  and ONLY this  thread  has an active call stack,  and the method on the top of  the stack is executing.  you are here4 495   thread states  Typical runnable running loop  Typically, a thread moves back and  forth between runnable and running,  as the JVM thread scheduler selects a  thread to run and then kicks it back  out so another thread gets a chance.  RUNNABLE  RUNNING  Selected to run  Sent back to runnable  so another thread can  have a chance  RUNNABLE  RUNNING  A thread can be made  temporarily not-runnable  The thread scheduler can move a  running thread into a blocked state,  for a variety of reasons. For example,  the thread might be executing code  to read from a Socket input stream,  but there isn’t any data to read. The  scheduler will move the thread out  of the running state until something  becomes available. Or the executing  code might have told the thread to  put itself to sleep  sleep   . Or the  thread might be waiting because it  tried to call a method on an object,  and that object was ‘locked’. In that  case, the thread can’t continue until  the object’s lock is freed by the thread  that has it.  All of those conditions  and more   cause a thread to become temporarily  not-runnable.  496  chapter 15  BLOCKED  S ent to a te m porary  non-runnable state  until it can b eco m e  runnable again.  sleeping, waiting for another thread to finish,  waiting for data to be available on the stream,  waiting for an object’s lock...   The Thread Scheduler  The thread scheduler makes all the decisions about  who moves from runnable to running, and about when   and under what circumstances  a thread leaves the  running state. The scheduler decides who runs, and for  how long, and where the threads go when the scheduler  decides to kick them out of the currently-running state. You can’t control the scheduler. There is no API for  calling methods on the scheduler. Most importantly,  there are no guarantees about scheduling!  There are a  few almost-guarantees, but even those are a little fuzzy.  The bottom line is this: do not base your program’s  correctness on the scheduler working in a particular way!  The scheduler implementations are different for  different JVM’s, and even running the same program  on the same machine can give you different results.  One of the worst mistakes new Java programmers  make is to test their multi-threaded program on a  single machine, and assume the thread scheduler will  always work that way, regardless of where the program  runs.  So what does this mean for write-once-run-anywhere?  It means that to write platform-independent Java code,  your multi-threaded program must work no matter how  the thread scheduler behaves. That means that you can’t  be dependent on, for example, the scheduler making  sure all the threads take nice, perfectly fair and equal  turns at the running state. Although highly unlikely  today, your program might end up running on a JVM  with a scheduler that says, “OK thread ﬁve, you’re up,  and as far as I’m concerned, you can stay here until  you’re done, when your run   method completes.” The secret to almost everything is sleep. That’s  right, sleep. Putting a thread to sleep, even for a few  milliseconds, forces the currently-running thread to  leave the running state, thus giving another thread a  chance to run. The thread’s sleep   method does come  with one guarantee: a sleeping thread will not become  the currently-running thread before the the length of  its sleep time has expired. For example, if you tell your  thread to sleep for two seconds  2,000 milliseconds ,  that thread can never become the running thread again  until sometime after the two seconds have passed.  networking and  threads  Number four, you’ve had  enough time. Back to runnable.  Number two, looks like you’re up!   Oh, now it looks like you’re gonna have  to sleep. Number ﬁve, come take his   place. Number two, you’re still   sleeping...  The thread  scheduler makes all  the decisions about  who runs and who  doesn’t. He usually  makes the threads take  turns, nicely. But  there’s no guarantee  about that. He might  let one thread run  to its heart’s content  while the other  threads ‘starve’.  you are here4 497   thread scheduling  An example of how unpredictable the  scheduler can be...

That way, you call the Thread’s no-arg  constructor when you make the new thread;  Thread t = new Thread  ;     no Runnable  A: Yes, that is another way of making your own   thread, but think about it from an OO perspective.  What’s the purpose of subclassing? Remember that  we’re talking about two different things here—the  Thread and the thread’s job. From an OO view, those  two are very separate activities, and belong in separate  classes. The only time you want to subclass extend  the Thread class, is if you are making a new and more  specific type of Thread. In other words, if you think of  the Thread as the worker, don’t extend the Thread class  unless you need more specific worker behaviors. But if  all you need is a new job to be run by a Thread worker,  then implement Runnable in a separate, job-specific   not worker-specific  class.  This is a design issue and not a performance or  language issue. It’s perfectly legal to subclass Thread  and override the run   method, but it’s rarely a good  idea.  Q: Can you reuse a Thread object? Can you give it   a new job to do and then restart it by calling start    again?   A: No. Once a thread’s run   method has completed,   the thread can never be restarted. In fact, at that  point the thread moves into a state we haven’t talked  about—dead. In the dead state, the thread has  finished its run   method and can never be restarted.   The Thread object might still be on the heap, as a  living object that you can call other methods on  if  appropriate , but the Thread object has permanently  lost its ‘threadness’. In other words, there is no longer a  separate call stack, and the Thread object is no longer  a thread. It’s just an object, at that point, like all other  objects.  But, there are design patterns for making a pool of  threads that you can keep using to perform different  jobs. But you don’t do it by restarting   a dead thread.  500  chapter 15   BULLET POINTS  ß  A thread with a lower-case ‘t’ is a separate thread of   execution in Java.  ß  Every thread in Java has its own call stack.  ß  A Thread with a capital ‘T’ is the java.lang.Thread   class. A Thread object represents a thread of  execution.  ß  A Thread needs a job to do. A Thread’s job is an   instance of something that implements the Runnable  interface.  ß  The Runnable interface has just a single method, run  .  This is the method that goes on the bottom of the new  call stack. In other words, it is the first method to run in  the new thread.  ß  To launch a new thread, you need a Runnable to pass   to the Thread’s constructor.  ß  A thread is in the NEW state when you have   instantiated a Thread object but have not yet called  start  .   ß  When you start a thread  by calling the Thread object’s   start   method , a new stack is created, with the  Runnable’s run   method on the bottom of the stack.  The thread is now in the RUNNABLE state, waiting to  be chosen to run.  ß  A thread is said to be RUNNING when the JVM’s   thread scheduler has selected it to be the currently- running thread. On a single-processor machine, there  can be only one currently-running thread.  ß  Sometimes a thread can be moved from the RUNNING  state to a BLOCKED  temporarily non-runnable  state.  A thread might be blocked because it’s waiting for data  from a stream, or because it has gone to sleep, or  because it is waiting for an object’s lock.  ß  Thread scheduling is not guaranteed to work in any  particular way, so you cannot be certain that threads  will take turns nicely. You can help influence turn-taking  by putting your threads to sleep periodically.   Putting a thread to sleep  One of the best ways to help your threads take turns is  to put them to sleep periodically. All you need to do   is call the static sleep   method, passing it the sleep   duration, in milliseconds. For example: Thread.sleep 2000 ;  will knock a thread out of the running state, and  keep it out of the runnable state for two seconds.  The thread can’t become the running thread  again until after at least two seconds have passed.  A bit unfortunately, the sleep method throws an  InterruptedException, a checked exception, so all  calls to sleep must be wrapped in a try catch  or  declared . So a sleep call really looks like this: try {     Thread.sleep 2000 ; } catch InterruptedException ex  {     ex.printStackTrace  ; }  Your thread will probably never be interrupted from   sleep; the exception is in the API to support a thread  communication mechanism that almost nobody uses in  the Real World.  But, you still have to obey the handle  or declare law, so you need to get used to wrapping your  sleep   calls in a try catch. Now you know that your thread won’t wake up before the  speciﬁed duration, but is it possible that it will wake up  some time after the ‘timer’ has expired? Yes and no. It  doesn’t matter, really, because when the thread wakes  up, it always goes back to the runnable state! The thread  won’t automatically wake up at the designated time and  become the currently-running thread. When a thread  wakes up, the thread is once again at the mercy of  the thread scheduler. Now, for applications that don’t  require perfect timing, and that have only a few threads,  it might appear as though the thread wakes up and  resumes running right on schedule  say, after the 2000  milliseconds . But don’t bet your program on it.   networking and  threads  Put your thread to sleep  if you want to be sure  that other threads get a  chance to run.  When the thread wakes  up, it always goes back  to the runnable state  and waits for the thread  scheduler to choose it  to run again.  you are here4 501   This is what we want—a consistent order  of print statements:  File  Edit   Window  Help  SnoozeButton  % java ThreadTestDrive back in main top o’ the stack % java ThreadTestDrive back in main top o’ the stack % java ThreadTestDrive back in main top o’ the stack % java ThreadTestDrive back in main top o’ the stack % java ThreadTestDrive back in main top o’ the stack  l  l e e p   h e r e   w i  l   f o r c e   t h e   n e w   t h r e a d   t o   l e a v e   t h e   c u r r e n t l y - r u n n i n g   i n g   s l C a l s t a t e ! l   b e c o m e   t h e   c u r r e n t l y - r u n n i n g   t h r e a d   a g a i n ,   a n d   p r i n t   T h e   m a i n   t h r e a d   w i l   b e   a   o u t   “ b a c k   i n   m a i n ” .

You can give your threads a name of  your choosing, or you can accept their default names. But the  cool thing about names is that you can use them to tell which  thread is running.

Wow! Threads are   the greatest thing since the  MINI Cooper! I can’t think  of a single downside to using   threads, can you?    Um, yes. There IS a dark side.    Threads can lead to concurrency ‘issues’.  Concurrency issues lead to race conditions. Race conditions  lead to data corruption. Data corruption leads to fear... you  know the rest. It all comes down to one potentially deadly scenario: two or  more threads have access to a single object’s data. In other  words, methods executing on two different stacks are both  calling, say, getters or setters on a single object on the heap. It’s a whole ‘left-hand-doesn’t-know-what-the-right-hand- is-doing’ thing. Two threads, without a care in the world,  humming along executing their methods, each thread  thinking that he is the One True Thread. The only one  that matters. After all, when a thread is not running, and in  runnable  or blocked  it’s essentially knocked unconscious.  When it becomes the currently-running thread again, it doesn’t  know that it ever stopped.  504  chapter 15   Marriage in Trouble. Can this couple be saved?  Next, on a very special Dr.Steve Show  [Transcript from episode 42]  Welcome to the Dr. Steve show.   We’ve got a story today that’s centered around the top two reasons why  couples split up—ﬁnances and sleep.  Today’s troubled pair, Ryan and Monica, share a bed and a  bank account. But not for long if we can’t ﬁnd a solution. The  problem? The classic “two people—one bank account” thing.   Here’s how Monica described it to me:  “Ryan and I agreed that neither of us will overdraw the checking account.  So the procedure is, whoever wants to withdraw money must check the  balance in the account before making the withdrawal. It all seemed so  simple. But suddenly we’re bouncing checks and getting hit with overdraft  fees!  I thought it wasn’t possible, I thought our procedure was safe. But then  this happened:  Ryan needed $50, so he checked the balance in the account,  and saw that it was $100. No problem. So, he plans to  withdraw the money. But ﬁrst he falls asleep!    And that’s where I come in, while Ryan’s still asleep, and  now I want to withdraw $100. I check the balance, and  it’s $100  because Ryan’s still asleep and hasn’t yet made  his withdrawal , so I think, no problem. So I make the  withdrawal,  and  again  no  problem.  But  then  Ryan  wakes  up,  completes his withdrawal, and we’re suddenly overdrawn! He didn’t  even know that he fell asleep, so he just went ahead and completed his  transaction without checking the balance again. You’ve got to help us Dr.  Steve!”  Is there a solution? Are they doomed? We can’t stop Ryan from falling  asleep, but can we make sure that Monica can’t get her hands on the bank  account until after he wakes up?   Take a moment and think about that while we go to a commercial break.  networking and  threads  Ryan and Monica: victims  of the “two people, one  account” problem.  ls asleep after  Ryan fal he checks the balance  but before he makes the  . When he wakes  withdrawal up, he immediately makes  the withdrawl without  checking the balance again.  you are here4 505   Ryan and Monica code  The Ryan and Monica problem, in code The following example shows what can happen when two  threads  Ryan and Monica  share a single object  the bank  account . The code has two classes, BankAccount, and  MonicaAndRyanJob. The MonicaAndRyanJob class  implements Runnable, and represents the behavior that Ryan  and Monica both have—checking the balance and making  withdrawals. But of course, each thread falls asleep in between  checking the balance and actually making the withdrawal. The MonicaAndRyanJob class has an instance variable of type  BankAccount., that represents their shared account. The code works like this:  1 Make one instance of RyanAndMonicaJob.   The RyanAndMonicaJob class is the Runnable  the job to do ,  and since both Monica and Ryan do the same thing  check  balance and withdraw money , we need only one instance.  RyanAndMonicaJob  theJob = new RyanAndMonicaJob  ;  2 Make two threads with the same Runnable    the RyanAndMonicaJob instance  Thread one = new Thread theJob ; Thread two = new Thread theJob ;  3 Name and start the threads   one.setName “Ryan” ; two.setName “Monica” ; one.start  ; two.start  ;  Runnable  BankAccount int balance int balance  getBalance   getBalance   withdraw    RyanAndMonicaJob  BankAccount account run   makeWithdrawal    In the run   method, do  exactly what Ryan and  Monica would do—check  the balance and, if  there’s enough money,  make the withdrawal.  This should protect  against overdrawing the  account.  Except... Ryan and  Monica always fall  asleep after they  check the balance but  before they ﬁ nish the  withdrawal.   4 Watch both threads execute the run   method     check the balance and make a withdrawal  One thread represents Ryan, the other represents Monica.

The makeWithdrawal   method  always checks the balance  before making a withdrawal,  but still we overdraw the  account.  Here’s one scenario:  Ryan checks the balance, sees that  there’s enough money, and then falls  asleep.   Meanwhile, Monica comes in and checks  the balance. She, too, sees that there’s  enough money. She has no idea that  Ryan is going to wake up and complete a  withdrawal.   Monica falls asleep.  Ryan wakes up and completes his  withdrawal.   Monica wakes up and completes her  withdrawal. Big Problem! In between the  time when she checked the balance and  made the withdrawal, Ryan woke up and  pulled money from the account.   Monica’s check of the account was  not valid, because Ryan had already  checked and was still in the middle of  making a withdrawal.  Monica must be stopped from getting  into the account until Ryan wakes up and  ﬁnishes his transaction. And vice-versa.   They need a lock for account access!  The lock works like this:  1 There’s a lock associated with the bank   account transaction  checking the balance  and withdrawing money . There’s only  one key, and it stays with the lock until  somebody wants to access the account.  2 When Ryan wants to access the bank   account  to check the balance and withdraw  money , he locks the lock and puts the key  in his pocket. Now nobody else can access  the account, since the key is gone.  3 Ryan keeps the key in his pocket until he   ﬁnishes the transaction. He has the only  key, so Monica can’t access the account   or the checkbook  until Ryan unlocks the  account and returns the key.  Now, even if Ryan falls asleep after he  checks the balance, he has a guarantee  that the balance will be the same when he  wakes up, because he kept the key while he  was asleep!  networking and  threads  The bank account  transaction is  unlocked when  nobody is using  the account.  When Ryan  wants to access  the account, he  secures the lock  and takes the key.   When Ryan is  ﬁnished, he  unlocks the lock  and returns the  key. Now the key  is available for  Monica  or Ryan  again  to access  the account.  you are here4 509   using synchronized  We need the makeWithdrawal     method  to run as one atomic thing.   We need to make sure that once a thread enters the  makeWithdrawal   method, it must be allowed to ﬁnish the method  before any other thread can enter. In other words, we need to make sure that once a thread has  checked the account balance, that thread has a guarantee that it can  wake up and ﬁnish the withdrawal before any other thread can check the  account balance! Use the synchronized keyword to modify a method so that only  one thread at a time can access it. That’s how you protect the bank account! You don’t put a lock on  the bank account itself; you lock the method that does the banking  transaction. That way, one thread gets to complete the whole  transaction, start to ﬁnish, even if that thread falls asleep in the  middle of the method! So if you don’t lock the back account, then what exactly is locked? Is  it the method? The Runnable object? The thread itself? We’ll look at that on the next page. In code, though, it’s quite  simple—just add the synchronized modiﬁer to your method  declaration:  The synchronized  keyword means that  a thread needs a key  in order to access the  synchronized code.  To protect your data   like the bank account ,  synchronize the  methods that act on  that data.   private synchronized void makeWithdrawal int amount  {       if  account.getBalance   >= amount  {         System.out.println Thread.currentThread  .getName   + “ is about to withdraw” ;         try {            System.out.println Thread.currentThread  .getName   + “ is going to sleep” ;            Thread.sleep 500 ;         } catch InterruptedException ex  {ex.printStackTrace  ; }         System.out.println Thread.currentThread  .getName   + “ woke up.” ;         account.withdraw amount ;         System.out.println Thread.currentThread  .getName   + “ completes the withdrawl” ;     } else {        System.out.println “Sorry, not enough for “ + Thread.currentThread  .getName   ;    }  }   Note for you physics-savvy readers: yes, the convention of using the word ‘atomic’ here does not reflect  the whole subatomic parcticle thing. Think Newton, not Einstein, when you hear the word ‘atomic’ in the  context of threads or transactions. Hey, it’s not OUR convention. If WE were in charge, we’d apply  Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle to pretty much everything related to threads.   510  chapter 15   Using an object’s lock   Every object has a lock. Most of the time, the  lock is unlocked, and you can imagine a virtual  key sitting with it. Object locks come into play  only when there are synchronized methods.  When an object has one or more synchronized  methods, a thread can enter a synchronized  method only if the thread can get the key to the  object’s lock! The locks are not per method, they  are per object. If an object has two  synchronized methods, it does not  simply mean that you can’t have two  threads entering the same method. It  means you can’t have two threads entering  any of the synchronized methods. Think about it. If you have multiple  methods that can potentially act on an  object’s instance variables, all those methods  need to be protected with synchronized. The goal of synchronization is to protect  critical data. But remember, you don’t lock the  data itself, you synchronize the methods that  access that data.  So what happens when a thread is cranking  through its call stack  starting with the run    method  and it suddenly hits a synchronized  method? The thread recognizes that it needs  a key for that object before it can enter the  method. It looks for the key  this is all handled  by the JVM; there’s no API in Java for accessing  object locks , and if the key is available, the  thread grabs the key and enters the method.  From that point forward, the thread hangs on  to that key like the thread’s life depends on  it. The thread won’t give up the key until it  completes the synchronized method. So while  that thread is holding the key, no other threads  can enter any of that object’s synchronized  methods, because the one key for that object  won’t be available.  networking and  threads  Hey, this object’s   takeMoney   method is  synchronized. I need to get  this object’s key before I   can go in...  Every Java object has a lock.  A lock has only one key. Most of the time, the lock is  unlocked and nobody cares. But if an object has  synchronized methods, a  thread can enter one of the  synchronized methods ONLY  if the key for the object’s lock  is available. In other words,  only if another thread hasn’t  already grabbed the one key.  you are here4 511   synchronization matters  The dreaded “Lost Update” problem Here’s another classic concurrency problem, that comes from the database world. It’s  closely related to the Ryan and Monica story, but we’ll use this example to illustrate a few  more points. The lost update revolves around one process: Step 1:  Get the balance in the account     int i = balance; Step 2:  Add 1 to that balance      balance = i + 1; The trick to showing this is to force the computer to take two steps to complete the change  to the balance. In the real world, you’d do this particular move in a single statement:   balance++; But by forcing it into two steps, the problem with a non-atomic process will become clear.  So imagine that rather than the trivial “get the balance and then add 1 to the current  balance” steps, the two  or more  steps in this method are much more complex, and  couldn’t be done in one statement. In the “Lost Update” problem, we have two threads, both trying to increment the balance.   class TestSync implements Runnable {      private int balance;  r a d     g t i n     public void run   { t i o a r        for int i = 0; i < 50; i++  {         increment  ;         System.out.println “balance is “ + balance ;              }     }  h t   e m e   i t h  a i n e  u t n  c c a  h r c  n e  n h  r  e  e  t i m e e c n     s ,   n o     5 0   a l a b        s  e      public void increment   {        int i = balance;        balance = i + 1;     }  }  Here’s the crucial part! We increment the balance by  adding 1 to whatever the value of balance was AT THE  TIME WE READ IT  rather than adding 1 to whatever  the CURRENTvalue is   public class TestSyncTest {    public static void main  String[] args  {      TestSync job = new TestSync  ;      Thread a = new Thread job ;      Thread b = new Thread job ;      a.start  ;      b.start  ;    } }  512  chapter 15   networking and  threads  Let’s run this code...  1 Thread A runs for awhile  2 Thread B runs for awhile  Put the value of balance into variable i. Balance is 0, so i is now 0. Set the value of balance to the result of i + 1. Now balance is 1. Put the value of balance into variable i. Balance is 1, so i is now 1. Set the value of balance to the result of i + 1. Now balance is 2.  B  Put the value of balance into variable i. Balance is 2, so i is now 2. Set the value of balance to the result of i + 1. Now balance is 3. Put the value of balance into variable i. Balance is 3, so i is now 3.  [now thread B is sent back to runnable,  before it sets the value of balance to 4]  Put the value of balance into variable i. Balance is 3, so i is now 3. Set the value of balance to the result of i + 1. Now balance is 4. Put the value of balance into variable i. Balance is 4, so i is now 4. Set the value of balance to the result of i + 1. Now balance is 5.  3 Thread A runs again, picking up where it left off  A  B  A  B  4 Thread B runs again, and picks up exactly where it left off!  Set the value of balance to the result of i + 1. Now balance is 4.  !  Y i k e s  ! Thread A updated it to 5, but  now B came back and stepped  on top of the update A made,  as if A’s update never happened.  We lost the last updates  that Thread A made!  Thread B had previously  done a ‘read’ of the value  of balance, and when B  woke up, it just kept going  as if it never missed a beat.  you are here4 513   synchronizing methods  Make the increment   method atomic. Synchronize it!  Synchronizing the increment   method solves the “Lost  Update” problem, because it keeps the two steps in the method  as one unbreakable unit.  public synchronized void increment   {     int i = balance;     balance = i + 1; }  Once a thread enters  the method, we have  to make sure that all  the steps in the method  complete  as one  atomic process  before  any other thread can  enter the method.  there are no Dumb Questions Q: Sounds like it’s a good idea to synchronize  A: Nope, it’s not a good idea. Synchronization doesn’t   everything, just to be thread-safe.  B  come for free. First, a synchronized method has a certain  amount of overhead. In other words, when code hits a  synchronized method, there’s going to be a performance hit   although typically, you’d never notice it  while the matter of  “is the key available?” is resolved.   Second, a synchronized method can slow your program  down because synchronization restricts concurrency.  In  other words, a synchronized method forces other threads to  get in line and wait their turn. This might not be a problem  in your code, but you have to consider it.  Third, and most frightening, synchronized methods can lead  to deadlock!  See page 516.   A good rule of thumb is to synchronize only the bare  minimum that should be synchronized.  And in fact, you  can synchronize at a granularity that’s even smaller than  a method. We don’t use it in the book, but you can use the  synchronized keyword to synchronize at the more fine- grained level of one or more statements, rather than at the  whole-method level.  514  chapter 15                  doStuff   doesn’t need to  be synchronized, so we don’t  synchronize the whole method.  public void go   {    doStuff  ;     synchronized this  {       criticalStuff  ;       moreCriticalStuff  ;    } }  Now, only these two method calls are grouped  into one atomic unit. When you use the  synchronized keyword WITHIN a method,  rather than in a method declaration, you  have to provide an argument that is the  object whose key the thread needs to get.  Although there are other ways to do it, you  will almost always synchronize on the current  object  this . That’s the same object you’d  lock if the whole method were synchronized.   networking and  threads  1 Thread A runs for awhile  Attempt to enter the increment   method.  The method is synchronized, so get the key for this object Put the value of balance into variable i. Balance is 0, so i is now 0. Set the value of balance to the result of i + 1. Now balance is 1. Return the key  it completed the increment   method . Re-enter the increment   method and get the key. Put the value of balance into variable i. Balance is 1, so i is now 1.  [now thread A is sent back to runnable, but since it has not  completed the synchronized method, Thread A keeps the key]   2 Thread B is selected to run  Attempt to enter the increment   method. The method is  synchronized, so we need to get the key.  The key is not available.  [now thread B is sent into a ‘object lock not available lounge]  3 Thread A runs again, picking up where it left off          remember, it still has the key   Set the value of balance to the result of i + 1. Now balance is 2. Return the key.  [now thread A is sent back to runnable, but since it  has completed the increment   method, the thread  does NOT hold on to the key]  4 Thread B is selected to run  Attempt to enter the increment   method. The method is  synchronized, so we need to get the key.  This time, the key IS available, get the key.  Put the value of balance into variable i.  [continues to run...]  A  B  A  B  you are here4 515   thread deadlock  The deadly side of synchronization Be careful when you use synchronized code, because nothing  will bring your program to its knees like thread deadlock.  Thread deadlock happens when you have two threads, both of  which are holding a key the other thread wants. There’s no way  out of this scenario, so the two threads will simply sit and wait.  And wait. And wait. If you’re familiar with databases or other application servers,  you might recognize the problem; databases often have a  locking mechanism somewhat like synchronization. But a  real transaction management system can sometimes deal with  deadlock. It might assume, for example, that deadlock might  have occurred when two transactions are taking too long to  complete. But unlike Java, the application server can do a  “transaction rollback” that returns the state of the rolled-back  transaction to where it was before the transaction  the atomic  part  began.  Java has no mechanism to handle deadlock. It won’t even know  deadlock occurred. So it’s up to you to design carefully. If you  ﬁnd yourself writing much multithreaded code, you might  want to study “Java Threads” by Scott Oaks and Henry Wong  for design tips on avoiding deadlock. One of the most common  tips is to pay attention to the order in which your threads are  started.  All it takes for  deadlock are two  objects and two  threads.  foo  bar  A  B  A simple deadlock scenario:  1  A  2  Thread A enters a  synchronized method  of object foo, and gets  the key.   foo  3  Thread B enters a  synchronized method  of object bar, and gets  the key.  bar  B  Thread A goes to  sleep, holding the  foo key.  A  foo  Thread B tries to enter  a synchronized method  of object foo, but can’t  get that key  because   A has it . B goes   to the waiting lounge,  until the foo key is  available. B keeps the  bar key.  B  bar  foo  A  A  Thread A wakes up  still  holding the foo key   and tries to enter a  synchronized method on  object bar, but can’t get  that key because B has  it. A goes to the waiting  lounge, until the bar key is  available  it never will be!   Thread A can’t run until  it can get the bar key,   but B is holding the bar  key and B can’t run until it  gets the foo key that A is  holding and...  516  chapter 15    BULLET POINTS  ß  The static Thread.sleep   method forces a thread to leave the   running state for at least the duration passed to the sleep method.  Thread.sleep 200  puts a thread to sleep for 200 milliseconds.   ß  The sleep   method throws a checked exception  InterruptedException ,   so all calls to sleep   must be wrapped in a try catch, or declared.  ß  You can use sleep   to help make sure all threads get a chance to run,   although there’s no guarantee that when a thread wakes up it’ll go to the  end of the runnable line. It might, for example, go right back to the front.  In most cases, appropriately-timed sleep   calls are all you need to keep  your threads switching nicely.   ß  You can name a thread using the  yet another surprise  setName     method. All threads get a default name, but giving them an explicit name  can help you keep track of threads, especially if you’re debugging with  print statements.  ß  You can have serious problems with threads if two or more threads have   access to the same object on the heap.   ß  Two or more threads accessing the same object can lead to data   corruption if one thread, for example, leaves the running state while still  in the middle of manipulating an object’s critical state.  ß  To make your objects thread-safe, decide which statements should be  treated as one atomic process. In other words, decide which methods  must run to completion before another thread enters the same method  on the same object.  ß  Use the keyword synchronized to modify a method declaration,   when you want to prevent two threads from entering that method.   ß  Every object has a single lock, with a single key for that lock. Most of the   time we don’t care about that lock; locks come into play only when an  object has synchronized methods.  ß  When a thread attempts to enter a synchronized method, the thread  must get the key for the object  the object whose method the thread  is trying to run . If the key is not available  because another thread  already has it , the thread goes into a kind of waiting lounge, until the key  becomes available.   ß  Even if an object has more than one synchronized method, there is still  only one key. Once any thread has entered a synchronized method on  that object, no thread can enter any other synchronized method on the  same object. This restriction lets you protect your data by synchronizing  any method that manipulates the data.  networking and  threads  you are here4 517   final chat client  New and improved SimpleChatClient Way back near the beginning of this chapter, we built the SimpleChatClient that could send  outgoing messages to the server but couldn’t receive anything.

Every possible  disclaimer ever disclaimed is in effect here. To keep the code stripped down to the  bare essentials, we took out a lot of parts that you’d need to make this a real server.  In other words, it works, but there are at least a hundred ways to break it. If you  want a Really Good Sharpen Your Pencil for after you’ve ﬁ nished this book, come  back and make this server code more robust. Another possible Sharpen Your Pencil, that you could do right now, is to annotate  this code yourself.

If you have static  methods that change the static variable  state, can you still use synchronization?  A: Yes! Remember that static   methods run against the class and not  against an individual instance of the class.  So you might wonder whose object’s lock  would be used on a static method? After  all, there might not even be any instances  of that class. Fortunately, just as each  object has its own lock, each loaded class  has a lock.  That means that if you have  three Dog objects on your heap, you have  a total of four Dog-related locks. Three  belonging to the three Dog instances,  and one belonging to the Dog class itself.  When you synchronize a static method,  Java uses the lock of the class itself. So if  you synchronize two static methods in a  single class, a thread will need the class  lock to enter either of the methods.  Q: What are thread priorities? I’ve   heard that’s a way you can control  scheduling.  A: Thread priorities might help   you influence the scheduler, but they  still don’t offer any guarantee.  Thread  priorities are numerical values that tell  the scheduler  if it cares  how important a  thread is to you. In general, the scheduler  will kick a lower priority thread out of the  running state if a higher priority thread  suddenly becomes runnable. But... one  more time, say it with me now, “there  is no guarantee.”  We recommend that  you use priorities only if you want to  influence performance, but never, ever  rely on them for program correctness.  522  chapter 15  Q: Why don’t you just synchronize   all the getters and setters from the  class with the data you’re trying to  protect? Like, why couldn’t we have  synchronized just the checkBalance    and withdraw   methods from class  BankAccount, instead of synchronizing  the makeWithdrawal   method from  the Runnable’s class?  A: Actually, we should have   synchronized those methods, to prevent  other threads from accessing those  methods in other ways. We didn’t bother,  because our example didn’t have any  other code accessing the account.   But synchronizing the getters  and setters  or in this case the  checkBalance   and withdraw    isn’t  enough. Remember, the point of  synchronization is to make a specific  section of code work ATOMICALLY. In  other words, it’s not just the individual  methods we care about, it’s methods  that require more than one step to  complete! Think about it. If we had not  synchronized the makeWithdrawal    method, Ryan would have checked the  balance  by calling the synchronized  checkBalance   , and then immediately  exited the method and returned the key!  Of course he would grab the key again,  after he wakes up, so that he can call  the synchronized withdraw   method,  but this still leaves us with the same  problem we had before synchronization!  Ryan can check the balance, go to sleep,  and Monica can come in and also check  the balance before Ryan has a chance to  wakes up and completes his withdrawal.  So synchronizing all the access methods  is probably a good idea, to prevent  other threads from getting in, but you  still need to synchronize the methods  that have statements that must execute  as one atomic unit.   networking and  threads  Code Kitchen  dance beat  Andy: groove 2  Chris: groove2 revised  Nigel: dance beat  ,     s e n t   t o   s a g e   g e t s y o u r   m e s   a l o n g   t h e   o t h e r   p l a y e r s w i t h   y o u r   c u r r e n t   b e a t     w h e n   y o u   h i t   p a t t e r n , s e n d I t ” “  incoming messages from  players.

Even though the ship’s conference room was  incredibly claustrophobic, the sight of the growing blue and white crescent overtaking night on  the planet below ﬁlled Sarah with awe and appreciation.  This morning’s meeting was focused on the control systems for the orbiter’s airlocks.      As the ﬁnal construction phases were nearing their end, the number of spacewalks was   scheduled to increase dramatically, and trafﬁc was high both in and out of the ship’s   airlocks.  “Good morning Sarah”, said Tom, “Your timing is perfect, we’re just starting  the detailed design review.”      “As you all know”, said Tom, “Each airlock is outﬁtted with space-hardened GUI   terminals, both inside and out.  Whenever spacewalkers are entering or exiting the orbiter   they will use these terminals to initiate the airlock sequences.”  Sarah nodded, “Tom can  you tell us what the method sequences are for entry and exit?”  Tom rose, and ﬂoated to the  whiteboard, “First, here’s the exit sequence method’s pseudocode”, Tom quickly wrote on the  board.      orbiterAirlockExitSequence     verifyPortalStatus  ;       pressurizeAirlock  ;  openInnerHatch  ;  conﬁrmAirlockOccupied  ;  closeInnerHatch  ;  decompressAirlock  ;  openOuterHatch  ;  conﬁrmAirlockVacated  ;  closeOuterHatch  ;                          “To ensure that the sequence is not interrupted, we have synchronized all of the     methods called by the orbiterAirlockExitSequence   method”, Tom explained. “We’d hate to  see a returning spacewalker inadvertently catch a buddy with his space pants down!”                  Everyone chuckled as Tom erased the whiteboard, but something didn’t feel right  to Sarah and it ﬁnally clicked as Tom began to write the entry sequence pseudocode on the  whiteboard.  “Wait a minute Tom!”, cried Sarah, “I think we’ve got a big ﬂaw in the exit  sequence design, let’s go back and revisit it, it could be critical!”     Why did Sarah stop the meeting?  What did she suspect?  you are here4 527   What did Sarah know?        Sarah realized that in order to ensure that the entire exit  sequence would run without interruption the  orbiterAirlockExitSequence    method needed to  be synchronized.  As the design stood, it would be possible  for a returning spacewalker to interrupt the Exit Sequence!   The Exit Sequence thread couldn’t be interrupted in the  middle of any of the lower level method calls, but it could be  interrupted in between those calls.  Sarah knew that the entire  sequence should be run as one atomic unit, and if the orbit erAirlockExitSequence    method was synchronized, it  could not be interrupted at any point.  puzzle answers  528  chapter 15   16  collections and generics  Data structures  Sheesh... and all   this time I could have just let  Java put things in alphabetical  order?

Your job is to manage the data to track song popularity,  generate reports, and manipulate the playlists. You’re not  writing the entire app—some of the other software developer  waiters are involved as well, but you’re responsible for managing  and sorting the data inside the Java app. And since Lou has a thing  against databases, this is strictly an in-memory data collection. All  you get is the ﬁ le the jukebox keeps adding to. Your job is to take it  from there.

But you can see that the list is not in alphabetical  order... what can you do? You know that with an ArrayList, the elements are  kept in the order in which they were inserted into the  list, so putting them in an ArrayList won’t take care of  alphabetizing them, unless... maybe there’s a sort    method in the ArrayList class?  530  chapter 16   collections with generics  l   s t o r e   t h e   s o n g   t i t l e s   i n    l W e ’ a n   A r r a y L i s t   o f   S t r i n g s .

When you look in   ArrayList, there doesn’t seem to be any method related to sorting.  Walking up the inheritance hierarchy didn’t help either—it’s clear that you can’t call a sort  method on the ArrayList.        ArrayList has a lot of methods,  but there’s nothing here that  looks like it would sort...  532  chapter 16 532 chapter 16   collections with generics  I do see a collection class  called TreeSet... and the docs   say that it keeps your data  sorted. I wonder if I should be  using a TreeSet instead of an  ArrayList...  ArrayList is not the only collection  Although ArrayList is the one you’ll use most often,  there are others for special occasions. Some of the key  collection classes include:  $  TreeSet   Keeps the elements sorted and prevents duplicates.

In practice, an  ArrayList is still usually what you want.   $  HashSet   Prevents duplicates in the collection, and given an element, can  find that element in the collection quickly.  $  LinkedHashMap   Like a regular HashMap, except it can remember the order in  which elements  name value pairs  were inserted, or it can be  configured to remember the order in which elements were last  accessed.  you are here4 533   Collections.sort    You could use a TreeSet... Or you could use the    Collections.sort   method  If you put all the Strings  the song titles  into a TreeSet instead of  an ArrayList, the Strings would automatically land in the right place,  alphabetically sorted. Whenever you printed the list, the elements would  alphabetically sorted. Whenever you printed the list, the elements would  always come out in alphabetical order. And that’s great when you need a set  we’ll  talk about sets in a few minutes  or when  you know that the list must always stay  sorted alphabetically. On the other hand, if you don’t need the  list to stay sorted, TreeSet might be more  expensive than you need—every time you  insert into a TreeSet, the TreeSet has to take  the time to ﬁ gure out where in the tree the new  element must go. With ArrayList, inserts can  be blindingly fast because the new element  just goes in at the end.  Q: But you CAN add something to an   ArrayList at a speciﬁ c index instead of just at  the end—there’s an overloaded add   method  that takes an int along with the element to add.  So wouldn’t it be slower than inserting at the end?  A: Yes, it’s slower to insert something in an ArrayList   somewhere other than at the end. So using the overloaded  add index, element  method doesn’t work as quickly as calling  the add element —which puts the added element at the end.  But most of the time you use ArrayLists, you won’t need to put  something at a specific index.  Q: I see there’s a LinkedList class, so wouldn’t that be better for   doing inserts somewhere in the middle? At least if I remember my Data  Structures class from college...  A: Yes, good spot. The LinkedList can be quicker when you insert or   remove something from the middle, but for most applications, the difference  between middle inserts into a LinkedList and ArrayList is usually not enough  to care about unless you’re dealing with a huge number of elements. We’ll  look more at LinkedList in a few minutes.  534  chapter 16  java.util.Collections  public static void copy List destination, List source  public static List emptyList   public static void fill List listToFill, Object objToFillItWith  public static int frequency Collection c, Object o  public static void reverse List list  public static void rotate List list, int distance  public static void shuffle List list  public static void sort List list  public static boolean replaceAll List list, Object oldVal, Object newVal  public static boolean replaceAll List list, Object oldVal, Object newVal     many more methods...Hmmm... there IS a sort   method     many more methods... in the Collections class.

Now your boss wants actual Song class instances in the list, not just  Strings, so that each Song can have more data. The new jukebox  device outputs more information, so this time the ﬁ le will have four  pieces  tokens  instead of just two. The Song class is really simple, with only one interesting feature— the overridden toString   method. Remember, the toString    method is deﬁ ned in class Object, so every class in Java inherits the  method. And since the toString   method is called on an object  when it’s printed  System.out.println anObject  , you should  override it to print something more readable than the default  unique identiﬁ er code. When you print a list, the toString    method will be called on each object.  String title; String artist; String rating; String bpm;   F o u r   i n s t a n c e   v a r i a b l e s   f o r   t h e   l e . f o u r   s o n g   a t t r i b u t e s   i n   t h e   f i  Song String t, String a, String r, String b  {         }  The variables are all set in  the constructor when the  new Song is created.  title = t; artist = a; rating = r; bpm = b;  class Song {                                                               }  536  chapter 16  public String getTitle   {   }  return title;  public String getArtist   {    }  return artist;  public String getRating   {   }  return rating;  return bpm;  public String getBpm   {   }   public String toString   {   }    return title;   The getter methods for  the four attributes.  We override toString  , because when you do a System. out.println aSongObject , we want to see the title.  When you do a System.out.println aListOfSongs , it calls  the toString   method of EACH element in the list.   collections with generics  Changing the Jukebox code to use Songs  instead of Strings  Your code changes only a little—the ﬁle I O code is the same,  and the parsing is the same  String.split   , except this time  there will be four tokens for each song line, and all four will be  used to create a new Song object.

Something’s wrong... the Collections class clearly shows there’s a  sort   method, that takes a List.  ArrayList is-a List, because ArrayList implements the List interface,  so... it should work.  But it doesn’t! The compiler says it can’t ﬁnd a sort method that takes an  ArrayList , so maybe it doesn’t like an ArrayList of Song  objects? It didn’t mind an ArrayList , so what’s the  important difference between Song and String? What’s the  difference that’s making the compiler fail?

Obviously if you want  the song’s title to be the value that determines how the songs are  sorted, you’ll need some way to tell the sort method that it needs  to use the title and not, say, the beats per minute. We’ll get into all that a few pages from now, but ﬁrst, let’s ﬁnd out  why the compiler won’t even let us pass a Song ArrayList to the  sort   method.  538  chapter 16   collections with generics  WTF? I have no idea how to  read the method declaration   on this. It says that sort    takes a List , but what is  T? And what is that big thing   before the return type?  The sort   method declaration  From the    API docs  looking up the java.util.Collections class, and scrolling to the sort    method , it looks like the sort   method is declared... strangely. Or at least different from  anything we’ve seen so far. That’s because the sort   method  along with other things in the whole collection framework in  Java  makes heavy use of generics. Anytime you see something with angle brackets in Java source  code or documentation, it means generics—a feature added to Java 5.0. So it looks like we’ll  have to learn how to interpret the documentation before we can ﬁ gure out why we were able to  sort String objects in an ArrayList, but not an ArrayList of Song objects.  you are here4 539   generic types   Generics means more   type-safety We’ll just say it right here—virtually all of the code you write that deals  with generics will be collection-related code. Although generics can be used  in other ways, the main point of generics is to let you write type-safe  collections. In other words, code that makes the compiler stop you  from putting a Dog into a list of Ducks. Before generics  which means before Java 5.0 , the compiler could  not care less what you put into a collection, because all collection  implementations were declared to hold type Object. You could put  anything in any ArrayList; it was like all ArrayLists were declared as  ArrayList .   WITHOUT generics  Objects go IN as a reference to  SoccerBall, Fish, Guitar, and  Car objects  B e f o r e   g e n e r i c s ,   t h e r e   w a s   n o   w a y   t o   d e c l a r e   t h e   t y p e   o f   a n   A r r a y L i s t ,   s o   i t s   a d d       m e t h o d   t o o k   t y p e   O b j e c t .  ArrayList  Object  Object  Object  Object  And come OUT as a reference of type Object  WITH generics  Objects go IN as a reference to  only Fish objects  With generics, you can  create type-safe collections  where more problems are  caught at compile-time  instead of runtime. Without generics, the  compiler would happily let  you put a Pumpkin into an  ArrayList that was supposed  to hold only Cat objects.  ArrayList   Now with generics, you can put only Fish  objects in the ArrayList , so the  objects come out as Fish references.  You don’t have to worry about someone  sticking a Volkswagen in there, or that  what you get out won’t really be cast- able to a Fish reference.  And come out as a reference of type Fish  540  chapter 16   Learning generics Of the dozens of things you could learn about generics, there are  really only three that matter to most programmers:  1  Creating instances of generified classes  like ArrayList   When you make an ArrayList, you have to tell it the type  of objects you’ll allow in the list, just as you do with plain  old arrays.  2  Declaring and assigning variables of generic types  How does polymorphism really work with generic  types? If you have an ArrayList  reference  variable, can you assign an ArrayList  to it? What  about a List  reference? Can you assign an  ArrayList  to it? You’ll see...  3  Declaring  and invoking  methods that take generic types  If you have a method that takes as a parameter, say, an  ArrayList of Animal objects, what does that really mean?  Can you also pass it an ArrayList of Dog objects? We’ll  look at some subtle and tricky polymorphism issues that  are very different from the way you write methods that  take plain old arrays.  This is actually the same point as 2, but that shows you  how important we think it is.   Q: But don’t I also need to learn how to create my OWN generic   classes? What if I want to make a class type that lets people  instantiating the class decide the type of things that class will use?  A: You probably won’t do much of that. Think about it—the API   designers made an entire library of collections classes covering most of  the data structures you’d need, and virtually the only type of classes that  really need to be generic are collection classes. In other words, classes  designed to hold other elements, and you want programmers using it to  specify what type those elements are when they declare and instantiate  the collection class.   Yes, it is possible that you might want to create generic classes, but that’s  the exception, so we won’t cover it here.  But you’ll figure it out from the  things we do cover, anyway.   collections with generics  new ArrayList     List  songList =        new ArrayList     void foo List  list   x.foo songList   you are here4 541   generic classes  Using generic CLASSES  Since ArrayList is our most-used generiﬁed type, we’ll  start by looking at its documentation. They two key areas  to look at in a generiﬁed class are: 1   The class declaration 3   The method declarations that let you add elements  Understanding ArrayList documentation  Or, what’s the true meaning of “E”?   Think of “E” as a stand-in for  “the type of element you want  this collection to hold and  return.”  E is for Element.   i  s    a   p l a c e h o l d e r   f o r   t h e   R E A L   t y p e   y o u   u s e   w h e n   y o u   T h e   “ E ”   s t d e c l a r e   a n d   c r e a t e   a n   A r r a y L i  ArrayList is a subclass of AbstractList,  so whatever type you specify for the  ArrayList is automatically used for the  type of the AbstractList.  public class ArrayList  extends AbstractList  implements List   ... {    The type  the value of     becomes the type of the List  interface as well.         public boolean add E o   Here’s the important part! Whatever “E” is  determines what kind of things you’re allowed  to add to the ArrayList.     more code  }          The “E” represents the type used to create an instance  of ArrayList. When you see an “E” in the ArrayList  documentation, you can do a mental ﬁnd replace to  exchange it for whatever   you use to instantiate  ArrayList.  So, new ArrayList  means that “E” becomes “Song”,  in any method or variable declaration that uses “E”.  542  chapter 16   collections with generics  public class ArrayList  extends AbstractList ... {    Using type parameters with ArrayList  ArrayList  thisList = new ArrayList   THIS code:  Means ArrayList:  public class ArrayList  extends AbstractList  ... {     extends AbstractList  public boolean add E o   o     more code  Is treated by the compiler as:         }                  }    public boolean add String o     more code         In other words, the “E” is replaced by the real type  also called the type parameter   that you use when you create the ArrayList. And that’s why the add   method  for ArrayList won’t let you add anything except objects of a reference type that’s  compatible with the type of “E”. So if you make an ArrayList , the add    method suddenly becomes add String o . If you make the ArrayList of type Dog,  suddenly the add   method becomes add Dog o .  Q: Is “E” the only thing you can put there? Because the docs for sort used “T”.... A: You can use anything that’s a legal Java identifier.  That means anything that you   could use for a method or variable name will work as a type parameter. But the conven- tion is to use a single letter  so that’s what you should use , and a further convention is to  use “T” unless you’re specifically writing a collection class, where you’d use “E” to repre- sent the “type of the Element the collection will hold”.  you are here4 543   generic methods  Using generic METHODS  A generic class means that the class declaration includes a type  parameter. A generic method means that the method declaration  uses a type parameter in its signature.  You can use type parameters in a method in several different ways:  1  Using a type parameter defined in the class declaration  public class ArrayList  extends AbstractList  ... {    public boolean add E o   You can use the “E” here ONLY because it’s  already been defined as part of the class.  When you declare a type parameter for the class, you  can simply use that type any place that you’d use a  real class or interface type. The type declared in the  method argument is essentially replaced with the type  you use when you instantiate the class.  2  Using a type parameter that was NOT defined in the class declaration  public   void takeThing ArrayList  list    If the class itself doesn’t use a type parameter, you can still  specify one for a method, by declaring it in a really unusual   but available  space—before the return type. This method says  that T can be “any type of Animal”.  Here we can use   because we declared   “T” earlier in the method declaration.  544  chapter 16   collections with generics  Wait... that can’t be right. If you can  take a list of Animal, why don’t you   just SAY that? What’s wrong with just  takeThing ArrayList  list ?  Here’s where it gets weird...  This:  public   void takeThing ArrayList  list    Is NOT the same as this:  public void takeThing ArrayList  list    Both are legal, but they’re different! The ﬁrst one, where   is part of the method  declaration, means that any ArrayList declared of a type that is  Animal, or one of Animal’s subtypes  like Dog or Cat , is legal.  So you could invoke the top method using an ArrayList ,  ArrayList , or ArrayList . But... the one on the bottom, where the method argument is   ArrayList  list  means that only an ArrayList   is legal. In other words, while the ﬁrst version takes an ArrayList  of any type that is a type of Animal  Animal, Dog, Cat, etc. ,  the second version takes only an ArrayList of type Animal. Not  ArrayList , or ArrayList  but only ArrayList . And yes, it does appear to violate the point of polymorphism.  but it will become clear when we revisit this in detail at the end  of the chapter. For now, remember that we’re only looking at  this because we’re still trying to ﬁgure out how to sort   that  SongList, and that led us into looking at the API for the sort    method, which had this strange generic type declaration. For now, all you need to know is that the syntax of the top version  is legal, and that it means you can pass in a ArrayList object  instantiated as Animal or any Animal subtype.  And now back to our sort   method...  you are here4 545   sorting a Song  This still doesn’t  explain why the sort method  failed on an ArrayList of Songs  but worked for an ArrayList of  Strings...

And it looks like the answer is...  The sort   method can take only lists  of   Comparable objects.  Song is NOT a subtype of  Comparable, so you cannot sort    the list of Songs.  At least not yet...  public static  > void sort List  list   This says “Whatever ‘T’ is must  be of type Comparable.”   Ignore this part for now. But  if you can’t, it just means  that the type parameter for  Comparable must be of type T  or one of T’s supertypes.   You can pass in only a List  or  subtype of list, like ArrayList   that uses a parameterized type  that “extends Comparable”.  Um... I just checked the docs for  String, and String doesn’t EXTEND   Comparable--it IMPLEMENTS it.  Comparable is an interface. So it’s nonsense  to say  .   public ﬁ nal class String extends Object implements Serializable,                                                 Comparable , CharSequence  you are here4 547   In generics, the keyword  “extends” really means “is-a”,  and works for BOTH classes  and interfaces.  public static  > void sort List  list   the sort   method  In generics, “extends” means  “extends or implements”  The Java engineers had to give you a way to put a constraint  on a parameterized type, so that you can restrict it to, say, only  subclasses of Animal. But you also need to constrain a type to  allow only classes that implement a particular interface. So  here’s a situation where we need one kind of syntax to work  for both situations—inheritance and implementation. In other  words, that works for both extends and implements. And the winning word was... extends. But it really means “is-a”,  and works regardless of whether the type on the right is an  interface or a class.  Comparable is an interface, so this  REALLY reads, “T must be a type that  implements the Comparable interface”.  It doesn’t matter whether the thing on the right is  a class or interface... you still say “extends”.  Q: Why didn’t they just make a new keyword,“is”? A: Adding a new keyword to the language is a REALLY big deal because   it risks breaking Java code you wrote in an earlier version. Think about  it—you might be using a variable “is”  which we do use in this book to repre- sent input streams .  And since you’re not allowed to use keywords as identi- fiers in your code, that means any earlier code that used the keyword before  it was a reserved word, would break. So whenever there’s a chance for the  Sun engineers to reuse an existing keyword, as they did here with “extends”,  they’ll usually choose that. But sometimes they don’t have a choice...  A few  very few  new keywords have been added to the language, such  as assert in Java 1.4 and enum in Java 5.0  we look at enum in the appen- dix .  And this does break people’s code, however you sometimes have the  option of compiling and running a newer version of Java so that it behaves  as though it were an older one. You do this by passing a special flag to the  compiler or JVM at the command-line, that says, “Yeah, yeah, I KNOW this is  Java 1.4, but please pretend it’s really 1.3, because I’m using a variable in my  code named assert that I wrote back when you guys said it would OK!$%”.   To see if you have a flag available, type javac  for the compiler  or java  for  the JVM  at the command-line, without anything else after it, and you should  see a list of available options. You’ll learn more about these flags in the chap- ter on deployment.  548  chapter 16   Finally we know what’s wrong... The Song class needs to implement Comparable  We can pass the ArrayList  to the sort   method only if the  Song class implements Comparable, since that’s the way the sort     method was declared. A quick check of the API docs shows the  Comparable interface is really simple, with only one method to  implement:  java.lang.Comparable  public interface Comparable  {    int    compareTo T o ; }  collections with generics  The big question is: what  makes one song less than,  equal to, or greater than  another song? You can’t implement the  Comparable interface until you  make that decision.  And the method documentation for compareTo   says  Returns: a negative integer, zero, or a  positive integer as this object  is less than, equal to, or greater  than the speciﬁ ed object.  Write in your idea and pseudo code  or  better, REAL code  for implementing the  compareTo    method in a way that will  sort   the Song objects by title.  Hint: if you’re on the right track, it should  take less than 3 lines of code!  It looks like the compareTo   method will be called on one  Song object, passing that Song a reference to a different  Song. The Song running the compareTo   method has to  ﬁ gure out if the Song it was passed should be sorted higher,  lower, or the same in the list. Your big job now is to decide what makes one song greater  than another, and then implement the compareTo   method  to reﬂ ect that. A negative number  any negative number   means the Song you were passed is greater than the Song  running the method. Returning a positive number says  that the Song running the method is greater than the Song  passed to the compareTo   method. Returning zero means  the Songs are equal  at least for the purpose of sorting... it  doesn’t necessarily mean they’re the same object . You might,  for example, have two Songs with the same title.   Which brings up a whole different can of worms we’ll look  at later...   you are here4 549   the Comparable interface  The new, improved, comparable Song class We decided we want to sort by title, so we implement the compareTo    method to compare the title of the Song passed to the method against  the title of the song on which the compareTo   method was invoked.  In other words, the song running the method has to decide how its  title compares to the title of the method parameter. Hmmm... we know that the String class must know about alphabetical  order, because the sort   method worked on a list of Strings. We know  String has a compareTo   method, so why not just call it? That way, we  can simply let one title String compare itself to another, and we don’t  have to write the comparing alphabetizing algorithm!  class Song implements Comparable  {    String title;    String artist;    String rating;    String bpm;        public int compareTo Song s  {       return title.compareTo s.getTitle   ;   }     Song String t, String a, String r, String b  {       title = t;       artist = a;       rating = r;       bpm = b;    }     public String getTitle   {        return title;    }     public String getArtist   {        return artist;    }  File  Edit   Window  Help  Ambient  %java Jukebox3  Usually these match...we’re specifying the type that  the implementing class can be compared against.  This means that Song objects can be compared to  other Song objects, for the purpose of sorting.  The sort   method sends a Song to compareTo    to see how that Song compares to the Song on  which the method was invoked.  Simple! We just pass the work  on to the title String objects,  since we know Strings have a  compareTo    method.  This time it worked. It prints the list, then calls sort  which puts the Songs in alphabetical order by title.     public String getRating   {       return rating;    }  [Pink Moon, Somersault, Shiva Moon, Circles, Deep  Channel, Passenger, Listen]  [Circles, Deep Channel, Listen, Passenger, Pink  Moon, Shiva Moon, Somersault]    public String getBpm   {     return bpm;   }      public String toString   {      return title;    }  } 550  chapter 16   collections with generics  That’s not good enough.  Sometimes I want it to sort  by artist instead of title.   We can sort the list, but... There’s a new problem—Lou wants two different views of the song list,  one by song title and one by artist! But when you make a collection element comparable  by having it  implement Comparable , you get only one chance to implement the  compareTo   method. So what can you do?  The horrible way would be to use a ﬂ ag variable in the Song class,  and then do an if test in compareTo   and give a different result  depending on whether the ﬂ ag is set to use title or artist for the  comparison. But that’s an awful and brittle solution, and there’s something much  better. Something built into the API for just this purpose—when you  want to sort the same thing in more than one way.  Look at the Collections class API again. There’s a  second sort   method—and it takes a    Comparator.  T h e   s o r t       m e t h o d   i s   o v e r l o a d e d   t o   l e d   a   C o m p a r a t o r . t a k e   s o m e t h i n g   c a l N o t e   t o   s e l f :   f i g u r e   o u t   h o w   t o   g e t   m a k e   a   C o m p a r a t o r   t h a t   c a n   c o m p a r e   a n d   o r d e r   t h e   s o n g s   b y   a r t i s t   i n s t e a d   o f   t i t l e .  .  .  you are here4 551   java.util.Comparator  public interface Comparator  {    int compare T o1, T o2 ; }  If you pass a Comparator to the  sort   method, the sort order is  determined by the Comparator  rather than the element’s own  compareTo   method.  the Comparator interface  Using a custom Comparator  An element in a list can compare itself to another of  its own type in only one way, using its compareTo    method. But a Comparator is external to the element  type you’re comparing—it’s a separate class. So you can  make as many of these as you like! Want to compare  songs by artist? Make an ArtistComparator. Sort by beats  per minute? Make a BPMComparator.  Then all you need to do is call the overloaded sort    method that takes the List and the Comparator that will  help the sort   method put things in order. The sort   method that takes a Comparator will use the  Comparator instead of the element’s own compareTo    method, when it puts the elements in order. In other  words, if your sort   method gets a Comparator, it won’t  even call the compareTo   method of the elements  in the list. The sort   method will instead invoke the  compare   method on the Comparator. So, the rules are:  $  $  Invoking the one-argument sort List o  method  means the list element’s compareTo   method  determines the order. So the elements in the list  MUST implement the Comparable interface.  Invoking  sort List o, Comparator c  means the  list element’s compareTo   method will NOT be  called, and the Comparator’s compare   method  will be used instead. That means the elements  in the list do NOT need to implement the  Comparable interface.  Q: So does this mean that if you have a class that   doesn’t implement Comparable, and you don’t have the  source code, you could still put the things in order by  creating a Comparator?  A: That’s right. The other option  if it’s possible  would be   to subclass the element and make the subclass implement  Comparable.  Q: But why doesn’t every class implement Comparable?  A: Do you really believe that everything can be ordered?   If you have element types that just don’t lend themselves to  any kind of natural ordering, then you’d be misleading other  programmers if you implement Comparable. And you aren’t  taking a huge risk by not implementing Comparable, since  a programmer can compare anything in any way that he  chooses using his own custom Comparator.  552  chapter 16   collections with generics  Updating the Jukebox to use a Comparator  We did three new things in this code: 1  Created an inner class that implements Comparator  and thus the compare    method that does the work previously done by compareTo   . 2  Made an instance of the Comparator inner class. 3  Called the overloaded sort   method, giving it both the song list and the  instance of the Comparator inner class. Note: we also updated the Song class toString   method to print both the song  title and the artist.  It prints title: artist regardless of how the list is sorted.   import java.util.*; import java.io.*;  public class Jukebox5 {     ArrayList  songList = new ArrayList   ;     public static void main String[] args  {       new Jukebox5  .go  ;    }  Create a new inner class that implements  Comparator  note that its type  parameter matches the type we’re going  to compare—in this case Song objects.      class ArtistCompare implements Comparator  {      public int compare Song one, Song two  {           return one.getArtist  .compareTo two.getArtist   ;      }    }      public void go   {       getSongs  ;       System.out.println songList ;      Collections.sort songList ;      System.out.println songList ;  This becomes a String  the artist           ArtistCompare  artistCompare = new ArtistCompare  ;         Collections.sort songList, artistCompare ;  We’re letting the String variables  for artist   do the actual comparison, since Strings already  know how to alphabetize themselves.  Make an instance of the  Comparator inner class.  Invoke sort  , passing it the list  and a reference to the new  custom Comparator object.          System.out.println songList ;     }      void getSongs   {           I O code here    }      void addSong String lineToParse  {           parse line and add to song list     }    }  Note: we’ve made sort-by-title the default sort, by  keeping the compareTo   method in Song use the  titles.  But another way to design this would be to  implement both the title sorting and artist sorting as  inner Comparator classes, and not have Song implement  Comparable at all. That means we’d always use the two- arg version of Collections.sort  .  you are here4 553   Sharpen your pencil  Reverse Engineer Assume this code exists in  a single file.

The sorting all works, but now we have duplicates... The sorting works great, now we know how to sort on both title  using the Song object’s  compareTo   method  and artist  using the Comparator’s compare   method . But there’s  a new problem we didn’t notice with a test sample of the jukebox text ﬁ le—the sorted list  contains duplicates.  It appears that the diner jukebox just keeps writing to the ﬁ le regardless of whether the  same song has already been played  and thus written  to the text ﬁ le. The SongListMore.txt  jukebox text ﬁ le is a complete record of every song that was played, and might contain the  same song multiple times.

You  can have two keys that reference the same value, but you  cannot have duplicate keys.

Note: we left out some  of the Jukebox code, but you can copy it from earlier versions.

First, we have to ask—what makes two Song references  duplicates? They must be considered equal. Is it simply two  references to the very same object, or is it two separate objects  that both have the same title?   This brings up a key issue: reference equality vs. object equality.  $ Reference equality   Two references, one object on the heap. Two references that refer to the same object on  the heap are equal. Period. If you call the hashCode   method on  both references, you’ll get the same result. If you don’t override the  hashCode   method, the default  behavior  remember, you inherited  this from class Object  is that each object will get a unique number   most versions of Java assign a hashcode based on the object’s  memory address on the heap, so no two objects will have the same  hashcode . If you want to know if two references are really referring to the same  object, use the == operator, which  remember  compares the bits in  the variables. If both references point to the same object, the bits will  be identical.  $ Object equality   Two references, two objects on the heap, but the objects are considered meaningfully equivalent.  If you want to treat two different Song objects as equal  for  example if you decided that two Songs are the same if they have  matching title variables , you must override both the hashCode    and equals   methods inherited from class Object. As we said above, if you don’t override hashCode  , the default  behavior  from Object  is to give each object a unique hashcode  value. So you must override hashCode   to be sure that two  equivalent objects return the same hashcode. But you must also  override equals   so that if you call it on either object, passing in  the other object, always returns true.  If two objects foo and bar are  equal, foo.equals bar  must be  true, and both foo and bar must  return the same value from  hashCode  . For a Set to treat  two objects as duplicates, you  must override the hashCode    and equals   methods inherited  from class Object, so that you  can make two different objects  be viewed as equal.  title: Circles hashCode: 254  foo  Song  bar  Song  if  foo == bar  {        both references are referring        to the same object on the heap }  title: Circles hashCode: 254  title: Circles hashCode: 254  foo  Song  bar  Song  if  foo.equals bar  && foo.hashCode   == bar.hashCode    {        both references are referring to either a       a single object, or to two objects that are equal }  560  chapter 16   collections with generics  How a HashSet checks for duplicates: hashCode   and equals    When you put an object into a Hashset, it uses the  object’s hashcode value to determine where to put  the object in the Set. But it also compares the object’s  hashcode to the hashcode of all the other objects in  the HashSet, and if there’s no matching hashcode,  the HashSet assumes that this new object is not a  duplicate.  In other words, if the hashcodes are different, the  HashSet assumes there’s no way the objects can be  equal! So you must override hashCode   to make sure the  objects have the same value. But two objects with the same hashCode   might not  be equal  more on this on the next page , so if the   HashSet ﬁnds a matching hashcode for two objects— one you’re inserting and one already in the set—the  HashSet will then call one of the object’s equals    methods to see if these hashcode-matched objects  really are equal. And if they’re equal, the HashSet knows that the  object you’re attempting to add is a duplicate of  something in the Set, so the add doesn’t happen.  You don’t get an exception, but the HashSet’s add    method returns a boolean to tell you  if you care   whether the new object was added. So if the add    method returns false, you know the new object was a  duplicate of something already in the set.  I need to know  if your hashcode  values are the same.  Object you’re trying to  add to the HashSet.  title: Circles hashCode: 742  hashCode    2  4  7  HashSet  hashCode    742  title: Circles hashCode: 742  Object already IN  the HashSet.  foo  Song  bar  Song  foo  Song  bar  Song  Your hashcodes   are the same, but are  you REALLY equal?  HashSet  equals  bar    title: Circles hashCode: 742  r u e  t  Object you’re trying  to add runs its equals    method, comparing itself  to bar, and returns true.  title: Circles hashCode: 742  Object already IN  the HashSet.  you are here4 561   overriding hashCode   and equals    The Song class with overridden  hashCode   and equals    class Song implements Comparable {    String title;    String artist;    String rating;    String bpm;  s e   c a l T h e   H a s h S e t     o r   a n y o n e   e l m e t h o d     s e n d s   i t   a n o t h e r   S o n g .  i n g   t h i  l  s      public boolean equals Object aSong  {      Song s =  Song  aSong;      return getTitle  .equals s.getTitle   ;   }  The GREAT news is that title is a String,  and Strings have an overridden equals    l we have to do is ask one  method. So al title if it’s equal to the other song’s title.    public int hashCode   {       return title.hashCode  ;   }        public int compareTo Song s  {       return title.compareTo s.getTitle   ;   }  Same deal here... the String class has an overridden  hashCode   method, so you can just return the result of  calling hashCode   on the title. Notice how hashCode    and equals   are using the SAME instance variable.     Song String t, String a, String r, String b  {       title = t;       artist = a;       rating = r;       bpm = b;    }  Now it works! No duplicates when we  print out the HashSet. But we didn’t  call sort   again, and when we put  the ArrayList into the HashSet, the  HashSet didn’t preserve the sort order.     public String getTitle   {        return title;    }     public String getArtist   {        return artist;    }     public String getRating   {       return rating;    }    public String getBpm   {     return bpm;   }        public String toString   {      return title;    } }  562  chapter 16  File  Edit   Window  Help  RebootWindows  %java Jukebox6  [Pink Moon, Somersault, Shiva Moon, Circles,  Deep Channel, Passenger, Listen, Listen,  Listen, Circles]  [Circles, Circles, Deep Channel, Listen,  Listen, Listen, Passenger, Pink Moon, Shiva  Moon, Somersault]  [Pink Moon, Listen, Shiva Moon, Circles,   Deep Channel, Passenger, Somersault]   Java Object Law For HashCode    and equals    The API docs for class Object state the  rules you MUST follow:  $  If two objects are equal, they MUST   have matching hashcodes.  $  If two objects are equal, calling   equals   on either object MUST return  true. In other words, if  a.equals b   then   b.equals a  .  $  If two objects have the same hashcode   value, they are NOT required to be equal.  But if they’re equal, they MUST have the  same hashcode value.  $  So, if you override equals  , you MUST   override hashCode  .  $  The default behavior of hashCode     is to generate a unique integer for each  object on the heap. So if you don’t override  hashCode   in a class, no two objects of  that type can EVER be considered equal.  $  The default behavior of equals   is to   do an == comparison. In other words, to  test whether the two references refer to a  single object on the heap. So if you don’t  override equals   in a class, no two objects  can EVER be considered equal since  references to two different objects will  always contain a different bit pattern.  a.equals b  must also mean that  a.hashCode   == b.hashCode    But  a.hashCode   == b.hashCode   does NOT have to mean a.equals b   collections with generics  there are no Dumb Questions  even if objects aren’t equal?  Q: How come hashcodes can be the same  A: HashSets use hashcodes to store the ele-  ments in a way that makes it much faster to access.   If you try to find an object in an ArrayList by giving  the ArrayList a copy of the object  as opposed to  an index value , the ArrayList has to start searching  from the beginning, looking at each element in  the list to see if it matches. But a HashSet can find  an object much more quickly, because it uses the  hashcode as a kind of label on the “bucket” where  it stored the element. So if you say, “I want you  to find an object in the set that’s exactly like this  one...” the HashSet gets the hashcode value from  the copy of the Song you give it  say, 742 , and  then the HashSet says, “Oh, I know exactly where  the object with hashcode 742 is stored...”, and it  goes right to the 742 bucket.  This isn’t the whole story you get in a computer  science class, but it’s enough for you to use Hash- Sets effectively. In reality, developing a good hash- code algorithm is the subject of many a PhD thesis,  and more than we want to cover in this book.   The point is that hashcodes can be the same  without necessarily guaranteeing that the objects  are equal, because the “hashing algorithm” used in  the hashCode   method might happen to return  the same value for multiple objects. And yes, that  means that multiple objects would all land in the  same bucket in the HashSet  because each bucket  represents a single hashcode value , but that’s not  the end of the world. It might mean that the Hash- Set is just a little less efficient  or that it’s filled  with an extremely large number of elements , but  if the HashSet finds more than one object in the  same hashcode bucket, the HashSet will simply  use the equals   method to see if there’s a perfect  match. In other words, hashcode values are some- times used to narrow down the search, but to find  the one exact  match, the HashSet still has to take  all the objects in that one bucket  the bucket for  all objects with the same hashcode  and then call  equals   on them to see if the object it’s looking for  is in that bucket.  you are here4 563   TreeSets and sorting  And if we want the set to stay  sorted, we’ve got TreeSet  TreeSet is similar to HashSet in that it prevents duplicates. But it also keeps the list sorted.  It works  just like the sort   method in that if you make a TreeSet using the set’s no-arg constructor, the  TreeSet uses each object’s compareTo   method for the sort. But you have the option of passing  a Comparator to the TreeSet constructor, to have the TreeSet use that instead.  The downside to  TreeSet is that if you don’t need sorting, you’re still paying for it with a small performance hit. But  you’ll probably ﬁnd that the hit is almost impossible to notice for most apps.     import java.util.*; import java.io.*; public class Jukebox8 {     ArrayList  songList = new ArrayList   ;    int val;      public static void main String[] args  {       new Jukebox8  .go  ;    }      public void go   {        getSongs  ;        System.out.println songList ;       Collections.sort songList ;       System.out.println songList ;       TreeSet  songSet = new TreeSet   ;       songSet.addAll songList ;         System.out.println songSet ;     }      void getSongs   {       try {          File ﬁle = new File “SongListMore.txt” ;          BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader new FileReader ﬁle  ;          String line =  null;          while   line= reader.readLine    != null  {      We can add all the songs from the HashSet  using addAll  .

TreeSet looks easy, but make sure you really understand what you need to  do to use it. We thought it was so important that we made it an exercise so  you’d have to think about it.

If there is a problem  either compile-time or runtime  with this code,  how would you fix it?  you are here4 565   how TreeSets sort  TreeSet elements MUST be comparable  TreeSet can’t read the programmer’s mind to ﬁgure out how the  object’s should be sorted. You have to tell the TreeSet how.  To use a TreeSet, one of these  things must be true: $ The elements in   the list must be of a type that   implements Comparable  The Book class on the previous  page didn’t implement Comparable, so it  wouldn’t work at runtime. Think about it, the  poor TreeSet’s sole purpose in life is to keep  your elements sorted, and once again—it had  no idea how to sort Book objects! It doesn’t fail  at compile-time, because the TreeSet add    method doesn’t take a Comparable type,The  TreeSet add    method takes whatever type  you used when you created the TreeSet. In  other words, if you say new TreeSet     the add   method is essentially add Book . And  there’s no requirement that the Book class  implement Comparable! But it fails at runtime  when you add the second element to the set.  That’s the first time the set tries to call one of  the object’s compareTo   methods and... can’t.  OR  $ You use the TreeSet’s   overloaded constructor   that takes a Comparator  TreeSet works a lot like the sort    method—you have a choice of using the  element’s compareTo   method, assuming  the element type implemented the  Comparable interface, OR you can use  a custom Comparator that knows how  to sort the elements in the set. To use a  custom Comparator, you call the TreeSet  constructor that takes a Comparator.  566  chapter 16  class Book implements Comparable {    String title;    public Book String t  {      title = t;    }    public int compareTo Object b  {      Book book =  Book  b;      return  title.compareTo book.title  ;    } }  public class BookCompare implements Comparator  {    public int compare Book one, Book two  {       return  one.title.compareTo two.title  ;    } }  class Test {      public void go   {      Book b1 = new Book “How Cats Work” ;      Book b2 = new Book “Remix your Body” ;      Book b3 = new Book “Finding Emo” ;      BookCompare bCompare = new BookCompare  ;      TreeSet  tree = new TreeSet  bCompare ;      tree.add new Book “How Cats Work” ;      tree.add new Book “Finding Emo” ;      tree.add new Book “Remix your Body” ;               System.out.println tree ;    } }   collections with generics  We’ve seen Lists and Sets, now we’ll use a   Map  Lists and Sets are great, but sometimes a Map is the best collection  not Collection  with a capital “C”—remember that Maps are part of Java collections but they don’t  implement the Collection interface . Imagine you want a collection that acts like a property list, where you give it a name  and it gives you back the value associated with that name. Although keys will often be  Strings, they can be any Java object  or, through autoboxing, a primitive .  value  e y  k  “Ball”     “Fish”     “Car” “Ball1”   “Ball2”   “Ball3”   “Ball4”  Map  Each element in a Map is actually  TWO objects—a key and a value. You can have duplicate values, but  NOT duplicate keys.  Map example  import java.util.*;  public class TestMap {  HashMap needs TWO type parameters— one for the key and one for the value.     public static void main String[] args  {       HashMap  scores = new HashMap   ; Use put   instead of add  , and now of course  it takes two arguments  key, value .        scores.put “Kathy”, 42 ;      scores.put “Bert”, 343 ;      scores.put “Skyler”, 420 ;        System.out.println scores ;       System.out.println scores.get “Bert”  ;    } }  The get   method takes a key, and  returns the value  in this case, an Integer .

And we  mean weird in the polymorphic sense. If things start to feel  strange here, just keep going—it takes a few pages to really tell  the whole story.  We’ll start with a reminder on how array arguments work,  polymorphically, and then look at doing the same thing with  generic lists. The code below compiles and runs without errors:  Here’s how it works with regular arrays:  import java.util.*;  public class TestGenerics1 {    public static void main String[] args  {       new TestGenerics1  .go  ;    }  If a method argument is an array  of Animals, it will also take an  array of any Animal subtype.  In other words, if a method is  declared as:  void foo Animal[] a  { }  Assuming Dog extends Animal,  you are free to call both:  foo anAnimalArray ; foo aDogArray ;  Declare and create an Animal array,  that holds both dogs and cats.     public void go   {      Animal[] animals = {new Dog  , new Cat  , new Dog  };      Dog[] dogs = {new Dog  , new Dog  , new Dog  };      takeAnimals animals ;      takeAnimals dogs ;    }  Call takeAnimals  , using both  array types as arguments...  Declare and create a Dog array,  that holds only Dogs  the compiler  won’t let you put a Cat in .    public void takeAnimals Animal[] animals  {      for Animal a: animals  {        a.eat  ;       }    } }  Remember, we can call ONLY the methods declared in type  animal, since the animals parameter is of type Animal array,  and we didn’t do any casting.   What would we cast it to?  That array might hold both Dogs and Cats.   The crucial point is that the takeAnimals    method can take an Animal[]  or a Dog[], since  Dog IS-A Animal. Polymorphism in action.  abstract class Animal {     void eat   {      System.out.println “animal eating” ;    } } class Dog extends Animal {    void bark   { } } class Cat extends Animal {     void meow   { } }   568  chapter 16  The simplified Animal class hierarchy.   collections with generics  Using polymorphic arguments and generics  So we saw how the whole thing worked with arrays, but will it work  the same way when we switch from an array to an ArrayList? Sounds  reasonable, doesn’t it? First, let’s try  it with only the Animal ArrayList. We made just a few  changes to the go   method:  Passing in just ArrayList   A simple change from Animal[] to  ArrayList .   public void go   {      ArrayList  animals = new ArrayList   ;      animals.add new Dog   ;      animals.add new Cat   ;      animals.add new Dog   ;  We have to add one at a time since there’s no  shortcut syntax like there is for array creation.       takeAnimals animals ;    }  This is the same code, except now the “animals”  variable refers to an ArrayList instead of array.    public void takeAnimals ArrayList  animals  {        for Animal a: animals  {        a.eat  ;       }    }  The method now takes an ArrayList  instead of an array, but everything else is  the same. Remember, that for loop syntax  works for both arrays and collections.

Because of polymorphism, the compiler let us pass a Dog array  to a method with an Animal array argument. No problem. And  an ArrayList  can be passed to a method with an  ArrayList  argument. So the big question is, will the  ArrayList  argument accept an ArrayList ? If it works  with arrays, shouldn’t it work here too?  Passing in just ArrayList     public void go   {      ArrayList  animals = new ArrayList   ;      animals.add new Dog   ;      animals.add new Cat   ;      animals.add new Dog   ;      takeAnimals animals ;  We know this line worked fine.      ArrayList  dogs = new ArrayList   ;     dogs.add new Dog   ;     dogs.add new Dog   ;     takeAnimals dogs ;    }  Make a Dog ArrayList and put a couple dogs in.  Will this work now that we changed  from an array to an ArrayList?    public void takeAnimals ArrayList  animals  {        for Animal a: animals  {        a.eat  ;       }    }  When we compile it:  File  Edit   Window  Help  CatsAreSmarter  %java TestGenerics3  570  chapter 16  TestGenerics3.java:21: takeAnimals java.util.

That  totally screws my animal simulation where the  veterinary program takes a list of any type of   animal, so that a dog kennel can send a list of dogs,  and a cat kennel can send a list of cats... now  you’re saying I can’t do that if I use collections  instead of arrays?  What could happen if it were allowed... Imagine the compiler let you get away with that. It let you pass an  ArrayList  to a method declared as:  public void takeAnimals ArrayList  animals  {    for Animal a: animals  {       a.eat  ;    } }  There’s nothing in that method that looks harmful, right? After all,  the whole point of polymorphism is that anything an Animal can  do  in this case, the eat   method , a Dog can do as well. So what’s  the problem with having the method call eat   on each of the Dog  references?  Nothing.  Nothing at all. There’s nothing wrong with that code. But imagine this code instead:  public void takeAnimals ArrayList  animals  {    animals.add new Cat   ; }  Yikes!! We just stuck a Cat in what  might be a Dogs-only ArrayList.  So that’s the problem. There’s certainly nothing wrong with adding a   Cat to an ArrayList , and that’s the whole point of having an  ArrayList of a supertype like Animal—so that you can put all types of  animals in a single Animal ArrayList.  But if you passed a Dog ArrayList—one meant to hold ONLY Dogs— to this method that takes an Animal ArrayList, then suddenly you’d  end up with a Cat in the Dog list. The compiler knows that if it lets  you pass a Dog ArrayList into the method like that, someone could,  at runtime, add a Cat to your Dog list. So instead, the compiler just  won’t let you take the risk.  If you declare a method to take ArrayList  it can take ONLY an  ArrayList , not ArrayList  or ArrayList .  you are here4 571   arrays vs. ArrayLists  Wait a minute... if this is why they won’t let  you pass a Dog ArrayList into a method that   takes an Animal ArrayList—to stop you from  possibly putting a Cat in what was actually a Dog list,  then why does it work with arrays? Don’t you have  the same problem with arrays? Can’t you still add   a Cat object to a Dog[] ?  Array types are checked again at  runtime, but collection type checks  happen only when you compile  Let’s say you do add a Cat to an array declared as Dog[]  an array that  was passed into a method argument declared as Animal[], which is a  perfectly legal assignment for arrays .  public void go   {    Dog[] dogs = {new Dog  , new Dog  , new Dog  };    takeAnimals dogs ; }  public void takeAnimals Animal[] animals  {    animals[0] = new Cat  ; }  We put a new Cat into a Dog array. The  compiler allowed it, because it knows that  you might have passed a Cat array or Animal  array to the method, so to the compiler it  was possible that this was OK.  It compiles, but when we run it:  File  Edit   Window  Help  CatsAreSmarter  Whew!

That way I could loop through  the lists and call their immunize   method,  but it would still have to be safe so that you  couldn’t add a Cat in to the Dog list. But I  guess that’s just a fantasy...  you are here4 573   Remember, the keyword “extends”  here means either extends OR  implements depending on the  type. So if you want to take  an ArrayList of types that  implement the Pet interface,  you’d declare it as: ArrayList   generic wildcards  Wildcards to the rescue  It looks unusual, but there is a way to create a method argument that  can accept an ArrayList of any Animal subtype. The simplest way is to  use a wildcard—added to the Java language explicitly for this reason.  public void takeAnimals ArrayList  animals  {    for Animal a: animals  {       a.eat  ;    } }  So now you’re wondering, “What’s the difference? Don’t you have  the same problem as before? The method above isn’t doing  anything dangerous—calling a method any Animal subtype is  guaranteed to have—but can’t someone still change this to add a  Cat to the animals list, even though it’s really an ArrayList ?  And since it’s not checked again at runtime, how is this any  different from declaring it without the wildcard?” And you’d be right for wondering. The answer is NO. When you  use the wildcard   in your declaration, the compiler won’t let  you do anything that adds to the list!  When you use a wildcard in your method  argument, the compiler will STOP you from doing  anything that could hurt the list referenced by the  method parameter.  You can still invoke methods on the elements in  the list, but you cannot add elements to the list.  In other words, you can do things with the list  elements, but you can’t put new things in the list.  So you’re safe at runtime, because the compiler  won’t let you do anything that might be horrible at  runtime.  So, this is OK inside takeAnimals  :  for Animal a: animals  {    a.eat  ; }  But THIS would not compile:  animals.add new Cat   ;  574  chapter 16   collections with generics  Alternate syntax for doing the same thing  You probably remember that when we looked at the sort   method,  it  used a generic type, but with an unusual format where the type  parameter was declared before the return type. It’s just a different way  of declaring the type parameter, but the results are the same:  This:  public   void takeThing ArrayList  list    Does the same thing as this:  public void takeThing ArrayList  list    there are no Dumb Questions  one over the other?  Q: If they both do the same thing, why would you use  A: It all depends on whether you want to use “T” some-  where else. For example, what if you want the method to  have two arguments—both of which are lists of a type that  extend Animal? In that case, it’s more efficient to just declare  the type parameter once:  public   void takeThing ArrayList  one, ArrayList  two   Instead of typing:         public void takeThing ArrayList  one,                                               ArrayList  two    you are here4 575   be the compiler exercise  Exercise  BE the compiler, advanced  Your job is to play compiler and determine which of  these statements would compile.

We’ll look at local, semi-local, and remote deployment options including executable   jars, Java Web Start, RMI, and Servlets. In this chapter, we’ll spend most of our time on organizing   and packaging your code—things you’ll need to know regardless of your ultimate deployment   choice.

In other words,  once you’re done with development, what is it that you  deliver? Chances are, your end-users don’t have a system  identical to yours. More importantly, they don’t have your  application. So now it’s time to get your program in shape  for deployment into The Outside World. In this chapter,  we’ll look at local deployments, including Executable Jars  and the part-local part-remote technology called Java Web  Start. In the next chapter, we’ll look at the more remote  deployment options, including RMI and Servlets.

Combination of local and remote The application is distributed with a  client portion running on the user’s  local system, connected to a server  where other parts of the application  are running.  Remote The entire Java application runs on a  server system, with the client accessing  the system through some non-Java  means, probably a web browser.  2  3  But before we really get into the whole deployment thing,  let’s take a step back and look at what happens when you’ve  ﬁnished programming your app and you simply want to pull  out the class ﬁles to give them to an end-user.

Imagine this scenario...  Bob’s happily at work on the ﬁnal pieces of his cool new  Java program. After weeks of being in the “I’m-just-  one-compile-away” mode, this time he’s really  done. The program is a fairly sophisticated   GUI app, but since the bulk of it is Swing  code, he’s made only nine classes of his  own.  At last, it’s time to deliver the program to the  client. He ﬁgures all he has to do is copy the  nine class ﬁles, since the client already has  the Java API installed. He starts by doing an   ls on the directory where all his ﬁles are...  What the... ?  Whoa! Something strange has happened. Instead of 18  ﬁles  nine source code ﬁles and nine compiled class  ﬁles , he sees 31 ﬁles, many of which have very strange   names like:  Account$FileListener.class Chart$SaveListener.class  and on it goes. He had completely forgotten  that the compiler has to generate class ﬁles  for all those inner class GUI event listeners  he made, and that’s what all the strangely-  named classes are.  Now he has to carefully extract all the class  ﬁles he needs. If he leaves even one of them out,  his program won’t work. But it’s tricky since he  doesn’t want to accidentally send the client  one of his source code ﬁles, yet everything is  in the same directory in one big mess.  you are here4 583   But I thought I didn’t have  a choice about putting the class  ﬁ les in with the source ﬁ les.  When you compile, they just go   there, so what do I do?  organizing your classes  Separate source code and class files A single directory with a pile of source code and class ﬁ les is a  mess. It turns out, Bob should have been organizing his ﬁ les  from the beginning, keeping the source code and compiled  code separate. In other words, making sure his compiled class  ﬁ les didn’t land in the same directory as his source code. The key is a combination of directory structure organization and the  -d compiler option.  There are dozens of ways you can organize your ﬁ les, and your  company might have a speciﬁ c way they want you to do it. We  recommend an organizational scheme that’s become almost  standard, though. With this scheme, you create a project directory, and inside  that you create a directory called source and a directory called  classes. You start by saving your source code  .java ﬁ les  into  the source directory. Then the trick is to compile your code  in such a way that the output  the .class ﬁ les  ends up in the  classes directory. And there’s a nice compiler ﬂ ag, -d, that lets you do that.  Compiling with the -d  directory  ﬂ ag  %cd MyProject source %javac  -d .. classes  MyApp.java  tells the compiler to put the  compiled code  class files   into the “classes: directory  that’s one directory up and  back down again from the  current working directory.  l   l t h e   l a s t   t h i n g   i s   s t i t h e   n a m e   o f   t h e   j a v a   l e   t o   c o m p i f i  l e  l e d   c o d e    c o m p i l a n d s   h e r e  MyProject  l e   f r o m   c o m p i T H I S   d i r e c t o r y  classes  source  By using the -d ﬂ ag, you get to decide which directory the  compiled code lands in, rather than accepting the default of  class ﬁ les landing in the same directory as the source code.  To compile all the .java ﬁ les in the source directory, use:  %javac  -d .. classes  *.java  run your main    from here   Running your code  %cd MyProject classes %java Mini  run your program from  the ‘classes’ directory.   584  chapter 17  *.java compiles ALL  source files in the  current directory  101101  101101  101101  101101  10101000010  10101000010  1010 10 0  01010  1  1010101  10101010  1001010101   MyApp.class   Lorper  Lorper  iure eugue  iure eugue  tat vero  tat vero  conse  eugueroLore  do eliquis  do del dip   MyApp.java   troubleshooting note: everything in this chapter assumes that the  current working directory  i.e. the “.”  is in your classpath. If you  have explicitly set a classpath environment variable, be certain  that it contains the “.”     package, jars and  deployment  Put your Java in a JAR  JAR  A JAR ﬁ le is a Java ARchive. It’s based on the pkzip ﬁ le format, and it lets you bundle  all your classes so that instead of presenting your client with 28 class ﬁ les, you hand  over just a single JAR ﬁ le.  If you’re familiar with the tar command on UNIX, you’ll  recognize the jar tool commands.  Note: when we say JAR in all caps, we’re referring  to the archive ﬁ le. When we use lowercase, we’re referring to the jar tool you use to  create JAR ﬁ les.  The question is, what does the client do with the JAR? How do you get it to run?  You make the JAR executable. An executable JAR means the end-user doesn’t have to pull the class ﬁ les out before  running the program. The user can run the app while the class ﬁ les are     still in the  JAR. The trick is to create a manifest ﬁ le, that goes in the JAR and holds information  about the ﬁ les in the JAR.

Running  executing  the JAR Java  the JVM  is capable of loading a class from a JAR, and calling  the main   method of that class. In fact, the entire application can  stay in the JAR. Once the ball is rolling  i.e., the main   method  starts running , the JVM doesn’t care where your classes come  from, as long as it can ﬁ nd them. And one of the places the JVM  looks is within any JAR ﬁ les in the classpath. If it can   see a JAR, the  JVM will look in that JAR when it needs to ﬁ nd and load a class.  classes  101101  101101  101101  101101  101101   101101  101101  101101  101101  101101  101101  101101  101101  101101  101101  101101   101101  101101  101101  101101  101101  101101   %cd MyProject classes  %java -jar app1.jar  Main-Class: MiniApp Main-Class: MiniApp  app1.jar  The -jar flag tells the  JVM you’re giving it a  JAR instead of a class.    s k o l o   J V M   e T h s t   w i t h n i f e   m a a e i t   d o I f     . s s C l a e e x c   n t i m e r   a Depending on how your operating system is conﬁ gured, you  might even be able to simply double-click the JAR ﬁ le to launch  it. This works on most ﬂ avors of Windows, and Mac OS X. You  can usually make this happen by selecting the JAR and telling  the OS to “Open with...”  or whatever the equivalent is on your  operating system .  u  The JVM has to ‘see’ the JAR, so  it must be in your classpath. The  easiest way to make the JAR visible  is to make your working directory  the place where the JAR is.    r   J A R   f o   M a i n -   f o e t   g   u o y e , n o  r     s    t h i i d e s i n y n t r e   n a   n ’ t   f i n d   s n . p t i o  Q: Why can’t I just JAR up an entire directory? A: The JVM looks inside the JAR and expects to find   what it needs right there. It won’t go digging into other  directories, unless the class is part of a package, and even  then the JVM looks only in the directories that match the  package statement?  Q: What did you just say? A: You can’t put your class files into some arbitrary   directory and JAR them up that way. But if your classes  belong to packages, you can JAR up the entire package  directory structure. In fact, you must. We’ll explain all this on  the next page, so you can relax.  586  chapter 17   Put your classes in packages! So you’ve written some nicely reusable class ﬁ les, and you’ve  So you’ve written some nicely reusable class ﬁ les, and you’ve  posted them in your internal development library for other  programmers to use. While basking in the glow of having  just delivered some of the  in your humble opinion  best  examples of OO ever conceived, you get a phone call. A  frantic one. Two of your classes have the same name as  the classes Fred just delivered to the library. And all hell is  breaking loose out there, as naming collisions and ambiguities  breaking loose out there, as naming collisions and ambiguities  bring development to its knees. And all because you didn’t use packages! Well, you did use  packages, in the sense of using classes in the Java API that are,  of course, in packages. But you didn’t put your own classes  into packages, and in the Real World, that’s Really Bad. We’re going to modify the organizational structure from the  previous pages, just a little, to put classes into a package, and  to JAR the entire package. Pay very close attention to the  subtle and picky details. Even the tiniest deviation can    stop  your code from compiling and or running.   Packages prevent class name conflicts Although packages aren’t just for preventing name collisions,  that’s a key feature. You might write a class named Customer  and a class named Account and a class named ShoppingCart.  And what do  you know, half of all developers working in  enterprise e-commerce have probably written classes with  those names. In an OO world, that’s just dangerous. If part of  the point of OO is to write reusable components, developers  need to be able to piece together components from a  variety of sources, and build something new out of them.  Your components have to be able to ‘play well with others’,  including those you didn’t write or even know about.  Remember way back in chapter 6 when we discussed how  a package name is like the full name of a class, technically  known as the fully-qualiﬁ ed name. Class ArrayList is really  java.util.ArrayList,  JButton is really javax.swing.JButton, and  Socket is really java.net.Socket. Notice that two of those classes,  ArrayList and Socket, both have java as their “ﬁ rst name”.  In other words, the ﬁ rst part of their fully-qualiﬁ ed names  is “java”. Think of a hierarchy when you think of package  structures, and organize your classes accordingly.   package, jars and  deployment  Package structure of the Java API for:  java.text.NumberFormat  java.util.ArrayList  java.awt.FlowLayout  java.awt.event.ActionEvent  java.net.Socket  java  net  awt  101101 10  101101 10  101101 10  1001 101 10  1001 101 10  10 10010  101  101  101 101 101   text  NumberFormat  util  101101 10  101101 10  101101 10  1001 101 10  1001 101 10  10 10010  101  101  101 101 101   ArrayList  101101 10  101101 10  101101 10  1001 101 10  1001 101 10  10 10010  101  101  101 101 101   event  FlowLayout  101101 10  101101 10  101101 10  1001 101 10  1001 101 10  10 10010  101  101  101 101 101   Socket  101101 10  101101 10  101101 10  1001 101 10  1001 101 10  10 10010  101  101  101 101 101   ActionEvent  What does this picture look like to  you?

Guess I’ll just have to come   up with something else.  Packages can prevent name  conflicts, but only if you  choose a package name  that’s guaranteed to be  unique. The best way to  do that is to preface your  packages with your reverse  domain name. com.headﬁrstbooks.Book cla ss    package name  m  e  n  a  Preventing package name conflicts Putting your class in a package reduces the chances of naming  conﬂicts with other classes, but what’s to stop two programmers  from coming up with identical package names? In other words,  what’s to stop two programmers, each with a class named Account,  from putting the class in a package named shopping.customers?  Both classes, in that case, would still have the same name: shopping.customers.Account Sun strongly suggests a package naming convention that greatly  reduces that risk—prepend every class with your reverse domain  name. Remember, domain names are guaranteed to be unique.  Two different guys can be named Bartholomew Simpson, but two  different domains cannot be named doh.com.

The class name is PackageExercise,  so the fully-qualiﬁ ed name of the class is now:  com.headﬁ rstjava.PackageExercise.  2  Put a package statement in your class It must be the ﬁ rst statement in the source  code ﬁ le, above any import statements. There  can be only one package statement per source  code ﬁ le, so all classes in a source ﬁ le must  be in the same package. That    includes inner  classes, of course.  package com.headﬁ rstjava;  import javax.swing.*;  public class PackageExercise {       life-altering code here }  e r u t c u r t s   e g a k c a p  3 Set up a matching directory structure It’s not enough to say your class is in a package,  by merely putting a package statement in  the code. Your class isn’t truly in a package  until you put the class in a matching directory  structure. So, if the fully-qualiﬁ ed class name  is com.headﬁ rstjava.PackageExercise, you  must put the PackageExercise source code in a  directory named headﬁ rstjava, which must be in  a directory named com.  It is possible to compile without doing that, but  trust us—it’s not worth the other problems  you’ll have. Keep your source code in a directory  structure that matches the package structure,  and you’ll avoid a ton of painful headaches down  the road.  package, jars and  deployment  You must put a class  into a directory  structure that matches  the package hierarchy.

The main issue is that both the compiler and JVM have to be  capable of ﬁ nding your class and all of the other classes it uses.  For the classes in the core API, that’s never a problem. Java always  knows where its own stuff is. But for your classes, the solution  of compiling from the same directory where the source ﬁ les are  simply won’t work  or at least not reliably . We guarantee, though,  that if you follow the structure we describe on this page, you’ll be  successful. There are other ways to do it, but this is the one we’ve  found the most reliable and the easiest to stick to.

But it gets even better! Let’s say that you have a nice  directory structure all set up for your  source code. But you haven’t set  up a matching directory structure  for your classes directory.

But it’s right THERE  in the current directory!  A: Once your class is in a   package, you can’t call it by its  ‘short’ name. You MUST specify,  at the command-line, the fully- qualified name of the class whose  main   method you want to run.  But since the fully-qualified name  includes the package structure,  Java insists that the class be in a  matching directory structure. So if  at the command-line you say: %java com.foo.Book the JVM will look in its current  directory  and the rest of its  classpath , for a directory named  “com”. It will not look for a class  named Book, until it has found  a directory named “com” with a  directory inside named “foo”. Only  then will the JVM accept that its  found the correct Book class. If it  finds a Book class anywhere else,  it assumes the class isn’t in the  right structure, even if it is! The  JVM won’t for example, look back  up the directory tree to say, “Oh, I  can see that above us is a directory  named com, so this must be the  right package...”  you are here4 591   JARs and packages  Making an executable JAR with packages  JAR  When your class is in a package, the package directory structure  must be inside the JAR! You can’t just pop your classes in the  JAR the way we did pre-packages. And you must be sure that you  don’t include any other directories above your package. The  ﬁ rst directory of your package  usually com  must be the ﬁ rst  directory within the JAR! If you were to accidentally include the  directory above the package  e.g. the “classes”   directory , the JAR  wouldn’t work correctly.

A: Nothing will run, since   without a JVM, Java code can’t  run. The end-user must have Java  installed.  Q: How can I get Java   installed on the end-user’s  machine?  Ideally, you can create a custom  installer and distribute it along  with your application. Several  companies offer installer pro- grams ranging from simple to  extremely powerful. An installer  program could, for example, de- tect whether or not the end-user  has an appropropriate version  of Java installed, and if not,  install and configure Java before  installing your application.  Installshield, InstallAnywhere,  and DeployDirector all offer Java  installer solutions.  Another cool thing about some  of the installer programs is that  you can even make a deploy- ment CD-ROM that includes  installers for all major Java  platforms, so... one CD to rule  them all. If the user’s running on  Solaris, for example, the Solaris  version of Java is installed. On  Windows, the Windows, ver- sion, etc. If you have the budget,  this is by far the easiest way for  your end-users to get the right  version of Java installed and  configured.  package, jars and  deployment   BULLET POINTS  ß  Organize your project so that your source code and class files are not in   the same directory.  ß  A standard organization structure is to create a project directory, and then  put a source directory and a classes directory inside the project directory.  ß  Organizing your classes into packages prevents naming collisions with   other classes, if you prepend your reverse domain name on to the front of  a class name.  ß  To put a class in a package, put a package statement at the top of the   source code file, before any import statements:  package com.wickedlysmart;  ß  To be in a package, a class must be in a directory structure that exactly   matches the package structure. For a class, com.wickedlysmart.Foo,  the Foo class must be in a directory named wickedlysmart, which is in a  directory named com.  ß  To make your compiled class land in the correct package directory   structure under the classes directory, use the -d compiler flag:  % cd source  % javac -d .. classes com wickedlysmart Foo.java  ß  To run your code, cd to the classes directory, and give the fully-qualified   name of your class:  % cd classes  % java com.wickedlysmart.Foo  ß  You can bundle your classes into JAR  Java ARchive  files. JAR is based   on the pkzip format.  ß  You can make an executable JAR file by putting a manifest into the JAR  that states which class has the main   method. To create a manifest file,  make a text file with an entry like the following  for example :  Main-Class: com.wickedlysmart.Foo   ß  Be sure you hit the return key after typing the Main-Class line, or your   manifest file may not work. ß  To create a JAR file, type:   jar -cvfm manifest.txt MyJar.jar com  ß  The entire package directory structure  and only the directories matching   the package  must be immediately inside the JAR file.   ß  To run an executable JAR file, type:   java -jar MyJar.jar   you are here4 595   Executable JAR ﬁles   are nice, but wouldn’t it be dreamy  if there were a way to make a rich, stand- alone client GUI that could be distributed  over the Web? So that you wouldn’t have to  press and distribute all those CD-ROMs. And  wouldn’t it be just wonderful if the program  could automatically update itself, replacing  just the pieces that changed?

Web Start?  but it runs as a  stand-alone application  well, almost , without the constraints of the  browser. And once it’s downloaded to the end-user’s machine  which  happens the ﬁ rst time the user accesses the browser link that starts  the download , it stays there. Java Web Start is, among other things, a small Java program that lives  on the client machine and works much like a browser plug-in  the  way, say, Adobe Acrobat Reader opens when your browser  gets a .pdf  ﬁ le . This Java program is called the Java Web Start ‘helper app’,  and its key purpose is to manage the downloading, updating, and  launching  executing  of your JWS apps. When JWS downloads your application  an executable JAR , it  invokes the main   method for your app. After that, the end-user can  launch your application directory from the JWS helper app without  having to go back through the Web page link.   But that’s not the best part. The amazing thing about JWS is its  ability to detect when even a small part of application  say, a single  class ﬁ le  has changed on the server, and—without any end-user  intervention—download and integrate the updated code.  There’s still an issue, of course, like how does the end-user get Java  and Java Web Start? They need both—Java to run the app, and Java  Web Start  a small Java application itself  to handle retrieving and  launching the app. But even that has been solved. You can set things  up so that if your end-users don’t have JWS, they can download  it from Sun. And if they do have JWS, but their version of Java is  out-of-date  because you’ve speciﬁ ed in your JWS app that you  need a speciﬁ c version of Java , the Java 2 Standard Edition can be  downloaded to the end-user machine. Best of all, it’s simple to use. You can serve up a JWS app much like  any other type of Web resource such as a plain old HTML page or a  JPEG image. You set up a Web  HTML  page with a link to your JWS  application, and you’re in business.  In the end, your JWS application isn’t much more than an  executable JAR that end-users can download from the Web.  package, jars and  deployment  End-users launch a Java  Web Start app by clicking  on a link in a Web  page. But once the app  downloads, it runs outside  the browser, just like any  other stand-alone Java  application.

The ‘information’ tags are used by  the JWS helper app, mostly for displaying when the user  wants to relaunch a previously-downloaded application.

Q: How is Java Web Start different from an applet? A: Applets can’t live outside of a Web browser. An applet is   downloaded from the Web as part of a Web page rather than  simply from a Web page. In other words, to the browser, the applet  is just like a JPEG or any other resource. The browser uses either a  Java plug-in or the browser’s own built-in Java  far less common  today  to run the applet. Applets don’t have the same level of  functionality for things such as automatic updating, and they must  always be launched from the browser. With JWS applications, once  they’re downloaded from the Web, the user doesn’t even have to  be using a browser to relaunch the application locally. Instead,  the user can start up the JWS helper app, and use it to launch the  already-downloaded application again.  Q: What are the security restrictions of JWS? A: JWS apps have several limitations including being   restricted from reading and writing to the user’s hard drive. But...  JWS has its own API with a special open and save dialog box so  that, with the user’s permission, your app can save and read its  own files in a special, restricted area of the user’s drive.  ß   ß    BULLET POINTS  Java Web Start technology lets you deploy a  stand-alone client application from the Web.  Java Web Start includes a ‘helper app’ that must  be installed on the client  along with Java .  ß  A Java Web Start  JWS  app has two pieces:  an executable JAR and a .jnlp file.  ß  A .jnlp file is a simple XML document that  describes your JWS application. It includes  tags for specifying the name and location of the  JAR, and the name of the class with the main    method.  ß  When a browser gets a .jnlp file from the server   because the user clicked on a link to the .jnlp  file , the browser starts up the JWS helper app.  ß  The JWS  helper app reads the .jnlp file and  requests the executable JAR from the Web  server.  ß  When the JWS gets the JAR, it invokes the   main   method  specified in the .jnlp file .  you are here4 601   exercise: True or False  Exercise  We explored packaging, deployment, and JWS  in this chapter.

No  matter how far apart we really  are, RMI makes it seem like   we’re together.  Being remote doesn’t have to be a bad thing. Sure, things are easier when   all the parts of your application are in one place, in one heap, with one JVM to rule them all. But   that’s not always possible. Or desirable. What if your application handles powerful computations,   but the end-users are on a wimpy little Java-enabled device? What if your app needs data   from a database, but for security reasons, only code on your server can access the database?   Imagine a big e-commerce back-end, that has to run within a transaction-management system?   Sometimes, part of your app must run on a server, while another part  usually a client  must   run on a different machine.  In this chapter, we’ll learn to use Java’s amazingly simple Remote   Method Invocation  RMI  technology.  We’ll also take a quick peek at Servlets, Enterprise Java   Beans  EJB  , and Jini, and look at the ways in which EJB and Jini depend on RMI. We’ll end the   book by writing one of the coolest things you can make in Java, a universal service browser.  this is a new chapter  607   one heap, two objects  f     f  t u  S  o  d  Bar ob j  ect   Foo ob j ect  In most applications, when one object  calls a method on another, both objects  are on the same heap.

So far in this book, every method we’ve invoked has been on  an object running in the same virtual machine as the caller.  In other words, the calling object and the callee  the object  we’re invoking the method on  live on the same  heap.  class Foo {     void go   {          Bar b = new Bar  ;          b.doStuff  ;     }     public static void main  String[] args  {        Foo f = new Foo  ;        f.go  ;     } }  In the code above, we know that the Foo instance  referenced by f and the Bar object referenced by b are  both on the same heap, run by the same JVM. Remember,  the JVM is responsible for stufﬁ ng bits into the reference  variable that represent how to get to an object on the heap.  The JVM always knows where each object is, and how to  get to it. But the JVM can know about references on only  its own heap! You can’t, for example, have a JVM running  on one machine knowing about the heap space of a JVM  running on a different machine. In fact, a JVM running on  one machine can’t know anything about a different JVM  running on the same machine. It makes no difference if  the JVMs are on the same or different physical machines;  it matters only that the two JVMs are, well, two different  invocations of the JVM.  608  chapter 18   remote deployment with RMI  What if you want to invoke a method on  an object running on another machine?  We know how to get information from one machine to another— with Sockets and I O.  We open a Socket connection to another  machine, and get an OutputStream and write some data to it.  But what if we actually want to call a method on something running  in another machine... another JVM? Of course we could always build  our own protocol, and when you send data to a ServerSocket the  server could parse it, ﬁgure out what you meant, do the work, and  send back the result on another stream. What a pain, though. Think  how much nicer it would be to just get a reference to the object on  p o w e the other machine, and call a method. c   t o c a l c  Imagine two computers...    s e v l o g h   b i g     u       f a s t , l, r f u o c h   t h r n u r s n l a t i o u  tiny, wimpy, painfully  slow at calculations  JVM  Little  JVM  Big  Big has something Little wants. Compute power. Little wants to send some data to Big, so that Big can do the  heavy computing. Little wants simply to call a method...     double doCalcUsingDatabase CalcNumbers numbers  and get back the result. But how can Little get a reference to an object on Big?  you are here4 609        two objects,  two heaps  Object A, running on Little, wants to call  a method on Object B, running on Big. The question is, how do we get an object on one machine   which means a different heap JVM  to call a method on  another machine?       A  doCalcUsingDatabase    B  return value  But you can’t do that. Well, not directly anyway. You can’t get a reference to  something on another heap. If you say: Dog d = ??? Whatever d is referencing must be in the same heap space as  the code running the statement.  But imagine you want to design something that will use  Sockets and I O to communicate your intention  a method  invocation on an object running on another machine , yet  still feel as though you were making a local method call. In other words, you want to cause a method invocation on a  remote object  i.e., an object in a heap somewhere else , but  with code that lets you pretend that you’re invoking a method  on a local object. The ease of a plain old everyday method  call, but the power of remote method invocation. That’s our  goal. That’s what RMI  Remote Method Invocation  gives you! But let’s step back and imagine how you would design RMI if  you were doing it yourself. Understanding what you’d have to  build yourself will help you learn how RMI works.   610  chapter 18   remote deployment with RMI  A design for remote method calls   Create four things: server, client,  server helper, client helper  1 Create client and server apps. The server app is the  remote service that has an object with the method  that the client wants to invoke.  Client heap  Server heap  Client o b j e ct   Service  o  b j e ct   2 Create client and server ‘helpers’. They’ll handle all   the low-level networking and I O details so your client  and service can pretend like they’re in the same heap.  Client heap  Server heap  Client h elp e r  Client o b j e ct   Service   h  elper  Service  o  b j e ct   you are here4 611   client and server helpers  The role of the ‘helpers’ The ‘helpers’ are the objects that actually do the communicating.  They make it possible for the client to act as though its calling a  method on a local object. In fact, it is. The client calls a method on  the client helper, as if the client helper were the actual service. The client  helper is a proxy for the Real Thing. In other words, the client object thinks it’s calling a method on  the remote service, because the client helper is pretending to be  the service object. Pretending to be the thing with the method the client  wants to call! But the client helper isn’t really the remote service. Although the  client helper acts like it  because it has the same method that the  service is advertising , the client helper doesn’t have any of the  actual method logic the client is expecting. Instead, the client  helper contacts the server, transfers information about the method  call  e.g., name of the method, arguments, etc. , and waits for a  return from the server. On the server side, the service helper receives the request from  the client helper  through a Socket connection , unpacks the  information about the call, and then invokes the real method on  the real service object. So to the service object, the call is local. It’s  coming from the service helper, not a remote client. The service helper gets the return value from the service, packs it  up, and ships it back  over a Socket’s output stream  to the client  helper. The client helper unpacks the information and returns the  value to the client object.  Your client object gets to  act like it’s making remote  method calls. But what  it’s really doing is calling  methods on a heap-local  ‘proxy’ object that handles  all the low-level details of  Sockets and streams.  i e n t   h e l p e r   p r e t e n d s   C l t o   b e   t h e   s e r v i c e ,   b u t   i t ’ s   j u s t   a   p r o x y   f o r   t h e   R e a l   T h i n g .

In Java, RMI builds the client and service helper  objects for you, and it even knows how to make the  client helper look like the Real Service. In other  words, RMI knows how to give the client helper  object the same methods you want to call on the  remote service. Plus, RMI provides all the runtime infrastructure to  make it work, including a lookup service so that the  client can ﬁnd and get the client helper  the proxy  for the Real Service . With RMI, you don’t write any of the networking  or I O code yourself. The client gets to call remote  methods  i.e. the ones the Real Service has  just  like normal method calls on objects running in the  client’s own local JVM.  Almost. There is one difference between RMI calls and local   normal  method calls. Remember that even though  to the client it looks like the method call is local,  the client helper sends the method call across the  network. So there is networking and I O. And what  do we know about networking and I O methods? They’re risky!  They throw exceptions all over the place. So, the client does have to acknowledge the risk. The  client has to acknowledge that when it calls a remote  method, even though to the client it’s just a local call  to the proxy helper object, the call ultimately involves  Sockets and streams. The client’s original call is local,  but the proxy turns it into a remote call. A remote call  just means a method that’s invoked on an object on  another JVM. How the information about that call  gets transferred from one JVM to another depends  on the protocol used by the helper objects.  With RMI, you have a choice of protocols: JRMP or  IIOP. JRMP is RMI’s ‘native’ protocol, the one made  just for Java-to-Java remote calls. IIOP, on the other  hand, is the protocol for CORBA  Common Object  Request Broker Architecture , and lets you make  remote calls on things which aren’t necessarily Java  objects. CORBA is usually much more painful than  RMI, because if you don’t have Java on both ends,  there’s an awful lot of translation and conversion that  has to happen.  But thankfully, all we care about is Java-to-Java, so  we’re sticking with plain old, remarkably easy RMI.  In RMI, the client helper is a ‘stub’  and the server helper is a ‘skeleton’.

Don’t worry, each step is  explained in detail over the next few pages.  Server   Step one:  Make a Remote Interface The remote interface deﬁ nes the methods  that a client can call remotely. It’s what  the client will use as the polymorphic class  type for your service. Both the Stub     and  actual service will implement this!  public interface  public interface  MyRemote extends  MyRemote extends  Remote { }  MyRemote.java        e  u  h  o  t y  e  s  t        f i n a h t a ll  c  e       d d s o    t  e o     c h s    i n T h i s t e m o r t n w a     f r e t   m e e n c li e  a t t  Step two:  Make a Remote Implementation This is the class that does the Real Work.  It has the real implementation of the  remote methods deﬁ ned in the remote  interface. It’s the object that the client  wants to call methods on.  Step three:  Generate the stubs and skeletons using rmic These are the client and server ‘helpers’.  You don’t have to create these classes or ever  look at the source code that generates them.  It’s all handled automatically when you  run the rmic tool that ships with your Java  development kit.  Step four:  Start the RMI registry  rmiregistry  The rmiregistry is like the white pages of a  phone book. It’s where the user goes to get  the proxy  the client stub helper object .  The Real Service. The class  with the methods that do  the real work.

Your service implementation class instantiates an  instance of the service and registers it with the RMI  registry. Registering it makes the service available for  clients.

Every remote method call is  considered ‘risky’. Declaring  RemoteException on every  method forces the client  to pay attention and  acknowledge that things  might not work.  a remote interface  Step one: Make a Remote Interface  1 Extend java.rmi.Remote  Remote is a ‘marker’ interface, which means it has no methods. It has  special meaning for RMI, though, so you must follow this rule. Notice  that we say ‘extends’ here. One interface is allowed to extend another  interface.  public interface MyRemote extends Remote {  2 Declare that all methods throw a RemoteException  The remote interface is the one the client uses as the polymorphic type  for the service. In other words, the client invokes methods on something  that implements the remote interface. That something is the stub, of  course, and since the stub is doing networking and I O, all kinds of Bad  Things can happen. The client has to acknowledge    the risks by handling  or declaring the remote exceptions. If the methods in an interface  declare exceptions, any code calling methods on a reference of that type   the interface type  must handle or declare the exceptions.  import java.rmi.*;  the Remote interface is in java.rmi  public interface MyRemote extends Remote {     public String sayHello   throws RemoteException; }  3 Be sure arguments and return values are primitives or Serializable  Arguments and return values of a remote method must be either primitive  or Serializable. Think about it. Any argument to a remote method has to  be packaged up and shipped across the network, and that’s done through  Serialization. Same thing with return values. If you use primitives, Strings,  and the majority of types in the API  including arrays and collections ,  you’ll be ﬁ ne. If you are passing around your own types, just be sure that  you make your classes implement Serializable.  public String sayHello   throws RemoteException;  This return value is gonna be shipped  over the wire from the server back to  the client, so it must be Serializable.  That’s how args and return values get  packaged up and sent.  616  chapter 18   remote deployment with RMI  public interface  public interface  MyRemote extends  MyRemote extends  Remote { }  MyRemoteImpl.java  Step two: Make a Remote Implementation  1 Implement the Remote interface  Your service has to implement the remote interface—the one  with the methods your client is going to call.  public class MyRemoteImpl extends UnicastRemoteObject implements MyRemote {     public String sayHello   {        return “Server says, ‘Hey’”;    }       more code in class }  The compiler will make sure that  you’ve implemented all the methods  from the interface you implement. In  this case, there’s only one.  2 Extend UnicastRemoteObject  In order to work as a remote service object, your object needs some  functionality related to ‘being remote’. The simplest way is to extend  UnicastRemoteObject  from the java.rmi.server package  and let that  class  your superclass  do the work for     you.  public class MyRemoteImpl extends UnicastRemoteObject implements MyRemote {  3 Write a no-arg constructor that declares a RemoteException  Your new superclass, UnicastRemoteObject, has one little problem—its  constructor throws a RemoteException. The only way to deal with this is  to declare a constructor for your remote implementation, just so that you  have a place to declare the RemoteException. Remember,  when a class is  instantiated, its superclass constructor is always called. If your superclass  constructor throws an exception, you have no choice but to declare that  your constructor also throws an exception. public MyRemoteImpl   throws RemoteException { }  4 Register the service with the RMI registry  Now that you’ve got a remote service, you have to make it available to  remote clients. You do this by instantiating it and putting it into the RMI  registry  which must be running or this line of code fails . When you  register the implementation object, the RMI system actually puts the stub in  the registry, since that’s what the client really needs. Register your service  using the static rebind   method of the java.rmi.Naming class. try {     MyRemote service = new MyRemoteImpl  ;     Naming.rebind “Remote Hello”, service ; } catch Exception ex  {...}        You don’t have to put anything in  the constructor. You just need a  way to declare that your superclass  constructor throws an exception.  Give your service a name  that clients can use  to look it up in the registry  and register it  with the RMI registry. When you bind the  service object, RMI swaps the service for the  stub and puts the stub in the registry.  you are here4 617   stubs and skeletons  Step three: generate stubs and skeletons  Notice that you don’t say “.class”  on the end. Just the class name.

It uses a naming convention that is the name of  your remote implementation, with either _Stub or  _Skeleton added to the end. There are other options  with rmic, including not generating skeletons,  seeing what the source code for these classes looked  like, and even using IIOP as the protocol. The way  we’re doing it here is the way you’ll usually do it.  The classes will land in the current directory  i.e.  whatever you did a cd to . Remember, rmic must  be able to see your implementation class, so you’ll  probably run rmic from the directory where your  remote implementation is.  We’re deliberately not  using packages here, to make it simpler. In the Real  World, you’ll need to account for package directory  structures and fully-qualiﬁ ed names .  Step four: run rmiregistry  1 Bring up a terminal and start the rmiregistry.  Be sure you start it from a     directory that has access  to your classes. The simplest way is to start it from  your ‘classes’ directory.

The  name you register it under is the name clients will  need to look it up in the rmi registry.  you are here4 619   getting the stub  How does the client get the stub object? The client has to get the stub object, since that’s the thing the  client will call methods on. And that’s where the RMI registry  comes in. The client does a ‘lookup’, like going to the white pages  of a phone book, and essentially says, “Here’s a name, and I’d like  the stub that goes with that name.”   lookup   is a static method of  the Naming class  This must be the name  that the service was  registered under  MyRemote service =  MyRemote    Naming.lookup “rmi:  127.0.0.1 Remote Hello” ;  The client always uses the  remote implementation as the  type of the service. In fact,  the client never needs to know  the actual class name of your  remote service.  You have to cast it to the  interface, since the lookup  method returns type Object.   your host name or IP  address goes here  Client        l o    s a y H e l 3  Client o b j e ct   Stub  Skelet o n  Service  o  b j e ct   stub returned  2  RMI registry  on server   1  lookup     Server  Remote  Hello  Stub  1 Client does a lookup on the RMI registry Naming.lookup “rmi:  127.0.0.1 Remote Hello” ;  2 RMI registry returns the stub object   as the return value of the lookup method  and RMI  deserializes the stub automatically. You MUST have  the stub class  that rmic generated for you  on the  client or the stub won’t be deserialized.  3 Client invokes a method on the stub, as   though the stub IS the real service  620  chapter 18   remote deployment with RMI  How does the client get the stub class? Now we get to the interesting question. Somehow, someway, the  client must have the stub class  that you generated earlier using  rmic  at the time the client does the lookup, or else the stub won’t  be deserialized on the client and the whole thing blows up. In a  simple system, you can simply hand-deliver the stub class to the  client.  There’s a much cooler way, though, although it’s beyond the  scope of this book. But just in case you’re interested, the cooler  way is called “dynamic class downloading”. With dynamic class  downloading, a stub object  or really any Serialized object  is  ‘stamped’ with a URL that tells the RMI system on the client  where to ﬁnd the class ﬁle for that object. Then, in the process of  deserializing an object, if RMI can’t ﬁnd the class locally, it uses  that URL to do an HTTP Get to retrieve the class ﬁle. So you’d  need a simple Web server to serve up class ﬁles, and you’d also  need to change some security parameters on the client. There are  a few other tricky issues with dynamic class downloading, but that’s  the overview.   Complete client code  The Naming class  for doing the  remiregistry lookup  is in the  java.rmi package  import java.rmi.*;  public class MyRemoteClient {    public static void main  String[] args  {         new MyRemoteClient  .go  ;    }    public void go   {    t y p e s t r y   a s g i   r e   o u t   o f   t h e c a s t   e t   t h e s o   d o n ’ t   f o r g     c o m e I t   c t , e O b j  s          try {         MyRemote service =  MyRemote  Naming.lookup “rmi:  127.0.0.1 Remote Hello” ;          String s = service.sayHello  ;           System.out.println s ;       } catch Exception ex  {          ex.printStackTrace  ;       }    } }  It looks just like a regular old method  call!

The top three things programmers do wrong with RMI are: 1  Forget to start rmiregistry before starting remote service   when you register the service using Naming.rebind  , the  rmiregistry must be running!  2  Forget to make arguments and return types serializable   you won’t know until runtime; this is not  something the  compiler will detect.  3  Forget to give the stub class to the client.

Servlets are  Java programs that run on  and with  an HTTP web server. When a client uses a  web browser to interact with a web page, a request is sent back to the web server. If the request  needs the help of a Java servlet, the web server runs  or calls, if the servlet is already running   the servlet code. Servlet code is simply code that runs on the server, to do work as a result of  whatever the client requests  for example, save information to a text ﬁ le or database on the  server . If you’re familiar with CGI scripts written in Perl, you know exactly what we’re talking  about. Web developers use CGI scripts or servlets to do everything from sending user-submitted  info to a database, to running a web-site’s discussion board. And even servlets can use RMI! By far, the most common use of J2EE technology is to mix servlets and EJBs together, where  servlets are the client of the EJB. And in that case, the servlet is using RMI to talk to the EJBs.   Although the way you use RMI with EJB is a little different from the process we just looked at.   1 Client ﬁ lls out a registration form and clicks ‘submit’.  The HTTP server  i.e. web server  gets  the request, sees that  it’s for a servlet, and sends the request to the servlet.

For these examples, we’ll assume that you already have a web server  up and running, and that it’s already conﬁ gured to support servlets.  The most important thing is to ﬁ nd out exactly where your servlet  class ﬁ les have to be placed in order for your server to ‘see’ them. If  you have a web site hosted by an ISP, the hosting service can tell you  where to put your servlets, just as they’ll tell you  where to place your  CGI scripts.   2 Get the servlets.jar and add it to your classpath  Servlets aren’t part of the standard Java libraries; you need  the servlets classes packaged into the servlets.jar ﬁ le. You can  download the servlets classes from java.sun.com, or you can get  them from your Java-enabled web server  like Apache Tomcat, at  the apache.org site . Without these classes, you won’t be able to  compile your servlets.  3 Write a servlet class by extending HttpServlet  A servlet is just a Java class that extends HttpServlet  from the  javax.servlet.http package . There are other types of servlets you  can make, but most of the time we care only about HttpServlet.   public class MyServletA extends HttpServlet { ... }  4 Write an HTML page that invokes your servlet  When the user clicks a link that references your servlet, the web  server will ﬁ nd the servlet and invoke the appropriate method  depending on the HTTP command  GET, POST, etc.    This is the most amazing servlet.   5 Make your servlet and HTML page available to your server  This is completely dependent on your web server  and more speciﬁ - cally, on which version of Java Servlets that you’re using . Your ISP  may simply tell you to drop it into a “Servlets” directory on your  web site. But if you’re using, say, the latest version of Tomcat, you’ll  have a lot more work to do to get the servlet  and web page  into  the right location.  We just happen to have a book on this too .   626  chapter 18  Web Server   Servlets  101101  101101  10 110 1  10 110 1  0 11 0  0 11 0  001 10  001 01   MyServletA.class  servlets.jar  101101  101101  10 110 1  10 110 1  0 11 0  0 11 0  001 10  001 01   MyServletA.class          Java  rules!

Most ‘normal’ servlets will extend  HttpServlet, then override one or  more methods. The web server calls this method, handing you the client’s  request  you can get data out of it  and a ‘response’  object that you’ll use to send back a response  a page .            public void doGet  HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response                                            throws  ServletException, IOException  {                       response.setContentType “text html” ;             PrintWriter out = response.getWriter  ;          String message = “If you’re reading this, it worked!”;          out.println “  ” ;           } }   out.println “ ” + message + “ ” ;  out.println “  ” ;          out.close  ;  This tells the server  and browser  what kind of  ‘thing’ is coming back from the server as a reuslt of  this servlet running. The response object gives us an output stream to  ‘write’ information back out to the server.   What we ‘write’ is an HTML page! The page  gets delivered through the server back to  the browser, just like any other HTML page,  even though this is a page that never existed  until now. In other words, there’s no .html file  somewhere with this stuff in it.  HTML page with a link to this servlet              This is an amazing servlet.

For example, if a client submits  information in a web page form, the servlet can  process the information, add it to a database,  and send back a customized, confirmation  response page.  ß  To compile a servlet, you need the servlet   packages which are in the servlets.jar file. The  servlet classes are not part of the Java standard  libraries, so you need to download the servlets. jar from java.sun.com or get them from a servlet- capable web server.  Note: the Servlet library  is included with the Java 2 Enterprise Edition   J2EE    ß  To run a servlet, you must have a web server   capable of running servlets, such as the Tomcat  server from apache.org.  ß  Your servlet must be placed in a location that’s  specific to your particular web server, so you’ll  need to find that out before you try to run your  servlets. If you have a web site hosted by an ISP  that supports servlets, the ISP will tell you which  directory to place your servlets in.  ß  A typical servlet extends HttpServlet and   overrides one or more servlet methods, such as  doGet   or doPost  .  ß  The web server starts the servlet and calls the   appropriate method  doGet  , etc.  based on the  client’s request.  ß  The servlet can send back a response by getting   a PrintWriter output stream from the response  parameter of the doGet   method.  ß  The servlet ‘writes’ out an HTML page, complete   with tags .  628  chapter 18  there are no Dumb Questions  Q: What’s a JSP, and how does it relate to servlets? A: JSP stands for Java Server Pages. In the end, the web server   turns a JSP into a servlet, but the difference between a servlet and  a JSP is what YOU  the developer  actually create. With a servlet,  you write a Java class that contains HTML in the output statements   if you’re sending back an HTML page to the client . But with a  JSP, it’s the opposite—you write an HTML page that contains Java  code!   This gives you the ability to have dynamic web pages where you  write the page as a normal HTML page, except you embed Java  code  and other tags that “trigger” Java code at runtime  that  gets processed at runtime. In other words, part of the page is  customized at runtime when the Java code runs.  The main benefit of JSP over regular servlets is that it’s just a lot  easier to write the HTML part of a servlet as a JSP page than to  write HTML in the torturous print out statements in the servlet’s  response.  Imagine a reasonably complex HTML page, and now  imagine formatting it within println statements.  Yikes!  But for many applications, it isn’t necessary to use JSPs because  the servlet doesn’t need to send a dynamic response, or the  HTML is simple enough not to be such a big pain. And, there are  still many web servers out there that support servlets but do not  support JSPs, so you’re stuck.  Another benefit of JSPs is that you can separate the work by  having the Java developers write the servlets and the web page  developers write the JSPs. That’s the promised benefit, anyway.  In reality, there’s still a Java learning curve  and a tag learning  curve  for anyone writing a JSP, so to think that an HTML web page  designer can bang out JSPs is not realistic. Well, not without tools.  But that’s the good news—authoring tools are starting to appear,  that help web page designers create JSPs without writing the  code from scratch.  huge thing on RMI?  Q: Is this all you’re gonna say about servlets? After such a  A: Yes. RMI is part of the Java language, and all the classes for   RMI are in the standard libraries. Servlets and JSPs are not part of  the Java language; they’re considered standard extensions.  You  can run RMI on any modern JVM, but Servlets and JSPs require a  properly configured web server with a servlet “container”.  This is  our way of saying, “it’s beyond the scope of this book.” But you can  read much more in the lovely Head First Servlets & JSP.   Just for fun, let’s make the Phrase-O-Matic  work as a servlet  remote deployment with RMI  Try my   new web-enabled   phrase-o-matic and you’ll  be a slick talker just like  the boss or those guys in  marketing.  Now that we told you that we won’t  say any more about servlets, we can’t  resist servletizing  yes, we can verbify  it  the Phrase-O-Matic from chapter 1.  A servlet is still just Java. And Java code  can call Java code from other classes.  So a servlet is free to call a method on  the Phrase-O-Matic. All you have to do  is drop the Phrase-O-Matic class into  the same directory as your servlet, and  you’re in business.  The Phrase-O- Matic code is on the next page .  import java.io.*;  import javax.servlet.*; import javax.servlet.http.*;  public class KathyServlet extends HttpServlet {      public void doGet  HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response                                             throws ServletException, IOException  {         String title = “PhraseOMatic has generated the following phrase.”;          response.setContentType “text html” ;         PrintWriter out = response.getWriter  ;   out.println “PhraseOmatic” ;  out.println “   ” ;  out.println “ ” + title + “ ” ;  out.println “ ” + PhraseOMatic.makePhrase   ;          out.println “   ” ;                 out.println “  make another phrase  ” ;                  } }   out.println “  ” ;   out.close  ;  See? Your servlet can call methods on  another class. In this case, we’re calling  the static makePhrase   method of the  PhraseOMatic class  on the next page   you are here4 629   Phrase-O-Matic code  Phrase-O-Matic code, servlet-friendly  This is a slightly different version from the code in chapter one. In the  original, we ran the entire thing in a main   method, and we had to rerun  the program each time to generate a new phrase at the command-line. In this  version, the code simply returns a String  with the phrase  when you invoke  the static makePhrase   method. That way, you can call the method from any  other code and get back a String with the randomly-composed phrase. Please note that these long String[] array assignments are a victim of word- processing here—don’t type in the hyphens! Just keep on typing and let your  code editor do the wrapping. And whatever you do, don’t hit the return key in  the middle of a String  i.e. something between double quotes .   public class PhraseOMatic {    public static String makePhrase   {          make three sets of words to choose from      String[] wordListOne = {“24 7”,”multi-Tier”,”30,000 foot”,”B-to-B”,”win-win”,”front- end”, “web-based”,”pervasive”, “smart”, “six-sigma”,”critical-path”, “dynamic”};       String[] wordListTwo = {“empowered”, “sticky”, “valued-added”, “oriented”, “centric”,  “distributed”, “clustered”, “branded”,”outside-the-box”, “positioned”, “networked”, “fo- cused”, “leveraged”, “aligned”, “targeted”, “shared”, “cooperative”, “accelerated”};       String[] wordListThree = {“process”, “tipping point”, “solution”, “architecture”,  “core competency”, “strategy”, “mindshare”, “portal”, “space”, “vision”, “paradigm”, “mis- sion”};         ﬁnd out how many words are in each list     int oneLength = wordListOne.length;     int twoLength = wordListTwo.length;     int threeLength = wordListThree.length;         generate three random numbers, to pull random words from each list     int rand1 =  int   Math.random   * oneLength ;     int rand2 =  int   Math.random   * twoLength ;     int rand3 =  int   Math.random   * threeLength ;         now build a phrase     String phrase = wordListOne[rand1] + “ “ + wordListTwo[rand2] + “ “ +  wordListThree[rand3];         now return it     return  “What we need is a “ + phrase ;   }  }    630  chapter 18   remote deployment with RMI  An EJB server adds a bunch  of services that you don’t get  with straight RMI. Things  like transactions, security,  concurrency, database  management, and networking.  An EJB server steps into the  middle of an RMI call and  layers in all of the services.  The bean object is protected from  direct client access! Only the server  can actually talk to the bean. This  lets the server do things like say,  “Whoa! This client doesn’t have  the security clearance to call this  method...” Almost everything you pay  for in an EJB server happens right  HERE, where the server steps in!  Enterprise JavaBeans: RMI on steroids  RMI is great for writing and running remote services. But  you wouldn’t run something like an Amazon or eBay on RMI  alone. For a large, deadly serious, enterprise application, you  need something more. You need something that can handle  transactions, heavy concurrency issues  like a gazillion  people are hitting your server at once to buy those organic  dog kibbles , security  not just anyone should hit your  payroll database , and data management. For that, you need  an enterprise application server. In Java, that means a Java 2 Enterprise Edition  J2EE  server.  A J2EE server includes both a web server and an Enterprise  JavaBeans EJB  server, so that you can deploy an application  that includes both servlets and EJBs.  Like servlets, EJB is  way beyond the scope of this book, and there’s no way to  show “just a little” EJB example with code, but we will take  a quick look at how it works.  For a much more detailed  treatment of EJB, we can recommend the lively Head First  EJB certiﬁcation study guide.   Here’s where the EJB server gets  involved! The EJB object intercepts  the calls to the bean  the bean holds  the real business logic  and layers in  all the services provided by the EJB  server  security, transactions, etc.  EJB server  RMI SKELETON  Service   h  elper  This client could be ANYTHING, but  typically an EJB client is a servlet  running in the same J2EE server.

We think Jini is pretty much the best thing in Java. If EJB is RMI  on steroids  with a bunch of managers , Jini is RMI with wings. Pure Java bliss.  Like the EJB material, we can’t get into any of the Jini details here, but if you  know RMI, you’re three-quarters of the way there. In terms of technology,  anyway. In terms of mindset, it’s time to make a big leap. No, it’s time to ﬂy. Jini uses RMI  although other protocols can be involved , but gives you a few  key features including: Adaptive discovery Self-healing networks  With RMI, remember, the client has to know the  name and location of the remote service. The  client code for the lookup includes the IP address or  hostname of the remote service  because that’s where  the RMI registry is running  and the logical name the  service was registered under.  But with Jini, the client has to know only one thing: the  interface implemented by the service! That’s it.  So how do you ﬁnd things? The trick revolves around Jini lookup  services. Jini lookup services are far more powerful and ﬂexible than  the RMI registry. For one thing, Jini lookup services announce themselves to the  network, automatically. When a lookup service comes online, it sends a message  using IP  multicast  out to the network saying, “I’m here, if anyone’s interested.” But that’s not all. Let’s say you  a client  come online after the lookup service has already  announced itself, you can send a message to the entire network saying, “Are there any  lookup services out there?” Except that you’re not really interested in the lookup service itself—you’re interested in  the services that are registered with the lookup service. Things like RMI remote services,  other serializable Java objects, and even devices such as printers, cameras, and coffee- makers. And here’s where it gets even more fun: when a service comes online, it will dynamically  discover  and register itself with  any Jini lookup services on the network. When the  service registers with the lookup service, the service sends a serialized object to be placed  in the lookup service. That serialized object can be a stub to an RMI remote service, a  driver for a networked device, or even the whole service itself that  once you get it from  the lookup service  runs locally on your machine. And instead of registering by name, the  service registers by the interface it implements. Once you  the client  have a reference to a lookup service, you can say to that lookup  service, “Hey, do you have anything that implements ScientiﬁcCalculator?” At that point,  the lookup service will check its list of registered interfaces, and assuming it ﬁnds a  match, says back to you, “Yes I do have something that implements that interface. Here’s  the serialized object the ScientiﬁcCalculator service registered with me.”   632  chapter 18   Adaptive discovery in action  1 Jini lookup service is launched somewhere on the network, and   announces itself using IP multicast.  remote deployment with RMI  Hey everybody,  I’m here!

It will give you the ﬂavor and feeling of Jini, but using straight RMI. In fact the  main difference between our application and a Jini application is how the service is  discovered. Instead of the Jini lookup service, which automatically announces itself and  lives anywhere on the network, we’re using the RMI registry which must be on the same  machine as the remote service, and which does not announce itself automatically. And instead of our service registering itself automatically with the lookup service, we  have to register it in the RMI registry  using Naming.rebind   . But once the client has found the service in the RMI registry, the rest of the application  is almost identical to the way we’d do it in Jini.  The main thing missing is the lease that  would let us have a self-healing network if any of the services go down.  The universal service browser is like a specialized web browser, except instead of HTML  pages, the service browser downloads and displays interactive Java GUIs that we’re  calling universal services.  Choose a service from the  list. The RMI remote service   has a getServiceList    method that sends back this  list of services.  When the user selects one,  the client asks for the  actual service  DiceRolling,  DayOfTheWeek, etc.  to  be sent back from the RMI  remote service.

By implementing this interface, a service can come over  even though the client has no idea what the actual class  or classes   are that make up that service. All the client knows is that whatever  comes over, it implements the Service interface, so it MUST have a  getGuiPanel   method.  The client gets a serialized object as a result of calling  getService selectedSvc  on the ServiceServer stub, and all the client  says to that object is, “I don’t know who or what you are, but I DO  know that you implement the Service interface, so I know I can call  getGuiPanel   on you. And since getGuiPanel   returns a JPanel, I’ll just  slap it into the browser GUI and start interacting with it!  5 class DiceService implements Service  Got dice? If not, but you need some, use this service to roll anywhere  from 1 to 6 virtual dice for you.  6 class MiniMusicService implements Service  Remember that fabulous little ‘music video’ program from the ﬁ rst  GUI Code Kitchen? We’ve turned it into a service, and you can play it  over and over and over until your roommates ﬁ nally leave.  7 class DayOfTheWeekService implements Service  Were you born on a Friday?

The  interface extends Serializable, so that any  class implementing the Service interface will  automatically be Serializable.  That’s a must, because the services get  shipped over the wire from the server, as a  result of the client calling getService   on  the remote ServiceServer.  640  chapter 18   remote deployment with RMI  class ServiceServerImpl  the remote implementation   A   n o r m a l    R M I     i m p l e m e n t a t i o n  import java.rmi.*; import java.util.*; import java.rmi.server.*;      HashMap serviceList;  public class ServiceServerImpl extends UnicastRemoteObject implements ServiceServer  {           public ServiceServerImpl   throws RemoteException {        setUpServices  ;     }  The services will be stored in a HashMap collection.

This method is called by the event  listener on the JComboBox . We call getService   on the  remote server  the stub for ServiceServer  and pass it the  String that was displayed in the list  which is the SAME  String we originally got from the server when we called  getServiceList   . The server returns the actual service   serialized , which is automatically deserialized  thanks to RMI   and we simply call the getGuiPanel   on the service and add  the result  a JPanel  to the browser’s mainPanel.      642  chapter 18   remote deployment with RMI  D o   t h e   R M I   l o o k u p ,   a n d   g e t   t h e   s t u b  Cast the stub to the remote interface type,  so that we can call getServiceList   on it     Object[] getServicesList   {        Object obj = null;       Object[] services = null;        try {                    obj = Naming.lookup “rmi:  127.0.0.1 ServiceServer” ;                 }       catch Exception ex  {        ex.printStackTrace  ;       }       server =  ServiceServer  obj;                   try {                  services = server.getServiceList  ;                } catch Exception ex  {          ex.printStackTrace  ;       }       return services;             }     class MyListListener implements ActionListener {       public void actionPerformed ActionEvent ev  {                       Object selection =  serviceList.getSelectedItem  ;           loadService selection ;       }     }     public static void main String[] args  {       new ServiceBrowser  .buildGUI  ;    } }                     i  I f   w e ’ r e   h e r e ,   i t   m e a n s   t h e   u s e r   m a d e   a   s t .

One  suggestion: using what you learned in the GUI chapters,  make the dice graphical. Use a rectangle, and draw the  appropriate number of circles on each one, corresponding  to the roll for that particular die.  Here’s the one important method! The method of the  Service interface-- the one the client’s gonna call when  this service is selected and loaded. You can do whatever you  want in the getGuiPanel   method, as long as you return a  JPanel, so it builds the actual dice-rolling GUI.   class MiniMusicService  a universal service, implements Service   remote deployment with RMI  import javax.sound.midi.*; import java.io.*; import javax.swing.*; import java.awt.*; import java.awt.event.*;  s   d i  l   i t   T h e   s e r v i c e   m e t h o d !

NETWORKING - just like the SimpleChatClient in this chapter, the BeatBox now  connects to the server and gets an input and output stream.  THREADS - again, just like the SimpleChatClient, we start a ‘reader’ class that  keeps looking for incoming messages from the server. But instead of just text, the  messages coming in include TWO objects: the String message and the serialized  ArrayList  the thing that holds the state of all the checkboxes.   import java.awt.*; import javax.swing.*; import java.io.*; import javax.sound.midi.*; import java.util.*; import java.awt.event.*; import java.net.*; import javax.swing.event.*;  public class BeatBoxFinal {        JFrame theFrame;       JPanel mainPanel;       JList incomingList;       JTextField userMessage;       ArrayList  checkboxList;       int nextNum;       Vector  listVector = new Vector   ;       String userName;       ObjectOutputStream out;       ObjectInputStream in;       HashMap  otherSeqsMap = new HashMap   ;        Sequencer sequencer;       Sequence sequence;       Sequence mySequence = null;       Track track;             String[] instrumentNames = {“Bass Drum”, “Closed Hi-Hat”, “Open Hi-Hat”,”Acoustic        Snare”, “Crash Cymbal”, “Hand Clap”, “High Tom”, “Hi Bongo”, “Maracas”, “Whistle”,        “Low Conga”, “Cowbell”, “Vibraslap”, “Low-mid Tom”, “High Agogo”, “Open Hi Conga”};        int[] instruments = {35,42,46,38,49,39,50,60,70,72,64,56,58,47,67,63};        650  appendix A   appendix A Final Code Kitchen          public static void main  String[] args  {          new BeatBoxFinal  .startUp args[0] ;     args[0] is your user ID screen name       }  Add a command-line argument for your screen name.

Here are a few ideas to get you started:  1  Once you select a pattern, whatever current pattern was playing is blown  away. If that was a new pattern you were working on  or a modification of  another one , you’re out of luck. You might want to pop up a dialog box that  asks the user if he’d like to save the current pattern.  2  If you fail to type in a command-line argument, you just get an exception  when you run it! Put something in the main method that checks to see if  you’ve passed in a command-line argument. If the user doesn’t supply one,  either pick a default or print out a message that says they need to run it  again, but this time with an argument for their screen name.  3  It might be nice to have a feature where you can click a button and it  will generate a random pattern for you. You might hit on one you really like.  Better yet, have another feature that lets you load in existing ‘foundation’  patterns, like one for jazz, rock, reggae, etc. that the user can add to.  You can find existing patterns on the Head First Java web start.  656  appendix A   Final BeatBox server program Most of this code is identical to the SimpleChatServer we made in the  Networking and Threads chapter.

You mean, there’s still  MORE? Doesn’t this  book EVER end?  We covered a lot of ground, and you’re almost finished with this book.  We’ll miss you,  but before   we let you go, we wouldn’t feel right about sending you out into JavaLand without a little more   preparation.  We can’t possibly fit everything you’ll need to know into this relatively small appendix.    Actually, we did originally include everything you need to know about Java  not already covered by   the other chapters , by reducing the type point size to .00003.  It all fit, but nobody could read it.  So,   we threw most of it away, but kept the best bits for this Top Ten appendix.   This really is the end of the book.  Except for the index  a must-read! .  this is a new appendix  659   bit manipulation  10   Bit Manipulation Why do you care?  We’ve talked about the fact that there are 8 bits in a byte,  16 bits in a short, and so on.  You might have occasion to  turn individual bits on or off.  For instance you might ﬁnd  yourself writing code for your new Java enabled toaster,  and realize that due to severe memory limitations, certain  toaster settings are controlled at the bit level.  For easier  reading, we’re showing only the last 8 bits in the comments  rather than the full 32 for an  int .  Bitwise NOT Operator:   ~  This operator ‘ﬂips all the bits’ of a primitive.  int x = 10;          bits are 00001010 x = ~x;           bits are now 11110101  The next three operators compare two primitives on a bit  by bit basis, and return a result based on comparing these  bits.  We’ll use the following example for the next three  operators:  int x = 10;       bits are 00001010  int y =  6;       bits are 00000110   Bitwise AND Operator:   & This operator returns a value whose bits are turned on only  if both original bits are turned on:  int a = x & y;     bits are 00000010  Bitwise OR Operator:    This operator returns a value whose bits are turned on only  if either of the original bits are turned on:  int a = x  y;     bits are 00001110  Bitwise XOR  exclusive OR  Operator:  ^ This operator returns a value whose bits are turned on only  if exactly one of the original bits are turned on:  int a = x ^ y;     bits are 00001100  660 appendix B  The Shift Operators These operators take a single integer primitive and shift  or  slide  all of its bits in one direction or another.  If you want  to dust off your binary math skills, you might realize that  shifting bits left effectively multiplies a number by a power of  two, and shifting bits right effectively divides a number by a  power of two.  We’ll use the following example for the next three operators:  int x = -11;          bits are 11110101 Ok, ok, we’ve been putting it off, here is the world’s  shortest explanation of storing negative numbers, and  two’s complement. Remember, the leftmost bit of an integer  number is called the sign bit.  A negative integer number in  Java always has its sign bit turned on  i.e. set to 1 . A positive  integer number always has its sign bit turned off  0 .  Java  uses the two’s complement formula to store negative numbers.  To change a number’s sign using two’s complement, ﬂip all  the bits, then add 1  with a byte, for example, that would  mean adding 00000001 to the ﬂipped value .   Right Shift Operator:   >>  This operator shifts all of a number’s bits right by a certain  number, and ﬁlls all of the bits on the left side with whatever  the original leftmost bit was. The sign bit does not change:  int y = x >> 2;     bits are 11111101   Unsigned Right Shift Operator:   >>> Just like the right shift operator BUT it ALWAYS ﬁlls the  leftmost bits with zeros.  The sign bit might change:  int y = x >>> 2;     bits are 00111101  Left Shift Operator:   << Just like the unsigned right shift operator, but in the other  direction; the rightmost bits are ﬁlled with zeros. The sign bit  might change.  int y = x << 2;     bits are 11010100   9  Immutability   Why do you care that Strings are Immutable? When your Java programs start to get big, you’ll  inevitably end up with lots and lots of String objects.   For security purposes, and for the sake of conserving  memory  remember your Java programs can run on  teeny  Java-enabled cell phones , Strings in Java are  immutable.  What this    means is that when you say:  String s = “0”;  for  int x = 1; x < 10; x++  {   s = s + x; } What’s actually happening is that you’re creating ten  String objects  with values “0”, “01”, “012”, through   “0123456789” .  In the end s is referring to the String  with the value “0123456789”, but at this point there  are ten Strings in existence! Whenever you make a new String, the JVM puts it  into a special part of memory called the ‘String Pool’   sounds refreshing doesn’t it? .  If there is already  a String in the String Pool with the same value, the  JVM doesn’t create a duplicate, it simply refers your  reference variable to the existing entry.   The JVM can  get away with this because Strings are immutable; one  reference variable can’t change a String’s value out  from under another reference variable referring to  the same String.   The other issue with the String pool is that the  Garbage Collector doesn’t go there.  So in our example,  unless by coincidence you later happen to make a  String called “01234”, for instance, the ﬁ rst nine  Strings created in our for loop will just sit around  wasting memory.  How does this save memory? Well, if you’re not careful, it doesn’t!  But if you un- derstand how String immutability works, than you  can sometimes take advantage of it to save memory.   If you have to do a lot of String manipulations  like  concatenations, etc. , however, there is another class  StringBuilder, better suited for that purpose.  We’ll  talk more about StringBuilder in a few pages.  appendix B  Top Ten Reference  Why do you care that Wrappers are  Immutable? In the Math chapter we talked about the two main  uses of the wrapper classes:    Wrapping a primitive so it can pretend to be an     object.    Using the static utility methods  for example,     Integer.parseInt   . It’s important to remember that when you create a  wrapper object like:   Integer iWrap = new Integer 42 ;  That’s it for that wrapper object.  Its value will always  be 42. There is no setter method for a wrapper object.   You can, of course, refer iWrap to a different wrapper  object, but then you’ll have two objects. Once you  create a wrapper object, there’s no way to change  the value of that object!   Make it Sticki kkk Roses are red, violets are blue. Strings are immutable, wrappers are too. Oh look! A bonus Make it Stick. Right here in the appendix.  you are here4 661   assertions  8   Assertions  We haven’t talked much about how to debug your Java  program while you’re developing it.  We believe that  you should learn Java at the command line, as we’ve  been doing throughout the book.  Once you’re a Java  pro, if you decide to use an IDE*, you might have  other debugging tools to use.  In the old days, when  a Java programmer wanted to debug her code, she’d  stick a bunch of System.out.println    statements   throughout the program, printing current variable  values, and “I got here” messages, to see if the ﬂow  control was working properly.   The ready-bake code  in chapter 6 left some debugging ‘print’ statements  in the code.   Then, once the program was working  correctly, she’d go through and take all those System. out.println    statements back out again.  It was  tedious and error prone.  But as of Java 1.4  and 5.0 ,  debugging got a whole lot easier. The answer?   Assertions Assertions are like System.out.println    statements  on steroids.  Add them to your code as you would  add println statements.  The Java 5.0 compiler  assumes you’ll be compiling source ﬁles that are 5.0  compatible, so as of Java 5.0, compiling with assertions   is enabled by default. At runtime, if you do nothing, the assert statements  you added to your code will be ignored by the JVM,  and won’t slow down your program. But if you tell the  JVM to enable your assertions, they will help you do  your debugging, without changing a line of code!   Some folks have complained about having to leave  assert statements in their production code, but  leaving them in can be really valuable when your  code is already deployed in the ﬁeld. If your client  is having trouble, you can instruct the client to run  the program with assertions enabled, and have the  client send you the output. If the assertions were  stripped out of your deployed code, you’d never  have that option. And there is almost no downside;  when assertions are not enabled, they are completely  ignored by the JVM, so there’s no performance hit to  worry about.  662 appendix B  How to make Assertions work  Add assertion statements to your code wherever you  believe that something must be true.  For instance:  assert  height > 0 ;       if true, program continues normally     if false, throw an AssertionError           You can add a little more information to the stack  trace by saying:  assert  height > 0  : “height = “ +  height + “ weight = “ + weight; The expression after the colon can be any legal  Java expression that resolves to a non-null value.  But  whatever you do, don’t create assertions that change an  object’s state!  If you do, enabling assertions at runtime  might change how your program performs.                          Compiling and running with  Assertions  To compile with assertions:     javac TestDriveGame.java   Notice that no command line options were  necessary.   To run with assertions:     java -ea TestDriveGame  * IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment  and includes tools such as Eclipse, Borland’s JBuilder, or  the open source NetBeans  netbeans.org .   appendix B  Top Ten Reference  7   Block Scope  In chapter 9, we talked about how local variables  live only as long as the method in which they’re  declared stays on the stack.  But some variables can  have even shorter lifespans.  Inside of methods, we  often create blocks of code.  We’ve been doing this  all along, but we haven’t explicitly talked in terms of  blocks.  Typically, blocks of code occur within methods,  and are bounded by curly braces { }.  Some common  examples of code blocks that you’ll recognize include  loops  for, while  and conditional expressions  like if  statements .                   k    m e t h o d   b l o Let’s look at an example: void doStuff   {                       int x = 0;                          for int y = 0; y < 5; y++  {      o f   t h e  r t    s t a  c  local variable scoped to the entire method           x = x + y;                       }                                       end of the for loop block  No problem, x and y are both in scope      x = x * y;                      }    Aack! Won’t compile! y is out of scope here!  this is not  the way it works in some other languages, so beware!   end of the method block, now x is also out of scope                                      In the previous example, y was a block variable,  declared inside a block, and y went out of scope as  soon as the for loop ended.  Your Java programs will  be more debuggable and expandable if you use local  variables instead of instance variables, and block  variables instead of local variables, whenever possible.  The compiler will make sure that you don’t try to use  a variable that’s gone out of scope, so you don’t have  to worry about runtime meltdowns.   beginning of a for loop block, and y is  scoped to only the for loop !   you are here4 663   linked invocations   6   Linked Invocations  While you did see a little of this in this book, we tried to keep our syntax as clean and  readable as possible.  There are, however, many legal shortcuts in Java, that you’ll no doubt  be exposed to, especially if you have to read a lot code you didn’t write.  One of the more  common constructs you will encounter is known as linked invocations.  For example:      StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer “spring” ;      sb = sb.delete 3,6 .insert 2,”umme” .deleteCharAt 1 ;        System.out.println “sb = “ + sb ;                            result is sb = summer What in the world is happening in the second line of code?  Admittedly, this is a contrived  example, but you need to learn how to decipher these.  1 - Work from left to right.  2 - Find the result of the leftmost method call, in this case sb.delete 3,6 .  If you  look up StringBuffer in the API docs, you’ll see that the delete   method returns a  StringBuffer object.  The result of running the delete   method is a StringBuffer object  with the value “spr”.    3 - The next leftmost method  insert   is called on the newly created StringBuffer  object “spr”.  The result of that method call  the insert   method , is also a StringBuffer  object  although it doesn’t have to be the same type as the previous method return , and so  it goes, the returned object is used to call the next method to the right.  In theory, you can  link as many methods as you want in a single statement  although it’s rare to see more than  three linked methods in a single statement .  Without linking, the second line of code from  above would be more readable, and look something like this:      sb = sb.delete 3,6 ;     sb = sb.insert 2,”umme” ;     sb = sb.deleteCharAt 1 ;  But here’s  a more common, and useful example, that you saw us using, but we thought  we’d point it out again here. This is for when your main   method needs to invoke an  instance method of the main class, but you don’t need to keep a reference to the instance of  the class. In other words, the main   needs to create the instance only so that main   can  invoke one of the instance’s methods.      class Foo {        public static void main String [] args  [          new Foo  .go  ;            }        void go   {            here’s what we REALLY want...        }  we want to call go  , but we don’t care about  the Foo instance, so we don’t bother assigning  the new Foo object to a reference.      }  664 appendix B   appendix B  Top Ten Reference  5   Anonymous and Static Nested Classes  Nested classes come in many ﬂavors In the GUI event-handling section of the book, we started using inner  nested  classes as a  solution for implementing listener interfaces. That’s the most common, practical, and read- able form of an inner class—where the class is simply nested within the curly braces of another  enclosing class. And remember, it means you need an instance of the outer class in order to get  an instance of the inner class, because the inner class is a member of the outer enclosing class. But there are other kinds of inner classes including static and anonymous. We’re not going  into the details here, but we don’t want you to be thrown by strange syntax when you see it in  someone’s code. Because out of virtually anything you can do with the Java language, perhaps  nothing produces more bizarre-looking code than anonymous inner classes. But we’ll start with  something simpler—static nested classes. Static nested classes You already know what static means—something tied to the class, not a particular instance. A  static nested class looks just like the non-static classes we used for event listeners, except they’re  marked with the keyword static.  A static nested class is just that—a  class enclosed within another, and  marked with the static modifier.  public class FooOuter {    static class BarInner {       void sayIt   {          System.out.println “method of a static inner class” ;       }    } }  Because a static nested class is...static, you don’t  use an instance of the outer class. You just use the  name of the class, the same way you invoke static  methods or access static variables.   class Test {     }     public static void main  String[] args  {       FooOuter.BarInner foo = new FooOuter.BarInner  ;       foo.sayIt  ;  } Static nested classes are more like regular non-nested classes in that they don’t enjoy a special relation-     ship with an enclosing outer object. But because static nested classes are still considered a member of  the enclosing outer class, they still get access to any private members of the outer class... but only the  ones that are also static. Since the static nested class isn’t connected to an instance of the outer class, it  doesn’t have any special way to access the non-static  instance  variables and methods.  you are here4 665   when arrays aren’t enough  5   Anonymous and Static Nested Classes, continued  The difference between nested and inner Any Java class that’s deﬁ ned within the scope of another class is known as a nested class. It  doesn’t matter if it’s anonymous, static, normal, whatever. If it’s inside another class, it’s  technically considered a nested class. But non-static nested classes are often referred to as inner  classes, which is what we called them earlier in the book. The bottom line: all inner classes are  nested classes, but not all nested classes are inner classes. Anonymous inner classes Imagine you’re writing some GUI code, and suddenly realize that you need an instance  of a class that implements ActionListener. But you realize you don’t have an instance of an  ActionListener. Then you realize that you also never wrote a class for that listener. You have two  choices at that point: 1  Write an inner class in your code, the way we did in our GUI code, and then instantiate it  and pass that instance into the button’s event registration  addActionListener    method. OR 2  Create an anonymous inner class and instantiate it, right there, just-in-time. Literally right  where you are at the point you need the listener object. That’s right, you create the class and the  instance in the place where you’d normally be supplying just the instance. Think about that for  a moment—it means you pass the entire class where you’d normally pass only an instance into a  method argument!   l y   w e ’ d   d o   s o m e t h i n g   l  W e   m a d e   a   f r a m e   a n d   a d d e d   a   b u t t o n ,   a n d   n o w   w e   i s t e n e r   w i t h   t h e   b u t t o n .

There are only three modiﬁers because  the default  what you get when you don’t use any access modiﬁer  is one of the four  access levels.  Access Levels  in order of how restrictive they are, from least to most restrictive     public    protected    default    private  public means any code anywhere can access the public thing  by  ‘thing’ we mean class, variable, method, constructor, etc. .  protected works just like default  code in the same package has access , EXCEPT it  also allows subclasses outside the package to inherit the protected thing.  default access means that only code within the same package as  the class with the default thing can access the default thing. private means that only code within the same class can access the private thing.  Keep in mind it means private to the class, not private to the object. One Dog  can see another Dog object’s private stuff, but a Cat can’t see a Dog’s privates.  Access modiﬁers   public  protected  private  Most of the time you’ll use only public and private access levels.  public  Use public for classes, constants  static ﬁnal variables , and methods that you’re  exposing to other code  for example getters and setters  and most constructors.  private  Use private for virtually all instance variables, and for methods that you don’t want  outside code to call  in other words, methods used by the public methods of your class .  But although you might not use the other two  protected and default , you still need to  know what they do because you’ll see them in other code.  you are here4 667   4  Access Levels and Access Modiﬁers, cont.  when arrays aren’t enough  default and protected  default Both protected and default access levels are tied to packages. Default access is simple—it  means that only code within the same package can access code with default access. So a  default class, for example  which means a class that isn’t explicitly declared as public  can  be accessed by only classes within the same package as the default class. But what does it really mean to access a class? Code that does not have access to a class is  not allowed to even think about the class. And by think, we mean use the class in code.  For example, if you don’t have access to a class, because of access restriction, you aren’t  allowed to instantiate the class or even declare it as a type for a variable, argument, or  return value. You simply can’t type it into your code at all! If you do, the compiler will  complain. Think about the implications—a default class with public methods means the public  methods aren’t really public at all. You can’t access a method if you can’t see the class. Why would anyone want to restrict access to code within the same package? Typically,  packages are designed as a group of classes that work together as a related set. So it might  make sense that classes within the same package need to access one another’s code, while  as a package, only a small number of classes and methods are exposed to the outside  world  i.e. code outside that package .  OK, that’s default. It’s simple—if something has default access  which, remember, means  no explicit access modiﬁer! , only code within the same package as the default thing   class, variable, method, inner class  can access that thing. Then what’s protected for?  protected Protected access is almost identical to default access, with one exception: it allows sub- classes to inherit the protected thing, even if those subclasses are outside the package of the super- class they extend.  That’s it. That’s all protected buys you—the ability to let your subclasses  be outside your superclass package, yet still inherit pieces of the class, including methods  and constructors. Many developers ﬁnd very little reason to use protected, but it is used in some designs,  and some day you might ﬁnd it to be exactly what you need. One of the interesting things  about protected is that—unlike the other access levels—protected access applies only to  inheritance. If a subclass-outside-the-package has a reference to an instance of the superclass   the superclass that has, say, a protected method , the subclass can’t access the pro- tected method using that superclass reference! The only way the subclass can access that  method is by inheriting it. In other words, the subclass-outside-the-package doesn’t have  access to the protected method, it just has the method, through inheritance.  668 appendix B   String and StringBuffer   appendix B  Top Ten Reference  3   String and StringBuffer StringBuilder Methods  Two of the most commonly used classes in the Java API are String and StringBuffer  remember from  9 a few pages back, Strings are immutable, so a StringBuffer StringBuilder can be a lot mor efﬁcient  if you’re manipulating a String .  As of Java 5.0 you should use the StringBuilder class instead of  StringBuffer, unless your String manipulations need to be thread-safe, which is not common. Here’s a  brief overview of the key methods in these classes:  Both String and StringBuffer StringBuilder classes have:      char charAt int index ;                             what char is at a certain position      int length  ;                                               how long is this      String substring int start, int end ;          get a part of this       String toString  ;                                       what’s the String value of this  To concatenate Strings:     String concat string ;                               for the String class      String append String ;                            for StringBuffer & StringBuilder  The String class has:     String replace char old, char new ;        replace all occurences of a char      String substring int begin, int end ;       get a portion of a String     char [] toCharArray  ;                             convert to an array of chars      String toLowerCase  ;                              convert all characters to lower case      String toUpperCase  ;                             convert all characters to upper case      String trim  ;                                            remove whitespace from the ends      String valueOf char []                            make a String out of a char array      String valueOf int i                                 make a String out of a primitive                                  other primitives are supported as well        The StringBuffer & StringBuilder classes have:      StringBxxxx delete int start, int end ;                                       delete a portion      StringBxxxx insert int offset, any primitive or a char [] ;       insert something      StringBxxxx replace int start, int end, String s ;                      replace this part with this String      StringBxxxx reverse  ;                                                     reverse the SB from front to back      void setCharAt int index, char ch ;                                           replace a given character  Note: StringBxxxx refers to either StringBuffer or StringBuilder, as appropriate.  you are here4 669   when arrays aren’t enough  2   Multidimensional Arrays  In most languages, if you create, say, a 4 x 2 two-dimensional array,  you would visualize a  rectangle, 4 elements by 2 elements, with a total of 8 elements.  But in Java, such an array  would actually be 5 arrays linked together!  In Java, a two dimensional array is simply an array  of arrays.   A three dimensional array is an array of arrays of arrays, but we’ll leave that for  you to play with.   Here’s how it works  int[][] a2d  = new int [4][2];  The JVM creates an array with 4 elements.  Each of these four elements is actually a reference  variable referring to a  newly created , int array with 2 elements.           a 2 d [  ]  1  regular ints go inside each  of the eight elements  a2d[2][1]  a 2 d [ 0 ]  [ 0 ] a 2 d [ 0 ]  ]  1  [                       i n t    i n t                            i n t   a r r a y     i n t [ ]    int        int           int        int           int array  int[]   int array  int[]   a2d[3][0]  int        int          int array  int[]   e f e  ]     r  e  c  n  e  r  i n t [  4    r i a  v     a  b l  e  s  int[]     int[]      int[]      int[]        int array object  int[][]    a2d  int[][]  Remember that the array itself is an object     an array holding references to int arrays   Working with multidimensional arrays   - To access the second element in the third array:   int x = a2d[2][1];      remember, 0 based! - To make a one-dimensional reference to one of the sub-arrays:    int[] copy = a2d[1];  - Short-cut initialization of a 2 x 3 array:        int[][] x = { { 2,3,4 }, { 7,8,9 } }; - To make a 2d array with irregular dimensions:     int[][] y = new int [2][];         makes only the ﬁrst array, with a length of 2     y[0] = new int [3];       makes the ﬁrst sub-array 3 elements in length     y[1] = new int [5];       makes the second sub-array 5 elements in length  670 appendix B   enumerations   appendix B  Top Ten Reference  And the number one topic that didn’t quite make it in...  1  Enumerations  also called Enumerated Types or Enums   We’ve talked about constants that are deﬁned in the API,  for instance,  JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE. You can also create your own constants by  marking a variable static ﬁnal. But sometimes you’ll want to create a set  of constant values to represent the only valid values for a variable. This set of  valid values is commonly referred to as an enumeration. Before Java 5.0 you  could only do a half-baked job of creating an enumeration in Java. As of Java  5.0 you can create full ﬂedged enumerations that will be the envy of all your  pre-Java 5.0-using friends.   Who’s in the band?  Let’s say that you’re creating a website for your favorite band, and you want to  make sure that all of the comments are directed to a particular band member.   The old way to fake an “enum”:  public static ﬁnal int JERRY = 1; public static ﬁnal int BOBBY = 2; public static ﬁnal int PHIL = 3;     later in the code  if  selectedBandMember == JERRY  {      do JERRY related stuff }  We’re hoping that by the time we got here  “selectedBandMember” has a valid value!  The good news about this technique is that it DOES make the code easier to  read. The other good news is that you can’t ever change the value of the fake  enums you’ve created; JERRY will always be 1. The bad news is that there’s  no easy or good way to make sure that the value of selectedBandMember  will always be 1, 2, or  3. If some hard to ﬁnd piece of code sets  selectedBandMember equal to 812, it’s pretty likely your code will break...  you are here4 671      s  s  s  s           c  n  n e w    s s l a u m s r c s r    d e f i n i t i o   a   A R E   n   a a t e d   e ”  li k s n r l a e  e i m p l s   a   e e a t   u t   t h o e v ’   w e e r   H e . “ M e m b e d   a ll  k o l o o f   k i n d     T h i I t   t u   i t ? n ’ t   s e d o c o f   k i n d     c i a l e p s p a t e d   t y r u m e n e The “selectedBandMember” variable is of type  “Members”, and can ONLY have a value of  “JERRY”, “BOBBY”, or “PHIL”.    e  c  .     when arrays aren’t enough  1   Enumerations, cont.  The same situation using a genuine Java 5.0 enum. While this is a very basic  enumeration, most enumerations usually are this simple.  A new, ofﬁcial “enum”:  public enum Members { JERRY, BOBBY, PHIL }; public Members selectedBandMember;     later in the code  if  selectedBandMember == Members.JERRY  {      do JERRY related stuff }  No need to worry about this variable’s value!  The syntax to refer to an enum “instance”.  Your enum extends java.lang.Enum When you create an enum, you’re creating a new class, and you’re implicitly extending  java.lang.Enum. You can declare an enum as its own standalone class, in its own  source ﬁle, or as a member of another class.   Using “if” and “switch” with Enums Using the enum we just created, we can perform branches in our code using either  the if or switch statement. Also notice that we can compare enum instances using  either == or the .equals   method. Usually == is considered better style.  Members n = Members.BOBBY; if  n.equals Members.JERRY   System.out.println “Jerrrry!” ; if  n == Members.BOBBY  System.out.println “Rat Dog” ;  Assigning an enum value to a variable.  Members ifName = Members.PHIL; switch  ifName  {   case JERRY: System.out.print “make it sing “ ;   case PHIL: System.out.print “go deep “ ;   case BOBBY: System.out.println “Cassidy! ” ; }  672 appendix B     !  e    f i n k r   w o r i n t e d . p  s  i  s  e    e        o f   t h B o t h ” g “ R a t   D o  Pop Quiz!

They’re  not common, but you might run into them:    a n   a r g u m e n t   p a s  i n   t o   t h e   c o n s t r u c t o r   d e c l a r e d   b e l o w .

Think of them as overriding the  basic enum method  in this case  the “sing  ” method , if sing   is  called on a variable with an enum  value of JERRY or BOBBY.      private String instrument;      Names String instrument  {       this.instrument = instrument;     }     public String getInstrument   {       return this.instrument;     }     public String sings   {       return “occasionally”;     }   }  This is the enum’s constructor. It runs  once for each declared enum value  in  this case it runs three times .  You’ll see these methods being called from “main  ”.    public static void main String [] args  {     for  Names n : Names.values    {       System.out.print n ;       System.out.print “, instrument: “+ n.getInstrument   ;       System.out.println “, sings: “ + n.sings   ;     }   } }  File  Edit   Window  Help  Bootleg  %java HfjEnum JERRY, instrument: lead guitar, sings: plaintively BOBBY, instrument: rhythm guitar, sings: hoarsely PHIL, instrument: bass, sings: occasionally %  Every enum comes with a  built-in “values  ” method  which is typically used in a  “for” loop as shown.  Notice that the basic “sing  ”  method is only called when the  enum value has no constant- specific class body.  you are here4 673   when arrays aren’t enough  Five-Minute Mystery  A Long Trip Home  Captain Byte of the Flatland starship “Traverser” had received an urgent, Top Secret transmission  from headquarters.  The message contained 30 heavily encrypted navigational codes that the  Traverser would need to successfully plot a course home through enemy sectors.  The enemy  Hackarians, from a neighboring galaxy, had devised a devilish code-scrambling ray that was capable   of creating bogus objects on the heap of the Traverser’s only navigational computer.  In   addition, the alien ray could alter valid reference variables so that they referred to these  bogus objects.  The only defense the Traverser crew had against this evil Hackarian ray was  to run an inline virus checker which could be imbedded into the Traverser’s state of the art  Java 1.4 code.    Captain Byte gave Ensign Smith the following programming instructions to process the critical   navigational codes:  “Put the ﬁrst ﬁve codes in an array of type ParsecKey.  Put the last 25 codes in a ﬁve by ﬁve, two  dimensional array of type QuadrantKey.  Pass these two arrays into the plotCourse   method of the  public ﬁnal class ShipNavigation.  Once the course object is returned run the inline virus checker  against all the programs reference variables and then run the NavSim program and bring me the  results.”  A few minutes later Ensign Smith returned with the NavSim output.  “NavSim output ready for  review, sir”, declared Ensign Smith.  “Fine”, replied the Captain, “Please review your work”.  “Yes  sir!”, responded the Ensign, “First I declared and constructed an array of type ParsecKey with the  following code;  ParsecKey [] p = new ParsecKey[5];  ,  next I declared and constructed an array  of type QuadrantKey with the following code:  QuadrantKey [] [] q = new QuadrantKey [5] [5]; .   Next, I loaded the ﬁrst 5 codes into the ParsecKey array using a ‘for’ loop, and then I loaded the last  25 codes into the QuadrantKey array using nested ‘for’ loops.  Next, I ran the virus checker against  all 32 reference variables, 1 for the ParsecKey array, and 5 for its elements, 1 for the QuadrantKey  array, and 25 for its elements.  Once the virus check returned with no viruses detected, I ran the  NavSim program and re-ran the virus checker, just to be safe…   Sir ! “  Captain Byte gave the Ensign a cool, long stare and said calmly, “Ensign, you are conﬁned to  quarters for endangering the safety of this ship, I don’t want to see your face on this bridge again  until you have properly learned your Java! Lieutenant Boolean, take over for the Ensign and do this  job correctly!”  Why did the captain conﬁne the Ensign to his quarters?  674 appendix B   puzzle answers  appendix B  Top Ten Reference  Five-Minute Mystery Solution  A Long Trip Home  Captain Byte knew that in Java, multidimensional arrays are actu- ally arrays of arrays.  The ﬁve by ﬁve QuadrantKey array ‘q’, would  actually need a total of 31 reference variables to be able to access  all of its components:  1 - reference variable for ‘q’  5 - reference variables for q[0] - q[4]  25 - reference variables for q[0][0] - q[4][4]  The ensign had forgotten the reference variables for the ﬁve one  dimensional arrays embedded in the ‘q’ array.  Any of those ﬁve  reference variables could have been corrupted by the Hackarian  ray, and the ensign’s test would never reveal the problem.  you are here4 675    h  Index h  h d  d  the index  Symbols  &, &&, .   boolean operators   151, 660 &,  >, >>>, ^, , ~   bitwise operators   660 ++  --   increment decrement   105, 115 +   String concatenation operator   17 .  dot operator   36   , >=   comparison operators   86, 114,   reference  54  151   , >=   comparison operators   11  A  abandoned objects.

Learning a complex new language is no easy task especially when it s an object-oriented computer programming language like Java. You might think the problem is your brain. It seems to have a mind of its own, a mind that doesn't always want to take in the dry, technical stuff you're forced to study. The fact is your brain craves novelty. It's constantly searching, scanning, waiting for something unusual to happen. After all, that's the way it was built to help you stay alive. It takes all the routine, ordinary, dull stuff and filters it to the background so it won't interfere with your brain's real work--recording things that matter. How does your brain know what matters? It's like the creators of the Head First approach say, suppose you're out for a hike and a tiger jumps in front of you, what happens in your brain? Neurons fire. Emotions crank up. Chemicals surge. That's how your brain knows. And that's how your brain will learn Java. Head First Java combines puzzles, strong visuals, mysteries, and soul-searching interviews with famous Java objects to engage you in many different ways. It's fast, it's fun, and it's effective. And, despite its playful appearance, Head First Java is serious stuff: a complete introduction to object-oriented programming and Java. You'll learn everything from the fundamentals to advanced topics, including threads, network sockets, and distributed programming with RMI. And the new. second edition focuses on Java 5.0, the latest version of the Java language and development platform. Because Java 5.0 is a major update to the platform, with deep, code-level changes, even more careful study and implementation is required. So learning the Head First way is more important than ever. If you've read a Head First book, you know what to expect--a visually rich format designed for the way your brain works. If you haven't, you're in for a treat. You'll see why people say it's unlike any other Java book you've ever read. By exploiting how your brain works, Head First Java compresses the time it takes to learn and retain--complex information. Its unique approach not only shows you what you need to know about Java syntax, it teaches you to think like a Java programmer. If you want to be bored, buy some other book. But if you want to understand Java, this book's for you.
