tools, new schools  NEWTOO Front.indd   10  3 2 09   2:24:26 PM   introduction  let’s start with a pop quiz  Q  Yes or no:   Have you ever blogged, podcasted, wikied,   showed photos, or commented online?  If you said yes and reside in the United States, you’re among 48 million people who  have tried these new tools  Horrigan, 2006 . If you said no but are still reading  this, you obviously are curious about these latest technological innovations.  Welcome to the New Web, most often called Web 2.0. It is all about the free new  tools such as blogs, wikis, photo and video sharing, and social networking that  people are talking about and that many are using already.  What do they mean for education? These tools are changing how people, including  our students, interact with the world. The changing nature of information and  the new ways our students understand and make sense of the world signal that  we need new strategies and new tools for teaching and learning. The challenges  of  the  new  millennium  require  that  students  be  adaptable  and  analytical,  and  that they have the skills to identify and use the best tools in a rapidly changing  environment.  Why should you care about these new tools and methods? After all, in spite of all  the hype, technology has not yet changed schools very much. So why now—in an  era of No Child Left Behind and high-stakes testing—should we care?  As you will see, the world has changed; our students have changed, and traditional  schools are no longer up to the task of educating young people for the future.  You may say that the Web as we have known it is good enough, that these new  tools are uncontrollable and students are venturing into uncharted territory. What  was so bad about last year’s tools?  web 2.0     new tools, new schools    NEWTOO CH1.indd   1  3 2 09   2:34:51 PM   introduction  With  Web  1.0,  students  could  find  information  online  and  use  it   with  proper  citations, of course  to write reports using a word processor or PowerPoint. They  could show their work to peers in class and parents at home and store it in portfolios  on the school server. Sometimes they could even create Web pages that the district  might allow to be posted.  Now they can write directly online in a blog and get immediate feedback from  peers and others who could be anywhere. They can collaborate with peers near  and far—in a wiki, also directly online. They can post photos, videos, podcasts,  and other items online. The difference is that they can do the posting. They control  the tools of production and publication. There are no more gatekeepers.  With these tools, people are changing the way that the real world works—business  practices as well as social activities. Why not use them to change schools?  So welcome to this book, which is all about harnessing these new tools for learning.  Since so much else is changing, will these tools help schools to change? Will these  new technologies make the difference? We hope so. We wrote this book to help  educators and policymakers understand what’s at stake and why these tools are so  important. We also take a look at ideas for the future of new tools in education.  We know that the world has changed. If we think back to life 20 years ago, we  remember  that  several  things  we  take  for  granted  today  were  not  in  wide  use,  starting with cell phones, laptops, and handheld computers.  We  know  that  technology  is  changing  rapidly  and  the  Web  is  providing  new  opportunities  for  learning,  earning,  and  living.  People  no  longer  just  search  for  information.  Now  they  provide  information,too.  These  people  include  our  students.  We  know  that  students  are  different  today  from  students  20  years  ago,  mostly  because of technology. To illustrate the latest versions of “the dog ate my homework”  excuse, we count down Scott McNealy’s  2006  top 10 reasons why students can’t  turn in their homework:  J  Tech support for my PC was outsourced offshore.  9  I had to delete it to make room for my iTunes.  8  I’m still handwriting it. The MS Office license was too expensive.  7  I e-mailed it … didn’t you get it?  6  I couldn’t afford the HP ink cartridge.    web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH1.indd   2  3 2 09   2:34:52 PM   introduction  5  It took too long to type on a regular keyboard. Can I text it to you instead?  4  The cut and paste keys on my keyboard are worn out  Google, cut, paste .  3  I plan on “open sourcing” from the kid next to me.  2  I had a visit from the Blue Screen of Death.  1  The dog chewed up my laptop.  Have schools changed? Some have and more are adopting new practices. These  are the new schools we mean in the title. There is no shortage of models—charter,  restructured, private, public, and more. What we suggest is that to be a truly new  school, it has to model new ways of teaching and learning, and of using new tools.  It has to have at its core an interest in helping its students to be successful in the  21st century—in work and in play, and in all other aspects of living in a world that  promises only change as the norm.  To begin with, the world is wired and that has an effect on today’s students. In  chapter 1, we look at how we already live in a world in which jobs are changing and  requirements for workers are shifting so much that the most important skill for  the future is adaptability. Part of this change is adapting to and using these new  tools, and being flexible enough to learn to use the next set of tools to be able to  address the next set of challenges.  Now that businesses are requiring employees to have new skills and are using new  tools to run their businesses, young people need to be prepared—technologically  and intellectually—partly because many countries are working hard to get their  workers and students ready for globalization.  Luckily, students are off to a good start, technologically at least. Today’s young  people  have  grown  up  with  technology,  use  it  as  a  matter  of  course,  and  never  knew a world without it. Chapter 2 explores these developments. We already know  that certain types of pedagogy lend themselves to helping students develop 21st- century skills. Now it is time to put these methods together with new tools.  There is no shortage of tools. In chapter 3 we look at  new Web-based applications  that are enticing people to create, communicate, and share online. These tools are  growing increasingly robust, supported by a community of creators. For the most  part, our students know how to use these tools for their own purposes. Schools  must help them to use the tools to learn as well as to satisfy intellectual curiosity.  In addition, we are beginning to see the development and collection of another  category of tools—free Web-based educational applications.  web 2.0     new tools, new schools    NEWTOO CH1.indd   3  3 2 09   2:34:53 PM   introduction  These are still early days in bringing together education and Web 2.0, yet there are  models—both of learning and technology use—that point us in the right direc- tion. We will see teachers who have guided their students to create a collaborative  math  solutions  manual,  an  independent  literature  circle  project,  a  collabora- tive guidebook about online security, and more. The educators you will meet in  chapter 4 are pioneers who are an inspiration to us all.  For  there  to  be  widespread  acceptance,  today’s  educators  and  future  educators  need  to  be  prepared.  Chapter  5  looks  at  past  models  for  professional  develop- ment for technology integration and presents new models for both practicing and  preservice teachers. The chapter examines the benefits of a community of practice  approach to assisting everyone in understanding and using new ways of teaching  and learning.  In addition to preparing educators, districts and schools face administrative chal- lenges  that  demand  new  forms  of  leadership.  Chapter  6  describes  some  of  the  complex issues facing education leaders and their strategies for coping. One solu- tion relies on open-source infrastructure and software.  Keeping students and data safe and secure in an online environment is one of  the more challenging problems today, and no more so than in schools. Chapter 7  outlines online safety and security issues. They are often difficult to resolve, but  solutions and models are there for districts to implement.  Technology alone will not solve every educational problem. Some issues are intrac- table, but adding technology into the mix just might help, and in unexpected ways.  Chapter 8 shows instances in which using new tools is having a positive effect or  is showing potential to help solve complex educational issues.  Sounds pretty straightforward, doesn’t it?  Of  course,  if  you’re  involved  with  education,  you  already  know  that  nothing  is  simple. In fact, a Public Broadcasting Service  PBS; 2006  Web site about the Story  of  American  Public  Education  begins,  “From  the  landing  at  Plymouth  Rock  to  today, educators and community members have debated over the best way that  government should fulfill its responsibility to educate citizens. Underlying these  debates are central questions”  n.p. . The first question, according to PBS: “What  is the purpose of a public education?”   It is almost 400 years later, and all we know is that there is no simple answer. At least  we’re still talking—and arguing. For example, the National Council of Teachers of  Mathematics recommended in 2006 that we change how we teach mathematics,     web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH1.indd   4  3 2 09   2:34:54 PM   introduction  switching from an emphasis on what is called “fuzzy math” and returning to “the  basics”   Lewin,  1999 .  In  science  education,  one  writer  claimed,  “The  [science]  curriculum is fragmented into tiny pieces that render the important connections  invisible”  Anderson, 2006, n.p. . It sometimes seems that educational theory and  practice are determined by a pendulum’s swing.  In  the  U.S.  we  ask,  “Does  the  United  States  work  its  students  too  hard,  or  not  hard enough?”  Gewirtz, 1998, n.p.  We don’t know if teachers give too much or  too little homework or if homework makes any difference. We aren’t even sure  how to create effective teachers. Two 2006 reports highlighted the inadequacies of  teacher preparation programs in higher education and asked if we know whether  professional  development  in  school  districts  is  effective   Honawar,  2006;  The  Noyce Foundation, 2006 .  We may not agree on the purpose of education or know what works in all cases,  but  at  least  we  can  sound  a  promising  note  about  technology’s  use  in  schools.  A  growing  body  of  evidence  supports  technology’s  important  role  in  educating  today’s  young  people.  Indeed,  a  recent  report  by  the  Metiri  group  stated  that  although its potential is still largely untapped, evidence suggests that technology  can result in higher levels of learning. This review outlined trend data about tech- nological innovations that experts and research say are working—and stated the  potential of these innovations  Fadel & Lemke, 2006 .  What is that potential? What will the future be? While there is no crystal ball,  chapter 9 takes a look at promising ideas and chapter 10 offers a few tutorials to  help you get started using some of the tools. Appendix A puts the time frame of  Web 2.0 development into perspective, and appendix B lists many popular Web  2.0 tools. Utilizing Web 2.0 tools during a typical school day for students, teachers,  and administrators is the topic of appendix C.  Of course, underlying all the positive implications for new tools in new schools,  there  is  a  dark  side  too.  Web  2.0  sites  and  services  are  examples  of  disruptive  technologies.  According  to  Miguel  Guhlin   2006e ,  “Social  networking  tools  like MySpace  or Facebook and Bebo  and YouTube grant freedom of speech and  assembly to the masses in a way that the American Revolution never could. For  this reason, disruptive technologies are the greatest threat to the powerful who  have  traditionally  controlled  the  means  of  publication … and  that  includes  our  schools”  n.p. .  If you care about the future of teaching and learning, this book is for you. We  hope that classroom teachers will find the possibilities exciting and the examples   web 2.0     new tools, new schools    NEWTOO CH1.indd   5  3 2 09   2:34:54 PM   introduction  inspiring. We hope that technology directors and coordinators will find that the  explanations can help them persuade their colleagues. We hope that administra- tors will see how important these new tools are in educating students for their  future rather than for our past. We hope that teacher educators will mine the ideas  to help their students prepare. And we hope that policymakers will understand  that there are solutions that will keep the education system working as well for  future generations as it has for previous ones.  We believe that new solutions can improve education and prepare students for the  future. Technology now provides the means to do many things that will make a  real difference. Web 2.0 involves us all.  Let’s take a look at where we are in the process.    web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH1.indd   6  3 2 09   2:34:55 PM   E E    1  new world,   new web, new skills  T hink back to when you were in school;   consider  how  different  everything  was  then.  There  was  a  simpler,  clearly  defined path to the future, or so it seems in  retrospect. While that may or may not have  been  true  for  all  of  us  back  then,  no  one  today  would  view  the  world  or  the  path  to  the future as being simple.   E E E E E  web 2.0     new tools, new schools    NEWTOO CH1.indd   7  3 2 09   2:34:57 PM   C h a p t e r     new world, new web, new skills  new world  We live in a wired, globalized world in which communication and collaboration  are possible 24 7. Corporations have become multinational and their workers can  be anyplace and work at any time. Fast connections and standardized software  link  these  corporations  with  workers  wherever  they  are,  and  some  members  of  this  workforce  live  in  parts  of  the  world  where  salaries  are  low  and  benefits  are  unheard  of.  Technology  is  the  driving  force  that  created  this  environment.  Technology makes people in remote locations viable employees who are eager to  have the jobs.  Companies  use  technology  to  become  lean  and  efficient.  They  can  track  their  goods and services from point of origin to delivery and at every step along the way.  They know what they need at any moment and can make adjustments to the supply  flow in real time using technology from a  distance.  They  trim  expenses,  including  worker costs. When workers in Asia are as  well  educated  as  Western  graduates,  are  just as well versed in using new tools, and  require  significantly  smaller  salaries,  it  is  clear where the jobs will go.  information   The Web is changing too. It has morphed  from  static  HTML  pages  where  readers  could  find  and  copy  to  interactive  services,  where  visitors  can  create and post information. The transition  from  using  desktop-based  applications  to  new  online  tools  means  that  we  can  work  differently.  We  no  longer  just  find  and  use  information;  the  Web  is  now  a  participatory,  interactive  place  where  we  create information collaboratively and share the results. Everyone can participate  thanks  to  social  networking  and  collaborative  tools  and  the  abundance  of  Web  sites  that  allow  us  to  post  journals,  photos,  movies,  and  more.  The  Web  is  no  longer a one-way street where someone controls the content. Anyone can control  content in a Web 2.0 world.  So  what  does  this  mean  for  teaching  and  learning?  As  educational  leaders,  we  should understand changes in the Web and how they reflect changes in the world   By the early 2000s, the  notion of interactivity  went from linking and  clicking to creating and  sharing. Now individuals  not only find and read  information but also  create and share their  own in real time. It is a  new Web, known as   Web 2.0.    web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH1.indd   8  3 2 09   2:34:57 PM   new world, new web, new skills  C h a p t e r     around us. We should provide these new tools to our students so that they are  prepared for new challenges.  Young people in the developed parts of the globe are very aware of the new tools  at their disposal and many of them spend hours online using these tools. Because  these  new  technologies  and  new  capabilities  engage  and  motivate  students,  we  can  use  them  to  educate.  If  you’re  reading  these  pages,  you’re  among  the  first  wave  of  people  who  will  move  schools  and  educational  technology  forward  by  harnessing these new tools and new models of learning. Of course, young people  may be ahead of us in using tools, but leaders like you will help them use the tools  in educationally appropriate ways.  economics 0  While we debate the purpose of education in America, we have to accept that in  part it is to ensure that citizens are ready to be intelligent employees. We may want  to think in terms of a well-rounded education for its own sake, but that education  has  to  include  a  focus  on  the  skills  and  abilities  that  students  will  need  if  the  next generation is to remain competitive in a changing world. New York Times  columnist and Pulitzer Prize–winning author Thomas Friedman says the world  is flat; the advantages the West used to have are disappearing; new dynamics are  changing economics and society, and the East is gaining ground. A convergence  of factors makes this a time of great change.  Friedman identifies three world “flatteners.” First are the new technologies and  the new processes made possible or enhanced by these technologies. Second are  new ways of working and a new playing field for doing business. Third is a whole  new  set  of  people  who  have  emerged  onto  the  playing  field  and  want  to  work.  Because they have access to new technologies, they can “plug and play” their way  into being competitive  Friedman, 2005 .  The  impact  on  businesses  is  clear.  According  to  BusinessWeek,  “Competition  keeps intensifying around the world. For one thing, after decades of rising power,  Asian companies are starting to run circles around American and European rivals  across a wide variety of industries”  Hof, 2006, pp. 80–81 .  For  many  companies,  being  competitive  means  spreading  jobs  throughout  the  world. For example, one out of every 10 jobs in the U.S. computer, software, and  information technology industry will move overseas in the next two years, and   web 2.0     new tools, new schools    NEWTOO CH1.indd   9  3 2 09   2:34:58 PM   C h a p t e r     new world, new web, new skills  one in four IT jobs will be sent offshore by 2010. The impact in dollars is as great  as on employment. Daniel Pink  2006  in A Whole New Mind says, “At least 3.3  million white collar jobs and $136 billion in wages will shift from the U.S. to low- cost countries like India, China and Russia by 2015”  p. 39 .  Competition takes place all over the globe. For example, Uruguay partners with  the Indian outsourcing company Tata. “When Tata’s Indian employees in Mumbai  are asleep, its 650 Uruguayan engineers and programmers now pick up the work  and help run the computers and backroom operations for the likes of American  Express, Procter & Gamble and some major U.S. banks—all from Montevideo”   Friedman, 2006, n.p. .  Soon “technology will literally transform every aspect of business, every aspect of  life, and every aspect of society.” The world is changing from a primarily vertical  “command  and  control”  universe  to  a  horizontal  “connect  and  collaborate”  one   Friedman, 2005, pp. 233–234 .  The Web is key in this transformation; the democratization of information and  technologies that is taking place online is a world-changing phenomenon. “These  digital,  mobile,  personal,  and  virtual  technologies;  file  changing  and  instant  messaging;  VoIP;  videoconferencing;  computer  graphics,  and  new  wireless  technologies  make  all  the  other  changes  happen  faster,  better,  and  smarter”   Friedman, 2005, p. 51 .  If  companies  in  the  developed  world  are  to  continue  to  excel  at  efficiency  and  innovation  and  survive  against  the  competition, employees must acquire new  skills such as having “ongoing relationships  rather than executing transactions, tackling novel challenges instead of solving  routine problems, and synthesizing the big picture rather than analyzing a single  component”  Pink, 2006, p. 40 .  In the future, how we  educate our children  may prove to be more  important than how  much we educate  them  Binder, cited in  Friedman, 2005, p. 302 .  Some people in the developed world will be left behind. Barbara Ehrenreich, whose  books show how hard life is for the millions of people in the U.S. with low-end  jobs and the problems of laid-off white-collar workers, “has started an organization  called  United  Professionals  to  help  white-collar  workers,  be  they  unemployed,  uninsured, downsized, stressed out or merely anxious”  Greenhouse, 2006, n.p. .   0  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH1.indd   10  3 2 09   2:34:59 PM   new world, new web, new skills  C h a p t e r     Education  at  U.S.  universities  has  traditionally  been  seen  as  valuable.  Many  students  who  want  to  reach  the  top  have  traveled  there  to  learn.  Friedman   2005  cites data from the Institute of International Education that shows in the  2004–2005  school  year,  80,466  of  the  foreign  students  enrolled  at  colleges  and  universities in the U.S. were from India, 62,523 were from China, and 53,358 were  from South Korea. Their enormous hunger to get ahead drives them to “outlearn  the competition”  p. 214 .   Now  these  countries  are  changing  their  precollegiate  education  systems  to  prepare the next generation. Starting in 2006 in Shanghai, according to Joseph  Kahn  2006  of The New York Times, China is refocusing history textbooks from  “wars,  dynasties  and  revolutions  to  economics,  technology,  social  customs  and  globalization”   n.p. .  One  author  of  the  new  textbooks  says  that  the  alterations  “reflect  a  sea  change  in  thinking  about  what students need to know.… The goal of  our work … is to make the study of history  more mainstream and prepare our students  for a new era”  n.p. .  for  K–12   The South Korean government is adopting  open-source  software  in  a  nationwide project to help create a national  computing infrastructure and bring their  national  education  system  into  the  21st  century  Mereness, 2006 .  It is important to ask:  Who will be prepared  for the new world?  Who will have the  technological and  thinking skills needed  for the 21st century?  And how can we help  them prepare?  “Eighteen  of  India’s  28  states  either  are  using  Linux  or  have  pilot  projects  for  its  use  in  various  government  departments  and schools”  Lakshman, 2006, p. 40 . Computer science classes based on Linux  software will be mandatory in some of the states’ high schools.   “It  is  clear  that  the  U.S.  and  other  rich  nations  will  have  to  transform  their  educational systems so as to produce workers for the jobs that will actually exist  in their societies. … In the future, how we educate our children may prove to be  more important than how much we educate them”  Binder, cited in Friedman,  2005, p. 302 .  Thus, it is important to ask: Who will be prepared for the new world? Who will  have the technological and thinking skills needed for the 21st century? And how  can we help them prepare?  web 2.0     new tools, new schools    NEWTOO CH1.indd   11  3 2 09   2:35:00 PM   C h a p t e r     new world, new web, new skills  Change  is  not  based  on  technology  alone.  For  example,  Japan  is  “remaking  its  vaunted  education  system  to  foster  greater  creativity,  artistry,  and  play.  The  Education  Ministry  has  been  pushing  students  to  reflect  on  the  meaning  and  mission of their lives, encouraging what it calls ‘education of the heart’”  Pink,  2006, p. 53 .  Intel’s World Ahead Program will help emerging nations to become competitive. It  will invest more than a billion dollars globally over the next five years, beginning in  the Amazon rain forest, where it installed networking infrastructure and computer  labs and has trained teachers. The project plans to extend wireless PC access to  millions of citizens in Latin America and train more than a million teachers about  the effective use of technology in the classroom. From there, project plans include  such installations in other isolated communities in Africa, Asia, and the Middle  East  Davis, 2006 .  The United States recognizes the need to improve education. In the fall of 2006,  the Business Roundtable urged Congress to pass legislation that promotes U.S.  competitiveness  and  helps  maintain  the  United  States’  science  and  technology  leadership.  Among  its  suggestions  were  to  strengthen  K–12  math  and  science  education  and  expand  undergraduate  and  graduate  science  and  engineering  programs.  Universal access to broadband is very important. South Korea leads all countries  with 83% broadband penetration, followed by Hong Kong with 80.98%, Iceland at  74%, Israel at 69.08%, and Taiwan at 64.65%. The U.S. is in 20th place at 44.45%   WebSiteOptimization.com, 2006 .  At the home and school levels, students have to take advantage of the new tools  available on the Web, and teachers have to guide them with new ways of learning.  Let’s take a step back to see how we arrived at this technological crossroads.  new web  What we know today as the Internet  and the visual component of the World Wide  Web  evolved from military to academic to commercial interests. In the 1970s, the  U.S. Department of Defense wanted a secure communications system that could  survive  disasters.  In  the  1980s,  the  National  Science  Foundation   NSF   funded  a network so that scientists at major universities could communicate and share  research. In 1990, NSF announced a plan for privatization.    web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH1.indd   12  3 2 09   2:35:00 PM   new world, new web, new skills  C h a p t e r     Browser  software  and  commercialization  changed  the  text-based  Internet  into  the graphical World Wide Web that has become so familiar. People with access  could create pages and show relationships among items; they could lead readers  to  follow  their  links.  By  the  early  2000s,  the  notion  of  interactivity  went  from  linking and clicking to creating and sharing. Now individuals not only find and  read information but also create and share their own in real time. It is a new Web,  known as Web 2.0.  Web 2.0 is an invented term, coined in 2004.  See appendix A, Web Timeline.  It  encompasses the growing collection of new and emerging Web-based tools. Many  are similar in function to desktop applications, with people using their browsers  for access rather than installing the software on computers. Many tools are free  and  available  to  all,  a  change  from  applications  that  are  purchased  or  licensed  annually.  Others  are  social  in  nature  and  promote  self-expression,  such  as  the  community networks, blogs, wikis, and photo and video sharing sites.  As part of the open-source movement, programmers freely provide their source  code for the sheer enjoyment of seeing their creation used. Others often add to it,  improve it, and customize it. Much of this programming is built on Ajax, which  stands  for  Asynchronous  JavaScript  and  XML.  Unlike  traditional  sharing  on  mainframe computers, today’s programmers can work from any location. No one  is tied to a specific workplace anymore.  Intellectually, Web 2.0 signals a transition from isolation to interconnectedness— not  just  for  programmers  but,  more  important,  for  end  users.  The  tools  allow  multiple  users  to  participate:  editing,  commenting,  and  polishing  a  document  collaboratively rather than working alone. In some ways, both the software and  the  products  created  with  it  can  be  considered  works  in  progress,  available  for  anyone  to  contribute  to,  ad  infinitum.  Imagine  a  book  that  the  author  updates  monthly, that others add to, edit, and correct, and that readers routinely receive a  new version of each time changes occur.  Wired magazine writer Kevin Kelly  2005  sees the Web 2.0 era as one in which:  People have come to realize that it’s not the software that enables the  Web that matters so much as the services that are delivered over the  Web. … The net has replaced the PC as the platform that matters, just  as the PC replaced the mainframe and minicomputer … and the key  to success in this stage of the Web’s evolution is leveraging collective  intelligence.  n.p.   web 2.0     new tools, new schools    NEWTOO CH1.indd   13  3 2 09   2:35:01 PM   C h a p t e r     new world, new web, new skills  These tools are effective for business success as well as for personal enjoyment.  Let’s  take  a  brief  look  at  some  of  the  tools  and  then  see  how  they’ve  become  effective for forward-looking businesses that are tapping into the technologies and  strategies to succeed.  The new Web is open and democratic. There are no gatekeepers; most content is  available without charge, and anyone may add to its volume of knowledge. The best  example is Wikipedia. Developed by Jimmy Wales, Wikipedia is a collaborative  encyclopedia that includes more entries on more subjects than the Encyclopedia  Britannica  with about as good an accuracy rate , and the entries are created and  updated by more people than you can imagine.  The United States has become a nation of bloggers, expressing ourselves as never  before. According to a 2006 Pew Internet & American Life Project national phone  survey, almost 40% of the approximately 147 million adult Internet users in the  U.S. say they read blogs. Eight percent write blogs too. “The majority of bloggers  cite an interest in sharing stories and expressing creativity. Just half say they are  trying to influence the way other people think”  Pew Internet & American Life  Project, 2006, p. iii . Table 1.1 shows the results of the survey.    Bloggers often have an effect on their readers. They often write about their lives,  and  their  personal  stories  are  compelling  and  bring  return  visitors.  However,  bloggers  also  discuss  politics,  media,  government,  and  technology  and  some  have  distinguished  themselves  as  a  force  for  honesty  and  political  action.  Malcolm Gladwell  2002  in his analysis of change, The Tipping Point, identifies  “connectors,” people who spread the word as they see it to others. That message  spreads “virally” through readership and syndication. Bloggers are connectors.  During the 2004 American presidential campaign, bloggers took on fund-raising as  well as consciousness-raising roles for the Democratic primary-election candidate  Howard Dean. Later, in the general election campaign, bloggers questioned the  authenticity  of  documents  offered  by  CBS  News  anchor  Dan  Rather,  causing  embarrassment for both that network and for Democratic presidential nominee  John Kerry. In August 2006, bloggers “outed” a Lebanese photographer working  for Reuters whose doctored photographs made events seem worse than they really  were.    web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH1.indd   14  3 2 09   2:35:02 PM   new world, new web, new skills  C h a p t e r     Table 1.1    Blogger surveY results  the reason you personally blog   Major reason   Minor reason   not a reason   To express yourself creatively   To document your personal experiences   or share them with others   To stay in touch with friends and family   To share practical knowledge or skills   with others   To motivate other people to action   To entertain people   To store resources or information that is  important to you   To influence the way other people think   To network or to meet new people   To make money   52%   50%   37%   34%  29%  28%   28%   27%   16%   7%   25%   26%   22%   30%   32%   33%  21%   24%   34%   8%   23%   24%   40%  35%   38%   39%   52%   49%   50%   85%   E Source: Pew Internet & American Life Project Blogger Callback Survey, July 2005–February 2006.

Bloggers  are  quick  to  state  their  likes  and  dislikes  about  products  and  services  too,  and  companies  are  watching  consumer-written  product  reviews  carefully.  According  to  a  report  from  Jupiter  Research,  “The  growing  phenomenon  of  consumer-generated content has become disruptive to online businesses, but many  are studying the reviews and finding ways to use the content to their advantage.  The research found 77 percent of online shoppers read consumer product reviews  and ratings and are increasingly loyal to the stores that feature product feedback”   Sullivan, 2006, n.p. . This is a force to be reckoned with.   On the new Web, people can select from among a seemingly endless supply of  content that addresses their needs instead of having information or entertainment  delivered  that  someone  else  has  picked  for  them.  They  can  search  for  content  online,  read  it,  analyze  it  to  decide  what’s  important,  interact  with  the  author,   web 2.0     new tools, new schools    NEWTOO CH1.indd   15  3 2 09   2:35:03 PM   C h a p t e r     new world, new web, new skills  and post the resulting knowledge. The work they post online could have as much  impact as the work of any known author or expert on the topic, and the potential  audience  may  be  large  and  international.  This  is  power  that  was  unheard  of  before.  Given that the Web is democratic, and because Web 2.0 tools are free and available  to anyone with a browser and Internet connection, everyone can have access to the  sophisticated tools they need for almost any task. Because the tools themselves  are adaptable, the programmers among us will rework and refine them and offer  newer and even more improved models.  As  broadband  becomes  cheaper  and  local  communities  set  up  wireless  access  from parks and other gathering places, everyone with a laptop will have access to  the same sophisticated tools that professionals use. A browser is the only software  needed.  new corporations  Businesses are adjusting to new realities.  For  all  its  appeal  to  the  young  and  the  wired,  Web  2.0  may  end  up  having  its  greatest impact on business. And that could usher in more changes in corporations,  already  in  the  throes  of  such  tech-driven  transformations  as  globalization  and  outsourcing. Indeed, “what some are calling Enterprise 2.0 could flatten a raft of  organizational boundaries—between managers and employees and between the  company and its partners and customers”  Hof, 2006, n.p. .  Nimble  corporations  use  technology  and  Web-traffic  information  to  track  customers and commodities, but there are even greater advantages from Web 2.0  tools and services. Some companies use wikis, or group-editable Web pages, for  collaboration. Others use them instead of e-mail to create meeting agendas and  post training videos. Some corporate executives even post on their own blogs to  communicate directly with customers.  Some  firms  are  using  social-networking  services.  According  to  Rachael  King   2006  of BusinessWeek:  Recruiters  at  Microsoft  and  Starbucks,  for  instance,  troll  online  networks  such  as  LinkedIn  for  potential  job  candidates.  Goldman  Sachs and Deloitte run their own online alumni networks for hiring     web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH1.indd   16  3 2 09   2:35:04 PM   new world, new web, new skills  C h a p t e r     back  former  workers  and  strengthening  bonds  with  alumni-cum- possible clients. And companies such as Intuit and MINI USA have  created customer networks to build brand loyalty.  n.p.   Social network mapping helps business leaders to understand and harness the  dynamics of their own workplace. “Managers are mapping informal collaborative  relationships  that  foster  creativity.  Accenture  created  a  graphic  Web  of  social  networks  within  client  companies  to  analyze  management.  Seimans  made  a  social  network  chart  to  show  how  its  global  software  development  team  would  work”  Jana, 2006, p. 4 .  New  tools  are  also  being  used  to  solve  technology  problems.  For  example,  “companies struggle to overcome problems with current online communications,  whether it’s e-mail spam or the costs of maintaining company intranets that few  employees use. So they’re now starting to experiment with collaborative services,  such as wikis”  Hof, 2006, n.p. .  As businesses and employees adopt new practices, their expectations for the next  generation of employees will evolve into an assumption about technology skills  and collaboration and communication skills that the new Web tools embody. Will  our students be ready?  st-century skills  As  society  and  the  world  of  work  change,  the  skills  that  students  need  to  live  and thrive in it also change. The competition will be fierce and can come from  anywhere in this flat world. In some ways, students today are ahead of their elders.  Technology is second nature to them and they accept and use it without question.  Schools lag behind.  The Partnership for 21st Century Skills  2004 , a group that represents business  and education in the United States, makes the case:  E  Education is changing. We can no longer claim that the U.S. educational  results are unparalleled. Students around the world outperform American  students on assessments that measure 21st-century skills. Today’s teachers  need better tools to address this growing problem.  web 2.0     new tools, new schools    NEWTOO CH1.indd   17  3 2 09   2:35:05 PM   C h a p t e r     new world, new web, new skills  E  Competition  is  changing  internationally.  Innovation  and  creativity  no  longer  set  U.S.  education  apart.  Innovators  around  the  world  rival  Americans in breakthroughs that fuel economic competitiveness.  E  The workplace, jobs, and skill demands are changing. Today, every student,  whether he she plans to go directly into the workforce or on to a 4-year  college or trade school, requires 21st-century skills to succeed. We need  to ensure that all students are qualified to succeed in work and life in this  new global economy.  p. 1   Using collaboration  and communication  tools with educational  methods that also  promote these skills— such as project-based  learning—will help  students acquire the  abilities they need for  the future.  The  Partnership  for  21st  Century  Skills   2006  also points out that:   E  Standards  that  reflect  content  mastery  alone  do  not  enable  accountability  and  measurement of 21st-century skills.  E  An  expanded  approach  to  assessment,  involving  measurements  that  assess  21st-century  skills,  is  necessary  to  ensure accountability of schools in the  21st century.  E  Students  cannot  master  21st-century  skills  unless  their  teachers  are  well  trained  and  supported  in  this  type  of  instruction.  E  Information and communications technology  ICT  literacy is the ability   to use technology to develop 21st-century content, knowledge, and skills.  E  Twenty-first century content areas like global awareness, financial literacy,  civic  literacy,  and  health  awareness  are  critical  to  student  success  in  communities and workplaces, and these should be taught.  E  Targeted,  sustained  investment  in  research  and  development  initiatives  is  required  to  promote  21st-century  skills  and  craft  teaching  practices  and assessment approaches that more closely convey and measure what  students need to excel in the 21st century.  n.p.

The Partnership’s 2004 report Learning for the 21st Century identifies six key  elements of 21st-century learning: “emphasize core subjects; emphasize learning  skills; use 21st-century tools to develop learning skills; teach and learn in a 21st- century  context;  teach  and  learn  21st-century  content,  and  use  21st-century  assessments that measure 21st-century skills”  p. 6 .  Further, it reports, “Today’s education system faces irrelevance unless we bridge  the gap between how students live and how they learn”  p. 5 . They live with Web  2.0 tools, but schools must help them use the tools to acquire new skills, not just  play  with  them.  Even  more,  today’s  education  system  faces  irrelevance  unless  we  bridge  the  gap  between  how  well  American  students  achieve  and  how  well  students in the rest of the world are doing.  web 2.0     new tools, new schools    NEWTOO CH1.indd   19  3 2 09   2:35:06 PM   C h a p t e r     new world, new web, new skills  The role of teachers will be to guide students in using the new tools for academically  rigorous investigations and presentations. Which tools students choose to create  with won’t matter. Teachers will be able to let students with specific learning styles  use the tools that address their particular needs. Students will be able to create a  serious paper or video of robust content, great sophistication, and real depth.  Using  collaboration  and  communication  tools  with  educational  methods  that  also  promote  these  skills—such  as  project-based  learning—will  help  students  acquire the abilities they need for the future. They will also require access to a  new  generation  of  online  educational  software  that  can  help  them  acquire  and  maintain needed skills. Providing access to the tools is essential.  Some U.S. federal policymakers agree. Alan Greenspan  2004 , former chairman  of  the  Federal  Reserve  System,  says,  “We  need  to  be  forward  looking  in  order  to  adapt  our  educational  system  to  the  evolving  needs  of  the  economy  and  the  realities of our changing society. Those efforts will require the collaboration of  policymakers,  education  experts,  and— importantly—our  citizens.  It  is  an  effort  that should not be postponed”  n.p. .  To be literate today  involves acquiring new  skills, including those  of using technology,  understanding  science, having global  awareness, and most  important, having the  ability to keep learning.  However,  action  must  follow  rhetoric.  Countries  have  to  do  more  than  test  students on basic skills. China is revising  textbooks  and  South  Korea  is  developing  a  technology  infrastructure.  If  education  doesn’t  help  today’s  students  learn  the  skills  they  need,  major  advances  will  happen elsewhere.  We used to talk about reading, writing, and  arithmetic as the essential skills for literacy.  To be literate today involves acquiring new  skills, including those of using technology, understanding science, having global  awareness, and most important, having the ability to keep learning, which involves  gathering,  processing,  analyzing,  synthesizing,  and  presenting  information  as  well as communicating and collaborating. Free, online tools can play a large role  in helping students acquire these skills.  Businesses today focus on communicating, collaborating, and optimizing their  use  of  data.  According  to  David  Wallen,  business  development  director  for  the  DataLan Corporation, “Collaboration is the key to successful innovation”  personal   0  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH1.indd   20  3 2 09   2:35:07 PM   new world, new web, new skills  C h a p t e r     communication, 2006 .

This will happen because the tools promote  creativity,  collaboration,  and  communication,  and  they  dovetail  with  learning  methods in which these skills play a part. For example, when students collaborate  on a project and present what they’ve learned, they’ve honed their thinking and  organizational skills. New tools enable that possibility.  The old way of doing things is presentation-driven; information is delivered and  tested.  This  approach  prepares  students  for  jobs  that  require  simply  following  directions and rote skills. The new way is collaborative, with information shared,  discussed,  refined  with  others,  and  understood  deeply.  It  prepares  students  to  become part of a nimble workforce that makes decisions and keeps learning as  the  workplace  changes.  What  makes  the  difference  is  preparing  students  with  21st-century skills using a flexible approach rather than teaching just what will  be tested.  Indeed,  the  U.S.  2005  National  Educational  Technology  Plan  began,  “Over  the  next  decade,  the  United  States  will  face  ever  increasing  competition  in  the  global economy.… It is the responsibility of this nation’s educational enterprise— including  policymakers—to  help  secure  our  economic  future  by  ensuring  that  our young people are adequately prepared to meet these challenges.” Among the  action steps it suggested are encouraging broadband access and moving toward  digital content  U.S. Department of Education, 2005, n.p. .  the tipping point  The Tipping Point author Malcolm Gladwell  2002  thinks of change as epidemics  in which “ideas and products and messages and behaviors spread just like viruses  do”  p. 7 . The tipping point is “the moment within an epidemic when everything  can change”  p. 191 .  web 2.0     new tools, new schools    NEWTOO CH1.indd   21  3 2 09   2:35:08 PM   C h a p t e r     new world, new web, new skills  At what point will new tools and new methods catch on enough in schools to reach  the  tipping  point?  What  forces  are  pushing  school  change?  From  this  vantage  point,  it  looks  like  the  confluence  of  having  new  tools   both  pedagogical  and  technological , the future economic need, the access to bandwidth, and tech-savvy  students are driving change.  As educators, we can’t sit on the sidelines watching it happen. We have to recognize  that  students’  use  of  technology  is  stronger  and  work  from  our  own  strength,  which is pedagogy. This means that we harness the technology and use it to help  students  learn  thinking  and  analytical  skills.  They  may  know  the  tools  better,  but we have to help them use them wisely. As Jeff Utecht, a teacher in Shanghai,  says, “If we want to engage students in learning, we need to first understand their  world. This world is without borders, boundaries, and is limited only by the speed  of one’s Internet access”  personal communication, 2006 .  What will make change happen? Gladwell  2002  identifies three factors necessary  for  change  to  occur:  exceptional  people  who  drive  change  by  their  own  habits,  stickiness or memorable qualities of the ideas that move others to act, and the  power  of  context,  which  includes  the  skillful  use  of  groups  and  the  power  of  communities. Educators are agents of change.  They  include  people  such  as  David  Warlick,  who  speaks  out  on  these  issues  and creates new tools for education; Miguel Guhlin, who creates change within  a school district and generates blogs, podcasts, and articles to spread the word;  Tim Lauer, who as a school principal uses and encourages new technologies for  everyday practices for his staff, students, and parents; and David Jakes, who as a  school district technology coordinator, presents workshops that use the tools, not  as an end in themselves but so that teachers, and thus their students, will learn  the power of communicating.  David  Jakes   2006c ,  in  a  conference  keynote  presentation,  described  the  “characteristics of school culture that are required for an innovation to become  seamless and transparent”  n.p. . In other words, to become “sticky.” Here are his  thoughts:  mAkINg IT STIck  .  There must be a high degree of organizational readiness for the innovation.  .  The innovation must have multiple entry points for a spectrum of usership;   each of these entry points must support effective use by teachers and  students.    web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH1.indd   22  3 2 09   2:35:09 PM   new world, new web, new skills  C h a p t e r     .  The innovation must clearly address an instructional need, with benefits for   both teacher and student.  .  The innovation must add value to an instructional process.  .  There must be visible and tangible results indicating that the innovation   improves student learning.  .  The technology has been taken out of the technology or innovation.  .  The teacher has become a confident, active, and visible user; use becomes   seamless and transparent.  n.p.   new tools and learning  One  exciting  aspect  of  Web  2.0  tools  is  that  they  are  free  programs  that  could  replace the traditional application suites for which schools ordinarily must pay.  Some  perform  the  familiar  functions,  such  as  word  processors,  spreadsheets,  and presentation tools. While they may not have every single feature of Microsoft  Word, Excel, or PowerPoint, there is an advantage to having software that is Web- based: people at different computers can use the software to collaborate on a single  document or on sets of documents at the same time.  Web 2.0 is an ever-growing array of tools that people use to aggregate and interact  with  information  in  ways  that  are  useful  to  them.  Figure  1.1  shows  several  distinctions between the old and new ways of doing things, dubbed as Web 1.0  and Web 2.0.

The results showed that more than 60% said yes, with people  interested in the potential cost savings and believing that the free tools’ features  would eventually surpass those of offline tools. Nearly 20% of respondents said  that getting everyone online to use the tools would pose a technical problem and  8% worried about security issues  techLEARNING.com, 2006 .   One participant commented, “I think it is the wave of the future. We have to change  our mindset and learn how to deal with the technical issues. When enough people  are brave enough to use it, it will become the norm”  n.p. . While independent  programmers write most Web 2.0 tools and make them freely accessible, some of  the results are so successful that companies such as Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft  are  creating,  acquiring,  and  offering  them  as  part  of  their  collections  of  free  products.  taking advantage of new tools  We can take advantage of the features that new tools offer and tap into students’  natural affinity for these tools in order to create learning experiences that expand  their  worldview  and  enhance  what  they  learn.  Specifically,  the  features  are  interconnectedness, immediacy, interactivity, communications, and community.  These are the very features that keep global businesses competitive and workers  in jobs.  Students can learn because of these features. Ideas and concepts on the Web are  connected to one another through hyperlinks. Using these links, students can dig  deeper to find information that stretches their ability to reason and analyze. They  can  interact  with  information  online  and  connect  instantly  to  relevant  content  that is also engaging and malleable. Students can collaborate on projects, consult  experts, and share their data with the world. Most of all, they can build on others’  learning by reading other students’ posted work as a starting point for their own  research and link back to it. The process fulfills the concept of leveraging collective  intelligence in a community-building environment.  Only by learning this way and using these tools, will students be competitive for  21st-century jobs.    web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH1.indd   24  3 2 09   2:35:10 PM   E E    2  students and learning  W hile  using  the  Web  has  changed  the   world  and  the  workplace  of  the  21st  century, nowhere has it had a greater effect  than  on  the  lives  of  young  people.  They  play video games, communicate using text  messaging and instant messaging, conduct  Internet  searches,  download  music  and  share  files   legally,  we  hope ,  and  use  the  Web for homework. These technologies have  always been available to them. Their parents  and teachers and the rest of us who weren’t  born into a technologically interactive world  have to struggle to keep up.

He calls students digital natives, people  who live in a world where technology is omnipresent. He calls their parents and  teachers  and us  digital immigrants, well-meaning adults who have to work at  being comfortable with technology.  According to Prensky  2001 , today’s students:  E  Are no longer the people our educational system was designed to   teach  E  Have not just changed incrementally from those of the past … our   students have changed radically  E  Represent  the  first  generations  to  grow  up  with  this  new   technology  their predecessors  E  Think  and  process  information  fundamentally  differently  from   E  Are  all  “native  speakers”  of  the  digital  language  of  computers,   video games, and the Internet  p. 1   Of course, many adults  including tech coordinators and many teachers  are just  as comfortable with technology as the most advanced teen. And, unfortunately,  many students cannot afford 24 7 access to technology and thus cannot be facile.  However, the definitions are useful for understanding that today’s students are  likely to be a wired generation and that today’s teachers and parents are likely to  need a little help from their young friends.  21st-century students  How  wired  are  students?

By Grade 12, almost 50% of students reported  personal Web site use on a weekly basis and 79% play video games. In Grades  6–12,  54%  of  students  go  online  for  news,  sports,  weather,  and  entertainment  updates; 51% use graphic, design, photo, video editing, or music editing software;  47% conduct personal research; and 43% shop.   What does this tell us about students? NetDay’s findings indicate that:  E  Students are setting trends with their use of technology both in  school and out of school. They are innovative users of technology,  adopting  new  technologies  to  support  their  learning  and  their  lifestyles.  E  Communication is a key motivator for students and drives their  use  of  technology  for  learning  and  for  personal  use.  The  result  is  an  explosion  of  communications  tool  use  and  the  desire  to  transcend communications obstacles.  E  Students are strong believers in the power of technology to enrich  their  learning  experiences.  They  have  ideas  about  their  futures  that  include  using  technology  tools  for  learning  and  preparing  themselves  for  a  competitive  job  market.   Project  Tomorrow,  2006, p. 6   Technology  affects  how  students  live  and  communicate  and  when,  where,  and  how they learn. They assume technology is there to help them. More and more  students  have  access  to  technology  from  home.  Data  from  the  Corporation  for  Public Broadcasting  CPB; 2003  indicate that by 2002, 83% of family households  in America reported computer ownership, a growth of 30% from 2000. By 2006,  another  study  found  that  almost  70%  of  households  in  America  subscribed  to  an online service and 60% of them had high-speed access  Leichtman Research  Group, 2006 .  Having  digital  technology  at  their  fingertips  all  the  time  means  that  students  think,  work,  and  play  differently  from  previous  generations.  Young  people  are  ahead of the curve in using new Web tools and services, and social networking  is causing concern. The upside is that the Internet helps people to connect with  others who have similar interests whom they might not encounter in traditional  ways. They can reach across vast distances to communicate and share.  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  27  NEWTOO CH2.indd   27  3 2 09   2:37:40 PM   C h a p t e r   2  students and learning  MySpace, for example, is popular with teens. Youngsters post their biographies,  exploits, photos, and more and link to a network of “friends.” It’s the place to be  for teenagers to meet friends, brag, and just hang out. It has replaced the mall as  the after-school haven for teens. It didn’t exist three years before, but it celebrated  its 100 millionth registered user on August 8, 2006. It is the most trafficked site  and was acquired in 2006 by NewsCorp.  Of course there’s a real downside. While social networking allows users to create  an online persona, some people are eager to embellish the truth. The more hip  the page, the more attention the page’s author receives. Other young people accept  what is written at face value. Teenagers often think that they can post outrageous  information  and  photos  about  themselves  without  any  consequences.  Lately  that has backfired with colleges and even prospective employers sifting through  postings  to  determine  a  candidate’s  character.  This  out-of-control  behavior  has  also raised the hackles of parents and educators. Schools block access and parents  are starting to do so too.  Businesses  are  aware  of  the  change  in  young  people’s  habits  and  now  spend  substantial dollars in advertising online. “With children spending much of their  time  online,  marketers  are  experimenting  with  new  techniques,”  says  Brian  Steinberg  2006, n.p. , writing for The Wall Street Journal Online. OfficeMax,  for example, produced a reality-show–type video that includes plugs for products.  “Kids in middle school and high school tend to buy things differently,” says Bob  Thacker, OfficeMax’s senior vice president of marketing. “These kids are online.  They live online”  Steinberg, 2006, n.p. .   Today’s students become technology-savvy early as toymakers target younger and  younger children. VTech Holdings, a consumer-focused technology company, has  adapted its V.Smile educational video games to reach children as young as nine  months. The console was configured so that toddlers can learn vocabulary, motor  skills, and even baby sign language. MGA Entertainment offers a virtual-reality  gadget with animated digital characters that chat with kids on a BlackBerry-size  handheld device and a Web site  Binkley, 2006; Palmeri, 2006 .  According to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting  2003 , “Preschool children  are one of the fastest growing groups to be online. Only 6 percent of children ages  2–5 used the Internet from any location in 2000; two years later, parents reported  that 35 percent of the same age group now went online from some location—the  largest increase of any age or demographic group”  n.p. .  28  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH2.indd   28  3 2 09   2:37:41 PM   students and learning  C h a p t e r   2  It  is  clear  that  youngsters  and  adults  spend  time  in  different  places  and  use  different  tools.

For example, sixth grade  is  the  tipping  point  when  students  begin  to  show  their  enthusiasm  for  using  technology for communication. In middle schools, 50% of sixth graders say they  use e-mail or instant messaging on a daily basis. It is interesting to note that only  for  desktop  and  laptop  computer  use  do  teachers  employ  a  technology  product  more than students do; on all other items, students are using the technology more  than teachers.

Watch  the  interaction  among  groups  of  seventh-grade girls to understand.  Older technologies such as television weren’t  social; individuals watched passively even if they would talk about what they had  seen.  Today’s  technologies  are  interactive.  Students  go  online  to  meet  friends,  seek information, and find out what they need to know. These are social activities  and involve instant messaging, e-mails, blogs, and social-networking Web sites.  Young people’s personal networks of friends are always available. Youngsters are  part  of  a  group  even  when  alone  in  their  bedrooms.  They  interact,  get  advice,  form opinions, plan events, and gather with friends. As their interests vary, their  groups vary, and so they may be part of several networks at one time.  School-age youngsters use the Web to do homework and school projects—from  home.  According  to  a  study  commissioned  by  the  Pew  Internet  &  American  Life  Project   Levin  &  Arafeh,  2002 ,  “For  the  most  part,  students’  educational  use  of  the  Web  occurs  outside  of  the  school  day.”  Unfortunately,  “Many  schools  and  teachers  have  not  yet  recognized—much  less responded to—the new ways students  communicate and access information over  the Internet”  p. iii .  The  Corporation  for  Public  Broadcasting   2003   found  that  “In  households  with  broadband  connections,  children  ages  6– 17 reported that high-speed access affected  both  their  online  and  offline  activities,  including schoolwork. According to these children, since getting broadband, 66  percent spend more time online; 36 percent watch less television, and 23 percent  get better grades”  n.p. . Many parents report grade increases as well.  Students do not even have to scramble to find information; now it comes to them.  Using  aggregators   software  that  checks  for  new  content  at  user-determined  locations  and  retrieves  updates   and  syndication   which  makes  part  of  a  Web  site available to other sites or to subscribers  they can receive automated updates  about any information they want.

For  example,  if  they  start  a   Students come to  school knowledgeable  about the Web and  its potential, are  comfortable using it,  and expect learning in  school to be more like  learning on their own.  30  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH2.indd   30  3 2 09   2:37:42 PM   students and learning  C h a p t e r   2  research project by looking up the topic at Wikipedia, they’ll find dozens of links  to other sites with more information on that topic that they can follow—and when  they get there, they’ll find even more links.  Today, advice is always available online. Adults make decisions about purchases  by going to the Web and researching not only traditional reviewers’ opinions but  also by visiting sites that contain users’ reviews. Online companies are themselves  presenting  suggestions  about  their  own  products  based  on  what  others  have  bought.  Web  sites  such  as  Amazon.com  use  sophisticated  software  to  figure  out purchasing patterns and then use that information to make suggestions for  additional purchases.  For  example,  by  using  word  pattern  analyses,  Amazon  can  suggest  additional  books  a  reader  might  like,  informing  you  that  “People  who  bought  this  book  also bought … ” or offer a related book as a set with the one you want—at a slight  discount for purchasing both. In addition, Amazon displays the opinions of other  readers as reviews and as lists of related books.  This means that students come to school knowledgeable about the Web and its  potential, are comfortable using it, and expect learning in school to be more like  learning on their own. “Large numbers of students say they are changing because  of their out-of-school use of the Internet—and their reliance on it. Internet-savvy  students  are  coming  to  school  with  different  expectations,  different  skills,  and  access to different resources”  Levin & Arafeh, 2002, p. v .  With  E-Rate  funding  and  local  support,  more  students  are  going  online  from  school as well as from home. By 2002, key findings from a U.S. Department of  Education survey showed that 99% of U.S. public schools already had access to  the Internet, 88–96% had classroom access, and 94% of schools had broadband  connections  National Center for Education Statistics [NCES], 2003 .  what students want   from their schools  Today’s students know that they are tech-savvy and report that their schools are  not. Schools are still more text-dominated and do not integrate technology into  student  learning  effectively.  A  2005  report,  “Listening  to  Student  Voices  on  Technology:  Today’s  Tech-Savvy  Students  Are  Stuck  in  Text-Dominated  Schools”,  reviews  articles  and  papers  on  student  attitudes,  perceptions,  and   web 2.0     new tools, new schools  31  NEWTOO CH2.indd   31  3 2 09   2:37:43 PM   C h a p t e r   2  students and learning  behaviors about using digital technology, particularly for learning. The summary  also highlights what students want adults who influence education policy decisions  to know about how they use technology and how schools could better meet their  needs  Farris-Berg, 2005 .

He gives an  example:  Derek walked into technology class like he does every “A” day on his  schedule. A quick “Hello Mr. U” and off to his computer. By the time  I greet the other students and we begin class, Derek has done the  following to his class computer:  1  Change the desktop background to another picture in the sample   picture folder. Why? Because the one that was there was not his.  2  Change the settings of the Windows menus to reflect his colors,   font, style. Why? He didn’t pick those colors.  3  Quickly  go  into  the  control  panel  and  change  the  cursor  to  a   twirling dinosaur. Why? He likes it that way.  4  Get the height of his chair just right, move the mouse and mouse   pad where it is comfortable for him.  n.p.   Utecht  2006  is asking the right questions:  How  do  we  take  this  customization  generation  and  apply  that  customization  in  the  classroom?  Allow  students  to  choose  their  method  of  presentation,  choose  where  they  go  to  find  their  information, and choose to learn in a way that meets their needs. Can  we have customized classrooms? Where each student has access and  uses the tools they need to learn. Where the teacher is customizable  giving each student just what he or she needs to succeed. How would  our  students  react  if  we  gave  them  the  control  to  customize  their  education?  n.p.   Outside of school, students are using the Web for homework as well as for fun,  and  to  a  great  extent  they  do  customize  what  and  how  to  learn.  The  desire  to  do this is not new, however; only the tools are. With these tools, students have  much more power to do as they wish. Schools may have a ways to go to match the  experience students have elsewhere, but the goal is to help students use and enjoy  technology in order to learn.  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  33  NEWTOO CH2.indd   33  3 2 09   2:37:44 PM   C h a p t e r   2  students and learning  access to online tools and services  In any discussion of new tools, it is clear that access to them must come first. In  the first national educational technology plan, issued in 1996 and titled Getting  America’s  Students  Ready  for  the  21st  Century,  access  was  defined  as  five  students per computer  U.S. Department of Education, 1996 .  If, as we saw in the previous chapter, access to online tools and services has changed  the way the world operates, then students’ needs have changed. If businesses have  harnessed blogs and wikis, for example, then students will be expected to use these  tools. For schools, this means implementing one-to-one computing programs so  that each student has access where and when he or she needs it.  A  2006  American  Digital  Schools  survey  of  the  top  2,500  U.S.  school  districts  found that 19.4% of all student devices today are mobile and that 52.1% will be  mobile  in  2011.  This  is  not  a  frill.  Where  results  were  tracked,  87%  of  schools  offering one-to-one computing reported substantial academic improvement, and  the districts and states that have one-to-one programs reported higher attendance  rates, fewer discipline problems, and improved student writing skills.  In  10  years  of  research  into  laptop  programs,  Saul  Rockman,  an  evaluator  of  educational technology projects, found that one of the most important benefits  of  a  laptop  program  is  an  increase  in  21st-century  skills.  Students  learned  independently,  collaborated  with  peers  to  accomplish  work,  and  communicated  the conclusions. Teachers were more likely to encourage student-led inquiry and  collaborative  work.  Test  score  results  improved.  “These  accomplishments  are  seen in many laptop programs, especially those that permit students to take their  computer home in the evening”  Rockman, 2003, p. 27 .   The  kind  of  learning  students  do  with  these  laptops  will  define  how  well  they  will perform the rest of their lives. Thomas Friedman points out the importance  of  teaching  greater  collaboration  skills,  creating  a  sustainable  community  of  learning, cultivating the entrepreneurial spirit in all, and encouraging synthesis  skills. “The ability to memorize is quickly fading in our information rich society  where  a  Google  search  can  return  millions  of  references.  Society  needs  more  synthesizers capable of filtering divergent sources into a coherent, relevant whole”   Friedman, 2006, n.p. .  School leaders have to think differently and promote teaching methods such as  those we discuss later in this chapter. According to Daniel Pink  2006 , today’s  students will need “a new set of aptitudes. They’ll need to do what workers abroad   34  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH2.indd   34  3 2 09   2:37:45 PM   students and learning  C h a p t e r   2  cannot do equally well for much less money: Forging relationships rather than  executing  transactions,  tackling  novel  challenges  instead  of  solving  routine  problems,  and  synthesizing  the  big  picture  rather  than  analyzing  a  single  component”  p. 40 .  To help students acquire these skills takes time and training as well as practice.  The first step is to understand how learning works.  understanding learning  Bloom’s  Taxonomy   Bloom,  1956   described  learning  in  six  cognitive  process  dimensions:  remembering,  understanding,  applying,  analyzing,  evaluating,  and creating. His taxonomy, however, was one-dimensional. A team of cognitive  psychologists  updated  the  taxonomy  in  2001  by  developing  a  two-dimensional  version to reflect relevance to 21st-century work  Anderson & Krathwohl, 2001 .  In this adaptation, the knowledge dimension represents the kind of knowledge  to be learned, and the cognitive process dimension identifies the process used to  learn. The knowledge dimension is composed of the following four levels:  1  Factual  knowledge  includes  an  elementary  knowledge  students  must  know to be acquainted with a discipline or to be able to solve problems in  it; for example, knowledge of terminology and knowledge of details and  elements.  2  Conceptual   declarative   knowledge  refers  to  an  understanding  of  the  interrelationships among the basic elements within a larger structure that  enable them to function together; for example, knowledge of classifications  and  categories,  principles  and  generalizations,  or  theories,  models,  and  structures.  3  Procedural  knowledge  is  an  understanding  of  how  to  do  something,  methods of inquiry, and criteria for using skills, algorithms, techniques,  and methods.  4  Meta-cognitive knowledge is the knowledge of cognition in general as well   as awareness and knowledge of one’s own cognition.  The differences between the traditional and newer versions of Bloom’s Taxonomy  are displayed in Figure 2.1. The distinctions indicate that new technology tools   web 2.0     new tools, new schools  35  NEWTOO CH2.indd   35  3 2 09   2:37:45 PM   C h a p t e r   2  students and learning  have the capacity to support higher order thinking and more engaged learning.  The revised taxonomy addresses the needs of today’s students  Krathwohl, 2002 .  Figure 2.1    Comparison of the revised taxonomy with Bloom’s traditional version  Eval.

Anderson  and  Krathwohl  2001  explain these terms as follows:  remembering. Retrieving, recognizing, and recalling relevant  knowledge from long-term memory.  Understanding.  Constructing  meaning  from  oral,  written,  and  graphic  messages  through  interpreting,  exemplifying,  classifying,  summarizing, inferring, comparing, and explaining.  applying. Carrying out or using a procedure through executing, or  implementing.  analyzing. Breaking material into constituent parts, determining how  the parts relate to one another and to an overall structure or purpose  through differentiating, organizing, and attributing.  36  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH2.indd   36  3 2 09   2:37:47 PM   students and learning  C h a p t e r   2  evaluating.  Making  judgments  based  on  criteria  and  standards  through checking and critiquing.  Creating. Putting elements together to form a coherent or functional  whole; reorganizing elements into a new pattern or structure through  generating, planning, or producing.  pp. 67–68   To  help  students  acquire  these  skills  and  become  synthesizers  means  not  just  providing access to technological tools but also employing the pedagogical tools  that  are  more  powerful  when  combined  with  technology.  When  pedagogies  and technologies are grounded in how students learn, schools provide the best  strategies.  To begin with, students learn in a variety of ways. They have different learning  styles  that  are  based  on  how  they  understand  and  process  information.  For  example,  there  are  visual  learners,  auditory  learners,  and  tactile kinesthetic  learners.  Technology  makes  it  possible  to  target  the  right  approaches  for  each  student in order to provide individualized and differentiated instruction.  We  turn  to  cognitive  science  to  understand  how  the  brain  functions  and  how  people learn. These scientific approaches have indicated that everyone learns, but  schools do not always understand how best to approach each student. According  to Renate and Geoffrey Caine  On Purpose Associates, 2001 , the following are the  core principles of brain-based learning:  1  The brain is a parallel processor, meaning it can perform several   activities at once, like tasting and smelling.  2  Learning engages the whole physiology.  3  The search for meaning is innate.  4  The search for meaning comes through patterning.  5  Emotions are critical to patterning.  6  The brain processes wholes and parts simultaneously.  7  Learning involves both focused attention and peripheral   perception.  8  Learning involves both conscious and unconscious processes.  9  We have two types of memory: spatial and rote.  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  37  NEWTOO CH2.indd   37  3 2 09   2:37:48 PM   C h a p t e r   2  students and learning  J  We understand best when facts are embedded in natural, spatial   memory.  K  Learning is enhanced by challenge and inhibited by threat.  L  Each brain is unique.  n.p.   Renate and Geoffrey Caine  On Purpose Associates, 2001  also indicate that three  interactive elements are essential to this process:  E  Teachers  must   learners   immerse   interactive  experiences that are both rich and real. One excellent example is  immersing students in a foreign culture to teach them a second  language. Educators must take advantage of the brain’s ability to  parallel process.  in  complex,   E  Students  must  have  a  personally  meaningful  challenge.  Such  challenges  stimulate  a  student’s  mind  to  the  desired  state  of  alertness.  E  In order for a student to gain insight about a problem, there must  be  intensive  analysis  of  the  different  ways  to  approach  it,  and  about  learning  in  general.  This  is  what’s  known  as  the  “active  processing of experience.”  n.p.   When we understand how students learn, we can use targeted teaching methods  to help them analyze, synthesize, and communicate information. Combined with  appropriate uses of technology, these methods will help students prepare for the  future. Examples of approaches that are customizable are constructivism, project- based learning, and a relatively new concept, connectivism.  constructivism  Constructivism views learning as a process in which the learner actively constructs  or generates new ideas or concepts based upon current and past knowledge. With  a constructivist approach to learning, students build on what they already know  and  what  they  learn.  Rather  than  providing  didactic  instruction  and  expecting  students to repeat facts on a test, teachers encourage students to think about what  they already know about a topic, search for new information, and collaborate with  others to solve realistic problems and derive new understanding.  38  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH2.indd   38  3 2 09   2:37:48 PM   students and learning  C h a p t e r   2  Using Web tools helps the process along. Students are able to do more research,  find information they would never encounter without Web access, and collaborate  to create a product that shows how both a priori and new information are combined  to  become  knowledge.  Using  Web  2.0  tools  such  as  wikis  allows  students  to  collaborate  on  creating  a  document  that  displays  what  they  have  learned.  They  can illustrate with photos and videos, use an interesting presentation format, and  engage the audience to think about what they’ve seen.  project-based learning  Project-based  learning  is  a  constructivist  approach  that  encourages  learning  in  depth by allowing students to use inquiry-based methods to engage with issues  and questions that are rich, real, and relevant to their lives. It emphasizes learning  activities  that  are  long-term,  interdisciplinary,  and  student-centered.  Students  form a learning community that focuses on critical thinking.  Students  are  expected  to  use  technology  in  meaningful  ways,  for  example,  to  help them investigate or present their learning. Teachers offer resources so that  students  can  explore  and  develop  content  purposefully  and  creatively.  Students  engage in activities that are valued in the real world, manage their own tasks and  time, work as part of a team, and communicate with adults and experts. They drive  the accumulation of content knowledge and thus remember what they learn.  Project-based  learning  allows  for  alternative  approaches  that  address  students’  individual  differences,  variations  in  learning  styles,  intelligences,  and  abilities  and disabilities. Despite the current emphasis on learning and testing basic skills,  many  schools  continue  to  encourage  students  to  do  higher  order  thinking  as  preparation for self-directed lifelong learning and as a way to develop workplace  skills.  Web-based tools add the ability to communicate and collaborate with the world  outside the classroom easily and at no cost beyond the technology. Thus, Web 2.0  tools are part of a paradigm shift in learning. Rather than delivering information  from  textbooks  and  teachers’  resources,  the  new  approach  harnesses  the  technologies that students use outside of school to engage them in finding and  analyzing resources themselves.  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  39  NEWTOO CH2.indd   39  3 2 09   2:37:49 PM   C h a p t e r   2  students and learning  Because the Web has almost limitless information, students need strategies to find  what they are looking for. Web 2.0 services allow them to create social networks  of those with similar interests in order to interact, share information, and learn  collaboratively.  Achieving  the  goal  of  having  students  learn  deeply  rather  than  broadly can happen. They can pursue a topic thoroughly, discern the truth about  it, and eventually know more than some of the experts and thus become experts  themselves. They can create an authentic audience for their work by creating tags  for linking, by inviting comment, or by syndicating it with RSS  Really Simple  Syndication . Because they have the tools at their fingertips to publish their work  online, they become resources for other students’ research.  connectivism  George Siemens’  2004  theory of connectivism is an approach to learning that  also considers technology as a key factor. “Including technology and connection  making as learning activities begins to move learning theories into a digital age”   n.p. .  Siemens  2004  believes that:  Learning and knowledge rests in diversity of opinions; learning is a  process of connecting specialized nodes or information sources; the  capacity to know more is more critical than what is currently known;  nurturing  and  maintaining  connections  is  needed  to  facilitate  continual  learning;  the  ability  to  see  connections  between  fields,  ideas,  and  concepts  is  a  core  skill;  and  decision-making  is  itself  a  learning process.  n.p.   Siemens  points  out  that  using  technology  and  making  connections  are  linked.  Combining  connectivism  with  constructivist  methods  in  the  classroom  offers  students  an  opportunity  to  gain  21st-century  skills.  Siemens   2004   sees  the  trends:  E  Many  learners  will  move  into  a  variety  of  different,  possibly   unrelated fields over the course of their lifetime.  E  Informal  learning  is  a  significant  aspect  of  our  learning  experience. Formal education no longer comprises the majority of  our learning. Learning now occurs in a variety of ways—through   40  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH2.indd   40  3 2 09   2:37:49 PM   students and learning  C h a p t e r   2  communities  of  practice,  personal  networks,  and  through  completion of work-related tasks.  E  Learning is a continual process, lasting for a lifetime. Learning  and  work-related  activities  are  no  longer  separate.  In  many  situations, they are the same.  E  Technology  is  altering   rewiring   our  brains.  The  tools  we  use   define and shape our thinking.  E  The organization and the individual are both learning organisms.  Increased  attention  to  knowledge  management  highlights  the  need  for  a  theory  that  attempts  to  explain  the  link  between  individual and organizational learning.  E  Many  of  the  processes  previously  handled  by  learning  theories   especially in cognitive information processing  can now be off- loaded to, or supported by, technology.  E  Know-how  and  know-what  are  being  supplemented  with  know- where   the  understanding  of  where  to  find  knowledge  needed .   n.p.   the challenge  For a while the education pendulum had swung toward the types of learning that  constructivism, project-based learning, and connectivism typify. The goals were  to prepare students for the 21st century—to use higher order thinking skills, apply  technology, adapt to change, acquire workplace skills, and more.  Today’s educational goals are seemingly the opposite. We focus more on standards,  standardized  tests,  and  accountability,  which  lend  themselves  to  traditional,  teacher-directed  instruction.  Because  “the  test”  is  the  ultimate  determinant  of  success, many think the process is easy—teach what will be tested. However, two  dangers exist: one is in not measuring what really matters even if it will matter  more  in  the  future.  The  other  is  in  narrowing  instruction  to  the  exclusion  of  anything more than test materials.  The challenge is to find ways to support in-depth learning and increased student  achievement while also employing a variety of measures, including standardized   web 2.0     new tools, new schools  41  NEWTOO CH2.indd   41  3 2 09   2:37:50 PM   C h a p t e r   2  students and learning  tests. If new methods engage students so they are eager to learn, allow them to  acquire  the  ability  to  do  serious,  in-depth,  “real  world”  activities,  and  support  them in retaining what they’ve learned, can the new methods also result in their  doing well not only on performance-based measures but also on high-stakes tests?  If these new Web-based tools offer students the tools of production and engage  them, can we harness these tools for learning? The goal is to provide an education  that prepares students to have 21st-century skills and also to ace the test without  breaking stride  Solomon, 2003 .  When  they  are  adults,  today’s  students  will  change  jobs  more  often  than  their  parents did and each new job may be unrelated to the last. This means that the  skills they will need will be less job-specific; rather, they will be skills that enable  people to think, adapt, and continue learning. Students will acquire some of these  skills informally—by communicating with a wide range of people and developing  personal networks. With the kind of guidance that schools can provide, they can  add the other skills they’ll need. The tools students use may change where and  how they get information, but only educators can make sure that students learn  how to process and use that information wisely.  harnessing new technologies  How do we take advantage of students’ interests and the ways they learn to create  new  models  for  learning?  David  Jakes   2003   had  this  to  say  in  a  conference  presentation:   Various types of virtual learning environments, when supported by  pedagogically sound instructional models, and when combined with  the content of the Web, can provide the following:   E  A structured approach to an investigation that provides direction  and  guidance  for  students  in  a  large,  complex,  and  dynamic  system such as the Web.  E  An opportunity to integrate multiple types of truly unique Web  resources into the learning experience, including such media as  simulations and animations that can promote the development of  highly interactive and multisensory learning environments.  E  An increased level of student engagement.  42  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH2.indd   42  3 2 09   2:37:50 PM   students and learning  C h a p t e r   2  E  An  opportunity  to  build  information  literacy  and  21st-century   skills in students.  E  Learning  experiences  that  are  pliable  and  scalable,  and  provide   opportunities for differentiation.  E  Learning experiences that are inquiry-based, and focus upon the  resolution of an essential question that requires the acquisition,  processing and synthesis of information.  p. 1   One of the new technologies that could be harnessed is digital storytelling. The  goals are traditional; the tools are new. David Jakes explains in the Web 2.0 Wisdom  sidebar, Digital Storytelling.   web 2.0 wisdom  digital storytelling  David Jakes  New tools such as blogs, wikis, and podcasts allow everyone,  including students, to contribute to a global conversation. They   enable voice. The process of digital storytelling provides a voice rich in  multimedia that has the potential to resonate deeply with an audience.   As a result, digital storytelling has become one of the most powerful   21st-century learning processes available to teachers and students.  So what exactly is a digital story? A digital story in its truest form is a  personal experience represented in narrative format. A script, or the  essence of the story, is extracted from the narrative and then amplified  by including video, music, still-frame imagery, and the author’s voice. A  digital story typically lasts between two and three minutes. The inclusion  of multimedia makes the story come alive and takes the story to a place  that could not be achieved by writing alone.  E E E  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  43  NEWTOO CH2.indd   43  3 2 09   2:37:51 PM   C h a p t e r   2  students and learning  E E  The process is rich in learning. Digital storytelling makes students better  writers through the multiple drafts, rewrites, and script preparation that  is required and helps them build essential visual literacy skills through  the selection of the imagery required to construct the story. Using  storytelling software such as Photo Story 3 and iMovie further advances  their skill set.  The final component in the digital storytelling process is sharing  the creation. The video-sharing sites now available online make this  possible. The result demonstrates to students that what they have to say  is important and how they say it is critical. They discover that they can be  lifelong contributors to the new global conversation.  David Jakes is the instructional technology coordinator for Community High  School District 99 in Downers Grove, Illinois.  One  could  argue  that  there  is  even  yet  another  component  beyond  sharing  the  story. In the world of Web 2.0, the final piece involves the audience—to choose to  watch or not, to choose to modify or not, to choose to re-create or collaborate or  not. And then to offer it back to the original author—or not—and so on, in the  ultimate peer-learning experience.  Now that we’ve seen what the world is like and what today’s students are like, let’s  take a closer look at the Web tools that have such an impact.  44  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH2.indd   44  3 2 09   2:37:52 PM   E E    3  new tools  On  October  18,  2006,  YouTube  featured   a  music  video  by  ClipBandits,  a  band  with three young men that called itself “The  World’s First Web Band” because they formed  the group, developed the music, and created  the  video  all  online.  In  fact,  they  had  never  met, didn’t know one another’s real names,  and  lived  in  New  York,  Los  Angeles,  and  Austin. They were searching for a drummer  by  soliciting  audition  videos.  In  three  days,  nearly 500,000 people watched the video and  almost  1,700  people  posted  ratings   it  got  four out of five stars . This is the world our  students live in. How did we get here? And  just what does this mean for education?   E E E E E  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  45  NEWTOO CH3.indd   45  3 2 09   2:47:02 PM   C h a p t e r   3  new tools  concepts  Let’s begin by explaining some of the concepts we talked about earlier. Because  Web 2.0 software is online and accessible to anyone with an Internet connection  and a browser, we have new avenues for collaboration and communication. The  tools  are  free  and  businesses,  young  people,  and  some  educators  are  already  using them.  Web 2.0 tools change the nature of the Web from distributed to participatory. People  control the tools of production and publication and use them to collaborate. They  can add to and change others’ work online. Steven Downes  2006 , a researcher  with  the  National  Research  Council  of  Canada,  believes  that  the  emergence  of  Web  2.0  “is  not  a  technological  revolution;  it  is  a  social  revolution. … It’s  about  enabling and encouraging participation through open applications and services …  with rights granted to use the content in new and exciting contexts”  n.p. .  The basis for this model is the open-source movement. Open source means that  the code is available for others to use, and that they may enhance and distribute  the  results  freely.  “It  enables  the  Web  to  shift  from  being  a  medium  in  which  information is transmitted and consumed into being a platform in which content  is created, shared, remixed, repurposed, and passed along”  Downes, 2006, n.p. .  the web as platform  Tim O’Reilly  2005 , the CEO of O’Reilly Media and one of the best thinkers about  Web 2.0 issues, says, “You can visualize Web 2.0 as a set of principles and practices  that tie together a veritable solar system of sites that demonstrate some or all of  those principles, at a varying distance from that core”  n.p. .  The  Web  2.0  movement  stems  from  the  concept  that  the  Web   rather  than  a  proprietary network  is the platform on which everything is built and users control  their own data. Among the advantages of having the Web as the platform is that  it provides services rather than packaged software. It is also participatory, cost- effective,  and  scalable.  The  most  important  point  is  that  it  harnesses  collective  intelligence.  O’Reilly’s  diagram   Figure  3.1   shows  how  ideas  and  tools  are  connected.  46  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH3.indd   46  3 2 09   2:47:03 PM   new tools  C h a p t e r   3  Figure 3.1    Web 2.0 meme map  Flickr, del.icio.us:   Tagging,    not taxonomy  PageRank, eBay   reputation, Amazon   reviews: user as   contributor  Blogs: Participation,   not publishing  BitTorrent: Radical  decentralization  Gmail, Google Maps,  and AJAX: Rich user   experiences  Google AdSense:   customer self-service   enabling the    long tail  Wikipedia:   Radical trust  “An attitude, not a   technology”  User positioning:    You control you own data  Trust your users  Strategic positioning:    The Web as platform  Core Competencies:    Services, not packaged software     Architecture of Participation     Cost-effective scalability     Remixable data source and data   transformations     Software above the level of a single device     Harnessing collective intelligence  The Long Tail  Data as the “Intel   Inside”  Small pieces loosely   joined  Web as  components   Rich user experience  The perpetual beta  Play  Software that gets   better the more   people use it  Hackability  The Right to Remix   “Some rights    reserved”  Emergent: User  behavior not  predetermined  Granular   addressability of   content  E    2005 O’Reilly Media, Inc.

Ajax,  shorthand  for  Asynchronous  JavaScript  and  XML,  is  a  Web  development  technique used for creating interactive Web applications. The code is open source,  improvements happen regularly, and users never have to wait for a new software  release to get new features.  What happens is that rather than performing tasks such as word processing or  crunching numbers with a spreadsheet on your desktop, you do it all online. Your  browser window is the interface to Web 2.0 applications such as blogs and wikis.  The  greatest  advantage  is  that  these  are  collaborative  tools  that  allow  people  to  work together simultaneously from any location. All anyone needs is an Internet  connection.  Ajax  applications  make  Web  pages  work  faster  than  usual  to  load  and  refresh.  That’s because the Ajax engine sits between the user and the server and updates  pieces of data rather than reloads the entire Web page each time someone makes  a change to a document. It allows work to happen asynchronously—independent  of communication with the server. You can work faster because you’re not waiting  for the screen to reload. For example, an Ajax application such as Google Maps  downloads satellite images into a browser and displays specific map segments.  There are serious tools for word, data, and business processing that companies  are  using  to  run  their  businesses  over  the  Internet.  These  replace  traditional  application software installed on the computer desktop. Thomas Friedman  2005   sees this change as part of the flat world and “uploading” as one of the flatteners  that he says:  enabled  more  people  to  author  more  content  and  to  collaborate  on  that content. It also enabled them to upload files and globalize that  content—individually or a part of a self-forming community—without  going  through  any  of  the  traditional  hierarchical  organizations  or  institutions.  This newfound power of individuals and communities to send up,  out, and around their own products and ideas, often for free, rather  than just passively downloading them from commercial enterprises  or  traditional  hierarchies,  is  fundamentally  reshaping  the  flow  of  creativity,  innovation,  political  mobilization,  and  information   48  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH3.indd   48  3 2 09   2:47:06 PM   new tools  C h a p t e r   3  gathering  and  dissemination.  It  is  making  each  of  these  things  a  bottom-up  and  globally  side-to-side  phenomenon,  not  exclusively  a  top-down one.  pp. 94–95   Companies  can  run  their  businesses  online,  which  means  that  workers  can  be  anywhere  and  communicate,  collaborate,  and  be  as  productive  as  if  they  were located in one physical location. For example, some companies are asking  employees  to  write,  change,  and  track  changes  of  documents  together  using  a  wiki.  Other  companies  record  meetings  that  can  be  downloaded  to  iPods,  use  blogs so employees can reply to their bosses, and create internal blog pages where  people  can  read  their  colleagues’  notes  and  add  their  own.  Some  companies  encourage employees to bookmark internal Web pages that they find useful so  others can find the information by searching for keywords associated with those  ideas. A public-relations manager recently tapped his social network to expand an  online-marketing campaign  Vara, 2006 .  If these tools are not exactly what a business is looking for, the code is available,  and companies can customize applications to any of their specific needs—or hire  a service to do that.  This  is  the  world  our  students  will  work  in,  and  the  implications  for  school  administrators, teachers, students, and parents are significant.  For administrators Because these are free and freely shared tools that developers are using to create  ever more robust and creative applications, the day may come when schools would  not  have  to  invest  in  new  computers  and  software  licenses  because  everything  would be available online and at no cost.  In addition, administrators may be able to run the administrative side of school  districts  with  these  tools  the  way  that  businesses  are  doing.  And  there  are  implications for offering students virtual learning options as part of the bricks- and-mortar school. If this happens, districts may be able to reduce building costs  and help students to benefit from learning remotely.  For teachers Having students use these tools has implications for quality since time is no longer  part of the equation. They can set high standards and require high-quality work,  monitor performance at any time, and require that students keep online portfolios  when excellence rather than completion is the standard.  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  49  NEWTOO CH3.indd   49  3 2 09   2:47:07 PM   C h a p t e r   3  new tools  For students Young  people  are  already  using  many  of  these  tools  for  enjoyment.  It’s  up  to  schools to help them apply the tools toward more serious endeavors. Because the  world  that  today’s  students  will  work  in  relies  on  technology,  they  will  have  to  use it well or risk being left behind countries with more tech-savvy workers. In  addition, these tools can allow students to collaborate on projects on weekends  and evenings no matter where they live; no longer is the school day limited to the  time spent within brick-and-mortar walls.  For parents It is important for parents to know what their children are doing and to monitor  their progress. With these tools, parents can access student work when they have  time to see what their children are doing and how well they are performing.  open source  The  genesis  of  Web  2.0  tools  is  the  open-source  movement,  whose  proponents  believe that the source code for programs should be available for anyone else to  study,  use,  enhance,  and  distribute.  The  basic  idea  behind  open  source  is  very  simple: “When programmers can read, redistribute, and modify the source code  for a piece of software, the software evolves. People improve it, people adapt it, and  people fix bugs. And this can happen at a speed that, if one is used to the slow  pace  of  conventional  software  development,  seems  astonishing”   Open  Source  Initiative, 2006, n.p. . The epitome of open-source software is the Linux operating  system  www.linux.org . There is even an open-source browser, the Mozilla Firefox  Web browser  www.mozilla.org .  According to Dan Woods  2005 , a seasoned CTO  chief technology officer :   Open source usually refers to software that is released with source  code  under  a  license  that  ensures  that  derivative  works  will  also  be  available  as  source  code,  protects  certain  rights  of  the  original  authors, and prohibits restrictions on how the software can be used  or  who  can  use  it. … Open  source  began  as,  and  for  the  most  part  still is, software created by a community of people who are dedicated  to working together in a highly collaborative and evolutionary way.   n.p.   50  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH3.indd   50  3 2 09   2:47:07 PM   new tools  C h a p t e r   3  What does this mean for today’s youth? According to Jim Hirsch, the associate  superintendent for technology in the Plano Independent School District in Plano,  Texas:  The whole open technology business is where the rest of the world  is by and large now, and it’s where our students are as well. … It’s a  mindset. Our students are very much into a world that is collaborative,  and  because  of  that,  they  tend  to  see  things  a  little  bit  differently.  They are exposed to a greater number of information resources than  ever before, and whether it’s good or bad, they’ve come to expect that  information to be available and free.  Villano, 2006a, n.p.   There is confusion about open-source software, according to Robert Tinker  2005 ,  president of the Concord Consortium. In Freeing Educational Applications, he  identifies the following misconceptions and explains the reality:   Free means junk. Not necessarily. Just like commercial software, there  is a lot of open-source junk and vaporware. But there are some gems,  too. Indeed, sometimes, there is such a thing as a free lunch.  Open-source  software  only  runs  on  a  Linux  box.  Wrong.  Most  recent  open-source software is written in Java, which will run on current  Windows,  Macintosh,  and  Linux  computers,  without  requiring  downloads.  Other  open-source  software  is  available  as  applets  that  run in almost any browser.  Open-source software may be free now, but what about later? If it’s open  source now, it will always be open source. The open-source copyright  forbids anyone from withdrawing open-source software and making  people  pay  for  it.  That  said,  you  may  want  to  pay  someone  who  bundles open-source software into a convenient package, but there  will always be a free option.  Open-source  software  will  crash  and  burn.  Not  likely.  Open-source  software tends to be better than commercial software when lots of  people are involved in maintaining it. This hasn’t happened yet for  most interesting educational applications, but if enough people begin  using open-source educational applications, it will.  Only  geeks  use  open-source  software.  No  way.  All  the  software  described in Freeing Educational Applications can be downloaded   web 2.0     new tools, new schools  51  NEWTOO CH3.indd   51  3 2 09   2:47:08 PM   C h a p t e r   3  new tools  and  run  by  most  users  with  some   but  not  advanced!   technology  experience, just like other educational applications.  If it’s free, it must be open source. Not necessarily. Developers some- times make early versions of their software free to get you hooked,  and  then  begin  charging  later.  Check  the  licensing  to  be  sure  it’s  copyrighted  under  one  of  the  open-source  licenses,  like  the  GNU  General Public License.     2005 The Concord Consortium, Inc. Reprinted with permission.  tagging and syndication  One  of  the  ways  that  authors  make  their  content  available  is  by  including  information  metadata  that identifies its topics and themes. They also may add  an option for readers to be alerted when new content is available, which means  that information will find them. In addition, Web 2.0 sites, whether blogs, wikis,  or any other, can link to one another. While any search engine will find content  created  with  Web  2.0  services,  some  are  specifically  intended  for  this  purpose.  Technorati  www.technorati.com , for example, searches blogs by keyword and for  links and provides news from general news services and blogs.  tags With the traditional style of Web page, search engines can find content because  content  managers  add  metadata  or  metatags.  These  are  words  arranged  by  taxonomies  that  people  may  be  likely  to  type  into  a  search  engine.  They  are  structured  in  a  hierarchical  form  and  search  engines  find  them  and  list  the  content.  Web 2.0 is organized differently. It uses words that the authors select and attach to  content. These are called folksonomies, which are keywords or “tags” that convey  meaning  about  the  content.  These  tags  are  logical,  and  people  who  tag  often  arrange groups of them into concept maps that they call tag clouds, which can  show how the terms relate to one another. People often adopt terms that others  use to describe similar content, and sites such as the bookmarking site del.icio.us  suggest tags to use that are based on ones that others have identified.  For example, when attendees at Technology & Learning’s Tech Forum conference in  Chicago in April 2007 wrote in their own blogs or in the shared wiki, they tagged   52  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH3.indd   52  3 2 09   2:47:09 PM   new tools  C h a p t e r   3  their entries with the topic and tag to identify the event. If someone wrote about  the Web 2.0 panel that Gwen Solomon conducted at Tech Forum in Chicago in  2007, the tags might be “Web20, session, techforumChi07, solomon.”  So why should tagging matter for student learning? Teachers lament that students  often lack organizational skills in their writing. Adding tags to their work forces  students to think about the overarching themes, the points they make, and also  the value their writing could provide to a potential audience. Thinking about their  writing enhances their analytical skills.  Syndication In  the  traditional  publishing  world,  articles  and  columns  are  often  syndicated  or  distributed  to  publications  other  than  the  one  they  were  written  for.  Other  newspapers  or  magazines  license  these  articles  and  columns  for  their  own  readers. The system is similar in television: programs are made available to other  stations.  Web  syndication  is  making  information  available  to  other  Web  sites  or  to  individual subscribers. This is done by adding XML code that readers can use.  When a reader wants to know when new content is added to a site, he or she can  subscribe to it by grabbing the XML code and putting it into an aggregator. That  software retrieves syndicated Web content. Then readers are alerted automatically  when new content is added. The technique is called RSS, which stands for Really  Simple Syndication.  The distinction between searching for information and using RSS is similar to  the difference between going out to find something and having it come to you.  When you search, you go to a search engine and plug in the terms you think will  bring up the subject. Or you visit a site you’ve been to in the past that’s likely to  have the information, and search for it there. With RSS, you set up an aggregator  and list the sites you’ve liked in the past using the RSS code provided by that site.  When there’s something new, you’ll be alerted and can choose to read it or not.  Making information available to other Web sites or to individual subscribers is  syndication. In addition to students setting up RSS feeds to get new items about  content they need, they can syndicate their own work so others can find it.  Hyperlinking  is  the  basis  of  searching  on  the  Web.  As  users  add  new  content,  pages,  and  sites,  other  users  find  them  and  link  to  them.  Syndication  is  the  opposite. New content on topics you decide are valuable will find you.  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  53  NEWTOO CH3.indd   53  3 2 09   2:47:09 PM   C h a p t e r   3  new tools  aggregators Using an aggregator means that you don’t have to keep checking a particular Web  site for new content. When you subscribe to a site, you determine how often you  want to know when content has changed. Students can save the sites that they’ve  researched as RSS feeds with an RSS reader such as Bloglines  www.bloglines. com . Other aggregators are My Yahoo! and Google Reader; even some browsers  have the capacity to be aggregators.  from the web to web 2.0  While Web 2.0 tools rely on traditional Web pages, the Web 2.0 system is structured  differently.  Traditional  Web  pages  are  designed  and  posted  in  an  arrangement  that the designer deems important, whether it is to get a specific message across  or to showcase specific content. Web 2.0 pages display their content in reverse- chronological order. The purpose of this structure is to address the immediacy of  Web content so authors and collaborators can link to other 2.0 Web pages on the  same topic, link to traditional Web pages, and display comments.  While most traditional Web pages simply display information, most Web 2.0 pages  offer tools and services. According to Garrett  2005 :  The classic Web application model works like this: Most user actions  in the interface trigger an HTTP request back to a Web server. The  server does some processing—retrieving data, crunching numbers,  talking to various legacy systems—and then returns an HTML page  to  the  client.  It’s  a  model  adapted  from  the  Web’s  original  use  as  a hypertext medium, but … what makes the Web good for hypertext  doesn’t necessarily make it good for software applications.  n.p.    Organization on traditional Web pages, especially those run by corporations, relies  on taxonomies, predetermined keywords. Web 2.0 organization uses folksonomies,  which are author-assigned and fall into a more reader-centric philosophy that may  change how we store and find information online. According to NCREL  2003 , “It  may become less important to know and remember where information was found  and more important to know how to retrieve it using a framework created by and  shared with peers and colleagues”  p. 2 .  54  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH3.indd   54  3 2 09   2:47:10 PM   new tools  C h a p t e r   3  using the tools  The rest of this chapter will explore many of the Web 2.0 tools that educators have  implemented and found useful. Chapter 4 will provide examples of how people  are using the tools in classrooms and schools. There are so many ways to work  with Web 2.0 tools that we can cover only a small portion of these creative ideas.  Detailed lessons are beyond the scope of this book. However, in the spirit of Web  2.0, we hope you’ll take these tools and ideas, put them to use, then tell the world.  We have plans for a companion book that will be a practical guide to Web 2.0. This  resource will showcase real-world lessons, classroom narratives, and tutorials.  basic web 2.0 tools:   blogs, podcasts, and wikis  Three of the most commonly used Web 2.0 tools are blogs, podcasts, and wikis, and  there are many examples of each. Bryan Alexander  2006 , director for research at  the National Institute for Technology and Liberal Education  NITLE , talks about  the unique nature of these inventions:  Blogs are about posts, not pages. Wikis are streams of conversation,  revision, amendment, and truncation. Podcasts are shuttled among  Web sites, RSS feeds, and diverse players. These content blocks can  be  saved,  summarized,  addressed,  copied,  quoted,  and  built  into  new projects. Browsers respond to this boom in microcontent with  bookmarklets  in  toolbars,  letting  users  fling  something  from  one  page into a Web service that yields up another page.  n.p.   For examples of how to use these tools, take a look at the tutorials in chapter 10.  Blogs A  Web  log,  usually  shortened  to  blog,  is  a  set  of  personal  commentaries  on  issues the author deems important. It contains text, images, and links to related  information on other blogs, Web pages, and media. Readers can reply easily and  thus  participate  in  a  discussion  in  which  they  share  knowledge  and  reflect  on  the  topic.  Blogs  promote  open  dialogue  and  encourage  community  building  in  which both the bloggers and commenters exchange opinions, ideas, and attitudes.  Entries  are  posted  in  reverse  chronological  order.  According  to  Business  2.0   web 2.0     new tools, new schools  55  NEWTOO CH3.indd   55  3 2 09   2:47:10 PM   C h a p t e r   3  new tools  magazine, by the summer of 2006, there were 50 million blogs, and “two new  ones are launched every second”  Sloan & Kaihla, 2006, n.p. .   Blogging  has  become  an  important  method  of  communication  within  the  educational  technology  community.  With  this  new  means  of  publishing,  educators are free to share their ideas about issues and offer examples of what  works. Classroom teachers include Jeff Utecht, who writes The Thinking Stick   http:  jeff.scofer.com thinkingstick  ; Vicki Allen, who writes Cool Cat Teacher   http:  coolcatteacher.blogspot.com ;  and  Darren  Kuropatwa,  who  writes  A  Difference  http:  adifference.blogspot.com . Technology directors include Miguel  Guhlin, who writes Around the Corner  http: mguhlin.net , and David Jakes, who  writes  The  Strength  of  Weak  Ties   http:  jakespeak.blogspot.com .  Principals  include  Tim  Lauer,  who  writes  Education Technology   http:  tim.lauer.name  .  This list is a small sample of the dedicated educators who are using new tools  to  communicate  and  instruct.  Some  of  them  write  more  than  one  blog,  often  separating instructional advice from opinions.  Blogging is the new way to express oneself and have an authentic audience. The  implications for students include writing about issues and thus improving writing  skills, learning from each other, thinking through topics thoroughly enough to  offer an opinion or add information, peer editing, finding a community of others  interested in the same topic, and becoming confident in sharing what they know.  Teachers can create blog pages to communicate with students and parents about  content and to have an ongoing open dialogue about coursework. Administrators  can replace printed announcements and meeting agendas with blogs that allow  for communication with the staff.  The danger is that blogs that students find when researching a topic may contain  highly  subjective  or  inaccurate  information.  However,  because  blogs  attract  an  audience by having a good reputation, the audience itself may serve as a filter to  protect a blog’s credibility by making sure that commenters don’t post inaccurate  or offensive remarks.  Some blogging tools that are popular in education are Blogger  www.blogger.com ,  WordPress  www.wordpress.com , and Drupal  www.drupal.org . A videoblog, or  vlog, is a Web log that uses video rather than text or audio.  For  anyone  concerned  about  allowing  student  blogs  to  be  public,  sites  such  as  Class Blogmeister  http:  classblogmeister.com  and Gaggle Blogs  www.gaggle. net  are available for schools and mandate teacher supervision. Their popularity  is growing. According to David Warlick  2006a , who provides Class Blogmeister,   56  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH3.indd   56  3 2 09   2:47:11 PM   new tools  C h a p t e r   3  “We are now well over  3,500 classroom  blogs on  Class Blogmeister. When you  throw in the student blogs as well, we are very close to 36,000 bloggers. That’s  pretty  amazing—especially  when  you  consider  the  current  atmosphere  around  social networking—at least in the U.S.”   podcasts Podcasting is a way to distribute multimedia files such as music or speech over  the Internet for playback on mobile devices and personal computers. The term  podcast, a word created by combining Apple’s iPod and broadcast, can mean both  the content and the method of delivery. The host or author of a podcast is often  called a podcaster. Podcasters’ Web sites may offer direct download or streaming  audio, and a podcast is distinguished by its ability to be downloaded automatically  using software capable of reading RSS feeds. Usually a podcast features one type of  show, with new episodes released either sporadically or at planned intervals such  as daily or weekly. In addition, there are podcast networks that feature multiple  shows on the same feed  Wikipedia, 2006b .  The implications for education include students’ being able to replay the audio of  traditionally delivered information  even a teacher’s lecture  to review or catch up.  Podcasts are portable and students are used to listening on iPods and MP3 players.  Podcasting is another step in having information that is portable, accessible 24 7,  and user-selected.  Anyone  with  a  simple  computer,  inexpensive  microphone,  and  access  to  the  Internet can create a podcast show and make it available online. Once the show  is put on the Internet, anyone can listen to it. What makes a podcast so different  from anything else on the Internet is the ability to subscribe to the show. This  means that once you find something you like, you can subscribe to it, and your  computer will continue to automatically update you with new shows as they are  produced.  Students can create their own podcasts as a way of sharing their expertise and  opinions. They can also use podcasts to keep notes, reflect on the day’s lesson, or  keep track of project activities as they work.  Wikis A wiki is a Web page and as such is accessible to anyone with a Web browser and  an  Internet  connection.  This  is  where  the  similarity  to  a  traditional  Web  page  ends, because a wiki allows readers to collaborate with others in writing it and   web 2.0     new tools, new schools  57  NEWTOO CH3.indd   57  3 2 09   2:47:11 PM   C h a p t e r   3  new tools  adding, editing, and changing the Web page’s contents at any time. Its ease of use  makes a wiki an effective tool for collaborative authoring.  The most well-known wiki is Wikipedia, a collaborative encyclopedia that includes  more  up-to-date  entries  than  the  Encyclopedia  Britannica.  The  danger  is  that  content can be modified incorrectly or to prove a point, and educators must teach  students how to evaluate the accuracy and appropriateness of content. Contributors  of most wikis usually monitor and edit one another’s work, which serves as a way  to evaluate and authenticate the content.  In  addition  to  having  students  read  existing  wikis  on  topics  of  interest,  the  implications for education include group collaboration and problem solving, peer  editing during the writing process, and electronic portfolios. Students can work  from anywhere, which means they are able to contribute on their own schedule  rather than being limited to the school day or class period. Wikis keep track of  changes, so teachers can look at successive versions of documents for electronic  portfolios or the contributions each student has made. When the work is complete,  students can invite parents and others to read their work and comment.  Teachers  can  use  wikis  for  students  to  collaborate  on  a  document  by  writing,  editing, and revising it in their own classes, across a grade, school, or district, or  even outside those traditional boundaries. Districts can set up a wiki on their own  servers  or  use  commercial  wiki  services  such  as  Wikispaces   www.wikispaces. com , which offers its service free to educators and removes all advertising from  its pages. These wikis are secure because the teacher or someone at the district  level determines who can view and edit.  MediaWiki  http:  mediawiki.com  is server-based, which means that it is protected  and  free  of  advertising.  Pbwiki  or  Peanut  Butter  Wiki   www.pbwiki.com   is  so  named  because  using  it  is  supposed  to  be  as  easy  as  making  a  peanut  butter  sandwich. Schools can password protect their wikis but there are advertisements.  Google purchased the wiki JotSpot  www.jotspot.com  in October 2006.  other popular web 2.0 tools Social Bookmarking Web  2.0  sites  promote  sharing  information  of  various  types.  For  example,   social  bookmarking  is  a  popular  Web-based  service  that  displays  shared  lists  of   58  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH3.indd   58  3 2 09   2:47:12 PM   new tools  C h a p t e r   3  user-created  Internet  bookmarks.  Instead  of  keeping  long  lists  of  “favorites”  in  their own browsers, people use these Web sites to organize, rank, and display their  resources for others to see and use. They classify the content using tags based on  folksonomies of community-acceptable keyword classifications.  Social  bookmarking  sites  allow  users  to  create  a  page  of  annotated  URLs.  You  select  favorite  Web  pages,  add  a  sentence  that  describes  each  page,  and  put  in  keywords  to  use  for  tags.  Because  these  tags  are  attached  to  the  sites,  others  can initiate a search for them and get back a list of URLs for sites tagged with  these words. People connect through shared tags and subscribe to one another’s  lists, which means that they’ll receive an alert when one is updated. Some social  bookmarking sites are popular for education.  On  del.icio.us   http:  del.icio.us  ,  which  is  owned  by  Yahoo!,  bookmarks  are  public, and lists of how many other people have saved the same site are visible  and accessible, which extends sharing. Backflip  www.backflip.com  stores user  URLs in folders, but student teams can create folders and store URLs together.  Bookmarks are private but you can choose to share them publically or with specific  people, and you can even let other people add to your folders. Furl  www.furl.net   saves pages as private or public and offers a list of recommended sites that have  topics or themes in common with those you’ve identified.  When student teams work on a project, they can divide their project’s topic into  subtopics,  and  each  student  can  search  for  information  on  the  one  he  or  she  chooses. Then they can share what they’ve found online, select the ones that are  most relevant, and use them for the project. In addition, students can search for  information by using keywords to bring up lists of Web sites related to their topic  that others have compiled. This way they can find information that they might not  have thought to look at. However, because the organization and tagging are not  supervised, students will have to learn how to discern what is valuable.  The  term  “personal  computer”  has  no  meaning  in  K–12  unless  students  are  assigned or buy their own computing device, be it a laptop, tablet, or handheld.  So  traditional  bookmarking  is  an  exercise  in  frustration  because  students  use  different  computers  each  time  they  work.  If  they  bookmark  sites  they  want  to  remember  on  one  computer,  there’s  no  way  to  access  that  information  from  another. Even if they get the same computer the next time, someone else may have  erased the information. Using online bookmarking sites means that favorites are  available from any computer at any time.  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  59  NEWTOO CH3.indd   59  3 2 09   2:47:13 PM   C h a p t e r   3  new tools  photo Sharing Flickr   www.flickr.com   is  perhaps  the  best  known  of  the  free  online  photo  management and sharing applications. Rather than sending photos from desktops  and cell phones to friends and family using e-mail, people can post them at Flickr  and  invite  people  to  view  them  in  online  albums  or  slideshows.  They  can  add  notes and tags to each photo, and their viewers can leave comments, notes, and  tags as well. Tags are searchable so it’s easier to find related photos later. Photos  are secure and private.  The  implication  for  education  is  that  students  can  post  digital  photos  and  use  them  to  illustrate  their  writing.  One  idea  that  teachers  are  using  is  to  have  students find images that have been stored on Flickr or other sites and select them  as illustrations. Because many images on Flickr have Creative Commons licenses,  students know what use they may make of the pictures.  Students can also upload images they have photographed themselves to illustrate  narratives, document field trips, show historical sites, or display objects they want  to show in school. When they do this, they learn how to copyright their own work  and are better informed about intellectual property.  photo editing To make their photos look good, people use photo-enhancing software. The most  sophisticated are only available for purchase, but a number of good programs are  free and downloadable. While the following are not open-source software, they are  good alternatives:  Google’s Picasa  http:  picasa.google.com  Apple’s iPhoto  www.apple.com iphoto   Microsoft’s Photo Story   www.microsoftcom photostory   One open-source solution is GIMP  www.gimp.org , an acronym for GNU Image  Manipulation Program. This freely distributed software is UNIX compatible and  is useful for photo retouching, image composition, and image authoring. People  find it handy both for creating graphics and editing them, as it has fairly complex  tools and filters.  60  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH3.indd   60  3 2 09   2:47:13 PM   new tools  C h a p t e r   3  Video Showcasing Several sites display videos created with a digital camcorder or cell phone with  video capabilities. For example, YouTube  www.youtube.com , which was started  in February 2005 and acquired by Google in 2006, is the best known of the free  video-sharing services. People can post, comment on, tag, and watch videos. While  it has become an entertainment hub, YouTube is also a place where people can  build or join a community that produces and shows videos about shared interests.  People can upload videos and make them public or private or even integrate them  on  other  Web  sites  using  video  embeds.  Viewers  can  create  playlists  of  their  favorites and subscribe to others’ videos.  There  is  a  free  solution  for  downloading  video,  too.  Video  Furnace   www. videofurnace.com , a video-over-IP solution, makes video just another application  on  the  network.  It  delivers  high-quality,  live  and  on-demand  broadcasts  to  any  network-connected  device,  such  as  desktop  and  laptop  computers,  without  requiring any client player software.  In addition, there’s a new group of sites that offer tools for merging video clips  and adding soundtracks, titles, transitions, and other visual effects. The intent of  sites such as Jumpcut  www.jumpcut.com , Eyespot  www.eyespot.com , Grouper   www.grouper.com , and VideoEgg  www.videoegg.com  is to make editing easier  and free.  The  implication  for  education  is  that  students  can  create  thoughtful  and  meaningful video clips that look professional and command an audience for their  work. Having the simple tools available makes it easier to create and edit effective  presentations.  They  can  collaborate  by  uploading  individual  videos  and  editing  them together into a single movie that uses the best of each clip. They can use  the clips for digital storytelling and insert them into presentations and projects. If  their videos are of high enough quality, other students can learn from them.  For  example,  a  student-created  video  from  a  New  Hampshire  school  that  is  on  YouTube features a student who is shown speeding and a police officer who stops  him.  The  police  officer  asks  if  the  student  knows  why  he  was  stopped  and  the  student produces a card that explains he is deaf and communicates using sign  language but can also read lips. The story of how and what they communicate  provides a powerful lesson.  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  61  NEWTOO CH3.indd   61  3 2 09   2:47:14 PM   C h a p t e r   3  new tools  web 2.0 versions of desktop tools  The  mainstays  of  any  enterprise,  whether  business  or  education,  are  the  applications used to write, crunch numbers, present information, send e-mail, and  keep calendars. Until recently, these tools have had to reside on users’ desktops,  and Microsoft Office is the most commonly used suite of products.  A number of Web-based applications have recently emerged for word processing,  spreadsheets, presentations, and other tasks. While they have yet to develop the  robust  features  of  Microsoft  products,  they  are  collaborative  tools  that  several  people can use at one time to work on documents together. And they are free. The  use of these applications in education is the same as for the full-featured, desktop  versions.  One  popular  source  of  applications  is  TheOpenCD  project   www.theopencd. org .  The  software  CD  this  organization  distributes  is  high  quality,  free,  and  open source. The programs run in Windows and cover the most common tasks  such as word processing, presentations, e-mail, Web browsing, Web design, and  image manipulation. Also available is the OpenOffice productivity suite  http:   openoffice.org , which is compatible with all other major office suites, yet is free to  download, use, and distribute.  In today’s intensely competitive business environment, both Google and Microsoft  won’t  be  left  out.  Google  offers  a  number  of  free  applications  such  as  gmail,  calendar, SketchUp, chat, telephony, Web pages, blogs, and more, and is packaging  some of them for schools. Microsoft has LiveOffice available as free online tools to  purchasers of Office software.  Word processing The potential for these early programs to become robust, feature-filled applications  exists. For example, Google Docs & Spreadsheets  http:  docs.google.com  started  out  as  Writely,  an  online  word  processor  that  was  developed  by  Upstartle  and  purchased by Google. It allows people to share ideas as they create a document.  Zoho  Writer   www.ajaxwrite.com ,  and  Writeboard   http:  writeboard.com   are  similar,  although  each  has  somewhat  different  features.  Most  have  simple  formatting  tools,  and  some  allow  users  to  save online or to their desktops.   www.zohowriter.com ,  ajaxWrite   Access is managed somewhat differently too. For example, with Writeboard, the  person  who  creates  the  page  sends  e-mail  to  invite  the  others.  Google  Docs  &   62  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH3.indd   62  3 2 09   2:47:14 PM   new tools  C h a p t e r   3  Spreadsheets  also  restricts  access  to  whomever  the  first  writer  allows  but  will  permit  exporting  the  content  into  other  formats  such  as  Word  for  additional  editing offline. Other educators use wikis for collaborative writing.  With these social writing tools, people can share documents and collaborate in real  time or asynchronously, edit documents from anywhere, and store their work on  their desktops or securely online. The software is easy to use and writers can limit  access  to  documents  to  a  selected  group.  Writers  can  assign  tags  and  organize  their documents into folders.  Some educators have begun to use blogs to teach the writing process so that their  students  can  publish  their  work  and  invite  comments  from  others,  and  Class  Blogmeister  http:  classblogmeister.com  is designed specifically for schools. Its  creator, David Warlick  2006a , says:   There are many freely available tools that facilitate blogging, but none  seem  especially  suited  for  the  classroom.  Blogmeister  is  explicitly  designed with teachers and students in mind, where the teacher can  evaluate, comment on, and finally publish students’ blog articles in a  controlled environment.  n.p.   Warlick explains why he created the site in the Web 2.0 Wisdom sidebar, Birth and  Caring of a New Web Tool.  Spreadsheets For anyone who relies on a spreadsheet to crunch numbers or keep track of data,  a Web 2.0 version can provide new options even if it has only some of a desktop  application’s advanced features. For example, Google Docs & Spreadsheet  http:   docs.google.com  is an emerging collaborative spreadsheet that others can update  from their own computers, even at the same time. Students can import existing  spreadsheets  or  create  new  ones  from  scratch,  make  changes  collaboratively  in  real time, and store them securely online or on a hard drive. It lacks charting and  graphing features but allows for sorts, various typefaces and colors, and the use  of preset formulas.  Zoho Sheet  www.zohosheet.com home.do  is another Web-based alternative to  traditional spreadsheet applications that provides basic spreadsheet functionalities  including charts coupled with Web-based features such as sharing, tagging, and  publishing.  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  63  NEWTOO CH3.indd   63  3 2 09   2:47:15 PM   C h a p t e r   3  new tools  web 2.0 wisdom  Birth and Caring of a New Web tool David Warlick  In 2004, I wAS juSt beGInnInG to learn about blogging and other  Web 2.0 applications. I knew so little that I could teach it all during a  one-hour presentation and have time for questions. There was a great deal  of interest among teachers, especially in blogging. They recognized the  power behind turning their students into authors. Not only would it be  an effective platform for making them better writers, but it would also  provide a voice to what they were learning and what they thought about it.  There was a problem, however. Of all of the blogging engines that were  available at that time, none of them were designed for classroom use.  Although some teachers were using tools such as Blogger for their high- school students, most teachers were not comfortable with student posts  going public before they were screened by the teacher. We had a demand  asking for a tool to quench it.  During the late weeks of 2004 and early weeks of 2005, I created Class  Blogmeister, a blogging engine that was designed with features that gave  teachers control over all of the content—both what the students read and  what they wrote. There are varying degrees of control, but no content  leaves the classroom that the teacher has not seen.  Perhaps the most important aspect of this tool is a concept called  perpetual beta. This means that the tool is never finished. Teachers use it,  think of a way that it can be made better, suggest it in the users’ mailing  list, and if enough like the idea, then I write in the feature. The software  becomes buggy for a while, but it all works out, and the tool continues to  get better out of the conversation between users and developer.  David Warlick, blogger, podcaster, author, programmer, and public speaker  is also director of the Landmark Project, a Web development, consulting, and  innovations firm in Raleigh, North Carolina.  64  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH3.indd   64  3 2 09   2:47:16 PM   new tools  C h a p t e r   3  presentations If  you  use  software  to  create  and  present  slides  for  presentations,  the  Web  2.0  application  Zoho  Show   www.zohoshow.com   serves  the  purpose  online.  You  can  access,  import,  and  edit  presentations  from  anywhere,  import  Microsoft  PowerPoint  .ppt, .pps  or OpenOffice Presentation  .sxi  files, or build and edit  presentations on-the-fly using a WYSIWYG editor. It lets you pull publicly shared  images  from  your  Flickr  account  into  your  presentation   www.zohoshow.com  login.sas .  web 2.0 management tools Search engines While many Web search engines are available and everyone has his or her favorite  way to find information, Technorati  www.technorati.com  is a new search tool that  works best on content that is posted on blogs. Google’s search engine, a favorite  of many, includes blogs in its regular searches. For others such as Grokker and  Squidoo, see appendix B, Web 2.0 Tools.  electronic portfolios  eportfolios  Teachers  often  ask  students  to  keep  portfolios  to  showcase  ongoing  work  and  assemble a body of evidence of intellectual growth and competence. EDUCAUSE,  an organization for higher education that also speaks to K–12, established a group  called IMS Global Learning Consortium, or IMS GLC, to determine specifications  for  electronic  portfolios.  These  include  enhancing  the  learning  experience  and  improving employee development, allowing educators and institutions to better  track competencies, making exchanging portfolios from school to work transitions  easier, and supporting the advancement of lifelong learning  IMS GLC, 2006 .  Some teachers are using wikis as portfolios for student projects because it is so  easy to view contributions from each person and track how the work has evolved  from previous pages. One example of an electronic portfolio is ELGG  www.elgg. org ,  which  allows  students  to  build  their  own  “personal  learning  landscape”  that incorporates many tools to put the students at the center of their learning  environment.  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  65  NEWTOO CH3.indd   65  3 2 09   2:47:16 PM   C h a p t e r   3  new tools  Content Management If one subscribes to a philosophy of constructivist learning and a belief that creating  online communities helps students to learn, one needs the tools to support the  activities. Moodle  http:  moodle.org  is a free, open-source course-management  system  that  was  designed  around  a  constructionist  philosophy  that  says  that  students  construct  new  knowledge  as  they  interact  with  their  environment  to  learn and create something.  Teachers can use it to organize learning content as a course divided into modules  and  lessons,  complete  with  quizzes,  tests,  and  discussions,  and  sometimes  integrated into the school or district student information system. It has features  that promote collaboration, activities, reflection, and other characteristics for both  online classes and face-to-face learning  Moodle, 2006 . Because Moodle use is  confined  to  the  school  district,  some  districts  include  tools  such  as  blogs  and  wikis for students to use within it.  Calendars With  a  Web  2.0  calendar,  the  user  and  anyone  who  needs  to  know  his  or  her  schedule can check it online. Such calendars are good for parents to keep their  own schedules, for educators to list events and due dates of assignments, and for  students to keep track of homework and extracurricular activities.  With Google Calendar  www.google.com calendar , you can see others’ schedules  next to your own to cross-reference and add new events quickly. You can also set  up automatic event reminders and search the calendar to find events.  other web 2.0 tools for education Mapping Google  Earth   http:  earth.google.com   combines  satellite  imagery,  maps,  and  the  power  of  Google  Search  to  put  the  world’s  geographic  information  at  your  fingertips. You start from a view of Earth from outer space and can zoom in quickly  to search for places in your neighborhood. You can also do research for a trip and  get directions. You can tilt and rotate the view to see 3D terrain and buildings, save  and share searches and favorites, and add your own annotations.  66  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH3.indd   66  3 2 09   2:47:17 PM   new tools  C h a p t e r   3  3D Modeling Google’s SketchUp  http:  sketchup.google.com  is a simple but powerful tool for  quickly and easily creating, viewing, and modifying 3D designs. You can create  3D models of houses, schools, and other objects in a community for a classroom  project and place them into Google Earth. You can click on a shape and push or  pull it to create a desired 3D geometry, experiment with color and texture, use  real-time shadow casting, and select from thousands of predrawn components to  save time drawing.  Social Networking The  MySpace  social-networking  site   www.myspace.com   has  seen  a  lot  of  controversy because many young people use it to show off, boast, and tout poor  behavior.  In  some  ways,  early  adopters  will  always  test  the  limits  of  any  new  technology. There’s always a reaction and school districts have blocked students  from accessing MySpace from their school network.  Social networking itself is powerful and other sites are available that may be better  equipped to monitor conduct. Certainly, if it is going to get approval from educators,  it has to promote responsible behavior. A site such as imeem.com  http:  imeem. com  that offers social networking and Web tools but that has community rules  may be more responsible. The issue is how well community policing will work.  For younger students, Whyville  www.whyville.net  is a free but not open-source  online community where 1.7 million children and young teens  ages 8–15  meet to  discuss books and films in the city’s Greek theater, compete at checkers, and go on  art treasure hunts. More than just a social network, Whyville is an educational tool  sponsored by various entities including NASA and designed to engage children in  all types of activities that will support their understanding in real life.  Organizing Web Info Google Notebook  www.google.com notebook   puts a little button on the frame  of your browser that organizes snippets of information you find on the Web into  folders that are then accessible from any computer. When you are on a Web site  and you see something you want to save, you highlight it, right-click your mouse,  click on “Note this” in the dropdown menu, and your search is saved.  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  67  NEWTOO CH3.indd   67  3 2 09   2:47:18 PM   C h a p t e r   3  new tools  Surveys and polls If you want to make a decision and need the input of others or if you want students  to  learn  how  to  use  surveys  in  class,  Zoho  Polls   http:  zohopolls.com   offers  a  simple interface.   Drawing Tux  Paint   www.newbreedsoftware.com tuxpaint    is  an  open-source  painting  tool that is free, downloadable, and easy to use. It runs on both Macintosh and PC  platforms and is a lot of fun.  Mashups Mashup sites mix and match content from two or more sites to create something  entirely  new.  One  of  the  most  popular  is  HousingMaps   www.housingmaps. com , which combines real estate information from Craigslist with Google Maps  interactive  data.  People  can  enter  a  city  and  price  and  see  a  map  marked  with  properties and a corresponding list.  Using mashups with students allows for interesting learning opportunities. For  example,  students  could  use  Flash  Earth   www.flashearth.com ,  a  mashup  of  Google Maps and Virtual Earth satellite imagery, to zoom in on their community.  They could use Bubblr  www.pimpampum.net bubblr   to add cartoon bubbles to  photographs. They could even use TerraPass’ emission calculator  www.terrapass. com flight flightcalc.html   to  enter  a  starting  point  and  destination  to  find  out  how far a trip is and how many pounds of carbon dioxide each person produces  en route.  There are a lot of possibilities for student creativity with these applications. Lists of  popular mashups are available on Programmable Web  www.programmableWeb. com popular  . Maybe at some point teachers and students will design custom  mashups, but for now, creating mashups is best left to programmers. For those  who want to try, instructions and tools are online at Amazon Web Services  http:   amazon.com aws   and other sites.  As  you  will  see  in  the  next  chapter,  many  teachers  are  using  these  tools  with  students.  Yet  this  is  just  the  beginning  of  Web  2.0  tool  integration,  and  in  the  future even better examples will emerge.  68  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH3.indd   68  3 2 09   2:47:18 PM   new tools  C h a p t e r   3  more new tools ehub Emily Chang’s Web site, eHub  www.emilychang.com go eHub  , is a constantly  updated  resource  of  Web  applications,  services,  and  sites  with  a  focus  on  next  generation  Web   Web  2.0 ,  social  software,  blogging,  Ajax,  location  mapping,  open source, folksonomy, design, and digital media sharing.  Instant Messaging If learning is to become a 24 7 enterprise, students will need access to real-time  communication tools. Instant messaging  IM  is a form of online communication  that allows real-time interaction through computers or mobile devices. Although  typed  text  remains  the  primary  convention  for  IM,  the  technology  now  allows  users  to  send  images,  audio  and  video  files,  and  other  attachments.  Hundreds  of millions of people use IM to stay connected. In many ways, it epitomizes the  notion  of  the  always-connected,  multitasking  student,  sending  and  receiving  messages at all hours, from a wide spectrum of devices, while doing several other  things at the same time. IM has become such an integral part of students’ lives  that some schools are working to move it beyond the social sphere into teaching  and learning so that students can communicate in real time from home to create  projects. Yahoo and Google offer free instant messaging tools.  Internet telephony  VoIp  Voice  over  Internet  Protocol   VoIP   means  routing  voice  conversations  over  the  Internet  or  through  any  IP-based  network.  In  general,  phone  service  that  uses  VoIP is free or costs less than equivalent service from traditional sources. Skype   www.skype.com , which is owned by eBay, reports that it has 113 million users  around the world. Google Talk is also a free Internet telephony tool.  Four  educators  who  call  themselves  Women  of  Web  2.0   www.womenofWeb2. com  conduct weekly SkypeChats in which they interview other educators whose  experiences  contribute  to  the  body  of  knowledge  about  Web  2.0  and  schools.  Students can use Skype to interview experts, conduct a conversation with groups  of people, and talk to one another as they work collaboratively on projects from  home.  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  69  NEWTOO CH3.indd   69  3 2 09   2:47:19 PM   C h a p t e r   3  new tools  think.com One  excellent  tool  that  is  not  open  source  is  worth  mentioning  because  of  the  philosophy  behind  it.  Think.com   www.think.com   is  an  online  learning  community  run  by  Oracle’s  Education  Foundation.  Think.com  turns  students  into multimedia authors who use Web sites and interactive tools to collaborate on  projects, build knowledge together, and publish their ideas. The advantage that it  has in being proprietary is that it is a password-protected learning community that  allows entry only to member schools and commands a large but vetted audience  for student work.  Google tools   Projects  are  organized  into  topic  categories  that  align  with  the  ThinkQuest  Library  www.thinkquest.org library  . Many of the projects are submitted to the  annual  ThinkQuest  contest,  in  which  students  collaborate  to  create  Web  pages of subject-based content that will  help other students to learn. The tools  they use begin with a Web page builder  that allows them to include text, lists,  and  images.  It  is  template-driven  so  it’s easy to use. All of this takes place  in  a  protected  environment;  accounts  are free but only schools can join and  teachers  assign  student  accounts.  Students  exchange  e-mail  messages  only  with  other  members.  Teachers  can  invite  parents  to  participate  and  even create newsletters for them.  Earth science. Students use Google Earth to  view tectonic plate-shift evidence by exami- ning whole continents, mountain ranges,  and areas of volcanic activity; they also study  impact craters, dry lake beds, and other major  land forms.  Social studies. Students use Google Maps  and start from their home address to plan a  trip to a nearby city, finding hotels, restau- rants, stores, and entertainment. They can  even look for additional information such  as business hours of operation, types of  payment accepted, and reviews.  Geometry. Students use SketchUp to visualize  geometry and other mathematical concepts  by constructing three-dimensional models of  buildings, trees, cars, and other objects.  AdApTEd fROM GOOGlE fOR EdUCATORS    WWW.GOOGlE.COM EdUCATORS  .  F  Google education No  discussion  of  Web-based  tools  is  complete  without  looking  at  Google.  Some  Google  tools  have  already  been  discussed,  but  there’s  even  more  to  talk  about.  Google  has  become  interested  in  helping  educators  use  their  tools  and  integrate  them  into   70  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH3.indd   70  3 2 09   2:47:20 PM   new tools  C h a p t e r   3  classrooms. Google has compiled a group of its programs into a collection of tools  that are particularly appropriate for learning. Called Google for Educators  www. google.com educators  , this part of the Google Web site is a teacher’s guide to  Google products such as Web Search, Earth, Book Search, Maps, Video, Docs &  Spreadsheets,  Blogger,  SketchUp,  Calendar,  Picasa,  and  more.  It  includes  basic  information  about  each  tool,  examples  of  how  educators  are  using  them,  and  lesson  ideas.  Google  invites  users  to  add  materials  too.  A  few  examples  of  the  tools’ potential uses are in the Google Tools sidebar.   On an enterprise level, because educators are concerned with students wandering  around the Web, Google offers Google Apps for your domain, an IT solution that  lets technology administrators provide e-mail, sharable online calendars, instant  messaging tools, and even a dedicated Web site to faculty, students, and staff for  free. Google manages the details.  Where does this leave us? So far, we have quite a collection of useful but disparate  tools. Yet this is only the beginning. If we believe that innovation and ideas will  come  from  the  brightest  minds  no  matter  where  they  are,  open  source  could  provide robust, complex solutions that are improved continually.  educational software  One  possibility  is  that  new  platforms  will  emerge  with  software  designed  for  specific learning tasks, following the model  although not specifically the content   of traditional educational software produced with open-source tools and available  free online. Writer and designer Marc Prensky  2004  proposes that:   the  educational  software  we  use   all  of  it—games,  non-games  and  anything  else,  at  all  levels,  pre-school  to  adult ,  should  be  created  by the ‘world mind,’ should not belong to any of us, and should be  available, for free, to anybody, anywhere, who wants to use it.  n.p.   Bob Tinker  2006 , president of the Concord Consortium, envisions that “a body  of  educational  applications  that  are  all  free,  open  source,  and  maintained  by  a  collaborating community, could result in an exciting new generation of computer- based  learning  activities  that  are  well  designed,  robust,  and  highly  effective”    p. 1. . These would run on any operating system, including Windows, Apple OS,  and Linux.   web 2.0     new tools, new schools  71  NEWTOO CH3.indd   71  3 2 09   2:47:21 PM   C h a p t e r   3  new tools  Tinker  2005  also says:  Students  learn  from  these  tools  and  models  through  guided  explorations of appropriate problems and challenges. To be practical,  these applications need to be embedded in an educational platform  that can deliver complete learning activities online and then assess  student progress as they work through these activities. Teachers and  educators should be able to customize the activities and assessments,  so that they can tailor the learning strategies to the needs and interests  of their students.  n.p.   Open source provides a  rich and growing set of  applications that can be  used as learning tools  and other software that  is designed specifically  for learning.   In the next chapter you will see how Web  2.0  tools  and  applications  are  gaining  a  foothold  in  classrooms  in  a  variety  of  subject areas. As more schools adopt them,  they  will  become  commonplace.  Then  educators  will  begin  to  look  for  and  use  open-source  educational  applications  that  have been created specifically as curricular  tools.  Designers  are  already  at  work  creating  them.  In  Freeing  Educational  Applications,  Robert  Tinker   2005 ,  who  is  in  the  forefront  of  this  development,  describes  some  of  the  applications  already  in  use   see  sidebar,  Open-Source  Educational Software .   In  addition,  there  are  groups  that  fund  open-source  solutions  that  focus  on  educational applications. For example, the Hewlett foundation is funding Open  Educational Resources for teaching, learning, and research resources that reside in  the public domain or have been released under an intellectual property license that  permits their free use or re-purposing by others. These include full courses, course  materials,  modules,  textbooks,  streaming  videos,  tests,  software,  and  any  other  tools, materials, or techniques used to support access to knowledge. Information is  available at www.hewlett.org Programs Education OER openEdResources.htm.  Curriki   www.curriki.org ,  funded  by  Sun  Microsystems,  is  developing  an  open-source  repository  for  educational  content  to  include  tools,  materials,  and  curriculum.  Educators  will  be  able  to  download,  use,  and  enhance  the  content  they find and post their changes to the repository, much the same as open-source  programmers adapt one another’s work and offer the revision to the community.   72  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH3.indd   72  3 2 09   2:47:21 PM   new tools  C h a p t e r   3  Open-Source educational Software  ThE SOfTWARE TOOlS And MOdElS showcased here were designed specifically for  education in a particular discipline area or topic. Most of these are in mathematics and  science, because the national Science foundation has funded almost all this software.  no comparable source of funding exists for educational software.  Mathematics Seeing Math Interactives. The Seeing Math project has developed a series of interactive  software that clarify key mathematical ideas for teachers and students of algebra. five  packages are currently available that allow students to explore various aspects of linear  and quadratic functions. http:  seeingmath.concord.org resources.html  Shodor Software.

Beyond  individual programs, however excellent they may be, a system is needed to analyze  results and predict what will work best.  We’ve argued that it should be possible to use brain-based learning to determine  how each student learns and direct learning activities to them that will address  their  needs.  School  districts  use  data  mining  software  to  analyze  student  test  scores. In one Louisiana middle school, administrators have been experimenting  with using this system to analyze student misbehavior and the effectiveness of  disciplinary actions taken. Data mining and analysis is getting more and more  sophisticated  and  thanks  to  interoperability  standards,  systems  can  share  files   Whiting, 2006 .  Thus, it is not a big leap to consider mining data about every student’s learning  style, retention of information, and interests and then harness what we know from  successes in the past to predict what will be successful for each student in the  future. Eventually every student may get a detailed learning plan that is adjusted  automatically, based on new data.  76  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH3.indd   76  3 2 09   2:47:27 PM   E E    4  new tools in schools  far,   Thus   this  book  has  presented  information  on  the  changing  nature  of  information,  new  ways  our  students  understand  and  make  sense  of  the  world,  and  strategies  for  rethinking  the  ways  teachers can take advantage of new methods  for  teaching  and  learning.  The  book  also  described  these  new  tools  that  offer  new  opportunities for students to learn, explore,  and present their knowledge; these models  are  often  termed  “social  software,”  a  phrase  attributed  to  Clay  Shirky   2003   to  describe  technologies  that  facilitate  group  communication.

This chapter presents concrete examples of ways the new tools are being used or  could be used in various subject areas and with learners at all age or grade levels.  This is not an exhaustive list by any means; rather, it is a compelling sample of  creative ideas.  You may be wondering what new schools really are like; after all, schools have  not really changed in the last century. We provide models of these new schools  along with information from the teachers and administrators who have first-hand  experience with them. We also show examples of the ways students are using the  new tools to learn.  cool schools  You will notice that there are not a lot of examples as of yet in which an entire  school  system  has  reconceptualized  itself  to  incorporate  technology  in  order  to  promote an environment that supports, sustains, and even requires a pedagogical  approach  that  includes  inquiry,  creativity,  and  full  integration  of  technology.  There may be many reasons for this, including caution, funding, leadership, or  competing demands on time. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that some schools  and districts are taking first steps in this process.  New tech high The  New  Technology  High  School  model  uses  in-depth  project-  and  problem- based  learning  that  involves  teamwork,  critical  thinking,  and  communication  skills. Students are assessed with authentic outcomes and get real-time feedback,  and  technology  is  used  to  bind  the  collaborative  learning  community  together.  The New Tech High Learning System is a suite of tools that is currently a Lotus  Notes implementation, but they are working on making the tools available in a  Web Portal version. The system contains curriculum, assessment rubrics, living  grade books, and communication tools.  78  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH4.indd   78  3 2 09   3:01:03 PM   new tools in schools  C h a p t e r   4  teachers   the  way   The  model  was  developed  first  at  Napa  New  Tech  High  School  by  visionary  teachers who knew that technology could help manage their unique collaborative  environment, and later with funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation  as  part  of  the  NTHS  Replication  Project,  which  helps  reinforce  best  practices  by  shaping  think  about  teaching  and  learning.  The  New  Technology  Foundation  has  assisted  14  schools in replicating the New Tech High  model and is working with 14 more during  the 2006 and 2007 school years. Business  projections  show  the  potential  to  grow  to  35 schools, each serving 400 students, by  school  year  2009,  thereby  reaching  more  than 14,000 students and preparing them  for the 21st century.  The most important  aspect of the New  Tech High model is  that it was developed  as part of an overall  education reform effort  and to implement a  21st-century learning  environment.  The  most  important  aspect  of  the  New  Tech High model is that it was developed  as part of an overall education reform effort  and to implement a 21st-century learning  environment.  Its  use  of  collaborative  and  project-based  learning  was  the  first  priority, and they looked at technology to support the pedagogy and philosophy  second. For true reform to take place, according to proponents of the New Tech  High model, pedagogy and technology must find a proper balance.  The results are important to note in this competitive global economy in which  it is imperative to have a significant percentage of students majoring in science,  technology,  engineering,  or  math   STEM   fields.  In  a  study  of  the  first  nine  graduating  classes  from  Napa  New  Tech  High,  40%  of  the  respondents  either  were majoring or were working in STEM professions.  The  program’s  expansion  is  admirable  but  the  weakness  is  the  funding  that  is  needed to make this work. For example, each school needs a Lotus Notes Domino  server,  a  highly  functional  and  reliable  network,  one-to-one  computing,  and  support for pedagogy and technology implementation as well as for infrastructure.  When pedagogical models such as this one are available within the framework  of open-source software, costs are reduced significantly. Then the expansion has  the  potential  to  be  geometric  rather  than  incremental   Computerworld  Honors  Program, 2006 .  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  79  NEWTOO CH4.indd   79  3 2 09   3:01:04 PM   C h a p t e r   4  new tools in schools  Lemon Grove School District The Lemon Grove School District of California faced a large digital divide issue  with respect to technology in homes, and with an innovative solution  partnerships  with cable and other companies in the community  they have been able to launch a  unique and inclusive project, called LemonLINK. According to the LemonLINK Web  site  2007 , “Project LemonLINK establishes a collaborative learning environment  for students, teachers, parents, and members of the Lemon Grove community. The  creation of a comprehensive technology-based educational environment stimulates  students and helps them learn to challenging standards”  n.p. .  The LemonLINK program sought support to develop this collaborative learning  environment by delivering high-speed intranet connectivity between the district  and students’ homes. Students are able to access the Internet and school resources  at school and from home. Parents can easily communicate with teachers.   The evolution of technology integration in the classroom environment  has brought about changes in the structures of teaching and learning.  With  adequate  numbers  of  computers  in  the  classroom,  teachers  report that they are integrating its use in every curriculum area at  every grade level.  LemonLINK, 2007, n.p.   Lemon  Grove  accomplishes  this  with  thin  client  technology.  A  thin  client  is  a  computer   client   that  depends  primarily  on  a  central  server  for  processing  activities  and  contains  no  software,  other  than  that  necessary  to  connect  to  a  network and start up a dedicated Web browser. The district also has a computer-to- student ratio of 1:2. Administrators prepare teachers for new models of learning  by offering more than 120 hours of curriculum-based professional development  to implement technology in their classroom; they work with 20% of the teachers  each year on a five-year rotation cycle.  classroom applications:   using the tools for learning Writing process  Blogs  Using a Web 2.0 site for writing or a blog is similar to keeping a writer’s journal,  and of course, journals serve many purposes. They can be a log of daily activities   80  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH4.indd   80  3 2 09   3:01:05 PM   new tools in schools  C h a p t e r   4  and thoughts, the intellectual musings that become the foundation of a serious  essay or book, or anything in between. Posting thoughts online—even on a class  Web site—is communicating in a public sphere.  Blogs are natural tools for writing instruction. From brainstorming to organizing  to writing, revising, and peer review, they are tools that lend themselves to the  writing process. Since there’s a comment box, blogs are important in peer editing  and sharing thoughts on the ideas presented.  Just  as  students  keep  paper  journals  as  a  class  assignment,  they  can  maintain  individual blogs on a site designed for writing. Because teachers monitor these  pages, students are able to write openly and get thoughtful feedback on their ideas.  When students are ready, their work can be made available to a larger audience  than just classmates. Of course, because of security issues, identities have to be  protected.  Because blogs and other Web 2.0 writing sites can have more of an audience than  just the teacher, students are engaged in sharing, communicating, and exchanging  ideas on a larger scale and see a permanency to their words that a composition  paper can never equal. Because of this audience, students are motivated to learn  how to write responsibly, accurately, clearly, and inoffensively. They are empowered  as  thinkers,  communicators,  and  authors.  One  third-  and  fourth-grade  class  in  Australia offers its students the opportunity to put their digital creative writing  stories  into  a  blog  for  all  to  read   http:  middlepstories.learnerblogs.org .  Other  schools  provide  a  forum  for  their  students  in  all  grades  to  write  about  current  events,  their  experiences,  and  school  activities.  Examples  include  sixth  graders  in England  http:  priestsic6.learnerblogs.org  and first graders in New Zealand   http:  roomonemapua.blogspot.com .  Collaborative Writing  Wikis  Sometimes  one  tool  will  work  well  for  one  type  of  project  and  a  different  tool  will  work  well  for  something  else.  Wikis  are  well  suited  for  projects  in  which  collaborative teams write, revise, update, and contribute on a regular basis. Wikis  keep  track  of  changes  and  teachers  can  monitor  progress  to  see  if  someone  is  taking over or if someone isn’t doing his or her fair share of the work.  Illinois English teacher Jon Orech’s students work on a long-term, independent  literature  circle  project  using  wiki  software.  They  begin  with  reading  a  book,  answering discussion worksheets, and leading a discussion about it online. Each  student must post at least twice a week as groups create book notes that include a   web 2.0     new tools, new schools  81  NEWTOO CH4.indd   81  3 2 09   3:01:05 PM   C h a p t e r   4  new tools in schools  comprehensive summary, biography of the author, passages from the book with  explanations, and an analysis of important themes, symbols, or recurring motifs.  These  tools  are  excellent  resources  for  teaching  English  and  literature,  but  collaborative  writing  projects  can  focus  on  almost  any  subject.  As  you  will  see  later in this chapter, Darren Kuropatwa, a high-school math teacher in Winnipeg,  Manitoba, Canada, created an Applied Math 40S Wiki Solutions Manual  http:   am40s.pbwiki.com .  Students  help  each  other  learn  by  contributing  to  the  manual.  Student Feedback  podcasting  Another teacher, Cheryl Oakes, also uses Web 2.0 tools with her students. Oakes   2006  explains:  As any teacher of technology has experienced, as soon as you learn  a new tool and feel comfortable enough to begin teaching it in your  classroom, that technology is old and you are moving on! Well, be  brave and take a risk, our new digital learners have different strategies,  different needs and totally different outcomes that WORK!  n.p.   Oakes tries to meet them where they are, and so, for example, “Instead of teaching  them about GarageBand, I jumped in and demonstrated how to use GarageBand,  gave them a sentence prompt, asked them to get into groups of 2 to 3 and record  their thoughts. Oh, did I mention these were third graders?” They had just taken  tests online and as a response, she offered them the following prompt:  What did you take? How many questions did you have?   The tests shows ______   I really ______  In 45 minutes, these students came up with thoughtful responses to the online  testing questions, recorded their reflections about taking these tests, listened to  their  responses,  and  asked  if  they  could  delete  and  record  again!  Oakes  stated,  “There  was  purpose;  there  was  a  challenge;  the  outcome  was  incredible  and  featured on my blog. Twenty students recording all at once, not one had to wait  their turn, it just happened.” She then has parents listen to the podcasts or read  students’  thoughts  on  her  blog.

This activity addresses the Maine Guiding  Principles, part of the traditional curriculum for the state, which encourage being  a self-directed lifelong learner and a clear and effective communicator.  Digital Storytelling  Flickr  Digital  storytelling  merges  writing,  photographs,  music,  and  voice  to  create  a  personal  multimedia  story.  It  too  is  valuable  for  teaching  many  subjects.  Students  begin  by  composing  their  narrative,  and  from  it,  synthesize  the  story  into its critical elements to develop a script. They add multimedia to the script by  including photographs, music, and audio and then put it all together in a logical  sequence that is compelling and engaging.  David  Jakes   2005 ,  instructional  technology  coordinator  for  Community  High  School in Downers Grove, Illinois, says, “Digital storytelling helps students explore  the  meaning  of  their  own  experience,  give  value  to  it,  and  communicate  that  experience on multiple levels to others. … [It] not only promotes the development  of life-long learners, but life-long communicators as well”  n.p. .  Teachers  in  his  district  are  using  digital  storytelling  with  students.  English  teacher  Jon  Orech  teaches  sophomores  on  the  college  track  and  those  who  are  learning disabled, and requires two projects annually. The first stems from their  reading  and  involves  their  writing  and  illustrating  personal  history  narratives  similar  in  style  to  what  they  read.  The  second  is  a  digital  inquiry  project  for  a  combined English and history course. This focuses on learning about the events  behind protest songs as they answer the question “How can you maintain a just  and equitable society?” Students use Photo Story 3 to create their presentations.  Orech finds that students work hard, remain engaged, and ask better questions  because they know it will end up in digital media.  Ted Glazier, a physical and health education teacher in the district’s North High  Campus, has students use Flickr  www.flickr.com  in digital storytelling projects.  He has had students create public service announcements on addiction. He also  wanted students to learn to use statistics so he asked them to take two relevant  statistics and make them come alive in a digital story. The images resided behind  the  district’s  firewall  in  a  shared  folder  on  the  network  with  Flickr  usernames  built into the file name so the students would be able to include correct attribution  for them.  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  83  NEWTOO CH4.indd   83  3 2 09   3:01:07 PM   C h a p t e r   4  new tools in schools  Digital Diplomacy  In an effort to expand and improve on the popular digital storytelling projects,  some teachers have moved into “digital diplomacy” using Web 2.0 tools. David Jakes  reports that his project “has enlarged the voice of our students and ‘broadcast’ it to  the larger digital world”  personal communication, 2006 . The educators involved  believe their students have a lot to say to the larger world and can do it through a  digital story format.  They wondered what would happen if “students could tell the story of their lives as  Americans or convey the realities of our culture to other students whose culture is  different or even in direct conflict to theirs”  David Jakes, personal communication,  2006 . They are asking their students and “those on the other side of the world”  to share their experiences, lives, and perspectives with each other. They are doing  this through podcasting stories, and student engagement in understanding the  world has dramatically increased. The educators ask, “Will kids learn as a result?  Does this project constitute enough risk, is it provocative enough, does it use the  tools of their generation to publish something of value, something of meaning,  and in the process, teach them about how they can be lifelong contributors and  what they have to say can make a difference?” While those questions have not been  answered directly, these educators are convinced that it will make a difference.  classroom applications:   teaching content english and Literature When offered a positive and engaging activity, students may suddenly become very  excited about learning literature. At Gunston Middle School in Arlington, Virginia,  an assignment to study poetry was not warmly received by the students, but the  teacher  turned  it  into  an  incredible  opportunity  to  create  a  blog  on  Dickinson,  Frost, and Shakespeare. The students began writing to other students about what  they learned and how they felt about the poems, and then published their work  for others to see and comment upon. Some schools, even elementary ones, are  allowing students to post their original poems, stories, and even illustrated books  to represent their work.  84  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH4.indd   84  3 2 09   3:01:07 PM   new tools in schools  C h a p t e r   4  Chris Sloan is an English, journalism, and new media teacher at Judge Memorial  High  School  in  Salt  Lake  City.  He  is  also  the  technology  liaison  for  the  Utah  Writing Project. Chris has been expanding the use of technology in his courses.  His media students have been using varied tools such as video, text, photographs,  and podcasts  http:  judgemedia.blogspot.com  to improve their communication  and writing skills.  Media Literacy Educators have been talking about and working to teach media literacy since the  first motion pictures entered the classroom. Jackie Marsh  2007 , a library media  specialist from the UK, asks students, “What does a news blog do that a newspaper  doesn’t, and vice versa?”  n.p.  She maintains that by using this simple question  for each Web 2.0 tool, students can begin to see the validity and challenges for  each type of information. Students really need to learn how to question the source  of the information they are seeing on the Web.  Perhaps the most valuable resource in teaching our students about the advantages  and pitfalls in using the information they find on the Web is the American Library  Association  ALA . Its TechSource  www.techsource.ala.org blog 2006 04 a-new- media-information-literacy-tool.html   offers  a  collection  of  information  to  help  educators and parents assist students in understanding and assessing the variety  of resources found online. The organization has also developed an e-learning tool  designed to provide new media information literacy-related content. It includes a  new media resource and reference guide. The organization states, “This project is  intended to introduce students to the key concepts in new media and to address  a host of new media issues including the collapse of distinctions between media  forms and the societal effects of new technologies such as blogs, chat rooms, TiVo,  and Facebook”  ALA TechSource, 2007, n.p. .  A new organization, NewMediaLiteracy.org, has evolved to promote a community  that encourages “technologists, designers, educators, scholars, and businesspeople  to  develop  new  media  projects  for  the  cultivation  of  deep  multimedia  literacy  among all Internet-users”  NewMediaLiteracy.org, 2006, n.p. . The organization  maintains  that  its  “definition  of  ‘literacy’  reaches  beyond  the  technical  skills  one  needs  to  perform  tasks  using  computers  and  networked  information  and  encompasses the critical faculties one needs to evaluate, criticize, and learn from  those resources.” The group provides interesting resources for teachers to assist in  their efforts to prepare their students for Web 2.0 curricular lessons.  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  85  NEWTOO CH4.indd   85  3 2 09   3:01:08 PM   C h a p t e r   4  new tools in schools  Social Studies During  a  course  of  study  in  American  history,  students  investigate  the  theme  of what it means to be American in a pluralistic society. One way students can  explore  this  question  is  by  conducting  oral  histories  with  family  members  and  creating a presentation of the interviews. In this way, students begin to develop  a  better  understanding  of  their  own  family  history  as  a  means  for  framing  a  discussion as well as an understanding of who they are themselves. Web 2.0 tools  are uniquely suited for this task. After a discussion on what it means to be an  American, students can use an iPod and a voice recorder to interview a family  member. They can then combine the interview with old photos of that relative in  iMovie, and create a short video history about that person. The final movies can  be presented to the class.  One history professor has dedicated his professional life to making history come  alive by telling the stories of the people who experienced all the events that sound  rather dry in textbooks. Professor Bob Packett loves to tell stories of the real people  behind the often sterile descriptions found in history texts. He has now created  podcasts filled with anecdotes, quips, and humor, presented in a conversational  manner, to “bring to life the characters of history”  Packett, 2007, n.p.; see www. summahistorica.com . The Organization of American Historians has also created  Talking  History  podcasts  that  focus  on  themes  and  periods  of  history   http:   talkinghistory.oah.org . The podcasts include titles such as American Gunfight  and Negro League Baseball.  Abbe Museum, in Bar Harbor, Maine, encourages the participation of students  in learning about Maine’s Native American tribes and then demonstrating their  knowledge through the creation of movies for the museum. Their online exhibit,  Wabanaki People—A Story of Cultural Continuity, will feature some of the best  movies.  The  museum  also  provides  support  for  teachers  who  want  to  use  the  technologies to help their students gather information and create novel approaches  to learning  www.abbemuseum.org wabanaki.html .  April  Chamberlain,  a  former  fourth-grade  teacher   now  district  technology  specialist   at  Paine  Intermediate  School  in  Trussville,  Alabama,  created  a  blog  to give her students a chance to communicate with soldiers who are fighting in  Iraq. The interaction on this blog includes many questions from students about  the  daily  life  of  the  soldiers   www.paineandthesoldiers.blogspot.com .

Each will be able to present the other with  a richer array of creative expression, and each will be more connected  to the other as these compositions become part of the daily library. The  challenge for teachers and teacher-educators is to find compelling uses  of composition tools and portable media devices to compete with the  offerings on YouTube or through iTunes, or at least find a complementary  niche. Otherwise, students’ use of these tools and devices will become  a nuisance that is as bad as or worse than cell phones. And while cell  phones are a nuisance within the classroom, digital media have the  potential to gain the attention of the world—for better or for worse.  Thankfully, the Internet provides access to teachers who are modeling  the use of composition tools and new media in social studies. Two such  models are Eric Langhorst of Liberty, Missouri, and Dan McDowell  of Santee, California. Mr. Langhorst’s blog  http:  speakingofhistory. blogspot.com; “Teaching about George, Thomas and Abe using the latest  technology”  provides links to his classroom site and a library of podcasts  created for his students. These podcasts demonstrate his application of  this new technology to his classroom practice, such as the studycasts he  posts before tests, guiding the students through a review of the material.  Dan McDowell’s site  http:  ahistoryteacher.com  models innovative uses  of wikis, including student compositions of compelling, historically-based  branching narratives  http:  ahistoryteacher.com ~ahistory apwhreview  .  Not unlike Lewis and Clark mapping the Louisiana Purchase, Langhorst  and McDowell and other innovative social studies teachers are charting  the instructional territory that new Web-based technologies have opened  up. Their examples of rich practice should serve as a source inspiration  for teachers, administrators, teacher-educators, and education researchers.  Tom Hammond is an experienced social studies teacher and a doctoral  candidate at the University of Virginia.  88  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH4.indd   88  3 2 09   3:01:11 PM   new tools in schools  C h a p t e r   4  Journalism, Broadcasting, and Video production Many schools at all grade levels are instituting journalism or broadcast courses  and  experiences  for  their  students.  This  type  of  curriculum  often  meets  the  standards for communications, creative writing, and technology. Web 2.0 tools are  particularly suited for this curriculum area, because citizen journalism “is the act  of citizens playing an active role in the process of collecting, reporting, analyzing  and disseminating information”  Bowman & Willis, 2003, n.p. .  Communication is oral as well as written, and a traditional way to teach students  to  understand  their  own  environment  is  to  create  a  classroom  daily  newscast.  These news broadcasts used to be compiled by a special group of students and  used a school’s sound system as the audio. We might question whether anyone  listened. Today, the process can be egalitarian; every class can create a news show  using podcasts or video that can be saved and heard by other students, parents,  and the community at the listeners’ convenience.  Some high schools are publishing their newspapers online as well as in paper,  and they provide podcasts as well as open blogs for their students. The Hunterdon  Central  Regional  High  School  in  Flemington,  New  Jersey,  is  one  school  using  this  innovative  technique.  Its  newspaper,  Journalism2   J2   at  HCRHS,  offers  stories,  blogs,  and  podcasts  relevant  to  its  audience   http:  central.hcrhs.k12. nj.us journ2  .  In fact, the My High School Journalism Web site  www.myhighschooljournalism. org  provides links to hundreds of high-school papers  481 at last count! , as well  as  dozens  of  middle-  and  elementary-school  papers.  The  site’s  organizers  also  mine the papers for the “best of the best” and provide links to those as models.  Individuals  can  search  for  their  local  paper  by  state  or  city.  Another  site,  Cool  School  Newsletters,  Newspapers  and  Magazines   http:  eduscapes.com tap  topic97.htm  also provides links and information to assist students in electronic  journalism.  And  a  third,  Making  the  News   http:  mtn.e2bn.net rostra news. php?r=1&t=2&id=14 , provides a free online publishing system for schools hosted  by the National Education Network that enables teachers and pupils to share and  promote their learning experiences over the World Wide Web. This organization  allows students and schools to have their news made available through broadcast  using text, images, animation, audio, and video. Online publishing, in real time,  is available by filling in an easy-to-use story submission form.  Journalism, broadly defined, does not have to be limited to high-school students.  More specifically, there are examples of young students reporting on significant   web 2.0     new tools, new schools  89  NEWTOO CH4.indd   89  3 2 09   3:01:11 PM   C h a p t e r   4  new tools in schools  personal events. Bob Sprankle teaches third and fourth grade at Wells Elementary  School in Wells, Maine. His classroom is Room 208, the name of the Web site  where he and his students post news updates and links regularly. Students have  their own pages but they also have areas for group projects such as poetry and  journals. They also produce podcasts.  In  May  2006,  southern  Maine  experienced  the  worst  flooding  since  the  1930s.  How  would  anyone  know  this?  Quite  simply,  one  can  listen  to  students  in  Sprankle’s  third-  and  fourth-grade  classroom  podcast  about  the  disaster   www. bobsprankle.com blog    in  Wells,  Maine.  Students  told  stories  about  their  own  personal  experiences  during  the  flood.  Beyond  headlines,  if  you  wanted  to  hear  what  happened  to  real  children  and  their  families,  this  was  the  way.  One  teacher  related her story of using a wet vacuum to  pump water from the garage and posed a  potential  math  problem  about  how  many  gallons of water she and her husband had  pumped  out  over  nine  hours.  Students  questioned  one  another  about  practical  concerns  and  doing  without  things  that  one takes for granted. How better to experience an event than by listening to the  narratives of those who lived through it, especially the voices of children.  How better to  experience an event  than by listening to  the narratives of those  who lived through it,  especially the voices   of children.  The  potential  for  new  journalists  to  learn  skills  that  may  be  used  throughout  their careers is exciting. The Association of Electronic Journalists has recognized  educators’ needs concerning the technical and pedagogical strategies required to  fully implement new technologies in journalism courses or projects  www.rtnda. org hsj  . They offer workshops and even seed grants to assist in the challenge.  They also have suggestions for lessons, a student handbook, and a teacher guide  to establishing such programs. This organization offers a document to assist with  broadcast and journalism projects, Plugged In: Using the Internet for High School   and Professional  Journalism  www.rtnda.org hsj pluggedin.pdf .  Taking this idea a step further, the Radio Television News Directors Association  was  funded  to  start  a  High  School  Broadcast  Journalism  Project.  This  group  matches  schools  to  broadcast  stations  for  dissemination  of  video  and  podcasts,  supports educators in learning about using the Web 2.0 tools in their journalism  classes, and provides a forum for teacher interaction on the topic. It also started a   90  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH4.indd   90  3 2 09   3:01:12 PM   new tools in schools  C h a p t e r   4  Student Television Network  STN  to foster the interaction by students about their  journalism activities  http:  hsbj.org .  Math The  possibilities  of  using  Web  2.0  tools  in  studying  mathematics  are  almost  unlimited. In one lesson developed for young learners, students work in groups to  create their own rhymes and songs for an entire family of math facts. Individual  students record their math fact creations using an iPod and a voice recorder. The  class then has a complete collection of math rhymes that can be used in class or  saved on a CD for students to use at home.  Darren Kuropatwa, a high-school math teacher in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada,  created an Applied Math 40S Wiki Solutions Manual  http:  am40s.pbwiki.com .  Students help each other learn by contributing to the manual. Participation counts  in students’ grades, and they have to make at least two edits or contributions to the  wiki. One must be a significant contribution and the other must be a constructive  modification.  He provides a table with a list of links to the various units that the class studies  in his course. There are problems and also basic skills questions for students to  solve in each unit. In solving these problems, students have to use all the skills  they’ve learned in class. They also tackle test questions that the class hasn’t done  well with in the past. Kuropatwa tells his students, “Solving them here, in a low  pressure environment, will help prepare you to ace your tests and the final exam”   2007, n.p. . Students have to solve the problems and show how they solved them  by including annotated calculations and interpretations. Darren blogs at the Web  site A Difference  http:  adifference.blogspot.com .   Ms. Armstrong was a student teacher at Daniel McIntyre Collegiate High School  in  Winnipeg,  Manitoba,  Canada  in  2006.  She  created  a  number  of  blogs  that  her  students  contributed  to  enthusiastically,  including  notes  and  homework  assignments,  along  with  general  math  discussions.  One  of  these  included  the  activity  Gummy  Bears—A  Graduated  Jellybean   http:  gr10pc-gb.blogspot.com   2006 09 multiplying-and-dividing-polynomials.html .

Since I made several changes in teaching practices this year, I can  in no way attribute all performance changes to the blog, but I honestly believe that  student  understanding,  motivation,  and  persistence  has  greatly  improved  since  the incorporation of the blog.”  Students  in  Chris  Harbeck’s  Grade  8  math  classes  at  Sargent  Park  School  in  Winnipeg, Manitoba, use two blog sites  http:  sp8mathextentions.blogspot.com  and  http:  sargentparkmathzone.blogspot.com   to  get  updates  and  assignments  for their math class. Students are required to complete assignments  usually math  games  and then post their results on the blog. Harbeck also created a student- written wiki  Welcome to Sargent Parks Grade 8 Math Interactive Guide Book,  http:  sargentparkmath.pbwiki.com .

The  teaching  of  mathematics  can  be  exciting  and  challenging.  In  the  Web  2.0  Wisdom  sidebar  entitled  Web  2.0  in  Math  Education,  Christopher  Johnston  provides insight into ways that new tools can assist students and teachers.  web 2.0 wisdom  Web 2.0 in Math education Christopher Johnston  During my eight years of middle-school teaching, my students had  regular opportunities to write about the mathematics they were learning.  These writing opportunities included daily journals where students  reflected upon the day’s lesson, in-class writing prompts about the day’s  lesson, and short answer essay questions on assessments. The purposes  of these writing assignments were generally two-fold: to allow students  to reflect upon their own thinking, and to give me an insight into their  thinking.  E E E  92  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH4.indd   92  3 2 09   3:01:13 PM   new tools in schools  C h a p t e r   4  E E  When students reflect upon not only their own writing, but also the  writing of fellow classmates, the results can be even more powerful.  Technology, specifically a blog, can be used to make this process more  interactive for the students. For example, a class is given a “problem of  the week” to consider. On Monday, the teacher posts the problem on  the blog, which would most likely be related to a concept the students  are currently studying. Students are given a day to think about how  they would solve that problem. Then, on Tuesday, students would begin  posting their responses. Their responses would include answers to the  following questions: What strategies did I use to solve the problem? Was  there more than one way for me to solve the problem? What did I learn as  I solved the problem?  Note that this is not simply an exercise in solving  a problem and then telling how it was solved.  Then, over the next two  days, students would have the opportunity to read their fellow classmates’  responses. Students would be encouraged to respond to their classmates’  work, with the understanding that constructive criticism has already  been established as part of the classroom culture. Students would also  have the chance to revise their responses by posting a new response, not  simply deleting an old one. On Friday, the teacher would share some of  the problem-solving strategies and reflections in class.  There are many benefits to the model I propose. First, there is a  permanent record of students’ reflection and thought. Since no one  would be able to delete a posting, all ideas would be available to both  students and teacher for further reflection. Second, students, especially at  the middle-school level, are more likely to be motivated to write if they are  using a blog or other technology tool than if they are simply writing on  paper. Third, students would have the opportunity to share their writing  with other students in a nonthreatening environment, thereby allowing  the “shy” students, the ones who don’t speak up in class, to participate  to the same degree as any other student. Finally, and perhaps most  importantly, students are engaged in an ongoing metacognitive process  in which they are reflecting upon their thinking and strategies.

Web 2.0 tools provide excellent ways to help  students  understand  cultural  aspects  of  the  world  and  particularly  to  find  out  something about the physical attributes of their own and other countries.  Geography  Matters  is  a  blog  and  set  of  activities  designed  to  teach  students  the  importance  of  this  subject.  “At  the  elementary  level,  students  are  naturally  curious  about  the  world  around  them,”  writes  Steve  Pierce   2006,  p.  1   of  the  National Council for Geographic Education  NCGE  Curriculum and Instruction  Committee,  in  his  overview  of  elementary  geography  clubs.  Do  you  remember  playing  hide-and-go-seek  or  going  on  a  scavenger  hunt  as  a  kid?  Well  it  seems  this old-time favorite has taken on a new dimension in a hobby called geocaching,  in which individuals and organizations set up caches  a logbook or a waterproof  container   around  the  world  and  share  the  locations  of  them  on  the  Internet.  People use a GPS device and coordinates to find the caches, which might include  various rewards.  One example of a Web 2.0 tool useful for geography education is World 66  www. world66.com ,  which  allows  users  to  customize  a  map  of  the  world  for  their  personal travels or for an assignment to investigate a particular place. Further,  individuals can contribute to the site. For instance, if your class disagrees with the  description of a place, students can change it there and then. The site describes  itself as “the travel guide you write.” Another example of a site allowing pupils to  contribute is the Royal Geographical Society’s Geography in the News Web site   www.geographyinthenews.rgs.org . These are examples of geo-blogs.  National Geographic recently started a new program, My Wonderful World  www. mywonderfulworld.org ,  to  expand  geographic  learning  in  schools,  homes,  and  throughout the community. This site offers a variety of tools to assist educators in  teaching geography at age-appropriate levels.  One  evolving  tool  that  can  make  geography  exciting  is  Google  Earth,  basically  a  globe  that  sits  inside  your  PC.  You  can  point  and  zoom  to  any  place  on  the  planet that you wish to explore, as satellite images and local facts zoom into view.  One  Web  site  that  helps  teachers  use  Google  Earth  and  other  Web  2.0  tools  is  Juicy  Geography   www.juicygeography.co.uk ,  which  offers  lesson  plans  and  complementary  ideas  for  encouraging  and  supporting  student  engagement  in  geography activities. Some of the best geography-based activities are fly-overs that  can  be  exported  to  a  video.  This  blending  of  technology  and  curriculum  helps   94  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH4.indd   94  3 2 09   3:01:15 PM   new tools in schools  C h a p t e r   4  students  experience  events  and  places  in  deep  and  analytical  ways.  Val  Vannet  found this to be the case when she prepared her students for a class trip to Iceland  with  an  exciting  advanced  organizer   www.hsdiceland.blogspot.com .  Another  tool,  NASA’s  World  Wind   http:  worldwind.arc.nasa.gov ,  lets  you  zoom  from  satellite altitude into any place on Earth through satellite imagery and topography  data. World Wind lets you experience Earth terrain in visually rich 3D, just as if  you were really there.  english as a Second Language   and english Language Learners Learning a new language requires the development of listening, speaking, and  memory  skills.  Finding  new  approaches  and  using  varied  methodologies  is  beneficial to both the teacher and learner. For middle-school students, motivation  is a key factor in the learning and retention of knowledge. Using the iPod as a  “language  lab”  is  a  sure  way  to  garner  interest.  It  allows  students  to  record  vocabulary,  conduct  question  and  answer  conversations,  check  pronunciation,  and store their language exercise for instant replay and evaluation. In this type  of  project,  students  can  brainstorm  topics  for  a  conversation  to  be  held  in  the  language  they  are  studying.  Students  generate  questions  and  hold  practice  conversations. Once a practice conversation has been generated, pairs of students  record questions and answers with an iPod and a voice recorder. When they are  satisfied  with  the  product,  the  conversation  is  downloaded  onto  a  computer,  renamed, and listened to by the teacher for evaluation. The recordings can be kept  on the iPods for students to replay.  When families immigrate to the United States, it is sometimes challenging for  them to learn a new language and become familiar with the community in which  they  live.  In  one  project  in  Grand  Island  Nebraska,  English  language  learners   ELL   use  an  iPod  and  other  technology  tools  to  help  them  develop  language  skills  and  learn  more  about  their  new  surroundings   http:  images.apple.com  education solutions ipod pdf 0221205_iPod_LocalHistory.pdf .  The  project  incorporates  multiple  intelligences  through  the  use  of  text,  audio,  and image files. English language learners are assigned a lesson that focuses on  research, reading, writing, and presentation skills. The students work individually  and in small groups to conduct research on their community. Students compile  the results of their research, write a report, and create a presentation slideshow.  They add appropriate images to illustrate each area of research. Students use an   web 2.0     new tools, new schools  95  NEWTOO CH4.indd   95  3 2 09   3:01:16 PM   C h a p t e r   4  new tools in schools  iPod and a voice recorder to create recordings of their report in both English and  their native language. The audio files are added to the presentations.  Science Science experiments can be challenging for students, especially if they are visual  learners  and  have  a  difficult  time  with  written  or  oral  instructions.  By  using  recordings of the teacher’s instructions and student observations combined with  photos of an experiment’s progress, all students can review what occurred. It’s a  great way to reinforce student learning and to share experiments with students  who weren’t there. This technique can be applied to any science experiment. The  teacher uses an iPod and a voice recorder to provide experiment instructions to  small groups of students. Students listen to the directions first, then they observe  and record their experiment steps and results using a digital camera and an iPod.  The images and audio are then combined in an iMovie project or on an iPod photo   if available  to share with others.  In Norwalk, California, Margaret Munoz of Corvallis Middle School  which has  a mostly economically disadvantaged student population  adopted a technology- infused,  project-based  learning  model  and  her  students  excelled.  They  used  iMovie to demonstrate their understanding of the concepts. She notes that their  level of engagement has increased significantly and their grades clearly indicate  that fact  www.apple.com education profiles corvallis  . Munoz  2006  states:  I had a student who made an iMovie for a science class that clearly  demonstrated that he understood the material, and his project was  just wonderful. Several other teachers wondered why he’d put in so  much effort, as he isn’t doing much in any of his other classes. I told  everyone, “This is what students can do when they’re excited about  learning!” Using tools like iMovie and the Mac mini computers, our  students’ level of engagement is just amazing.  n.p.   One  science  teacher  decided  to  get  students  in  his  physics  class  involved  in  a  project called Scribes, in which students keep a class blog. Each day a different  student  is  given  the  responsibility  of  updating  the  blog.  They  post  class  notes,  pictures, upcoming assignments, and useful links.  This  Week  in  Science   www.twis.org   offers  a  weekly  adventure  through  podcasting.

They  are  presented  as  works  in progress, with requests for comments from the listeners.

We  hope that these resources may assist other teachers to start this adventure. The  selection we have presented is by no means exhaustive and, in fact, it’s hard to keep  up with all the creative ideas. The educational applications seem limitless. One  school, for instance, asked students to use podcasts to record thoughts, memories,  and wishes as they moved from middle to  high school. A dance teacher has students  create  their  own  movies  to  examine  their  form and grace, and an art teacher uses the  tools for nature journaling and for artistic  renderings, such as sketches and paintings,  of a particular location and its surroundings.  An AP psychology class produces podcasts  to assist in demonstrating their knowledge  and studying new topics.  One thing is certain:  we are at the very  beginning of this  evolution and many   of you reading this book  will be creating new  ideas and projects that  others will want to   hear about.  One particular example demonstrates the  brightest  possibilities  for  incorporating  the  best  models  of  teaching,  learning,  and  student-driven  content  activities.  ThinkQuest   www.thinkquest.org   began  as a contest in 1996 and worked to encourage students and teachers across the  globe to design and implement intellectually challenging, project-based learning  experiences.

The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001  U.S. Department of Education, 2001  also  added pressure by increasing technology standards for teachers and by making  high-stakes testing more pervasive than ever before  Amrein & Berliner, 2003 .  Unfortunately,  even  though  massive  amounts  of  money  have  been  spent  on  training educators, we have not seen a real difference in the ways technology has  been integrated into the classroom  Cuban, 2001; Laffey, 2004; Norris, Sullivan,  Poirot,  &  Solloway,  2003;  Williams  &  Kingham,  2003 .  According  to  the  U.S.  Department of Education  2004 , we have not done a particularly stellar job, as a  recent report concluded:  We  have  not  realized  the  promise  of  technology  in  education.  Essentially,  providing  the  hardware  without  adequate  training  in  its  use—and  in  its  endless  possibilities  for  enriching  the  learning  experience—meant  that  the  great  promise  of  Internet  technology  was  frequently  unrealized.  Computers,  instead  of  transforming  education, were often shunted to a “computer room,” where they were  little used and poorly maintained. Students mastered the wonders of  the Internet at home, not in school. Today’s students, of almost any  age, are far ahead of their teachers in computer literacy.  p. 10   The  federal  government  has  done  more  than  study  the  problem.  In  particular,  it  published  the  National  Educational  Technology  Plan   U.S.  Department  of  Education, 2004 , first framed under the presidency of Bill Clinton and revised  and approved by Congress in January 2005. The plan lists these seven major steps  and recommendations for implementing technology in our schools:   1  Strengthen leadership  2  Consider innovative budgeting  3  Improve teacher training  4  Support e-learning and virtual schools  E  Encourage broadband access  6  Move toward digital content  7  Integrate data systems  U.S. Department of Education, 2004, n.p.   100  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH5.indd   100  3 2 09   3:02:06 PM   professional development  C h a p t e r   5  Professional developers have tended to design programs that attempt to implement  strategies  to  change  practice;  unfortunately,  when  the  support  and  funding  disappear, frequently so does the change in practice. Furthermore, brief classes  or workshops without ongoing support seem to create few substantive changes   Cuban,  2001;  Pelligrino,  2004;  Sandholtz,  Ringstaff,  &  Dwyer,  2000;  Schrum,  1999 .  The  research  firm  Market  Data  Retrieval  claims  that  more  than  80%  of  public  schools in the United States have broadband service, which suggests that many  educators  have  seen  some  form  of  technology  related  to  the  Internet  in  their  schools  Lindquist, 2004 . If you are reading this book, we assume you may have  resources well beyond broadband. Yet even with modern technology in so many  schools, it is not being utilized in the way that has been envisioned.  Typically, teachers have been seen as one cause for this shortfall  Cuban, 2001 .  Many  schools  have  attempted  to  provide  useful  professional  development  programs  to  prepare  teachers  to  integrate  technology  into  their  curriculum.  Traditional  staff  development  has  tended  to  be  based  on  one  model:  a  one-day  session, often four hours right after school when everyone is tired and focused  on other issues. Frequently the school hires an expert who arrives, delivers the  program, and goes home. Most typically, the entire teaching staff is required to  show up for the session.  Variations  on  the  one-day  program  have  evolved;  for  example,  a  district  or  individual school might choose a topic for an expanded version—an entire year  of  intensive  staff  development,  often  a  “hot  topic”  found  in  the  popular  press.  Regardless,  they  tend  to  be  of  the  “chalk  and  talk”  or  “spray  and  pray”  variety.  Unfortunately, there is very little evidence that these make much difference. The  research on professional development is extensive; however, most of it documents  the  inadequacies.  Further,  readers  of  that  body  of  literature  are  often  faced  with  contradictory  statements   Guskey,  1999 .  Fullan  and  Stiegelbauer   1991   summarized  this  by  saying,  “Nothing  has  promised  so  much  and  has  been  so  frustratingly wasteful as the thousands of workshops and conferences that led to  no significant change in practice when the teachers returned to their classrooms”   p. 315 .  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  101  NEWTOO CH5.indd   101  3 2 09   3:02:06 PM   C h a p t e r   5  professional development  creating effective programs  Most frequently, when working with adults, you will want to “meet them where they  are” rather than assuming a “one size fits all” model. There are multiple ways to  assess any group of faculty members, but again, using the technology will provide  support in two ways. First, it states clearly that this is of utmost importance to  you, and second, any additional experiences are going to prove useful and support  teachers’ confidence.  In his 2000 book Evaluating Professional Development, University of Kentucky  Professor  of  Education  Thomas  Guskey  outlines  a  comprehensive  five-step  evaluation program. The components are:  participants’ reactions. Evaluation at this level identifies the appropriateness of  a program’s content, process, and context. Was the content appropriate? Was  the presenter knowledgeable? Was the coffee hot?  participants’  learning.  What  are  participants’  beliefs  toward  the  professional  development topic, and has the event changed those attitudes and beliefs?  Organizational  support  and  change.  Does  the  organization  have  the  tools,  services, and policies in place to support the training experience once teachers  return to the classroom?  participants’  use  of  new  knowledge.  Did  participants  implement  what  they  learned? Did it change classroom practice?  Student learning. Did the experience improve student learning? In most cases,  that should be the most important question to ask.  preservice learning  In addition to the efforts by school districts, universities have provided classes and  professional  development  for  teacher  candidates.  These  efforts  were  expanded  through  the  Department  of  Education’s  Preparing  Tomorrow’s  Teachers  to  use  Technology  PT3  grant program from 1999 through 2003. Some PT3 studies in  particular looked at the barriers and challenges to technology integration, such as  alignment with the curriculum, peer support, and faculty involvement  Brzycki &  Dudt, 2005; Staples, Pugach, & Himes, 2005 .  102  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH5.indd   102  3 2 09   3:02:07 PM   professional development  C h a p t e r   5  Other  studies  have  addressed  the  growing  challenge  in  modern  education  to  remediate the fact that most teachers still feel uncomfortable using technology  in  their  teaching   Seels,  Campbell,  &  Talsma,  2003;  Strudler  &  Grove,  2002 .  With all of the support and training seemingly provided, many teachers are still  viewed as resistant to integrating technology on a more frequent basis. Now we are  requesting that educators change their practice in various ways to take advantage  of the opportunities of Web 2.0. How should a school or a district go about this,  given  the  poor  performance  of  previous  professional  development  activities,  especially as related to technology? One way might be to incorporate communities  of practice into educators’ daily routine and lives.  communities of practice  The investigative focus of recent theories of learning has gradually moved from  the individual as learner to learning as participation in the social world, including  numerous ways individuals are shaped by and shape the surrounding world  Lave  & Wenger, 1991 . As a result, another body of learning theories has blossomed  with an emphasis on the social and cultural context of learning. Among those  theories is situated cognition, which defines learning as a process of participation  in communities of practice. Situated learning means that it takes place in a specific  context. Lave  1988  suggests that most learning occurs naturally through activities,  contexts, and cultures, but schools too often abstract learning, “unsituate” it, and  teach concepts removed from natural contexts and applications.  This  is  particularly  true  of  professional  development  activities  too.  We  often  provide “just in case” training rather than “just in time” training, which provides  educators  with  information  they  need  just  as  they  need  it.  Just  as  Web  2.0  encourages the use of tools to engage and promote problem solving in authentic  contexts, Web 2.0 should be used authentically to enable educators to understand  and become comfortable with the tools and their potential as preparation for using  them in their classrooms.  Dede  2003  notes:  Emerging  devices,  tools,  media,  and  virtual  environments  offer  opportunities  for  creating  new  types  of  learning  communities  for  students and teachers. Examples of “learning communities” include a  national mix of kids working together to create an online encyclopedia   web 2.0     new tools, new schools  103  NEWTOO CH5.indd   103  3 2 09   3:02:08 PM   C h a p t e r   5  professional development  about Harry Potter’s fictional world, or groups of mentor and novice  teachers  in  Milwaukee  sharing  ideas  about  effective  instruction.   n.p.    Dede’s suggestions for how students might create a learning community provide  insight into how educators might use the tools to learn about the tools but, more  important, to promote a learning community that fosters interaction, collaboration,  and improved practice.  The participation is considered “legitimately peripheral” in the beginning, but it  gradually increases in conviction and engagement with a community of practice   Lave  &  Wenger,  1991 .  The  term  legitimately  implies  that  newcomers  are  not  excluded from various activities of a community but involved in such activities.  Wenger  1998  suggests that a community of practice defines itself along three  essential  dimensions—joint  enterprise,  mutual  engagement,  and  shared  repertoire. The first dimension, joint enterprise, refers to what the community is  about as it is understood, defined, and continuously redefined by its members. It  also implies a regime of mutual accountability, meaning that members negotiate  the  goals  and  characteristics  of  their  community,  and  thus,  are  responsible  for  how they are defined in a collective sense. Members of a community are engaged  in common activities that often take the form of group collaboration to pursue  their professional goals and interests. The second dimension describes a mutual  engagement that functions to bind a community of practice together into a social  entity. The last dimension, shared repertoire, refers to a wide range of artifacts  that were developed by members of the community over time. The repertoire may  include traditional documentary sources, routines, vocabulary, or styles that both  articulate shared experience and record the history of a community.  Another view of communities of practice is explained by Bielaczyc and Collins   1999 ,  who  suggest  that  the  defining  quality  of  a  learning  community  is  that  there is a culture of learning in which everyone is involved in a collective effort of  understanding. They propose that such a culture must include four characteristics:  a  diversity  of  expertise  among  its  members,  a  shared  objective  of  continually  advancing the collective knowledge and skills, an emphasis on learning how to  learn, and mechanisms for sharing what is learned. If a learning community is  presented with a problem, then the learning community can bring its collective  knowledge to bear on the problem. The importance of the community element  has been emphasized by various researchers  Rovai, 2001 . They have argued that  a  strong  feeling  of  community  increases  the  willingness  to  share  information,  the passion to support each other, and the collaborative efforts to complete joint   104  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH5.indd   104  3 2 09   3:02:09 PM   professional development  C h a p t e r   5  activities.  Sharing  interests  is  not  enough  for  people  to  form  a  community  of  practice; rather, people form a community of practice through interaction while  pursuing their interests  Wenger, 2001 . Therefore, interaction and the resulting  relationships are the most important catalysts in forming a community  Schwier,  2001 .  Communities  of  practice  are  assisted  by  following  some  simple  suggestions  in  organizing and planning the way these communities are structured. An article  by  Susan  Taylor   2006   suggests  the  following  strategies  to  support  virtual  communities:  E  Establish regular times for team interaction  E  Send agendas to participants beforehand  E  Designate a team librarian  E  Build and maintain a team archive  E  Use visual forms of communication where possible  E  Set formal rules for communication and or technology use  n.p.   In  addition,  continued  energy  to  maintain  participation  and  enthusiasm  from  members is required. The ideas in Encouraging Participation, from an article by  Trena Noval  2006  on techLEARNING.com, are appropriate to think about when  any type of professional development is being considered, and perhaps especially  when dealing with Web 2.0. These ideas will help keep members energized and  participatory in a professional development community.  encouraging participation  Professional learning communities can be wonderful and exhilarating places  for teachers to grow, learn, and collaborate. communities that meet regularly face-to- face have that built-in ability to encourage participation—but this can be a little harder  to maintain in online communities. Here are some tips to help keep your community  actively collaborative and thriving through members’ participation.  Create an environment of trust  E   involve all members in developing goals for the community.  E E E  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  105  NEWTOO CH5.indd   105  3 2 09   3:02:10 PM   C h a p t e r   5  professional development  E  eliminate confusion  through participation.  E  make sure they understand the purpose of your community, what they will gain   E  make sure they are clear on how the community works—this will illuminate   frustration by members which can lead to lost participation.  Create productive dialogue Make learning interactive  E   if your community is local, try to have monthly or at least a few face-to-face  meetings a year with the group so that they have opportunities to meet in  person.  E  Have a way for them to post short bios, their interests, curriculum ideas,   teaching environment profiles, and maybe even a picture.  E  Have a place for teachers to post questions, ideas, or things that they might   want help with or to collaborate on.  E   if you are a remote community, use discussion boards or live chats, or set up a  listserv for your community to talk to each other on a regular basis.  E  create a space where teachers can share resources and discuss how they have   used them.  have teachers share what they are doing on a regular basis  E  give them the opportunity to ask each other questions.  E  allow for brainstorming sessions with the community participants.  E  Have a show-and-tell about projects or successful learning strategies that they   have had with their students or at their school.  Give constructive feedback and support as a facilitator  E  make sure that there is a way for your community members to receive feedback   and encouragement—if these are done constructively it can go a long way to  keep your members happy and engaged!  F  106  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH5.indd   106  3 2 09   3:02:13 PM   professional development  C h a p t e r   5  One  of  the  most  long-lived  and  well-respected  educational  Web  sites  is  Tapped  In   http:  tappedin.org ,  which  is  credited  with  pioneering  a  multi-user  virtual  environment. Lectures, interactive conversations, and other resources all reside  in Tapped In; however, it is important to recognize that this community, just like  all communities of practice, has to work to maintain user motivation and interest.  Christine Greenhow  2006  suggests social networking strategies in the following  Web 2.0 Wisdom sidebar.   web 2.0 wisdom  Supporting teachers’ Development of extended  Social Networks for teaching and Learning Christine Greenhow  Social networkS affect the way schools respond to innovation;  therefore, we as teacher educators ought to cultivate an understanding  of how generative networks develop and how we can help teachers and  students use Web 2.0 tools to facilitate them.  Having worked with teacher educators, teachers, and students on the  integration of emerging Web-based technologies into their teaching and  learning practices, I offer the following recommendation to technology  coordinators, administrators, and library media specialists who seek to  help teachers take advantage of the social-networking capabilities of Web  2.0 technologies.   recommendation 1 Help teachers uncover and make transparent their notions   of the classroom community.   Teachers often seek to use popular new technologies found on the  Internet without examining their values and assumptions about teaching  and learning and considering how these fit with technology’s potential.  In using the social-networking capabilities of Web 2.0 to their advantage,  teachers may need help identifying and making explicit their notions of   E E E  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  107  NEWTOO CH5.indd   107  3 2 09   3:02:14 PM   C h a p t e r   5  professional development  E E  time and space and where and with whom learning and teaching ought  to occur in order to reconcile traditional beliefs with the technology’s  potential.   Consider teachers’ use of Web logs, for example. I have found that  often a teacher’s goal for using a class blog is to get students to reflect  on their beginning ideas about the subject matter and interact with  other students. Blogs offer a number of advantages for student-centered  and constructive teaching and learning, including giving students a  vehicle for contributing to the content of the class; allowing students to  comment on each other’s posts and link out to other resources; enabling  students to make their voice heard and to develop a sense of voice. In  addition, because blogs are public, other members of the blogosphere can  contribute to the evolving discussion, thereby potentially helping students  and teachers to connect to other networked communities  e.g., other  blogs  around their interests.   However, when teachers start out with blogs they tend to bring old  assumptions and perceptions to bear on the technology that inhibit its  fulfillment of this potential. Embracing traditional notions of time and  space, teachers often do not conceive of building social networks beyond  the classroom. Although teachers themselves may belong to online  professional social networks beyond their school and see the value of  such networks professionally, they need support in conceptualizing and  trying out this advantage with students. Moreover, teachers are often  discouraged when students’ interactions within blogs seem forced or  idiosyncratic. They hope that students will post ideas that substantially  contribute to their own learning and to the knowledge of the class,  but without modeling or linking out to other blogs, students may not  recognize the potentially important and public contribution they can  make. Moreover, ideally teachers’ use of different media should be  strategic.  What goes on in a learning blog—my term for a blog intended and  designed to facilitate students’ learning—should enrich face-to-face  educational experiences. Again, teachers may need guidance in finding   E E E  108  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH5.indd   108  3 2 09   3:02:14 PM   professional development  C h a p t e r   5  E E  opportunities to improve their face-to-face teaching by building on  blogged ideas and students’ behaviors online. In summary, as teacher  educators, we ought to develop teachers’ abilities not only to operate Web  2.0 tools but to simultaneously uncover and perturb their ideas about  what it means to teach with Web-enhanced social networks. We then have  a better chance of promoting well-intentioned uses of technology that  teachers and students perceive as successful.  recommendation 2 Develop alternative forms of teacher professional development that embed  the social-networking tools we want teachers to consider.   If we hope teaching practices will shift to benefit from Web 2.0  technologies, we ought to reexamine our own professional development  models and the examples we are providing. Do our PD models benefit  from Web 2.0? Do our methods mainly reinforce regular face-to-face  interactions with a local group of colleagues based primarily on our  own expertise? Do we draw from a broad and deep enough well of open  educational resources that allow us to discover and verify information and  forge creative networks?   For instance, wikis are collaborative Web sites that can be edited using  a Web browser. Although this means that anyone can edit existing  pages, create new pages, delete content, or rename pages, most wikis  established for course-related purposes have some security features built  in so only the class can view and edit them. Using wikis in education  can promote genuinely collaborative environments. They can support  transparent writing and editing, interdependence and teamwork among  authors, public and civic engagement, and the continuous exchange  of feedback on ideas. However, teaching with wikis can be difficult  because they require students and teachers to reconsider their roles. For  instance, students’ and teachers’ individual identities are subsumed by  the collective. Moreover, the intellectual authority of peers is equivalent to  that of the instructor or others who enter into the process of correcting,  editing, revising, and even deleting work.   E E E  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  109  NEWTOO CH5.indd   109  3 2 09   3:02:15 PM   C h a p t e r   5  professional development  E E  Our professional development models should involve teachers in   how we use and struggle to use such tools meaningfully and how we  ourselves wrestle with and resolve such issues. To do this, we might, for  example, work with teachers and wikis to collaboratively write technology  integration lessons and contribute to the evolution of a relevant entry  in Wikipedia. These experiences could stimulate a discussion about  issues of authorship, authority, credibility, and content. Most professional  development efforts are still organized around local communities often  with a heavy face-to-face component. Using public wikis in distributed  environments, we could emphasize a hybrid PD model, involving local  and far-flung participants and balancing teachers’ exploratory and  disruptive experiences with opportunities to collaboratively reflect on their  assumptions about the educational value and application of these tools.  reference  Greenhow, C.  2006 .

Assisting educators in this task will require a  concerted effort on the part of administrators. As mentioned, it is unfortunate,  but most typical professional development activities have not been successful in  changing behavior, for many reasons. Without significant district and building  level  commitment,  ongoing  support,  and  organized  efforts,  that  reality  is  not  likely to change. To chart a new course, administrators must agree that the use  of  technology  is  a  fundamental  goal,  and  faculty  members  must  participate  in  identifying it as a shared goal.  Once the goal of enhancing teaching and learning through technology is agreed  upon, there are many ways to accomplish it. One of the most successful is to use  the technology to learn how to use the technology, or some might say, not just talk  the talk, but truly walk the walk. Many studies of educators’ lack of technology  implementation  have  found  that  the  lack  of  accountability  from  administrators  on their actually accomplishing technological goals has been the most influential  in practice  Schrum, 1999 . One administrator said he had success by changing  two simple things in his evaluation of the educators in his building. He required  that one of the lessons he observed each year had to be in integrating technology  into the curriculum and one of each educator’s annual goals had to be focused on  improving technology proficiency.  School  districts  have  adopted  several  different  approaches  to  preparing  their  educators for using and learning with technology. Some use a central model in  which a wide variety of productivity and workplace skill programs are offered to  interested  teachers.  Others  have  a  requirement  that  educators  attend  a  certain  number of sessions each year. Still others poll their faculty each year and offer  programs  that  meet  specific  needs.  Another  group  of  schools  offers  special  designations  to  teachers  who  complete  a  specific  number  of  training  sessions  and  demonstrate  acquired  skills.  A  small  number  of  districts  have  invested  in  videoconferencing technology to allow remote experts to present information and  provide training without the expense and time normally required for travel.  With these possibilities for Web 2.0 tools, educators can weave in the potential  for building a “learning community” as they become familiar with blogs, wikis,  podcasting, and social bookmarking. Not only can educators connect with their  peers, but they can have access to experts in a variety of content or process areas.   web 2.0     new tools, new schools  111  NEWTOO CH5.indd   111  3 2 09   3:02:17 PM   C h a p t e r   5  professional development  “More important, these tools enable conversation, dialogue, and reflection, which  are critical to professional growth and development activities”  Jakes, 2006e, n.p. .  We will examine each possible method in terms of professional development.  professional development   and web 2.0 tools Blogging Blogs can be used to promote teachers’ comfort with and understanding of Web  2.0 tools, and some teachers already use them to create their own professional and  personal networks. Individuals within learning communities can determine their  topics of interest, identify ways to find information, and share conversations and  knowledge. Guhlin  2006a  explains:  This idea of building your own professional development network— where you find the people from whom you can learn, ask questions  of them, comment on their thoughts and links, and have them do  the  same  for  you—is  one  of  the  major  benefits  of  blogging  and  podcasting. It is the art of conversation captured in digital format.   n.p.   Conversations about teaching and perhaps every other topic are taking place in the  blogosphere, and as noted in the last chapter, blogs are available on almost every  issue. Guhlin  2006a  continues: “Blogs enable us to see others’ thinking—or lack  of thinking—as they build a Web of connected learning”  n.p. . Visiting a blog  gives educators access to conference sessions or meetings that they may not be  able to attend. Through interactive and public discussions, ideas can be refined,  developed, or expanded.  One teacher, Karl Fisch of Centennial, Colorado, uses a staff development blog  for  Arapahoe  High  School  teachers  exploring  constructivism  and  21st-century  learning  skills   The  Fischbowl,  http:  thefischbowl.blogspot.com .  This  blog  offers information about current educational events, new technologies and their  potential for schools and learners, and that’s just scratching the surface.   Other  schools  have  developed  different  ways  to  take  advantage  of  the  power  of  blogs  for  professional  development.  Poling   2005   described  how  her  school,   112  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH5.indd   112  3 2 09   3:02:17 PM   professional development  C h a p t e r   5  Oakdale Elementary in Maryland, sought to raise student achievement through  the  use  of  a  new  model  of  professional  development.  Using  the  “study  group”  model, they created a technology study group. The group met once a month on  various  topics  and  then  followed  up  their  meetings  through  the  use  of  a  blog.  Poling reported that:  Blogging  provided  a  means  of  ongoing  communication  with  other  group members that would not otherwise be available for an entire  month  until  the  next  face-to-face  session. … Overall,  the  concept  of  blogging  as  ongoing  support  has  been  extremely  beneficial  as  the  staff tries to make long-term change in instruction.  p. 15   podcasting Schools are starting to make professional development training sessions, lectures,  and ideas available through podcasts, which leads to individualized professional  development on demand. At a state level, New Hampshire offers podcasts from the  New Hampshire Department of Education; one discusses the state ICT standards  implementation.   King  and  Gura   2006   suggest  that,  “Developing  content  requires  some  forethought,  planning  and  scheduling.  It  also  requires  insight  into  how  this  new technology subtly changes the dynamics of information exchange between  speaker and listener and how this must be accounted for in format”  n.p. . Their  Podcast for Teachers, produced and published by Fordham University’s Regional  Educational Technology Center  RETC , provides a large number of freely available  podcasts  for  educators.  The  RETC  is  dedicated  to  serving  and  researching  the  professional  development  needs  of  educators  striving  to  improve  student  and  teacher performance.  Other types of podcasts for professional development are becoming available. For  example, you might want to take a session on a topic, but don’t have the time or  it does not fit into your schedule. A variety of organizations now offer podcasts  on  topics  you  really  want  to  hear.  LearningTimes   www.learningtimes.org ,  for  instance, is constantly updating its offerings. Recently this organization offered  a  podcast  called  Creating  a  CD  Portfolio  for  Documenting  Student  Progress  and another named Exploring the Intersection of Technology and Learning. Or  you could listen to a podcast made from a live Webcast titled K–12 Professional  Development: Trends and Opportunities.  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  113  NEWTOO CH5.indd   113  3 2 09   3:02:18 PM   C h a p t e r   5  professional development  A comprehensive organization, The Education Podcast Network  http:  epnweb. org   offers  a  wide  variety  of  podcasts  for  educators’  professional  development  as  well  as  curriculum  areas,  and  also  has  links  to  several  other  content  and  professional podcasts. It is likely that this area will develop rapidly to support and  assist educators in their learning and teaching.  threading a Conversation  Wikis One of the most exciting opportunities for professional development is to allow all  members of a community to participate in the creation of a goal, plan, or direction  or to simply discuss the way a new activity is working. Wikis present the ideal  manner  in  which  to  accomplish  this  and, at the same time, educators learn  about the potential for using this tool  in their classrooms. The Adult Literacy  Organization  models  this  process  with  a  wiki  focused  on  professional  development  its  members.  Entitled  Key  Issues  for  Professional  Development   http:  wiki.literacytent. org index.php Key_Issues_for_ Professional_Development  ,  this  project  allows  participants  to  collaboratively  contemplate  their  most  important  topics  and  ways  to  further  their mission.  WitH Web 1.0, many tools supported  threaded discussions, and they worked well  at the time. it was difficult, however, to link  specific comments back to their origins or to  make corrections and additions in a way that  was always meaningful. With the Web 2.0  wikis, comments can be inserted precisely  where they belong and the resulting “conver- sation” can help focus ideas. searching for  specific items is also simplified in the world  of wikis, since in the past all management  systems were not uniformly easy to use.  for   F  Other  Web  sites  provide  a  place  for  teachers  to  learn  about  wikis.  For  example,  For  Teachers  New  to  Wikis   http:  writingwiki.org default.aspx   WritingWiki ForTeachersNewtoWikis.html  has a graphic  Figure 5.1  that shows  the relationship and interaction between content and collaboration.  Other professional development sites offer lesson plans and opportunities to share  ideas and ask questions of other teachers. At the Teacher’s Lounge, under the link  for social studies at the high-school level, one can find ideas for teaching several  subjects   http:  teacherslounge.editme.com hssocialstudies  ,  and  elementary  teachers  can  post  their  lessons,  talk  to  other  teachers,  or  simply  find  ideas  for  teaching fractions  http:  teacherslounge.editme.com elemmath  .  114  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH5.indd   114  3 2 09   3:02:19 PM   professional development  C h a p t e r   5  Wikispaces   http:  teacherconnect.wikispaces.com   is  a  teacher-to-teacher  global  network with a stated goal to “Link a profile to a network to a network” and to  encourage teachers and students to provide information about the very best places  to  interact  with  others  interested  in  education.  Teachers  can  find  information  on many topics  self-directed professional development , create links to student  projects throughout the world, and access links to other wikis and blogs.  Figure 5.1    Relationship and interaction between content and collaboration  E source: http:  writingwiki.org default.aspx WritingWiki forteachersnewtoWikis.html  Additionally, some organizations are working to promote the growth of interaction  about particular topics for their members. One is a wiki called Library Success   www.libsuccess.org , which offers information for all types of librarians to share  their  successful  programs  and  innovative  projects  using  technology.  This  wiki  serves  as  a  collaborative  site  with  information  on  best  practices,  training,  and  other professional topics.  Finally,  even  preservice  educators  are  invited  to  participate  in  wikis  to  learn  about their future profession and activities. Future Teachers Meet Wiki  http:   en.wikibooks.org wiki Future_Teachers_Meet_Wiki   is one site that encourages  teacher candidates to explore new ways of teaching and learning and to promote  interaction among the next generation of teachers.  Encouraging our educators and schools to use technology effectively is a complicated  and challenging task. Using these new tools as models and methods to teach about  them accomplishes two goals. It first provides practice and comfort with the tools,   web 2.0     new tools, new schools  115  NEWTOO CH5.indd   115  3 2 09   3:02:20 PM   C h a p t e r   5  professional development  and second, offers the opportunity to experience firsthand the use of the technology  for meaningful and authentic activities.   116  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH5.indd   116  3 2 09   3:02:21 PM   E E    6  leadership and new tools  Being  a  school  or  district  administrator   has never been an easy occupation, but  today  they  have  more  issues  to  deal  with  than  ever  before.  Technology  makes  many  tasks  easier  but  it  also  adds  complexities  peculiar  to  this  digital  age.  While  much  time is spent in dealing with administrative  issues, a principal or district administrator  is  more  than  ever  an  educational  leader  with responsibilities for guiding classroom  activities and focusing thoughtful attention  on  the  intellectual  growth  of  students  and  teachers.   E E E E E  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  117  NEWTOO CH6.indd   117  3 2 09   3:05:04 PM   C h a p t e r   6  leadership and new tools  Their  students  are  part  of  a  digital  generation  with  new  expectations  and  approaches to learning. They understand information from a combination of text,  images, video, conversations, and more that come at them all at once. They are self- interested and self-directed; they network with peers and expect to be engaged,  even entertained, at all times. This is the reality evident in classrooms around the  country. The days of “Open your textbook to page 35” are over. That textbook is  outdated, print is suspect, and there’s only one opinion, that of the author.  With Web 2.0, however, knowledge is available from many sources and as long as  teachers vet those sources for accuracy and reliability, students can get a broader  range of information, perspectives, and resources.  Teachers  have  changed.  As  turnover  increases  and  younger  teachers  enter  classrooms, they are often well versed in using technological tools. They replace  teachers who have years of experience with subject matter, student sensibilities,  and the “system.” Both skill sets are needed in each educator, and after years of  training teachers how to use the tools, the focus is shifting to how to integrate  them for new hires.  Learning has changed. “Learning is characterized not only by greater autonomy  for  the  learner,  but  also  a  greater  emphasis  on  active  learning,  with  creation,  communication and participation playing key roles, and on changing roles for the  teacher, indeed, even a collapse of the distinction between teacher and student  altogether”  Downes, 2006, n.p. .  leading in the 21st century  Leadership under these conditions is more difficult and more necessary than ever  before. Leaders have to understand that things are changing, how that change is  happening, and what is likely to be the result. For example, they know that the world  their students will enter after graduation is very different from what it was even a  few years ago. They also know that their students are using instant messaging, are  blogging and downloading podcasts, and are watching YouTube outside of school.  In order for schools to prepare students for the future, leaders must help teachers  make  the  transition  to  using  new  technologies  and  new  methods.  Policies  and  actions at the top make it clear where a school or district is headed.  In promoting technology integration, indeed, in getting to the point of planning  for new technologies, district and school leaders need to understand the issues.  According to the Digital Disconnect survey:   118  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH6.indd   118  3 2 09   3:05:05 PM   leadership and new tools  C h a p t e r   6  School administrators—and not teachers—set the tone for Internet  use at school. The differences among the schools attended by students  [surveyed]  were  striking.  Policy  choices  by  those  who  run  school  systems and other factors have resulted in different schools having  different  levels  of  access  to  the  Internet,  different  requirements  for  student  technology  literacy  skills,  and  different  restrictions  on  student Internet access.  Levin & Arafeh, 2002, p. iii   If administrators want to make change happen, they must have a vision for the  future. According to techLEARNING blogger Wesley Fryer  2006 :   It is a question of leadership vision and pedagogic vision. What do  the school leaders believe we need in the way of an environment to  help students learn the skills they will need for life, and what does  authentic teaching and learning look and sound like in the early 21st  century?  n.p.    Fryer  also  believes  that  conversations  about  these  issues  should  happen  at  local  policymaking  levels  as  well  as  at  classroom  levels  with  teachers  and  administrators.  In  addition,  district  and  school  administrators  need  new  skills,  the  same  ones  that business leaders must have today, the personal and analytical skills required  to  be  true  leaders.  Microsoft  has  a  free  tool  called  Education  Competencies  that  identifies  the  attributes  needed  by  those  in  education  leadership  positions   Microsoft Corporation, 2006 . Their competencies are grouped into the following  six  qualities  that  individuals  must  have  in  order  for  a  school  district  to  achieve  success in the 21st century.  The six qualities are:  1  Individual excellence  2  Organizational skills  3  Courage  4  Results  goal-oriented   5  Strategic skills  6  Operating skills  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  119  NEWTOO CH6.indd   119  3 2 09   3:05:06 PM   C h a p t e r   6  leadership and new tools  District  and  school  leaders  must  have  a  vision  for  success  and  communicate  with others to make that a shared vision. They must see the big picture—how  everything fits together and what relationships exist. When new things emerge,  they  must  be  able  to  integrate  them  into  the  overall  strategy.  For  example,  when  new  tools,  like  Web  2.0  tools,  become  available,  a  district  may  have  to revisit its technology plan and adapt  it appropriately. The Planning for Web  2.0 sidebar offers several suggestions.  planning for Web 2.0  1.	 Create	a	vision	of	how	new	tools	will	  make	a	difference,	how	they	will	fit	with	 existing	tools,	and	what,	if	any,	new	 policies	will	be	needed	to	support	it.	 Get	a	consensus	on	the	vision	so	that	all	 stakeholders	buy	into	it.  2.	 Agree	on	goals	for	use.	Align	with	other	 goals	such	as	existing	curricular,	NCLB,	 career,	and	technology	goals.  3.	 Evaluate	how	well	the	current	infrastruc-  ture	will	support	these	goals	 e.g.,	the	 network	infrastructure	and	bandwidth .  4.	  5.	  Identify	new	instructional	and	technology	 integration	strategies.  Identify	professional	development	strate- gies	that	will	help	educators	to	implement	 new	instructional	and	technology	integra- tion	techniques.  6.	 Establish	a	realistic	timetable.  7.	 Develop	a	realistic	budget.	While	Web	2.0	 tools	are	free,	access	and	support	are	not.  8.	 Establish	milestones.	Identify	ways	to	  measure	progress	with	tool	use	and	 growth	in	student	learning.  9.	 Plan	for	evaluation.	Find	the	best	  measures	that	will	demonstrate	whether	 goals	were	reached.  F  120  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  using new tools  School  leaders  can  use  Web  2.0  tools  the way that business leaders do to help  their organizations.  Tim  Lauer,  principal  of  Meriwether  Lewis Elementary in Portland, Oregon,  uses a blog  http:  lewiselementary.org   to  post  information,  announcements,  class  projects,  and  photos,  and  a  calendar to communicate with the entire  school community. He uses a separate  blog to publish the staff bulletin and to  encourage the staff to use the comment  feature for discussions in order to build  community.  Helen  Nolen,  principal  of  Buckman  Arts  Magnet  Elementary  School  in  Portland,  Oregon,  uses  a  blog   http:   buckmanelementary.org   and  wiki   www.buckmanelementary.org wiki. to  communicate.  She  posts  html   principal  and  parent  newsletters  and  school  events.  She  installed  kiosks  with  Internet  access  for  those  parents   NEWTOO CH6.indd   120  3 2 09   3:05:08 PM   leadership and new tools  C h a p t e r   6  without  their  own  computers.  She  expects  teachers  to  use  the  school  blog  and  requires that all teachers have at least one page; many have found effective uses  for the technology. The librarian posts reading lists; teachers post student writing  and artwork, daily journals, and science observations  Intel Education Initiative,  2006 .  For  teachers,  blogs  can  replace  e-mail  as  a  way  to  communicate  with  students,  parents, or other educators. Because of syndication, everyone can get updates, so  teachers can post homework, long-term assignments, explanations, events, and  other information. Students and parents can ask questions, react to an idea, or  make  suggestions  in  the  comment  box.  This  really  matters  to  parents.  School  leaders can encourage teachers to use blogs, but the request is more accepted if the  leaders themselves use the tool.  Scott  McLeod   2006a ,  director  of  the  UCEA  Center  for  the  Advanced  Study  of  Technology Leadership in Education  CASTLE  at the University of Minnesota,  suggests  twelve  reasons  for  an  administrator  to  adopt  blogging  as  a  leadership  strategy  see sidebar .  twelve reasons for an administrator to Blog  MuCh	AttENtIoN	hAs	BEEN	PAID	to	the	value	of	blogging	for	teachers	and	students,	 but	administrators	can	also	benefit	from	the	use	of	this	great	new	tool.	this	discussion	 explores	the	potential	value	of	blogging	for	K–12	administrators.	Although	the	focus	is	 primarily	on	principals,	the	same	advantages	hold	true	for	superintendents,	technology	 coordinators,	and	other	central	office	administrators.	this	selection	of	reasons	stems	 from	chapter	4	of	The Corporate Blogging Book,	by	Debbie	Weil.	so	…	why	blog	as	an	 administrator?  reason 1: Sharing news and events Blogs	are	ideal	for	principals	to	quickly	post	news	items	for	their	school	communities.	 upcoming	special	events,	recent	awards	won	by	students	or	staff,	classroom	highlights,	 reminders,	lunch	menus,	extracurricular	activities,	deadlines,	and	other	newsletter-type	 items	are	extremely	well-suited	for	blogs	and	are	quick	and	easy	ways	to	keep	a	school	 community	informed.

Examples	might	include	building	a	new	facility,	implementing	new	curricula,	hiring	 new	staff,	trying	to	pass	a	levy	or	referendum,	and	other	school	initiatives.	Regular	posts	 to	update	stakeholders	on	the	progress	of	these	types	of	activities	can	go	a	long	way	 toward	building	goodwill	and	keeping	community	members	informed.  reason 3: Status alerts Another	type	of	blog	post	might	be	a	quick	message	to	alert	the	community	of	a	short- term	problem,	event	cancellation,	or	similar	news.	status	alerts	will	be	most	effective	 when	the	community	knows	to	go	to	the	blog	for	the	latest	news.  reason 4: Marketing Because	they’re	electronic,	blogs	are	both	faster	and	less	costly	than	paper	commu- nication.	If	the	savings	in	paper	alone	isn’t	persuasive,	administrators	should	consider	 additional	advantages	that	blogs	often	have	over	other	communication	channels.  Web	sites	and	paper	newsletters	are	static,	noninteractive,	and	often	dated.	 Who	wants	 to	read	about	something	two	weeks	after	it	occurred? 	E-mails,	electronic	newsletters,	 and	listservs	contribute	to	clogged	inboxes	and	get	caught	by	spam	filters.	In	contrast,	 blogs	are	timely,	interactive,	and	avoid	some	of	the	issues	that	accompany	e-mail	 communications.  If	done	well,	blogs	can	“create	buzz	[and]	loyal	customers”	 Weil,	2006,	p.	53 .	one	of	 parents’	biggest	criticisms	of	schools	is	that	teachers	and	administrators	don’t	commu- nicate	often	enough	about	the	things	that	parents	want	to	hear	about.	Blogs	can	be	a	 great	way	to	publicize	the	great	things	that	are	occurring	in	schools.

If	administrators	put	out	their	spin	only	after	some	incident	occurs,	the	message	will	 be	much	less	effective.	school	communities	are	going	to	be	much	more	receptive	and	 trusting	if	an	administrator	has	built	up	goodwill	beforehand	through	an	ongoing	series	 of	posts	and	dialogues	about	less	important	issues.  Frequent	transparent	communication,	with	the	opportunity	to	receive	feedback	 through	comments,	is	a	strength	of	blogs	that	administrators	can	leverage	to	their	 school	organization’s	advantage.  reason 6: Community building Blogs	can	be	an	excellent	tool	for	facilitating	feelings	of	community	within	a	school	 organization.	Whether	a	blog	serves	an	internal	or	external	audience,	regular	posts	can	 keep	stakeholders	informed	of	important	events	as	well	as	those	incidents	that	might	 go	unnoticed	in	the	hectic	day-to-day	activity	of	schools.	If	you	read	the	administrator	 blogs	at	Lewis	Elementary	school	in	oregon	 http:  lewiselementary.org 	or	Mabry	 Middle	school	in	Georgia	 http:  mabryonline.org blogs tyson  	you	can	see	that	the	 ongoing	stream	of	news,	updates,	and	highlights	can’t	help	but	contribute	to	feelings	of	 connectedness	by	students,	staff,	parents,	and	other	community	members.  Blogs	are	different	than	e-mail	listservs	and	static	Web	pages	because	they’re	inter- active.	When	a	principal	sends	out	an	e-mail	over	a	listserv	or	posts	a	notice	on	a	 Web	page,	there	is	no	way	for	the	school	community	to	interact	with	that	message.	If	 someone	has	a	question	or	comment,	it	either	doesn’t	get	made	or	it’s	merely	a	one-to- one	communication	with	the	principal	made	by	e-mail,	voice	mail,	or	telephone	call.	In	 contrast,	the	comments	feature	of	blogs	allows	anyone	to	post	a	question	or	comment	 and	thus	everyone	else	in	the	community	can	see	it,	see	the	principal’s	 or	someone	 else’s 	response,	and	add	his	or	her	own	two	cents	to	the	conversation.	the	blog	thus	 facilitates	ongoing	dialogue	among	multiple	school	stakeholders	rather	than	being	a	 static	one-way,	or	maybe	two-way,	transmission.	What	blogs	can	do	that	listservs	and	 Web	pages	can’t,	is	facilitate	conversation.

Principals	who	are	actively	and	 publicly	interacting	with	school	stakeholders,	listening	to	their	concerns,	responding	 to	those	concerns	and	other	questions,	and	generally	being	accessible	are	facilitating	 good	customer	relations	and	building	goodwill	within	the	school	community.	Parents,	 community	members,	staff,	and	students	are	going	to	feel	more	positively	about	the	 school	when	they	have	the	opportunity	to	not	only	get	frequent	updates	about	what	is	 going	on	but	also	ask	questions,	post	concerns,	and	give	suggestions.	this	openness— this	overt	transparency—builds	stakeholder	confidence	and	satisfaction	with	the	 direction	and	activities	of	the	school.  reason 8: Branding As	real	estate	agents	know,	perhaps	the	first	question	that	relocating	families	want	 answered	is	“Where	are	the	good	schools?”	Certain	school	districts	and	certain	schools	 within	districts	have	reputations	for	providing	high-quality	learning	experiences	for	 children.	these	school	organizations	are	the	ones	that	attract	families	with	high	social	 capital	and	high-achieving	children.  Parents	are	increasingly	checking	out	school	Web	sites	as	part	of	their	relocation	 decision-making.	the	same	messages	from	the	principal	that	create	warm,	fuzzy	 feelings	of	community,	belonging,	and	academic	excitement	also	are	perfect	for	 outsiders	who	want	to	see	what	the	school	is	all	about.	It	would	be	fairly	difficult	for	a	 relocating	family	to	acquire	several	months’	worth	of	newsletters	or	e-mails	to	parents,	 but	the	public	availability	of	a	blog	ensures	that	everyone—existing	stakeholders,	 relocating	families,	realtors,	potential	corporate	partners,	and	other	outside	community	 members—can	see	the	wonderful	things	that	are	occurring	in	the	school	building.  reason 9: Creating “customer evangelists” Customer	evangelists	are	those	individuals	who	are	passionate	about	the	school	and	 publicly	advocate	for	the	school	to	others.	they	do	this	of	their	own	volition—they	 are	not	paid	to	do	so.	these	are	the	people	who	talk	about	how	great	the	school	is	to	 everyone	they	meet.	they	help	build	the	reputation	and	the	buzz	of	the	school	organi- zation	and	contribute	to	overall	feelings	of	satisfaction	by	staff,	parents,	students,	and	 community	members.

Indeed,	as	Malcolm	 Gladwell	and	others	have	noted,	evangelists	may	be	the	only	information	source	that	 others	trust	and	believe.	Nearly	everyone	is	experiencing	overload	from	an	unlimited	 variety	of	information	sources—evangelists	are	the	folks	who	capture	people’s	attention	 and	sway	opinion.  Blogs	give	evangelists	something	to	talk	about.	Regular	updates,	news	items,	and	other	 highlights	feed	the	conversations	that	evangelists	are	having	with	others.	these	people	 can	make	or	break	a	school’s	reputation—administrators	would	be	wise	to	feed	them	 well	on	a	steady	diet	of	positive	information.  reason 10: thought leadership A	blog	can	be	a	great	place	to	put	thoughts	out	there	for	the	community	to	chew	on.	 Is	a	school	considering	a	new	initiative	or	an	important	change?	Does	the	school	want	 feedback	on	a	particular	topic	or	issue?	the	principal	could	post	some	information	and	 questions	on	the	blog	and	solicit	community	participation.	this	is	similar	to	setting	up	 a	meeting	with	an	advisory	board	or	interested	group	of	stakeholders,	except	that	the	 potential	reach	is	much	greater	because	everyone	in	the	school	community	can	see	and	 participate	in	the	conversation,	not	just	the	few	individuals	who	might	attend	a	face-to- face	meeting.  reason 11: advocacy A	blog	also	can	be	a	good	place	to	advocate	for	certain	actions.	For	example,	if	state	 legislators	were	considering	legislation	that	might	negatively	impact	schools	in	some	 way,	a	principal	could	post	a	message	encouraging	stakeholders	to	become	informed	 about	the	issue	and	let	their	local	legislator	know	their	opinion	about	the	matter.	 similarly,	a	blog	can	be	a	great	place	to	foster	community	support	for	an	upcoming	levy	 or	referendum.	Regular	progress	updates	can	keep	community	members	informed	and	 help	facilitate	increased	voter	participation	and	support	for	the	referendum.

B	Creative	Commons	attribution-share	alike	license,	www.dangerouslyirrelevant.org.  F  So far, blogging is beginning to catch on as an administrative tool. Wikis are useful  for  creating  documents  collaboratively.  Superintendents  and  district  staff,  for  instance, can create policy documents collaboratively. Principals can post agendas  for staff meetings and invite attendees to add to them in advance of the meeting as  well as use the document for note-taking and end up with collaboratively written  and edited minutes. Principals can ask teachers to collaborate on documents to  send home to parents, including notices and newsletters.  One debate around leadership is how much administrators must use technology  tools themselves. Because of new demands for accountability, most administrators  are becoming facile with data management tools. The question is the extent to  which they should use other applications. Scott McLeod provides his insight in the  Web 2.0 Wisdom sidebar, Effective Technology Leadership.  126  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH6.indd   126  3 2 09   3:05:21 PM   leadership and new tools  C h a p t e r   6  web 2.0 wisdom  effective technology Leadership Scott McLeod  Do aDministrators have to be technology-savvy to be  effective technology leaders? Many folks would say yes, it is important  for administrators to be able to model the use of technology if they  expect teachers to integrate digital learning tools into their instruction.  Otherwise it will be a situation of “Do as I say, not as I do,” and some  teachers will decline the invitation to use technology in their classrooms.  I am not sure I agree. Many principals and superintendents are not very  fluent personally with digital technologies and yet are strong technology  leaders. These folks might be able to send e-mail, surf the Web, use  word processing and electronic slideshow software, and use a few  administrative applications, but they are far from being the technology  experts in their school or district.  Instead, what these effective technology leaders are able to do is facilitate  a shared vision for technology in their school organization and mobilize  staff and the local community into putting resources and effort into  that vision. Although this may be harder when an administrator is not  fluent with the underlying technology, it is not a big stretch, for example,  to envision an administrator who knows very little about blogging  and yet understands the potential power of a tool that facilitates better  communication with parents and community members.  Administrators need better  and more  training in the area of technology.  They need exposure to various digital tools so that they can understand  the educational potential of those tools. They need help understanding  what effective technology support looks like and how to find funding  for appropriate staffing. They need to learn what constitutes effective  technology usage in the classroom so that they can evaluate it and  facilitate it schoolwide. And, of course, they need training in legal,  ethical, and policy issues related to student and employee use of various  digital tools.

Schools have a moral  obligation to prepare students for their technology-infused, globally  interconnected futures. Administrators cannot simply avoid leading  in the area of technology because it is an area in which they are not  comfortable. We need to give principals and superintendents the  knowledge and skills to be effective technology leaders despite their  personal lack of digital fluency.  Scott McLeod is director of the UCEA Center for the Advanced Study  of Technology Leadership in Education  CASTLE  at the University of  Minnesota.  supporting new tools  As  with  any  new  tool,  there’s  a  cycle  of  use  that  begins  with  administrative  support. If a school or district administrator is committed to implementing new  technologies,  the  staff  will  get  the  message.  Leadership  starts  at  the  top,  even  if the support comes without a leader actually using many of the tools him- or  herself. One popular application is a course or content management system. Many  districts are adopting commercial applications such as Blackboard, but there are  open-source  programs  too.  Districts,  especially  those  without  an  installed  base  in a commercial product, are beginning to use software such as Moodle instead.  Because it is open-source software, it is free; any school or district can download  and customize it to address its needs.  Teachers use course management systems to manage their classes, assignments,  activities, quizzes and tests, resources, student work, and other items in an online  environment that’s easy to access 24 7. They can create lessons, post tests, enter  grades,  and  more,  and  their  students  can  log  on  and  do  assignments  anytime,  anywhere.  128  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH6.indd   128  3 2 09   3:05:22 PM   leadership and new tools  C h a p t e r   6  Even districts that are not using open-source operating systems are using Moodle  because it runs on most operating systems including Windows and Mac OS X  without needing modification. It can be used with almost any database.  Miguel Guhlin and Greg Rodriguez  2006  in San Antonio are pleased with the  results. They say:   Imagine  a  content  management  system  that  enables  district  level  staff … to  share  documents  securely  through  passworded  levels  of  access, as well as update them without knowing how to create Web  pages. Imagine online help desks, frequently asked question  FAQ   repositories,  and  more—all  management  systems  available  to  you  and your district at no charge.  n.p.   financial issues  We know that the costs of technology are far more than just the price of equipment  and software. Upgrades, maintenance, and support play a large role as well. So  in looking at free, Web-based tools, districts have to explore the real costs, those  above and beyond the software itself, and weigh them against alternatives.  Even though there is federal, state, and other funding available for technology,  especially E-Rate funds for a district’s networking infrastructure, there is little  support  for  ongoing  costs.  The  Consortium  for  School  Networking   CoSN   partnered with Gartner to create a tool for school districts to evaluate how well  they are managing their technology infrastructure and the total cost of technology  ownership   TCO .  The  tool  measures  direct  and  indirect  costs  of  technology  investments, such as hardware, software, direct labor costs for formal technology  support, and the indirect costs for technology support. Information about the tool  is available at www.classroomtco.org gartner_intro.html.  In  addition  to  these  expenses,  districts  should  weigh  the  costs  of  purchasing  and  renewing  licenses  to  applications  software  such  as  Microsoft  Windows  as  a platform and Microsoft Office as tools against the costs of using open-source  solutions. While Linux as a platform and open-source applications are free to use,  a district should look at the costs of retraining an established base of Microsoft  users to use new products against the ongoing licensing and upgrade costs. In  addition,  districts  have  to  consider  the  value  of  the  software  and  the  ongoing  support that will be needed. Of course, if the tools that companies like Microsoft   web 2.0     new tools, new schools  129  NEWTOO CH6.indd   129  3 2 09   3:05:23 PM   C h a p t e r   6  leadership and new tools  and Google provide free are robust enough, districts will benefit because educators  do not commonly use advanced features.  To be sure, in order to use Web-based tools 24 7, students need Internet access.  Districts  must  have  the  networking  infrastructure  and  computer  availability  to  take  advantage  of  these  tools.  Most  districts  have  used  E-Rate  funds  to  set  up  robust networks, and many districts have implemented or are considering one- to-one computing solutions. As they weigh the costs and benefits, the availability  of free Web-based tools may play a role. CoSN has compiled a few case studies  of  districts  implementing  one-to-one   www.classroomtco.org gartner_intro. htmlcase . In general, while they were not looking for cost savings specifically,  “some financial benefits are being realized”  CoSN, 2006, p. 9 .  Access  24 7  also  involves  the  use  of  personal  computers,  best  modeled  in  one- to-one programs. These have become popular because students can collaborate  from home, and classroom use is more productive when students have their own  laptops. The costs are prohibitive for some districts, however, because they require  a wireless infrastructure, security, digital content, and useful applications as well  as professional development and support for educators. All of which have costs.  One  of  CoSN’s  case  studies  focused  on  a  small,  rural  Missouri  school  district  with  450  students  and  51  staff  members  with  a  total  of  210  client  computers.  Districts  this  size  face  particular  challenges  when  it  comes  to  managing  the  costs of operating their computer networks primarily because they have limited  resources.  This  district  has  three  things  in  its  favor:  fast  T1  communications  through the Missouri Research and Education Network  MOREnet  for a nominal  annual  support  fee,  donated  computers,  and  open-source  applications  such  as  Linux servers and Open Office. Not surprisingly, the total cost of ownership of  their technology was low  CoSN, 2004 .  Also,  Indiana’s  Affordable  Classroom  Computer  for  Every  Secondary  Student   InACCESS   was  launched  in  2003  as  an  alternative  way  to  put  computers  in  the hands of every student. One effect of the new system has been cost savings.  Previously, the state of Indiana was spending $100 per year per machine to license  software  from  vendors  such  as  Microsoft  or  Apple.  Today,  the  school  is  paying  no  more  than  $10  per  year.  With  18,000  computers,  this  is  a  savings  of  more  than $16,000 per year. And when amortized over 300,000 computers, this annual  savings jumps to $27 million. The district is experiencing a similar savings with  hardware,  reducing  total  cost  of  ownership  per  machine  from  $1,000  to  about  $290  Villano, 2006b .  130  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH6.indd   130  3 2 09   3:05:23 PM   leadership and new tools  C h a p t e r   6  Concerning a new project, Alex Inman, the technology director for the Whitfield  School in St. Louis, Missouri, says  personal communication, 2006 :  Our  goal  was  to  design  a  new  approach  to  laptop  programs  that  provides the same benefits but lowers the initial and long-term costs.  We  implemented  a  program  using  Linux  on  laptops  and  accessed  Windows  programs  as  needed  on  a  centralized  Citrix  network.  We  received  effectively  the  same  user  satisfaction  of  other  laptop  programs in their first year and did it for about $185 less per client  on  an  annual  basis.  We  conservatively  project  that  this  model  will  extend to save the school $200,000 per year across 600 laptops.   Beyond determining the total cost of ownership, a new CoSN project explores the  value of technology investments. The accompanying Web 2.0 Wisdom sidebar by  Rich Kaestner, Measuring the Value of Investment, outlines this process.  web 2.0 wisdom  Measuring the Value of Investment Rich Kaestner   open-source software solutions are frequently selected for  reasons driven by budgets. Perhaps more important in looking at end- user applications is the value derived from product functionality and ease  of use. These can be measured in terms of savings and user productivity,  some of which relate to providing a better education.  Schools can do a better job of measuring the value of technology for  proposed projects, which often compete for the same limited funds. Value  has two major components: costs and benefits. Benefits for K–12 include  qualitative benefits that are oriented to the district or school mission,  goals, and mandates. A five-step process for determining the value of  investment  VOI  for K–12 institutions follows:  E E E  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  131  NEWTOO CH6.indd   131  3 2 09   3:05:24 PM   C h a p t e r   6  leadership and new tools  E E  1. estimate costs To implement and support technology properly, include all initial and  ongoing direct costs in the budget. However, costs need to be annualized  and indirect costs  e.g., user overhead time  should be considered.  2. assess risk Risk, for the purposes of VOI calculations, is the probability of success  for the proposed project. Probability of success is generally applied to the  valuation of the expected benefits of the project.  Note that probability of  success could instead be applied against cost to create a risk-weighted cost.   3. Calculate anticipated savings and revenues Most projects, even those focused on qualitative benefits such as student  achievement, have some cost savings such as lower out-of-pocket costs,  better efficiencies, user productivity, or future cost avoidance. There may  also be some anticipated increase of revenues based on higher attendance,  grants, or state or federal aid.  4. Measure qualitative benefits Since the business of schools is education and schools operate for the  public good, many or most of the benefits of implementing technology  cannot be measured in terms of dollars; we call these qualitative benefits.  For these to be considered benefits they must directly or indirectly affect  the school or district mission, goals, mandates, or other objectives. A  suggested approach to calculating these anticipated benefits is:  E  Determine the school or district mission, goals, and mandates,   and assign a relative importance to each.  E  Align anticipated project benefits with the appropriate school   mission, goals, and mandates.  E  State the anticipated project benefits in measurable terms.  E E E  132  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH6.indd   132  3 2 09   3:05:25 PM   leadership and new tools  C h a p t e r   6  E E  E  Agree on the effect of the proposed project on the applicable   mission, goals, and mandates.  On a weighting of –10 to +10, how  much will the project affect each mission, goal, and mandate?  Note the possibility of a negative effect.   E  Come up with a total qualitative benefits score.  E  Multiply the total qualitative score by the probability of success    for a risk-weighted benefits score.  5. evaluate results Once you have implemented your wildly successful project, you have an  opportunity to review actual costs and benefits versus the projected costs  and benefits. This will allow you to respond to the project skeptics. As the  anticipated costs and benefits were stated in measurable terms, the actual  results can be measured:  E  Actual costs versus anticipated costs  E  Actual savings or revenues versus anticipated savings or revenues  E  Actual benefits versus anticipated benefits  For more information on TCO and VOI, including tools to help with this  process, check out CoSN’s TCO Web site at www.classroomtco.org and  CoSN’s VOI Web site at www.EdTechVOI.org.

Costs are always an issue, even more so  as budgets are reduced. Products must provide a good return on investment and  districts now monitor the total cost of ownership of technology. One place where  leaders sometimes economize is on software, and some districts are starting to  rely  on  open-source  solutions,  programs  for  which  there  are  no  purchasing  or  licensing fees. While they are technically free, the overall costs of implementing  and supporting open-source programs are not always less than with other choices.  The San Antonio School District staff finds open-source solutions effective and  cost effective. However, Miguel Guhlin cautions, “You will need to invest time”   personal communication, 2006 .  Open Source Open source is programming code that is freely available to use and to modify,  upgrade, and customize. The philosophy behind it is that source code must be  available to everyone to use and adapt and that any adaptations also have to be  available to use and adapt. Many people contribute to open-source programming  and share the programs they create.  Linux is a free UNIX-type operating system originally created by Linus Torvalds  with the help of developers around the world. It is open-source software, so the  source  code  is  available  to  everyone.  A  growing  number  of  school  districts  are  using the Linux operating system, Apache server, and Firefox Web browser instead  of commercial solutions.  There are open-source solutions for almost any task that network administrators  may  need,  from  monitoring  the  network  and  maintaining  network  security  to  fighting spam and encrypting data. These solutions run on top of any operating  system, from Windows to Linux. Two Web sites for finding these programs are the  OpenCD site for Windows  http:  theopencd.org  and Open Source Mac for Mac  OS X  www.opensourcemac.org .  According to Miguel Guhlin and Greg Rodriguez  2006 , who have implemented  Linux  and  other  open-source  software  in  the  San  Antonio,  Texas,  Independent  School  District,  the  motivation  in  seeking  out  open-source  solutions  is  finding   134  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH6.indd   134  3 2 09   3:05:26 PM   leadership and new tools  C h a p t e r   6  powerful solutions that can be readily implemented without expensive licensing  and the value of using free, easily adaptable solutions on a district-wide scale.  Applications  run  on  the  servers  but  student  and  staff  computers  can  be  dumb  terminals or thin clients, which mean that they have no hard drives or software.  They are easy to install, reliable, require little maintenance, and are immune to  viruses and other vandalism. Changes  happen  centrally,  which  saves  travel  time for updates and upgrades.  Full Circle?  Information  on  how  to  set  up  Linux  software  is  available  on  K–12  Linux  Project   http:  k12ltsp.org .  The  Web  site  offers  downloads  of  software  for  transforming  older  computers  into  diskless  clients,  technical  guides  and  tutorials  for  getting  started  with  open  source, and discussion forums. Because  Linux  is  community-based,  help  and  answers to questions are easy to find.  From  the  perspective  of  teachers  and  other  administrators,  these  are  useful  tools.  If  administrators  are  supportive  and  technical  staff  invests  the  time  to  train  and  help  teachers,  the  effect  can  be welcome to a district that is strapped  for  cash  but  wants  to  use  innovative  technologies.   See  appendix  B  for  an  expanded  list  of  open-source  Web  tools.   It	MAy	sEEM	As	thouGh	we	have	come	full	 circle	with	computer-based	learning.

Keeping students and data safe and  secure are important—ethically and legally.  School  districts  have  to  do  everything  in  their power to prevent problems before they  start.   E E E E E  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  137  NEWTOO CH7.indd   137  3 2 09   3:06:04 PM   C h a p t e r   7  online safety and security  Today’s new Web publishing tools such as blogs and wikis make it easy to get a  message out where others can find it. However, information that’s out there can be  biased, inappropriate, or untruthful. And social-networking sites such as MySpace  and  Facebook  allow  youngsters  to  post  private  information,  which  leaves  them  vulnerable  to  harassment  and  other  dangers.  Cyberbullying  may  be  the  online  equivalent of bad schoolyard behavior, but it is no less hurtful or dangerous.  College educator and lawyer Scott McLeod  2006c  says:   Many  enterprising  teachers  are  using   or  would  like  to  use   tools  provided by entities outside the school organization to enhance the  classroom  experience.  These  tools  typically  are  not  hosted  by  the  school system, however, and there is no ability for administrators to  exercise oversight effectively over teachers’ and students’ appropriate  use of these tools. In many instances, school leaders may not even  know such tools are being used.  n.p.   Schools have to be more vigilant than ever. They want to provide access to the  vast amounts of reliable, accurate information online, but they must worry about  students  finding  incorrect  data,  pornography,  and  predators  along  the  way.  Protecting children and personal data online is a legal responsibility.  legal requirements  School  districts  that  receive  E-Rate  funds  are  subject  to  the  requirements  put  forth in the Children’s Internet Protection Act  CIPA ; so are districts that accept  funds for Title II, Part D, the Enhancing Education through Technology  EETT   program under the No Child Left Behind Act  NCLB , or Title III monies, when  used to make certain purchases related to Internet connectivity.  CIPA  compliance  means  that  districts  must  install  filtering  or  blocking  technology on every Internet-connected computer, whether used by students or  adults. Districts also have to implement a comprehensive Internet safety policy. In  addition, districts have to conduct a public meeting to discuss their Internet safety  policies and the measures for protection that they have in place.  The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act  COPPA  limits the ability of Web  sites to offer services to children ages 12 and younger without explicit parental  consent. Its goal is to protect children’s privacy and safety online.  138  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH7.indd   138  3 2 09   3:06:04 PM   online safety and security  C h a p t e r   7  A  new  law  under  consideration  in  Congress  as  of  this  writing,  the  Deleting  Online Predators Act  DOPA , would require public schools and libraries to block  student access to chat and social-networking sites. Its purpose is to thwart sexual  predators.  copyright and intellectual property  Copyright  law  is  confusing.  In  addition  to  the  issues  of  music  and  video  downloading, there’s an even more complex area, especially for schools—students  use of someone else’s intellectual property to illustrate points within their own  work. The fact that schools have rights for educational purposes under the Fair  Use doctrine does not mean that students have the right to use someone else’s  work without attribution. They need guidance to understand this.  Hall  Davidson  outlined  key  facts  that  administrators,  educators,  and  students  should know about intellectual property. This material and related articles, charts,  and information are posted at www.techlearning.com hot_topics copyright.jhtml.  The following steps for avoiding copyright problems are from Davidson’s  2005   Copyright Primer for Administrators.  Five Steps to Avoiding Copyright Problems  1  Create  and  implement  a  technology  policy  that  includes  a  code     of ethics and set of procedures.  2  Review  the  entire  policy  with  your  educational  community:   students, teachers, and parents.  3  Appoint a technology manager to conduct audits and maintain a   log of licenses and registration materials.  4  Teach ethical and legal behavior for technology use.  5  Thank employees and students for supporting these steps.  n.p.   There is a new system that can make things easier—one that enables students  to  use  content  they  want  and  helps  them  to  understand  the  conditions  around  that use. Creative Commons  www.creativecommons.org  is a system built within  current copyright law that allows people to mark their creations with a Creative  Commons license. The license allows others to use their music, movies, images,  and  text  online  for  specific  purposes,  such  as  classroom  use.  The  licenses  fall   web 2.0     new tools, new schools  139  NEWTOO CH7.indd   139  3 2 09   3:06:05 PM   C h a p t e r   7  online safety and security  between full copyright  reserving all rights, which is what traditional publishers  do  and being in the public domain  where works retain no rights .  Creative Commons helps people publish work online while letting others know  exactly  what  they  can  and  can’t  do  with  the  work.  For  example,  you  can  share  educational materials with students while protecting these materials from other  uses. With an attribution license, people can copy, distribute, display, and perform  someone else’s copyrighted work—and derivative works based upon it—only if they  give credit the way the holder requests. In 2005, a court in the Netherlands heard a  case that involved a Creative Commons license and ruled that it is binding.  The Creative Commons Web site carries the slogan “Share, reuse, and remix— legally.”  The  organization  suggests  that  people  include  a  Creative  Commons  “Some Rights Reserved” button on their Web sites near their work. The licenses  are outlined at http:  creativecommons.org about licenses .  security solutions  Awareness education programs, acceptable use policies, student ethical conduct  reviews, administrative restrictions, and parental involvement help, but sometimes  policies  that  include  a  stronger  approach  such  as  blocking  with  or  without  alternatives are necessary—for practical and legal reasons and for peace of mind.  As former principal Susan Brooks-Young  2006  says, “We can’t anticipate every  possible issue, but we can position ourselves so that we’re being proactive rather  than reactive”  n.p. .  In  a  survey  commissioned  by  Thinkronize  in  fall  2006,  four  out  of  five  school  principals and administrators who were surveyed thought that danger for students  on  the  Internet  is  increasing  and  commercial  and  pay  sites  are  their  greatest  concern. When asked to rate the specific types of dangers facing students online,  61% said pornography and 58% said adult predators were a great or significant  danger. Concern  over  getting  useless  or  irrelevant  results  when  using  search  engines was also high at 59%. Seventy-six percent of respondents said they were  concerned  about  students’  unauthorized  redirection  to  commercial  or  pay  sites  when conducting online research.  Educators are seeking ways to solve these problems. According to the report, the  actions they have taken to protect students include:  140  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH7.indd   140  3 2 09   3:06:06 PM   online safety and security  C h a p t e r   7  E  Installing filters—100%  E  Giving faculty instructions on safety—90%  E  Giving students instructions on safety—90%  E  Providing parents with tips and information—66%  E  Purchased special search engines—35%  Thinkronize, 2006, n.p.   awareness programs Students  do  not  always  realize  the  dangers  that  are  lurking  online  and  having  frank discussions is effective in preventing problems for students at school and  at home.

F  Overall, these students responded correctly for most questions, with scores at least  in the mid 80% range for third graders and mid 90% for fourth graders. Only  question 7 had low correct responses in both grade levels. Only 68% of the third- grade students and 83% of the fourth-grade students responded correctly, which  is that they would save the message and tell their parents. Most said they would  reply and tell the person to stop using such bad language.  Programs  that  instruct  students  on  the  issues  make  the  difference.  Another  successful  awareness  program  involves  students  researching  and  creating  an  online  safety  guide.  Vicki  Davis,  a  high-school  teacher  at  Westwood  High  in  Camilla, Georgia, had her 10th-grade computer science class create Online Safety  and Privacy Skills  http:  westwood.wikispaces.com Chapter+1+-+Security+and+  Privacy . This guidebook was written collaboratively in a wiki. Each team selected  a topic, researched the issue, and developed a team wiki. The chapters include  information  about  viruses,  intrusions,  spyware,  pop-up  ads,  e-commerce,  protection, e-mail scams, and privacy. Her students learned about the issues and   how to collaborate, and they created a real document that other students, parents,  and educators use. Davis  personal communication, September 2006  explains:  The method that I use to teach online safety and privacy has evolved  during  the  last  four  years  although  the  issues  have  always  been  a  part of our computer science curriculum. Beginning in November  2005, my class truly became a wiki-centric classroom and this class   web 2.0     new tools, new schools  143  NEWTOO CH7.indd   143  3 2 09   3:06:12 PM   C h a p t e r   7  online safety and security  decided  to  write  a  “wiki  book.”  By  creating  a  wiki  with  required  external sources of information, students learn to take information  from their textbook and the Web and create a usable summary.  The class felt strongly that they wanted to share what they learned  because  they  feel  that  there  is  a  widespread  lack  of  education  on  safety and privacy. Too many Web sites are “geek speak” and do not  answer security questions in everyday language.  We will do this project again next year, and the content will focus  on  being  current  and  updated  and  filling  in  the  areas  that  need  more explanation. This multi-year project will also demonstrate how  things such as Wikipedia work.   acceptable Use policies Most districts have acceptable use policies in place and have for years—ever since  they gave students access to technology in general and to the Internet in particular.  These policies outline the guidelines, procedures, and responsibilities for using  school technology. They may have to be adapted or rewritten entirely to cover new  online tools. It has to be clear where students may go online and what they may  do when they’re there.  In  addition,  because  students  are  now  contributors  as  well  as  consumers  of  information online, schools have to define their manner of participation and their  rights and responsibilities concerning new technologies, the blogs, podcasts, RSS  subscriptions, social networks, and more that they will encounter.  David Warlick  2006b  offers the following advice:   It’s time to take those AUPs off the shelf, unfold them, and add a  whole new layer—Web publishing policies. It is essential that your  new technology use policy is designed not merely as a preventative  tool, but as an enabling document that promotes effective uses that  solve problems and accomplish goals.  n.p.     Warlick  2006b  suggests four steps for reworking acceptable use policies:  1  Establish goals for the use of read write Web tools. These goals  should  range  through  administrative  functions,  classroom  management, and instructional objectives.  144  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH7.indd   144  3 2 09   3:06:12 PM   online safety and security  C h a p t e r   7  2  Itemize and describe specific uses of read write Web applications  that you will promote and support, tied to the goals established in  the first section.  3  Briefly  but  clearly  identify  those  activities  that  will  not  be  allowed.  These  might  include  conducting  business,  advertising  commercial  products  or  services,  defaming  the  character  of  others, and jeopardizing in any way the safety of students.  4  Plan your document or ancillary materials to serve as instructional  resources that might be used in the classroom. Provide teachers  with guidelines and procedures that not only govern student use  of  technology,  but  also  help  them  to  understand  and  put  into  practice basic foundations of information ethics.  n.p.   ethical Behavior While people usually think they know what ethical behavior is, there is often a  fine line between ethical and unethical actions. Nowhere is this more evident than  online, where many people seem to believe that because they are physically able to  copy or download files, it is OK to go ahead and do it. Teenagers too might come  to the conclusion that availability equals permission. They need to learn that just  because they can do something doesn’t mean they should.  Suddenly, it seems that the barriers are gone and the possibilities are endless. The  best example is in music downloading, where file sharing has been ubiquitous.  Yet Stephen Downes  2006  and others believe that “File sharing evolves not of a  sudden criminality among today’s youth but rather in their pervasive belief that  information is something meant to be shared”  n.p. .  Perhaps, but students can learn the finer points of ethics. The ethos of the free  and open-source software movement and Creative Commons licenses for content  teach a different lesson about sharing, contributing, and the value of community.  It’s no wonder that teenagers are confused about copyright. Many of the adults  who guide them are equally as confused. A Los Angeles Times Bloomberg poll  conducted in spring 2006 indicates that although many teens acknowledge that  downloading music or DVDs for free is illegal, they feel that making a copy of  music  or  movies  they  own  to  share  with  friends  is  OK   Duhigg,  2006 .  Table  7.1 shows the results of the poll, which asked teens and young adults about the  perceived illegality of various activities.   web 2.0     new tools, new schools  145  NEWTOO CH7.indd   145  3 2 09   3:06:13 PM   C h a p t e r   7  online safety and security  Table 7.1    IS It StealIng?  proportion of young people who  thought the following would be  committing a crime  Copying a CD from a friend who paid for it  Copying a DVD videotape from a friend   who paid for it  Downloading free music from an  unauthorized file-sharing server  Downloading free movies from an  unauthorized file-sharing server  Buying a bootlegged CD  Buying a bootlegged DVD videotape  Shoplifting an item worth less than $20  Shoplifting an item worth more than $20  E    Los Angeles Times.

E  Examine your own cultural values and avoid imposing those values on others.  E  Avoid stereotyping by race, gender, age, religion, ethnicity, geography,    sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, or social status.  E  Give voice to the voiceless; official and unofficial sources of information    can be equally valid.  E  Distinguish between opinion and fact when expressing ideas. Analysis and   commentary should be labeled and not misrepresent fact or context.  Minimize harm Ethical teachers and students treat information sources, subjects, colleagues, and  information consumers as human beings deserving of respect.  E  Gathering and expressing information should never cause harm or threaten    to be harmful to any one person or group of people.

In an attempt to prove a  point, Miguel Guhlin  2006c  posted the following list of possible administrator  concerns in the form of questions a principal might ask of a teacher who wants to  use blogs with students.  1  What  release  form  will  you  use  for  publishing  student  work   online?  2  Has  this  form  been  approved  by  the  District  Administrative   Procedures committee?  3  Are you using a District-supported Web site for hosting student  and teacher content, or is a commercial site being used for this  purpose?  Please  note  that  with  the  importance  of  protecting  students  from  unauthorized  access  by  online  predators,  it  is  important that the venues which students frequent be kept within  District control.  4  Has the campus administrator approved teachers participating in   potentially putting students at risk?  5  What steps have been taken to ensure all stakeholders are aware   of what is going on?  6  Have  parents  been  notified  so  that  they  understand  this  is  an  instructional  activity  and  what  the  duration  of  such  types  of  activities might be?  7  How does use of blogs, image galleries with RSS feeds, and other  such Web sites prepare students to achieve at an “exemplary” level  on our state-mandated tests?  8  Will there be sufficient access for students, or will instructional  time  be  used  for  these  activities?  If  after-hours,  how  will  this  impact existing instructional programs like Terrific Tutoring that  help  students  achieve  state  mandated  instructional  objectives?   n.p.   web 2.0     new tools, new schools  149  NEWTOO CH7.indd   149  3 2 09   3:06:19 PM   C h a p t e r   7  online safety and security  parental Involvement Working  with  parents  so  that  they  understand  the  issues  and  the  policies  is  important. They also may need someplace to turn when the same issues confront  them at home. While schools have tools to influence students’ behavior, parents  are often unaware of the problems and have few strategies to resolve them.  How  should  schools  reach  out  to  parents?  Providing  guides  such  as  the  ones  published by MySpace, or directing them to resources such as GetNetWise  see  below , help parents to cope and school personnel to work with them.  Cable  in  the  Classroom  commissioned  a  survey  of  parents  in  July  2006  about  online safety. According to Douglas Levin, senior director of education policy for  Cable in the Classroom:  Parents want to take primary responsibility for guiding their kids’ use  of the Internet. Yet, as the Internet continues to change and evolve,  most  parents  don’t  feel  very  knowledgeable  about  how  to  ensure  children’s Internet safety and are looking for schools to help.  n.p.   The  findings  showed  that  71%  of  parents  believe  that  a  major  portion  of  the  responsibility  for  ensuring  children’s  safety  on  the  Internet  falls  to  schools.  In  addition, 49% of parents think that the government and law enforcement agencies  should have a lot of responsibility in the arena of children’s online safety. Of the  parents surveyed, 54% reported seeking advice from other parents and from their  child’s school. Finally, 94% had taken steps to try to ensure their children’s online  safety. These steps included:  E  Talking to them about how to use the Internet  88%   E  Monitoring online activities  82%   E  Confining  home  Internet  use  to  the  living  room  or  other  open   spaces  75%     55%   n.p.

The Online Safety Guide from GetNetWise  2003; http:  kids.getnetwise. org safetyguide   states, “Keeping children safe on the Internet is everyone’s job”   n.p. . The GetNetWise  2003  organization recommends that:  150  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH7.indd   150  3 2 09   3:06:20 PM   online safety and security  C h a p t e r   7  E  Parents need to stay in close touch with their kids as they explore   the Internet.  safely.  E  Teachers need to help students use the Internet appropriately and   E  Community  groups,  including  libraries,  after-school  programs,   and others should help educate the public about safe surfing.  E  Kids and teens need to learn to take responsibility for their own  behavior—with guidance from their families and communities.   n.p.   Schools  often  suggest  that  parents  visit  the  extensive  library  of  materials  on  GetNetWise  www.getnetwise.org  to help them understand the issues and protect  their children. It offers many resources in one place as well as links to others.   MySpace  has  also  published  parent’s  and  school  administrator’s  guides  to  Internet  safety.  The  parent’s  guide  helps  parents  understand  MySpace  and  answers questions about social networks and the Internet in general. The school  administrator’s  guide,  which  the  National  School  Board  Association   NSBA   distributed to 55,000 public school administrators in October 2006, addresses the  various  challenges  that  students  and  educators  face.  Check  out  www.myspace. com safetytips  for more information.  Blocking Adults and teens view the Internet very differently. For the former, the Web is a  tool, a place to check e-mail, get information, and shop. For teens, it’s a place to  hang out with friends, especially for real-time communication, which to them is  essential. But they sometimes run into problems online.  In spite of preventive measures, schools sometimes have a problem with Internet  searching. The issue is primarily with the way Google and Yahoo label graphics  that  prevents  filters  from  identifying  cyberporn.  Both  search  engines  have  internal features that block pornographic images; yet students sometimes disable  them. Combinations of hardware and software filtering solutions are emerging to  combat the problem. Some districts avoid the issue by licensing search engines  specifically for education such as netTrekker d.i., which provides access to more  than  180,000  educator-selected,  standards-based  online  resources  including  an  image database for safe, pornography-free images.  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  151  NEWTOO CH7.indd   151  3 2 09   3:06:20 PM   C h a p t e r   7  online safety and security  Almost all districts today set up firewalls or barriers to protect the network from  potential hackers and inappropriate Web sites. A firewall is software or hardware  or  both  that  filters  the  information  coming  through  the  Internet  connection  into  your  network  and  blocks  incoming  packets  of  information  that  the  filter  flags. Content filtering prevents students from viewing inappropriate materials,  though for filters to work properly, they depend on having all participants agree  to be filtered all the time. Blocking enforces the use of the filtering server, thus  preventing  end  users  from  bypassing  filtering.  It  prevents  viruses,  spam,  and  other dangers from reaching network computers.  For technology planning teams, the challenges are urgent. In addition to keeping  students from accessing inappropriate Web destinations from school and being  targets of spam, viruses, and other destructive elements, some districts with one- to-one  programs  have  to  install  endpoint  Internet  filtering  systems  for  off-site  laptops connected to their networks. Effective filtering stops spyware, malware,  and other security threats as well as inappropriate content.  knotty problems  Of  course,  administrators  worry  about  students  circumventing  even  the  best  strategies and spending time inappropriately. Some special problems arise from  instant messaging, which is possible not only from computers but also from cell  phones; social networking, which is the networking activity of choice for today’s  Internet generation; and image sharing, whether students post digital photos on  Flickr or videoclips on YouTube.  Administrators also have to determine how to handle posting photos of students  online. According to Scott McLeod  2006b , an educator and lawyer:  Schools  take  pictures  of  students  all  the  time—for  yearbooks,  at  athletic  events,  in  class,  at  artistic  performances,  etc.  Often  they  want to post those pictures to the Internet, thus making those photos  potentially available to a global audience. Every school district should  have  a  policy  for  dealing  with  student  photos.  That  policy  should  comply with the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act   FERPA    www.ed.gov policy gen guid fpco ferpa    as  well  as  any  relevant state statutes.  n.p.   152  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH7.indd   152  3 2 09   3:06:21 PM   online safety and security  C h a p t e r   7  Instant Messaging Initially designed for conducting one-on-one personal chats, instant messaging   also referred to as IM  has made its way into schools and offices. Many people  use  text-based  IM  over  phone  calls  and  e-mail—preferring  its  immediacy  and  efficiency in getting real-time information from others. Young people in particular  have adopted this technology as their own.  IM is different from other types of Internet applications in that it involves direct  connections between computers—either within a school or across the Internet.  While  it  is  a  popular  way  to  send  text  messages,  files,  audio,  and  video  for  collaborative work, IM’s lack of basic security features opens the door to hackers  and viruses and perhaps to data capture.  IM is one of the most difficult applications to control because it attempts to hide  within other network services, borrowing assigned TCP port numbers for its own  communication.  This  stealthy  approach  makes  traditional  firewalls  ineffective.  Regaining control and security over this type of service is a challenge to district  IT departments. Their solution is often to block access.  New  Hampshire’s  Monadnock  Community  High  School,  for  example,  allows  students,  teachers,  and  parents  to  communicate  using  an  internal  IM.  Most  of  the conversation revolves around students collaborating on projects, but parents  can  contact teachers about their students’ work, and students can ask questions of  their teachers with instant messages. By allowing IM in schools, implementations  such as this take advantage of the benefits. Keeping it behind a firewall avoids  harmful interactions, though IM use still requires careful management.  Social networking It is easy to understand why social-networking sites have become so compelling.  Just  how  compelling  can  be  seen  in  MySpace’s  astonishing  growth:  Estimates  indicate  that  5  million  new  members  join  each  month.  They  can  craft  their  personas and change them at will; they can be daring, popular, and attractive if  they want. They can even claim accomplishments they may want to retract later.  While in real life, many teens would welcome anonymity, online they can assume  an identity and be the sort of person they imagine would be fun. They can stand  out and be recognized and have a shot at fame.  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  153  NEWTOO CH7.indd   153  3 2 09   3:06:22 PM   C h a p t e r   7  online safety and security  Social  networking  doesn’t  introduce  new  technologies  and  services.  Rather,  it  aggregates  existing  standalone  services  in  new  ways,  offering  e-mail,  instant  messenging,  and  blogs,  along  with  profiles  and  photo  galleries—all  from  one  interface.  Making  everything  available  from  one  screen  is  very  conducive  to  building  communities,  but  on  the  downside,  social-networking  sites  make  personal information public and readily available in one virtual location.  And  that’s  only  part  of  the  problem.  Despite  regulations  that  restrict  MySpace  membership  to  users  14  and  older,  there’s  no  way  to  prevent  a  13-year-old  girl  from creating a profile that indicates she’s 19. Similarly, there’s nothing to stop a  40-year-old sexual predator from pretending to be a sympathetic 21-year-old. And  making contact is merely a matter of clicking an IM or sending an e-mail.  While MySpace offers filtering tools and protection, and parents have to decide  what to do about access, school districts and libraries that receive federal funds  must comply with CIPA. One of the regulation’s requirements states that images  “harmful to minors”  children 17 or under  must be blocked. This may not be  a  simple  process  because  bogus  URLs  evade  the  filters.  Some  filters  contain  a  wildcard to identify all variants of a URL, no matter how it’s disguised.  That’s  not  to  say  that  anyone  objects  to  the  use  of  social  networking  as  a  tool  if  it  can  be  accomplished  within  a  safe  environment.  One  online  educational  community,  Whyville   www.whyville.net ,  a  blend  of  social  networking  and  animated simulation, attracts almost 2 million children ages 8–15, who chat and  share information. While it is not a Web 2.0 site, it is free. Students use avatars  rather than personal images; they have to pass a “chat license” test, and violations  of their laws are picked up in “911 reports” to adults who monitor behavior.  Occasionally  we  see  positive  change;  one  example  is  in  MySpace’s  statistics.  We don’t know why—whether blocking or good sense prevailed, or there was a  naturally occurring increase in interest by a different demographic group—but  from August 2005 to August 2006 the percentage of visitors ages 12–17 declined by  nearly half at a time when the site’s traffic doubled, going from 21.8 to 55.8 million  unique visitors. People ages 12–17 now represent only 11.9% of the visitors, while  people ages 25–34 make up 16.7% of the visitors  Mindlin, 2006 .  Image Sharing Image-sharing sites such as Flickr that offer users the ability to upload their own  photos as well as download the work of others have become controversial. Because  photos at Flickr have Creative Commons copyright licenses, it’s clear what uses   154  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH7.indd   154  3 2 09   3:06:22 PM   online safety and security  C h a p t e r   7  are allowed for each picture. In addition to being a popular Web site for people to  share personal photographs, Flickr also allows photos to be tagged, which makes  it a good repository for bloggers’ photos.  Because so many of the photos at Flickr allow use for educational purposes, they  are  valuable  for  educators  in  teaching  digital  storytelling.  Because  anyone  can  post  images,  students  might  find  some  that  are  inappropriate.  For  this  reason,  many districts block access to Flickr.  In a recent controversy over Flickr’s use in K–12, techLEARNING bloggers Miguel  Guhlin and David Jakes parried arguments to one another and to the community  of readers.   Miguel Guhlin  2006c  states that blocking sites with inappropriate content is the  responsible choice and suggests Web Gallery software such as the open-source  Gallery 2  http:  gallery.menalto.com , so that “students will not be exposed to the  inappropriate images found on commercial, adult sites that have been appropriated  for student use”  n.p. .  David  Jakes   2006a   thinks  that  school  boards  should  set  policy  and  if  it’s  a  community  decision  to  block  access  to  Flickr,  that’s  the  right  decision  for  them. However, those students will miss a lot, not only because of the beautiful  photography  they  won’t  see  or  think  about  but  also  because  “there  are  missed  opportunities  to  prepare  students  for  the  real  world  and  take  advantage  of  a  teachable moment that can have lasting benefit”  n.p. .    The  techLEARNING  readers  were  asked  to  weigh  in  with  their  opinions  in  response  to  these  two  opposing  viewpoints.  The  site  stated,  “School  districts  around the country have set district policy to block access to what some consider  inappropriate  social-networking  sites,  including  sites  like  Flickr  and  YouTube.  Others  argue  that  these  sites  can  be  used  to  enhance  teaching  and  learning.”   Sullivan, 2006, n.p.   Readers were asked what their districts do and how they viewed the policy. Most of  them  43%  said that their districts block social-networking sites and they believe  it should stay that way. Others  29%  would like to see their districts’ blocking  policies change. Another 24% said that they block but have alternatives in place.  Only 3% said that their districts don’t block.  Parents and educators are concerned about students posting private, provocative,  and even untrue information on MySpace.com, and about their vulnerability there.   web 2.0     new tools, new schools  155  NEWTOO CH7.indd   155  3 2 09   3:06:23 PM   C h a p t e r   7  online safety and security  Schools are reaching out to parents to help them understand the issues involved  with using the site. The site’s owner, News Corp., is addressing security issues but  many schools simply do not allow access.  other alternatives  What  happens  when  great  tools  are  blocked?  How  can  students  have  access  to  them for learning? One solution is to have sites that are dedicated to education. As  on Wikipedia, moderators could patrol and edit or remove inappropriate content.  One example is David Warlick’s Class Blogmeister  http:  classblogmeister.com ,  which was designed specifically for the classroom so that teachers could be the  arbiter of appropriate content. The system is in a controlled environment in that  teachers set up a class blog and add the names of students who should have access.  Students  write  and  do  peer  editing,  but  their  teacher  makes  the  decisions  and  evaluates, comments on, and eventually posts students’ blogs.  Elgg   www.elgg.org ,  a  hybrid  of  blogging,  e-portfolios,  and  social  networking,  provides  an  environment  for  students  to  create  their  own  learning  space  and  connect to others, forming online learning communities. Students can create a  profile that lists their likes and dislikes, upload their favorite files, create blogs,  post podcasts, add RSS feeds, and use keywords to connect others who have the  same  interests.  The  key  factor  is  that  activities  focus  on  learning  rather  than  on  hanging  out.  Access  controls  make  it  possible  to  keep  their  profiles  private,  available to selected users, or public. Districts can decide to allow students access  or host the system on their own servers. Both are free.  Another solution is to place Web 2.0 tools on intranets so they are behind district  firewalls.  This  limits  students  to  collaborating  only  with  youngsters  who  are  already in close proximity, but it provides access to new tools and security. Miguel  Guhlin  2006b  recommends a “walled garden” of safe Web 2.0 tools that can be  used within a school’s intranet with the ability to control or “lock” things down  and eliminate social networking outside of the school environment. For example,  there are wiki applications that districts can install and run from their own servers  such  as  Socialtext   www.socialtext.com   and  TWiki   www.twiki.org .  Users  can  set up accounts, then write and revise their collaborative work.  156  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH7.indd   156  3 2 09   3:06:24 PM   online safety and security  C h a p t e r   7  David Jakes  2006d  provides a related example:  We use Blackboard … for our blogs, wikis, and discussion boards. Some  might criticize that for a less-than-authentic experience, but … it’s safe  and it’s what our community wants. Every student post, contribution,  etc. is stamped with the login information, which provides a healthy  deterrent  to  those  interested  in  less  than  appropriate  contribution.  So  far,  absolutely  no  issues … no  inappropriate  comments,  no  pornographic  spam,  etc.  Just  a  safe  environment  for  learning  the  tools.  n.p.   There  are  also  free,  although  not  open  source,  solutions  such  as  Think.com,  Oracle  Education  Foundation’s  philanthropic  initiative,  which  provides  online  tools for education that are hosted remotely but that provide access only to teacher- designated  users.  Think.com  allows  teachers  to  design  and  coach  projects  for  their students to work on collaboratively. Teachers can communicate with other  educators around the world to share ideas and projects. Student teams create Web  pages,  exchange  ideas,  and  share  information  on  a  specific  topic.  Projects  can  be  self-contained  within  a  class  or  school,  or  students  can  join  a  project  from  another school or open up their project for students in other schools to join. As  long as schools are members, students can work together across schools, districts,  and even countries. The key is that membership is limited to educators and their  students.  For districts that want or need help with Web 2.0 services, there are consultants,  such as Clarity Innovations  www.clarity-innovations.com  in Portland, Oregon,  who can set it up  see sidebar: Implementing Web 2.0 Technologies in Schools,  by Steven Burt . Companies such as CrossTec  www.crossteccorp.com  will create  a school or district communication system and maintain it on their servers for  security.   web 2.0     new tools, new schools  157  NEWTOO CH7.indd   157  3 2 09   3:06:24 PM   C h a p t e r   7  online safety and security  web 2.0 wisdom  Implementing Web 2.0 technologies in Schools Steven Burt  In 2001, we begAn uSIng webloggIng toolS as a sort of thin  content management system  CMS  to allow teachers and in some  cases students to publish content on the Web.

One very successful school district we’ve been working with is the  Lincolnwood School District  www.sd74.org  in Chicago, Illinois.  Working with the district Web team, we developed a strategic plan for  including Web 2.0 tools and built a new infrastructure  based on open- source software  to enable them to glue together the small pieces of  various tools, such as a true CMS, Flickr, Google Maps  and other Google  tools , RSS, and custom syndication. Their site is now based on a Web  2.0 platform that enables the best of what they find out on the Web and  want to try. The platform should be stable for community interaction and  communication for many years to come.

In  addition,  there  are  some  universal or systemic issues that all schools  must  consider  and  respond  to  through  their  programs,  activities,  and  professional  development. These issues may come sharply  into focus when considering technology, and  in particular, the use of Web 2.0 tools. This  chapter  examines  the  implementation  and  possibilities for not only using these tools in  the curriculum, but also using the tools in  ways to create opportunities for all learners  in a community.   E E E E E  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  159  NEWTOO CH8.indd   159  3 2 09   3:07:14 PM   C h a p t e r   8  systemic issues  Many issues are found in educational communities and using technology often  adds another layer of complexity to the questions all educators routinely address.  However, Web 2.0 tools offer opportunities to address these challenges in new  ways, based on what research shows us about the way learning occurs.  english language learners   and english as a second language  The 5.4 million students currently classified as limited English proficient  LEP   “are our fastest-growing student population and are expected to make up one out  of every four students by 2025”  U.S. Department of Education, 2006, n.p. . The  number of students entering U.S. public school classrooms with a first language  other than English continues to grow, according to the National Clearinghouse  for Bilingual Education, as cited by Mohr  2004 . Mohr continues, “The need to  provide  better  instruction  for  English  language  learners  requires  an  updated,  invigorated approach to their schooling”  p. 18 . Current literature provides many  ideas on how teachers can teach learning strategies and how certain strategies,  such as activating prior knowledge, making connections, visualizing, and asking  questions,  affect  the  general  education  student’s  reading  comprehension.  It  is  unfortunate that many teachers “are not well versed in how culture and language  can relate positively to student learning”  Gutiérrez, 2002, p. 1049 . While no one  is suggesting that technology can resolve all challenges faced by second language  learners,  it  is  worth  considering  the  possibilities  for  improving  learning  that  technology may afford.   Some research has indicated promise in using technology to work with students.  Daud and Husin  2004  found that the use of a computer program helped ESL   English as a second language  students develop critical analysis skills. Allowing  ESOL   English  for  speakers  of  other  languages   students  to  create  electronic  portfolios  on  personal  Web  sites  created  a  nonthreatening  alternate  evaluation  solution  to  traditional  standardized  assessments   Chang,  Wu,  &  Ku,  2005 .  Similarly, Zha, Kelly, Park, and Fitzgerald  2006  found that students’ use of written  language for personal expression and enjoyment increased when discussion boards  were introduced. Of course, teachers need to be prepared to utilize technology in  their  classrooms.  Brown  and  Warschauer’s   2006   study  found  that  while  new  teachers were knowledgeable of the many types of technology available, they were  not sufficiently prepared to integrate this technology into curricular activities.  160  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH8.indd   160  3 2 09   3:07:15 PM   systemic issues  C h a p t e r   8  We know that a second language is best acquired through meaningful engagement  with the language  Gersten & Baker, 2000  as opposed to a set of grammatical  rules  to  be  mastered.  One  way  to  make  this  language  usage  meaningful  is  to  create opportunities to use it in social interactions with native English speakers  and with peers in general  Collier, 1997 . We also know that learning a language  embedded in the content areas as part of that meaningful engagement with the  language  helps  to  reduce  the  academic  achievement  gap  between  native  and  nonnative speakers  Collier, 1997; Peregoy & Boyle, 2005 .  Cooperative learning activities were shown to have a positive effect on the academic  achievement of English language learners, or ELL  Allen, 2006; Calderon, Hertz- Lazarowitz, & Slavin, 1998; Naughton, 2006 . A study by Xu, Gelfer, and Perkins   2005   confirmed  the  view  that  informal  peer  interaction  may  have  beneficial  effects on the ELL student’s ability to read, write, speak, and understand English.  Baltova  1999  concluded that teachers should integrate traditional methods with  new technologies as more computer resources become available and popular.  Pawling   1999   conducted  two  case  studies  to  explore  CD  use  for  vocabulary  acquisition, pronunciation, and independent learning. She reported that foreign  language instruction is moving from traditional teacher-centered classrooms to  student-centered  resource-based  classrooms  with  activity  centers  for  listening,  reading,  playing  games,  working  in  pairs,  and  writing.  Innovative  and  well- funded schools also provided video and computer stations. Pawling found positive  attributes  for  CD  use  at  both  of  the  participating  schools.  Use  of  multimedia  apparently provided natural differentiation, a nonthreatening environment, and  cooperative  work  opportunities.  Students  stayed  on  task,  recalled  vocabulary,  improved pronunciation, and demonstrated increased motivation. Jones and Plass   2002  found that for short-term retention Pauling’s the hypothesis that multimedia  increases multiple levels of learning, was true, but that pictorial annotations were  better for long-term retention. Their study suggested that teachers should provide  resources to aid comprehension while listening.  Given the evidence that technology may have a positive effect on learning, we can  consider ways that Web 2.0 tools might expand students’ learning of English and  becoming more proficient in the educational activities required in our schools.  Blogging Poling  2005  writes, “Blogging as a classroom application allows for enhanced  comprehension and communication among students as well as the ability to build  deeper understanding across the curriculum. … Blogging is a wonderful way to   web 2.0     new tools, new schools  161  NEWTOO CH8.indd   161  3 2 09   3:07:15 PM   C h a p t e r   8  systemic issues  enhance student understanding”  p. 12 . Some second-language teachers believe  that  blogs  can  be  used  to  give  students  authentic  language  activities   Godwin- Jones, 2003 .  Campbell   2006   suggests  there  are  three  unique  uses  of  blogs  with  an  ESL  classroom. First, one could use the blog as a tutor, with the instructor being the  one who posts regularly. This would give reading practice to learners. The content  could be related to students’ interests and recent activities, vocabulary words could  be woven into the materials, and links to English language Web sites could engage  students in reading even more. Questions to be answered or “comment” buttons  would encourage writing responses. Second, one of the concerns that typically is  mentioned is that ESL and ELL students may learn to speak English well from  classmates, but they may have more difficulty in writing and reading it. Creating  a  blog  for  the  students  to  use  may  help  address  this  through  educational  and  recreational reading and writing. The learners might create a blog of their own, in  English, to support their questions, knowledge, and ideas on class assignments or  topics of common interest. Finally, a class “learning community” could create its  own blog. This might encourage threaded discussions, support group activities, or  identify questions or concerns. If the learners are sufficiently proficient in reading  and writing English, other classrooms  in other schools or countries  could join  the blog and add their own comments on a particular topic or identified problem.  podcasting Graham Stanley  2005  has developed several “interactive listening mazes” using  podcasting  an interactive listening maze is a story that allows the reader to decide  what happens and what action to take throughout the story . Stanley’s interactive  reading mazes allow students to use the audio as a pronunciation model to review  their  vocabulary,  to  test  themselves  by  writing  meanings  from  vocabulary,  or  simply to learn the material subliminally through short phrases and sentences.  At the same time, we are seeing efforts to expand these tools beyond podcasting.  No  fewer  than  five  major  universities  have  already  begun  experimenting  with  coursecasting, and several blogs now address the subject. Through secure sites,  students  may  log  in  to  download  lectures  from  their  professors.  At  Stanford  University, professors are waiting a month before their lectures become available  for download. In this case, the coursecasts are available more for review  e.g., prior  to a test or for writing a paper  than for learning new material. Is this a direction  that K–12 might pursue for all learners? One can imagine how students for whom  English is a struggle could download lectures or interact with colleagues before   162  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH8.indd   162  3 2 09   3:07:16 PM   systemic issues  C h a p t e r   8  an examination. If school libraries could be “stocked with compressed audio and  video files for students to ‘check out’ onto their MP3 players  and or if the players  themselves  could  be  borrowed  from  the  library ,  this  may  provide  a  lower  cost  and lower space requirement than traditional media storehouses”  Kadel, 2006,  p. 49 .  It is possible that podcasts may be one of the most effective ways to learn a foreign  language, to learn English as a second language, or to learn other subjects that  may  be  difficult  to  comprehend.  We  are  aware  of  the  power  and  necessity  of  auditory input and repetition for a variety of topics. In learning music, for example,  students have used podcasting to listen to, memorize, and critique classical music  and  even  to  share  their  original  musical  creations.  Foreign  language  teachers  have shared native music, literature, and plays through podcasting  Flanagan &  Calandra, 2005 .  Students have been able to create foreign language audio projects to share with  their class and their teacher. In social studies or history, primary documents can  include historical speeches, radio plays, interviews with experts, and audio books.  The ability to hear these items as often as one wishes puts the learner in control  of the learning. Audio books, newspapers, and magazines could be provided to  students as podcasts. Flanagan and Calandra  2005  suggest that an audio version  of Project Gutenberg would be useful so that teachers, parents, or students could  download free and legal materials.  students with special needs  Hasselbring  2001  argues that in many cases, “students with disabilities have a  greater need for accessing technology than do their non-disabled peers. This may  be especially true for those students who need technology just to function within  the school environment, such as students with sensory and physical impairments”   p. 16 . Students with learning challenges are now able to have access to podcasts,  learning materials, and videos, and at times that suit their individual schedules.  Additionally, the multimodality of these tools allows students to learn in ways that  best meet their learning styles.  Research shows that students with learning disabilities also benefit from explicit  instruction of learning strategies. Swanson and Hoskyn  1999  report a positive  result  when  a  combination  of  strategy  and  direct  instruction  is  provided  to  students  with  learning  disabilities.  Early  intervention  and  reading  support  are   web 2.0     new tools, new schools  163  NEWTOO CH8.indd   163  3 2 09   3:07:17 PM   C h a p t e r   8  systemic issues  critical  for  at-risk  students  and  students  with  learning  disabilities  according  to  Short, Frye, King, and Homan  1999 . They also report reading comprehension  for  these  students  increased  when  teachers  had  high  expectations,  provided  successful  reading  experiences,  and  taught  specific  strategy  skills.  One  study  found  that  if  teachers  model  and  provide  children  with  the  language  tools  for  talking about meaning, reading comprehension increased for students with mild  disabilities  Englert, Mariage, Garmon, & Tarrant, 1998 . The large majority of  studies  we  reviewed  show  that  explicitly  teaching  learning  strategies  positively  improves the reading comprehension of general and special education students,  and none reported a negative relationship. Peer-assisted learning strategies  PALS   have been shown to have a positive effect on students with learning disabilities  in the general population of native English speakers  Fuchs, Fuchs, Mathes, &  Simmons, 1997 .  Current federal guidelines require that assistive technology must be considered for  every student who has an individualized education program  IEP . Any technology  that is necessary to aid a student in meeting IEP goals and objectives qualifies as  an assistive technology. This might include an electronic spelling aid for a student  with a spelling disability or the ability to record lectures for a student with auditory  processing  difficulties.  Bausch   1999   created  a  special  keyboard  that  consisted  only of number and control keys with a computer program designed to provide  math facts instruction to students with learning disabilities.  With new Web 2.0 technologies, it is possible to imagine that a wide variety of  tools  might  be  useful  to  the  student  who  requires  multiple  input  strategies  or  alternative methods for expressing what has been learned. Already we have seen  an adaptive device for individuals with high levels of quadriplegia called a switch  pod   www.tecsol.com.au SwitchPod.htm .  There  are  touch  screens  that  replace  the use of a mouse for students with fine motor difficulties  www.touchscreens. com .  One  program,  Voycabulary,  allows  students  with  reading  difficulties  to  automatically  obtain  definitions  of  unfamiliar  words   www.voycabulary.com .  There is even a handheld for individuals with visual difficulties  www.humanware. com about news news300606.asp . All of these adaptive technologies allow Web  2.0 to become useful for every student.  In a review of research, Maccini, Gagnon, and Hughes  2002  found that auditory  assistance was very helpful for secondary students with learning disabilities. This  information may provide a rationale for teachers to provide podcasts of important  lectures to students, but may also encourage students to get assistance through  other auditory support materials. Interestingly, teachers have always known that   164  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH8.indd   164  3 2 09   3:07:18 PM   systemic issues  C h a p t e r   8  frequently  the  “extra”  support  given  to  students  with  learning  difficulties  also  improves the learning of all students, and perhaps Web 2.0 tools will raise the  knowledge and skills of our entire K–12 population.  There are also resources to provide information, access, and a sense of community.  For example, the Special Education blog  http:  specialed.about.com  offers links  for parents and teachers about a variety of topics, including wikis and podcasts  for downloading. Another one, Family.com  http:  education.families.com blog  category 134  , has a collection of links on special accommodations for enhanced  student learning, solutions that other teachers and parents have discovered, and  a  blog  for  communicating  with  other  parents  and  teachers.  One  state  site,  the  Connecticut  Special  Education  Resource   www.state.ct.gov sde site  ,  has  created  a  blog  for  parents  and  teachers  to  ask  questions  and  communicate.  And  some  institutions  have  created  blogs  for  those  interested  in  special  education   www. uwstout.edu lib subjects edspec.htm .  An ongoing challenge  for all schools is to  provide an equal  opportunity to learn and  achieve to all students.   Because  special  needs  issues  are  heavily  connected  to  legal  education  issues,  one  site,  Eduwonk.com   www.eduwonk.com ,  offers information on the legal considerations for educators and parents involved  in  working  with  schools.  Additionally,  a  special  education  law  blog  provides  information and a connection to others  http:  specialedlaw.blogs.com .  Podcasts are also populating the airwaves for those interested in special education  topics.  Pediatrics  for  Parents   www.pedsforparents.com   offers  podcasts  for  specific areas of concern, and Podcasts for Teachers  www.idiotvox.com Education  PodCast_Review_Podcast_for_Teachers__13037.html  covers all topics including  those  related  to  teaching  students  with  special  needs.  Almost  every  Web  site  devoted to this topic offers some type of podcast for those interested.  equity and the digital divide  An ongoing challenge for all schools is to provide an equal opportunity to learn  and achieve to all students. This must be viewed through the reality of unequal  access  to  technology,  specifically  in  schools  with  high  minority  populations,  high  proportions  of  families  who  have  cultural  or  linguistic  diversity,  or  in   web 2.0     new tools, new schools  165  NEWTOO CH8.indd   165  3 2 09   3:07:18 PM   C h a p t e r   8  systemic issues  schools located in rural areas. Female students and students who are physically  challenged may also face unequal access. Equity is a complex issue and reflects the  conundrum found throughout our society. There is an existing tension between  families  with  high-speed  access  in  their  homes  and  those  who  have  limited  or  no access, and between those who have comfort and experience with using the  technologies and those who do not. Language barriers also come into play, as do  educator expectations that assignments be completed using technology.  Some possible solutions to this problem have been suggested. Nicholas Negroponte,  founder  and  chairman  of  One  Laptop  per  Child,  has  demonstrated  a  working  model of a proposed $100 laptop  www.laptop.org . While many of these laptops  are destined for third world countries, areas of the United States are also going to  be eligible to become part of this collaborative project. These machines will not  require wired broadband access  with ongoing expenses that are often significant   but will work off a satellite connection.  Another option is for schools to use open-source software and tools, so that anyone  with a machine is able to use the same tools from any machine. The Nonprofit  Open  Source  Initiative   NOSI   was  formed  in  early  2001  by  a  collaboration  of  nonprofit  sector  technology  assistance  providers  who  were  interested  in  the  potential of open-source software to benefit their organizations.  We have also seen the emergence of mobcasting, which is mobile audio podcasting  using a mobile phone to receive the programming. Since a large percentage of  students have mobile phones, this may level the playing field even further  Clyde,  2005 .  Bridging the Digital Divide with Web 2.0 tools Although nearly all students have access to computer systems and the Internet  while  at  school,  the  most  recent  census  statistics  reveal  inequitable  access  at  home. Nearly 70% of White  Non-Hispanic  and Asian-American children have  both computers and Internet access at home, while fewer than 40% of American- Indian,  Hispanic,  and  African-American  children  have  both  computers  and  Internet access at home  Becker, 2000 . Based on these statistics, teachers should  determine whether students have computers and Internet access at home before  assigning blogs as instructional tools outside the school environment.   Another use of Web 2.0 tools is for those learners who routinely miss days or weeks  at  a  time  to  be  with  their  families.  Several  states  and  universities  have  created  organizations  to  support  migrant  families  through  technology  and  distance   166  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH8.indd   166  3 2 09   3:07:19 PM   systemic issues  C h a p t e r   8  learning initiatives  www.education-world.com a_curr curr347.shtml . This is an  opportunity to reach out to individuals and prepare them for their return to the  public schools. Through technology, students can stay in contact with their friends  and  teachers.  Other  organizations   for  example,  Conexiones,  http:  conexiones. asu.edu mep.html  have sought to determine ways to use technology to avoid the  typical disruption, lack of resources, and language difficulty that have routinely  been  problems  for  children  in  migrant  worker  families.  These  programs  are  funded by the U. S. Department of Migrant Education.  School  districts  are  also  working  on  strategies  to  level  the  playing  field  for  all  students.  They  have  created  a  wide  variety  of  after-school  programs,  clubs,  technology “specials,” and family technology classes.  In addition, communities have become aware of the dilemma that their members  face without access to technology. The Intel Corporation has invested heavily in  understanding the ways communities and individuals adopt and use technology.  One example demonstrates what they are doing:  North  Lawndale  is  a  low-income  community  on  the  west  side  of  Chicago that recently had a world class wireless network installed at  no cost to the community. In order to use the network, community  residents must have a computer and some form of Wi-Fi capability.  For residents who are using the wireless network, the main reason is  to have Internet connectivity so their children can access educational  resources.  Other  residents  said  convenience  was  a  key  factor  in  adoption.  For  instance,  one  disabled  veteran  uses  the  technology  to  deal  with  the  Veterans  Administration  and  other  government  agencies.  In  addition,  a  few  residents  use  the  network  for  their  home-based businesses. Virtually everyone who spoke with the Intel  researchers thought that the new wireless network would ultimately  make their neighborhood a better, safer place to live, because it would  bring  economic  development  to  the  neighborhood  and  would  give  teens with little chance of getting jobs, access to educational materials  and job skills training. That said, thus far the adoption rate has been  relatively low, beyond the users cited earlier. Many non-adopters said  the technology did not seem relevant to their lives. The challenge is  to identify new usage models that could make a measurable impact  on their lives.

All schools are  driven by requirements to maintain and improve standardized test scores. And yet  these efforts create a rather interesting conundrum, because frequently the “new  school” model and high-stakes testing seem in conflict with each other. At the  same time, we have seen an equally vigorous effort toward authentic assessment.  This type of assessment involves  engaging and worthy problems or questions of importance, in which  students must use knowledge to fashion performances effectively and  creatively. The tasks are either replicas of or analogous to the kinds of  problems faced by adult citizens and consumers or professionals in  the field.  Wiggins, 1993, p. 229   Can assessment be authentic and simultaneously prepare students to succeed in  the  standardized  testing  that  they  will  face?  Absolutely!  If  we  consider  another  definition  of  authentic  assessment,  it  will  become  clear.  Stiggins   1987   said,  “Performance assessments call upon the examinee to demonstrate specific skills   and competencies, that is, to apply the skills and knowledge they have mastered”  p. 34 .  Perhaps the most obvious use of Web 2.0 tools for assessment would be for students  to be able to show what they know in a wide  variety  of  media.  If  we  consider  the  state  standards  for  any  particular  subject  area,  it  is  easy  for  educators  to  plan  interesting  instruction  around  that  standard,  using  a  balanced approach that includes a variety of  technological activities.   Unfortunately, teachers may frequently fall  back to the traditional ways of figuring out  how well students have learned. However,  it makes much more sense to have ongoing  assessment—the way evaluators do that is  known as “formative evaluation.” All this means is that we don’t wait until the  “unit” is over to determine how well the students and we as educators are doing!  Harry Tuttle, an experienced educator, has spent considerable energy considering  ways to look at using technology to authentically evaluate student progress, as he  explains in the Web 2.0 Wisdom sidebar, Authentic Assessments.  Can assessment  be authentic and  simultaneously prepare  students to succeed in  the standardized testing  that they will face?  Absolutely!  168  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH8.indd   168  3 2 09   3:07:21 PM   systemic issues  C h a p t e r   8  web 2.0 wisdom  authentic assessments Made possible by Web 2.0 Harry Tuttle  Many teachers have tried to use the Web in the past for authentic  assessment but the quality of sound, of video, and of transmission speed  often made such attempts very awkward. In addition, they were limited  in their concepts of how they could use the Web. As a Spanish teacher,  I had a Spaniard try to assess my students’ speaking, but it was hard for  her to hear my students and for us to hear her; therefore, that assessment  did not work. However, today with Web 2.0, a Spanish teacher can  have Spanish-speakers easily assess students’ progress in conducting  conversations about daily life topics; the Spanish-speakers can hear and  reply clearly. The following list represents a sampling of the ways teachers  can do authentic assessment with the dynamically different Web 2.0.  E  English students can listen to a podcast, answer questions   about the podcast, and write about a topic using the  information from the podcast just as they would on a state  English exam. Furthermore, they can have students who have  listened to the same podcast but who are in distant locations  peer-edit their work in a shared online space. The teacher  can assess that writing using the state writing rubric.  E  Art students can prepare art projects using a certain artist’s style   and then, through videoconferencing, have that artist critique  their work in real time. The artist can see all the subtle details  because of the high quality of Web 2.0.  E  Social studies students who work in small groups can create their   own social bookmarks that not only identify critical Web sites  about a topic but also demonstrate their deep understanding of  the topic through their tags; teachers can use the bookmarking as  authentic assessment during the process.  E E E  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  169  NEWTOO CH8.indd   169  3 2 09   3:07:22 PM   C h a p t e r   8  systemic issues  E E  E  Elementary math students can record the clothing that people   wear in a different country with real time Web 2.0 Webcam  and then analyze the country’s culture through a graph of the  clothing; the teacher then determines how well the students go  from the lower level thinking skill of counting to the higher level  thinking skill of analysis.  E  Middle-school science students can add to a class wiki about   stream life; the teacher can assess the students’ unique  contributions about the part of the stream that they analyzed  and the students’ ability to synthesize the information about the  diverse elements of the stream ecosystem.  E  Students in a school within a school can put all of their e-portfolio   materials online so that distant reviewers can quickly download  the e-portfolio files and assess their standards-based skills  development.  E  Middle- and high-school students can have regular interviews   with people who have a career that they are interested in. Career  people can take students on a virtual “walk-through” of their daily  work life. These people can assess the students’ knowledge and  attitude about the careers based on the students’ questions and  comments.  E  Students can engage in multinational conversations about   school life to demonstrate their ability to communicate to diverse  audiences through verbal and visual modes as their teachers  assess those skills in authentic real-time situations.  If educators work together to plan their instruction and simultaneously plan ways  to  evaluate  throughout  the  unit,  they  will  develop  a  wide  variety  of  interesting  models. And using Web 2.0 tools the educators might also devise an interesting,  authentic, and appropriate summative evaluation for the unit. After all, if you are  integrating new tools, you do not want to assess these outcomes with old models— or to put it another way, you don’t want to put new wine in old bottles.   170  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH8.indd   170  3 2 09   3:07:22 PM   systemic issues  C h a p t e r   8  This new type of assessment model is perfect for a group activity, in which teams  are free to consider all possibilities. Students can blog their questions, add to a  subject matter wiki, or create a phased podcast of what they are learning and what  questions they are struggling with. If they see the rubric for the unit prior to the  unit’s start, they will understand the outcomes the school is expecting.  Helen  Barrett  has  led  educators  in  using  electronic  portfolios  and  has  now  developed the next stage of these tools. She talks about e-portfolios and Web 2.0 in  the following Web 2.0 Wisdom sidebar.  web 2.0 wisdom  authentic assessment with electronic portfolios  Using Common Software and Web 2.0 tools  Helen Barrett  an electronic portfolio provides an environment where students  can collect their work in a digital archive; select specific pieces of work   hyperlink to artifacts  to highlight specific achievements; reflect on  the learning demonstrated in the portfolio, in either text or multimedia  form; set goals for future learning  or direction  to improve; and celebrate  achievement through sharing this work with an audience, whether online  or face-to-face. When used in formative, classroom-based assessment,  teachers  and peers  can review the portfolio document and provide  formative feedback to students on where they could improve.  how does the Web 2.0 metaphor apply to electronic portfolios?  Web 1.0 is represented by portfolios created as traditional static Web  pages that are updated rarely, if at all; Web 2.0 is represented by server- side software that is more interactive and more like desktop applications.  Web 2.0 is sometimes called the “Participatory Web” based on its  architecture, which is designed for interaction.  When educators think of portfolios in education, they assume the  purpose is for assessment. But I always ask, “What kind of assessment?”  As I have discussed in other work, there are several approaches to   E E E  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  171  NEWTOO CH8.indd   171  3 2 09   3:07:23 PM   C h a p t e r   8  systemic issues  E E  assessment, and thus to portfolios. Table 8.1 presents my comparison  of electronic portfolios used as assessment of  learning with those that  support assessment for learning, based on work done in Britain by the  Assessment Reform Group  see www.arg.educ.cam.ac.uk . This table has  been published in previous work.   table 8.1 Comparison of Electronic Portfolios by Type of Assessment   portfolios used for assessment   of Learning  portfolios used for assessment   for Learning  The purpose of the portfolio is  prescribed by the institution.  The purpose of the portfolio is agreed  upon with the learner.  Artifacts are mandated by the  institution to determine the outcomes  of instruction.  Artifacts are selected by the learner to  tell the story of their learning.  The portfolio is usually developed at the  end of a class, term, or program  time  limited .  The portfolio is maintained on an  ongoing basis—throughout the class,  term, or program  time flexible .  The portfolio and or artifacts are  usually “scored” based on a rubric,  and quantitative data are collected for  external audiences.  The portfolio and artifacts are reviewed  with learner and used to provide  feedback to improve learning.  The portfolio is usually structured  around a set of outcomes, goals, or  standards.  The organization of the portfolio is  determined by the learner or negotiated  with a mentor advisor teacher.  Portfolios are sometimes used to make  high-stakes decisions  Portfolios are rarely used for high-stakes  decisions.  Portfolios are summative—what has  been learned to date  past to present ?  Portfolios are formative—what are the  learning needs in the future  present to  future ?  The process requires extrinsic  motivation.  The process fosters intrinsic motivation  and engages the learner.  The audience is external; there is little  choice.  The audience can be the learner, family,  or friends; the learner can choose.

Other terms might be “blog-folios” or “wiki-folios” or  perhaps “iPortfolios”  i=interactive . Table 8.2 offers a comparison of early  electronic portfolios and Web 2.0 portfolios.

Just as  the Web changed with the implementation of the architecture of  interaction, we could say that portfolios have the potential to change  with the pedagogy of interaction, especially as used within a paradigm  of assessment for learning. With these new tools, we can post work and  invite feedback, as in a blog; we can post work and invite co-authors,  as in a wiki. Fortunately, wiki tools keep track of the changes, so that  authorship can be tracked, if that is important for accountability. As I  wrote for an article submitted to the Connected Newsletter  2006 :  E E E  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  173  NEWTOO CH8.indd   173  3 2 09   3:07:25 PM   C h a p t e r   8  systemic issues  E E  The use of technology can be a motivating factor for portfolios,  especially if we can make the process engaging for the learners,  and give them an opportunity to express their own voice and  leave their own mark in their portfolios. As schools implement  electronic portfolios, it will be important to do more than  replicate their paper-based predecessors or adopt a database- type portfolio system that only allows students to fill in blanks  on a Web-based form. Where is the individuality, creativity, and  ownership? To truly engage learners, I encourage schools to  incorporate emerging Web 2.0–type technologies that motivate  and engage adolescent students, including digital storytelling,  multimedia artifacts, podcasting and blogging  maintaining a  reflective online journal .  We have seen how much students are motivated to use online social- networking sites, such as MySpace and FaceBook. The TaskStream  electronic portfolio has been described by students participating in the  REFLECT Initiative as an “academic MySpace.” If only we could capture  that level of motivation while furthering the goals of deep learning in  formative electronic learning portfolios, then we may realize the real  promise of using technology to both improve and showcase student  achievement.  references  Assessment Reform Group.  2002 .

Helen Barrett is a research associate with the University of Oregon’s   Center for Advanced Technology in Education  CATE .   Another new tool to assist in assessment goes beyond what we typically think of as  an e-portfolio. Elgg is a new breed of social software that is “based around choice,  flexibility  and  openness:  a  system  that  places  individuals  at  the  centre  of  their  activities” according to the Elgg Web site  www.elgg.org . U.K.-based David Tosh  and Ben Werdmuller developed this program in 2004 to counter what they saw as  top-down e-portfolio systems in which institutions rather than students designed  and drove how the systems looked.   In an interview, Tosh  2006  said that this tool was designed to promote reflective  thinking, to allow users to select artifacts important to them, to promote social  connections, and to focus on the process of learning rather than the end products.  He explains:   Elgg  is  truly  a  learner  centric  environment;  it  allows  learners  to  make certain choices about their own learning landscape. It is also  not designed to be an all-in-one box; it’s more an ethos of choice. We  have a standard tool set but the goal is to build a framework that lets  learners plug in their own tools and widgets.  n.p.   Several  universities  and  a  few  K–12  schools  have  adopted  this  tool  and  we  can  expect to see more about it in the future.  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  175  NEWTOO CH8.indd   175  3 2 09   3:07:27 PM   C h a p t e r   8  systemic issues  into the future  The topics covered in this chapter are not in any way unique to the Web 2.0 world— in fact, they are areas of consideration throughout the educational community.  However, there are some aspects of these topics that Web 2.0 tools may have the  potential to improve. These tools may allow us to see these topics in new ways, or  may even raise our awareness of their complexity.  176  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH8.indd   176  3 2 09   3:07:27 PM   E E    9  new schools  E verything changes fast in this Web 2.0   world.

The  real  issue  is  what  we  should  do  with  these  technologies for the future of teaching and  learning. What should we expect from new  schools?

But  it does mean going faster, less step-by step, more in parallel, with more random  access, among other things”  p. 4 .  It also means using the same tools in classrooms that students use at home. The  ultimate goal will be for schools to put all the pieces together and use new tools  to create new models of technology-infused teaching and learning. Our vision of  a new school is one in which the educators can adapt and change, model and use  tools, and understand how students learn and what tools—both technological and  pedagogical—will foster learning.  As the world, the students, and the technologies continue to change, what is on  the horizon and beyond? This chapter presents ideas and strategies that can make  a difference in the future. However, none of them is certain to happen. In a Web  2.0 world, predicting the future is risky. Some of these ideas seem possible; some  merely  hopeful.  Some  ideas  are  ours;  many  are  from  colleagues.  Speaking  of  the collaborative and collegial nature of Web 2.0, we invite you to contribute to a  second book we are developing on promising practice. We talk more about that at  the end of this chapter.  harnessing the collective intelligence  of education data  If Amazon and eBay can do it, why can’t an education company create intelligent  Web-based software that provides immediate feedback to students and recommends  other  lessons,  sites,  and  resources  that  they  might  use,  perhaps  based  on  what  has  helped  other  students  to  learn?  It  could  look  at  a  student’s  learning  style  and  suggest  sites  accordingly,  whether  simulations,  games,  readings,  drills,  or  whatever has worked for that student and others.  If a student did well with project-based learning, for example, the software would  provide suggestions for research  maybe an intelligent WebQuest  based on that  student’s  preferences.  These  preferences  would  come  from  analyzing  the  data  rather  than  asking  the  student  or  overburdened  teachers  what  works.  Teachers  would  become  true  guides,  like  information  gurus  at  a  help  desk,  to  lend  a   178  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH9.indd   178  3 2 09   3:08:05 PM   new schools  C h a p t e r   9  hand to students along the way. These students might not be in front of them in  classrooms but could be virtual learners, selected because their learning styles  match the teacher’s teaching style.  Years  ago,  Apple  Computer  had  an  advertisement  that  displayed  the  idea  of  a  Knowledge Navigator, an electronic personal assistant that helped its user keep  on track in many ways, steering him to just the right information, getting him to  meetings on time, and predicting his needs.  While the technology wasn’t available then, today that vision is closer to reality.  In the not too distant future, an electronic personal education assistant modeled  on this concept could direct students to activities that would work best for them at  that moment. It would harness both cognitive science and collective intelligence.  It  would  know  what  each  student  needs  and  say,  “Other  students  who  had  to  learn  this  topic  found  that  lessons  3,  5,  and  9  helped.  May  I  suggest  that  you  start with lesson 5 and work with Timmy?” Of course, the advice would be based  on awareness of the student’s learning style, interest in the subject, eagerness to  collaborate, and a host of other factors.  the long tail of educational materials  Chris Anderson’s 2006 book, The Long Tail, explains that today’s opportunities  for finding exactly the right book, piece of music, video, or other object are possible  because of the Web’s endless supply. Everything anyone could want is someplace  online. This simple fact is the basis of an economic distribution model called “The  Long Tail,” in which companies that offer limitless products will thrive because  the sum of all niche market purchases can equal the blockbusters.  Anderson  says,  “The  story  of  the  long  tail  is  really  about  the  economics  of  abundance, what happens when the bottlenecks that stand between supply and  demand  in  our  culture  start  to  disappear  and  everything  becomes  available  to  everyone”  p. 12 .  While the theory is about sales, it is also about choice and the potential to address  individual interests and needs. We can apply this theory to educational materials  and  to  student  learning.  If,  for  example,  an  infinite  selection  of  products  were  available so that teachers could choose anything that has been published instead  of just the approved textbooks, they could pinpoint precisely the right learning  materials for each student. In addition, if students could choose the resources on   web 2.0     new tools, new schools  179  NEWTOO CH9.indd   179  3 2 09   3:08:06 PM   C h a p t e r   9  new schools  school topics that engage them, be it simulations, games, tutorials, or some other  strategy, they could learn what the standards proscribe but how they wish.  Perhaps at some point in the future, students and teachers will make the decisions  and choose from among a seemingly endless supply of online content and tools  that  address  their  needs  instead  of  having  information  delivered  and  methods  mandated that someone else has decided would work.  the vision and the reality  In A Day in the Life of Web 2.0, David Warlick  2006c  offers his vision of a middle  school. In it, teachers keep regular blogs, where they write about everything from  homework  assignments  to  reflections  on  course  topics,  with  a  full  description  posted each Monday morning of course material to be taught in the upcoming  week. Many of them have a wiki site that serves as the class textbook, and students  construct their own study resources using their team wikis. All significant class  presentations and discussions are recorded and posted in a podcast that students,  parents, community members, and other educators can subscribe to.  The school librarian subscribes to all of the teachers’ Monday report blogs and  uses a shared spreadsheet to maintain an ongoing curriculum map of what’s being  taught in the school as a way to support the teachers. The principal maintains  an online school calendar with a weekly blog entry that describes happenings at  the school for the next seven days. The district superintendent subscribes to the  principal’s blog and teachers’ Monday report blogs. He uses a wiki site to develop  a  district  improvement  plan  in  collaboration  with  educators  and  community  members.  See appendix C for Warlick’s full article.   In response, David Jakes  2006b  paints a picture of the reality in a techLEARNING  blog titled Gap Analysis. He says:  Most schools continue to educate kids in the way they always have,  most teachers continue to teach in the ways they always have, and  most administrators remain in their offices focusing on the things  they focus on. There is a gap between what is and what should be.   n.p.   Unless we can close that gap, “while a few will accomplish so much, many will  accomplish  little,  and  the  window  for  imagination  and  boldness  will  be  lost,  perhaps forever.”  n.p.   180  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH9.indd   180  3 2 09   3:08:06 PM   new schools  C h a p t e r   9  The hope is that professional development will fill that gap for current teachers  and that new teachers will enter the profession armed with the technology skills  they’ll need to help students learn in new ways.  polls and surveys  A  series  of  polls  conducted  on  techLEARNING.com  attempted  to  capture  what  educators who are using technology think will happen in the future. In each case,  there was a brief explanation of the issue, a series of choices, and the opportunity  to comment.  The  question  during  the  week  of  October  3–9,  2006,  asked  readers  what  they  believe about the future of the Internet. They agreed that by 2020 a low-cost global  network  will  be  thriving  and  creating  new  opportunities  in  a  flattening  world.  They also agreed that people will wittingly and unwittingly disclose more about  themselves, gaining some benefits in the process even as they lose some privacy.  The  following  week,  the  question  asked  about  schooling  in  the  future.  Twenty  percent  of  respondents  agreed  that  schools  as  physical  locations  will  become  much less important as technology enables connected communities of learners  located  in  many  places.  Another  20%  agreed  that  students  would  be  grouped  by  achievement  level,  not  age,  as  technology  allows  for  very  granular  tracking  of what students know. And 43% agreed that students increasingly would work  collaboratively  on  significant  projects,  with  each  student’s  individual  learning  goals and achievement tracked by monitoring software.  Are they right? Only time will tell.  What  else  should  change?  Some  specifics  include  software,  textbooks,  and  applications, to name a few. The following discussion covers these topics.  software  Mechelle  DeCraene   2006   in  a  techLEARNING  blog  suggests  that  school  districts’ software selection process could use improvement. She says, “Given an  ideal situation we’d all opt for open-source, but the reality is that someone has to  pay”  n.p. . So she asks:  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  181  NEWTOO CH9.indd   181  3 2 09   3:08:07 PM   C h a p t e r   9  new schools  What  if  teachers  could  choose  software  themselves  that  is  tailored  to their students’ developmental needs? What if there was a global  central  hub  via  the  Web  for  educational  software  and  a  software  smorgasbord of sorts that every teacher could pick and choose from?  And  what  if  the  schools  only  paid  for  the  software  that  teachers  actually use? It would be similar to paying for the cell phone minutes  that one uses. Perhaps, a subscription based on usage?  There is no one-size-fits-all software. Unfortunately, I can’t tell you  how many times I’ve walked in the ol’ book closet and seen brand  new software sitting sealed in its packages. Other times, it’s installed  but never used. When asked about it, teachers often say, “it just wasn’t  right for my kids.”  n.p.   textbooks  Wikis make collaborative writing possible, and David Warlick  2006e  has come up  with an idea for textbooks that uses wiki technology. An advantage to students is  that backpacks would shrink and students would stand a little straighter. Warlick  asks:  What if teachers and preservice education students started writing  little chunks of content, worthy of their textbooks?  What  if  a  file-sharing  network  emerged  where  teachers  could  search,  access,  and  download  snippets  of  content  from  each  other—world-wide?  What  if  teachers  started  assembling  this  shared  content  into  their  Moodle  sites,  or  someone  writes  an  open-source  application  specifically designed to become the next-gen digital textbook?  What  if  we  could  stop  buying  textbooks,  and  use  the  money  to  provide every teacher and learner with access to the world of digital  networked content?  Our  homework  assignments  would  change  just  a  bit  from … Ya’ll  read  the  chapter  and  answer  the  questions  at  the  end!  to …   Ya’ll read the chapter and then validate it by Friday!  n.p.   182  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH9.indd   182  3 2 09   3:08:08 PM   new schools  C h a p t e r   9  moving applications and data online  Terry Whitmell, a secondary school vice principal, argues that it is time to provide  24 7 access. She says:  Investing in software that can be used only on school computers is  like  purchasing  textbooks  and  then  forcing  students  to  leave  them  in  their  desks  at  the  end  of  the  day.  Requiring  that  student  data  remain behind firewalls on school or district servers locks those same  students’ “notes” in their desks when they head home.  It is time to move our classroom applications and data online. Many  districts have licensed applications and utilities that are available to  staff and students only when they are working in school, not at home.  This restricts the flexibility of students to complete work outside of  school hours and puts additional stress on school hardware resources.   Whitmell & Killingsworth, 2006, p. 8   open-source educational  applications  Bob  Tinker   2006 ,  president  of  the  Concord  Consortium,  believes  that  we  can  change the paradigm used for software development to open source. He says:  Educators and programmers worldwide could create a shared collection  of  educational  applications  based  on  cutting-edge  open-source  educational software that could help realize the potential of technology  to  transform  education.  A  body  of  educational  applications  that  are  all free, open source, and maintained by a collaborating community,  could result in an exciting new generation of computer-based learning  activities that are well designed, robust, and highly effective.  To  be  practical,  these  applications  need  to  be  embedded  in  an  educational platform that can deliver complete learning activities online  and then assess student progress as they work through these activities.  Teachers and educators should be able to customize the activities and  assessments, so that they can tailor the learning strategies to the needs  and interests of their students.

A better option is to make them open  source and trust that their utility will support a broad community of  users that will provide ongoing support and development.  n.p.   web 2.0 wisdom  Creators in the Classroom Jeff Utecht  If we thInk about how our current students spent their early years,  we see a generation that is accustomed to information coming at them at  a fast pace, multitasking as the norm, and a reliance on images to convey  concepts. Their world always had cell phones, hand-held games, and the   Web. They use the tools and expect to have an audience. Because of  technology, these youngsters may in fact be wired differently from their  predecessors.  In traditional classrooms, we restrict students to creating pieces of work  only for other students in their own class, or even worse, just for the  teacher. Pieces of work that could have the potential to impact many others  are put out with the trash by year’s end. These are the same students who  go home and plug into sites like MySpace and YouTube: spaces that not  only allow them to create, but to create and share with a wide audience.  If we want to engage students in our classrooms, we must start looking  at the social Web as an educational tool and not something to fear. We,  as teachers, fear this new Web for possible dangers and are wary of the  unknown, but our students live in it. It is their home, their bowling alley,  their corner hangout. These social sites turn our students into creators;  creators who contribute their work not only to the twenty other students in  their classroom, but potentially to the 1 billion plus Internet users on the  Web. If we want to motivate students to create something, something that  will last beyond the lesson and the school year, then we must find ways to  use these social-networking tools in our classroom. If we continue to fight  them, I’m afraid it is a battle we will lose.  Jeff Utecht is an international educator currently working in Shanghai, China.  184  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH9.indd   184  3 2 09   3:08:09 PM   new schools  C h a p t e r   9  web 2.0 wisdom  Learning from Games David Warlick  we are fInally begInnIng to pay serious attention to video  games for learning. It is crucial, though, that we resist the temptation  to look only at the game, and instead, study the experience, which is  what students learn from, rather than the graphics and sound. I want to  suggest five elements of the video game experience that makes it both  compelling and instructionally potent.  responsiveness. Video games, IM, social networks, and SMS are far more  responsive to youngsters’ input than anything from my childhood. These  responsive information landscapes, where children play, are intensely  instructional. They are learning engines.  Convert-able and convers-able rewards. We reward student work and  successful learning with grades, which hold value mostly to their parents,  teachers, and the government. In video games, students work to increase  their level, which they value for two reasons. One is that it gives them  something to talk and brag about. They share strategies and short cuts  that they discovered or invented and discuss alternatives. Second, the  level influences the experience. When a student moves to a new level, the  game environment frequently changes dramatically.  personal investment. One of the early lessons learned by video game  developers was that players will return to a game that they have invested  in. Many of today’s games require players to generate currency. It might  be health points, extra powers, or an inventory of tools or weapons. It may  also be currency, money that can be traded for goods and services within  the play of the game. Students must invest time, skill, and learning into  the game to increase their level. When we have invested ourselves, we  come back.  Identity building. One of the interesting aspects of many new video games  is players’ ability to customize their presence. One example is 1080, a  snowboarding game that is fairly simple; you play against gravity. Players   E E E  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  185  NEWTOO CH9.indd   185  3 2 09   3:08:10 PM   C h a p t e r   9  new schools  E E  can choose their boards, board decorations, clothing, name, and other  aspects. In car racing games, players can customize their vehicles. There  is a compelling sense of personalization in the players’ experience.  Dependability. There is a sense in most video games that the answer to the  question or solution to the problem is always there. It is simply a matter  of finding or reasoning through the answer or solution. A classroom  should work the same way, with a ubiquitous sense that the answer is  always close by; that it merely means turning over the right stone, and  finding that stone is a matter of logic and prior knowledge.  David Warlick is director of the Landmark Project, a Web development,  consulting, and innovations firm in Raleigh, North Carolina.  professional development  For two weeks in fall 2006, a group of educators convened a K–12 online conference  with  the  theme  of  “Unleashing  the  Potential”   http:  k12onlineconference. org ?p=26 ,  for  teachers,  administrators,  and  educators  around  the  world  interested  in  the  use  of  Web  2.0  tools  in  classrooms  and  professional  practice.  The presentations were on practical, pedagogical uses of online social tools in the  classroom;  advanced  training  for  teachers  who  have  already  started  using  Web  2.0  tools  in  their  classes;  tips,  ideas,  and  resources  on  how  to  orchestrate  your  own  professional  development  online  and  on  how  to  overcome  obstacles.  This  conference  may  well  be  the  model  for  professional  development  in  the  future  with all events taking place online, peers helping peers, and sessions available on  demand for the foreseeable future.  toward a smart future  For any of these things to happen, there has to be a commitment to education,  broadband and computer access, and policies to make sure that students are able  to compete in the global market.   186  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH9.indd   186  3 2 09   3:08:11 PM   new schools  C h a p t e r   9  Broadband access in the U.S. The  U.S.  Congress  passed  the  Communications  Act  of  1934  to  ensure  that  all  Americans could have access to telephone service. They deemed telephone service  an  essential  in  American  life  and  initiated  the  Universal  Service  Fund,  which  was supported by fees to those who paid for telephone service. Today, access to  high-speed  Internet  is  as  much  of  an  essential  in  all  aspects  of  life.  However,  findings from a 2006 study say “America’s digital divide—between rich and poor  and urban and rural areas—shows no sign of closing”  Turner, 2006, n.p. . Thus  the need exists to expand universal service to provide poor and rural areas with  broadband. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 expanded the concept with the  E-Rate program, which provided networking capabilities for schools and libraries.  Homes in the U.S. remain in the digital divide.  Former FCC Chairman William Kennard  2007  says:  Studies  by  the  federal  government  conclude  that  our  rural  and  low-income  areas  trail  urban  and  high-income  areas  in  the  rate  of  broadband  use.  Indeed,  this  year  the  Government  Accountability  Office found that 42 percent of households have either no computer  or a computer with no Internet connection.  n.p.   Kennard  2007  believes that Congress should reform the Universal Service Fund  and find a new source of revenue besides taxes on telephone service and “put all  broadband providers on a level playing field”  n.p. .  Net Neutrality Network Neutrality emerges as a political issue every once in a while. It is really  about  competition,  Internet  transmission  speed,  and  freedom  of  speech.  The  large  networks   cable  and  telecom  companies   claim  that  Web  sites  should  pay  for content to be transmitted on the networks. Those who pay would have their  content  transmitted  faster  than  those  who  don’t.  Private  individuals   who  are  paying for cable and telecom  claim that it would create a two-tiered Internet with  large  companies  such  as  Amazon  and  eBay  able  to  pay  for  fast  transmissions  and mom-and-pop companies and personal sites stuck at lower speeds. Speed is  everything today; no one wants to wait more than an instant for sites to refresh  and content to download. Some believe that if the networks control the flow of  content, democracy will suffer and so “policies must maintain Net Neutrality or  ‘non-discriminatory, open-access principles’”  Turner, 2006, n.p. .  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  187  NEWTOO CH9.indd   187  3 2 09   3:08:11 PM   C h a p t e r   9  new schools  Classrooms The reality for experienced teachers is that they have too much to do and are busy  with all of the regular tasks of teaching. Their comfort level with technology is  low and they want to be facile before letting students use it. Then there is always  the  issue  of  time.  There  is  never  enough  of  it  and  it  takes  longer  to  figure  out  integration strategies than to use tried and true methods.  The reality for new teachers is that while they have used these tools themselves,  they must learn how to teach plus use integration strategies. Then there is access.  Most teachers have to sign up for labs and mobile carts, and the dates they get may  not dovetail with their plans.  For all, the reality is that each crop of students will be more adept at using the  tools for their own purposes. So teachers continue to feel that they are behind the  curve. There’s always something new on the horizon. How does anyone keep up?  brainstorming about schools   and web 2.0  As we think about what schools might really be like in five years, it is important  to keep all options on the table and our eyes firmly on the goals we set for our  schools and communities. One organization, School 2.0  www.school2-0.org , has  developed a brainstorming tool to help individuals and groups do just that. The  School 2.0  2006  Web site states:  The name School 2.0 was chosen to encourage a discussion about  the “next generation of school” that can be supported by an integrated  technology infrastructure. We believe that schools must transform  in  order  to  meet  the  multiple  challenges  of  the  21st  century:  accountability, student engagement and achievement, and economic  competitiveness. By encouraging a discussion of community-based  “next generation” schools, we hope communities will be inspired to  think creatively about teaching, learning, and management and then  explore ways that technology can help meet those goals.  n.p.

When  you  subscribe  to  a  feed,  Google  Reader   www. google.com reader   starts monitoring that feed for updates. You don’t have to give  any personal information, it doesn’t cost a dime, and it’s easy to unsubscribe.  Here’s how it works:  1  The left side of the screen displays your subscriptions. Each subscription  has a count of all unread posts, which indicates how many new items are  available to read. Clicking on a subscription shows you items from that  subscription.  2  The “All items” link shows you items from all of your subscriptions. You  can choose to auto-sort this list so that feeds with few posts  for example a  friend’s blog  rise above feeds that post more frequently. This allows you to  catch those posts that might otherwise fall into the background because of  other high-volume subscriptions.  3  The right side of the screen displays your items. You can choose to display  your items in list view or expanded view. The compact list view allows you  to quickly skim the latest headlines, while the expanded view displays the  full content of the items.  210  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO CH10.indd   210  3 2 09   2:36:29 PM   tutorials  C h a p t e r   10  4  By default Google Reader displays all items, but you may prefer to show  only new items—that way, things you’ve already read don’t keep you from  finding new content.  Managing your information:  1  Click the gray arrow button to view the original source for an item. This   is particularly useful if a feed only includes snippets or links.  2  Just like in Gmail  Google e-mail , you can star your items by clicking the  star. The star can be useful for many things, like indicating an item you  want to read later or marking your favorite posts.  Clicking the Share button adds the item to your public page. Your public page is  an easy way to share items of interest with your friends and family.   The E-mail button allows you to e-mail the item to a specific person  this requires  a Gmail account .  3  In list view, items are marked as read when you click on them.

Tim  Berners Lee and Robert Cailliau persuaded CERN to provide the Web technology  and program code for free so that anyone could use and improve it. The decision  is credited as one of the key reasons the Web grew so quickly.  The Tech, published by students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,  became the first online newspaper.  Hypertext markup language  HTML , used to create Web pages, was released.  The Webcam went online. It was set up by a group of computer scientists at  Cambridge University to watch a coffee pot.  The precursor to Yahoo, started by two Stanford University students, went  online. Called Jerry’s Guide to the World Wide Web, it was originally described as   a site featuring a hierarchical directory of other sites.  President Bill Clinton put whitehouse.gov on the Web.

This site emphasizes the social aspect of bookmarking,  allowing users to locate like-minded people by virtue of their tags and even create  a Watchlist to see what interesting sites they have bookmarked. It also constantly  checks for broken links and compiles a list.  Spurl  www.spurl.net . Spurl-ing a Web page does more than save its URL. It also  saves a copy of that page.

This site performs automatic backups and file sharing  with levels of access controlled by the user. Users decide who is invited and who  can view, edit, and upload designated folders stored in the Xdrive.

The site’s slogan is “Movie Making For All Of Us,”  and it adheres to that slogan by providing easy-to-use editing tools for producing  sophisticated  finished  products.  The  site  advocates  sharing  by  posting  finished  films to blogs, and allows users to view such posted films.  Grouper  www.grouper.com . Setting this site apart from the others is its acceptance  of  video  from  Webcams,  which  are  much  less  expensive  than  digital  cameras.  However, it is more focused on letting users view videos and offers fewer slick  editing features.  JumpCut  www.jumpcut.com . More than just a place to upload videos, JumpCut  actually helps users to create video and even to “borrow” parts of public videos for  their finished product, which may then be shared with the world or made private  with  restricted  access.  The  site  encourages  budding  directors  to  write  stories  explaining their digital creations.  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  223  NEWTOO AppB.indd   223  3 2 09   2:30:25 PM   A p p E n D i x   B  web 2.0 tools  VideoEgg  www.videoegg.com .

It enables users to import and edit  existing documents and spreadsheets or to create new ones from scratch. Users  can share changes in real time or invite others to make changes together at the  same time.  Writeboard   http:  writeboard.com .

An  eighth-grade  science  teacher,  Ms.  S,  retrieves  her  MP3  player  from  the  computer-connected cradle where it’s spent the night scanning the 17 podcasts she  subscribes to. Having detected three new programs, the computer downloaded the  files and copied them to the handheld. En route to work, Ms. S inserts the device  into her dash-mounted cradle and reviews the podcasts. She selects a colleague’s  classroom presentation on global warming and a NASA conference lecture about  interstellar space travel.  As with all the teachers at her middle school, Ms. S keeps a regular blog, where  she writes about everything from homework assignments to reflections on course  topics, with a full description posted each Monday morning on the how, what, and  why of course material to be taught in the upcoming week.  The  teachers’  blogs  are  all  syndicated  using  RSS—Rich  Site  Summary,  or  the  more  informal  and  descriptive  Really  Simple  Syndication.  With  aggregation  software, students, parents, administrators, and other teachers can subscribe and  have  the  freshly  written  blog  entries  immediately  and  automatically  delivered  to  their  desktops.  Professional  development,  communication,  cross-curricular  lesson planning, and articulation among grade levels are all served as educators   web 2.0     new tools, new schools  231  NEWTOO AppC.indd   231  3 2 09   2:31:31 PM   A p p e n d i x   C  a day in the life of web 2.0  regularly read each other’s blogs and learn about topics and activities taking place  in the various classrooms.  The  Monday  reports  in  particular  enable  them  to  benefit  by  sharing  strategies  and  materials  with  colleagues  who  teach  the  same  subject  or  those  in  other  departments. For instance, Mr. K, a health and P.E. teacher, frequently finds ways  of integrating science issues covered in Ms. S’s classroom with his health topics.  He knows that Ms. S will focus on genetics this week, and he will be teaching about  disease next week, so he arranges for them to meet and discuss a combination  assignment. In preparation for the meeting, Mr. K conducts a Web search to find  the most informative sites and adds the Center for Disease Control  CDC  to his  social bookmarks.  Meanwhile, social studies teacher Ms. L scans through sites tagged genetics in the  school’s social bookmark service. Her students may need quick access to them  as  they  discuss  genetic  engineering  current  events  during  class.  Mr.  K’s  CDC  site appears along with other genetics sites that have been saved and tagged. All  assignments in Ms. L’s class are turned in as blog entries, because she finds that  their conversational nature encourages students to think and write in more depth  than traditional formal essays or short answer assignments. Another advantage  of  receiving  assignments  in  blog  format  is  that  both  she  and  her  students  can  subscribe,  which  means  all  of  the  kids’  blogs  appear  in  her  aggregator,  and  students can reap the benefits of seeing each other’s work.  Ms. L crafts the blog assignments with an eye toward training students to think  critically and to post informed, well-considered opinions. A common classroom  activity, for instance, is to have students read the blogged entries of others and  write  persuasive  reactions—one  in  agreement,  another  in  disagreement— and  post  these  writings  as  comments  to  their  classmates’  blogs.  Initially,  the  students  struggled  with  the  task,  but  they  eventually  learned  the  goal  was  not  necessarily  to  find  an  idea  with  which  they  personally  disagreed  but  to  find  another  side  to  an  idea  and  write  persuasively  from  that  perspective.  For  the  genetics  assignment,  students  assume  a  range  of  positions—some  that  discourage work in genetic manipulation based on security, cost, and ethics, and   others that support it based on the potential cure for disease, life extension, and  increased food production. In response to these blogged assignments, Ms. L posts  assessments in the form of comments.  A few doors down the hall, veteran English teacher Mr. P is reviewing a new batch  of student wikis. In an effort to help the students become better communicators,  he never provides study guides for tests, instead relying on students to construct   232  web 2.0     new tools, new schools  NEWTOO AppC.indd   232  3 2 09   2:31:32 PM   a day in the life of web 2.0  A p p e n d i x   C  their own study resources using their team wikis. He rewards teams that create  the most useful study guides.  Mr. P uses a wiki tool installed on the school’s network. He devotes one part of the  wiki site to general information and resources that he and the most accomplished  students  can  edit.  This  part  of  the  site  serves  as  the  class  textbook.  He  also  maintains other parts of the site for class teams, usually four students per team.  These sections have their own passwords, and team members can log in to their  wikis and enter text, images, and links to audio and video files. Teams can also  format their content in a variety of ways. Mr. P is able to track the number of unique  views for each page so that he can measure and reward teams for producing the  most useful communications.  Earlier in the day, Student A had left Mr. P’s room in a jubilant mood, because  she’d  just  learned  that  her  team  produced  the  most  useful  study  guide  for  the  previous day’s test, which earned them 10 points toward level three in the class.  Level  three  will  give  the  team  much  more  editing  access  to  the  class  wiki  and  more  opportunities  to  contribute  to  the  class  literary  Web  site  and  the  literary  book the students will publish at the end of the school year.  Mr.  P  begins  adjusting  the  volume  on  the  microphone  that  hangs  from  his  classroom  ceiling.  Today’s  discussion  about  The  Grapes  of  Wrath  will  be  recorded and posted in an audio file as a class podcast, as are all significant class  presentations and discussions. Students, parents, community members, and other  educators subscribe to his podcast programs. In fact, on the other side of town,  Mrs. B, the parent of one of Mr. P’s students, is listening to a podcast classroom  conversation  about  a  science  fiction  short  story  the  students  recently  read.  She  and other parents subscribe to the podcasts so they can more easily engage their  children in conversations about school.  At  about  the  same  time  Mrs.  B  is  listening  to  the  lively  classroom  discussion,  her son, Student B, is keying a text message from his school desk to his social  studies class team. He briefly describes an idea for putting together a video as  part of their current class project on rural cultures. The video idea had occurred  to him a few days earlier while he and his mother were talking about one of the  lesson recordings she’d listened to. Student C happens to be in study hall when  she  receives  Student  B’s  message  and  is  excited  about  using  a  video  in  their  presentation. She immediately accesses the school’s social bookmarks, looking for  sites that have been submitted by their science teacher, Ms. S, tagged with soil and  plantgrowth. She identifies two sites, one from the Discovery Channel and the   web 2.0     new tools, new schools  233  NEWTOO AppC.indd   233  3 2 09   2:31:33 PM   A p p e n d i x   C  a day in the life of web 2.0  other from the USDA, called Ask a Worm. The idea is to create a video animation  illustrating how soil quality affects cultures.  As  Student  C  tags  the  sites  for  her  team,  school  librarian  Ms.  J  is  conducting  research  on  behalf  of  a  new  math  teacher.  She  and  the  school  tech  facilitator  both  subscribe  to  all  of  the  teachers’  Monday  report  blogs.  They  use  a  shared  spreadsheet to maintain an ongoing curriculum map of what’s being taught in  the  school,  based  on  the  weekly  updates.  The  librarian  and  tech  facilitator  use  the map to support teachers by finding and identifying resources and strategies  related to what they are teaching. Ms. J is using a blogging search engine to find  some serious Web logs about mathematics so that the new teacher can include  more  practical  applications  in  her  current  unit  on  real-world  math.  She  finds  several blogs: Galileo’s Dilemma  math, physics, and chemistry , Dr. Katte’s Blog   engineering , and BizImpresario  entrepreneurship . The librarian then adds the  three blogs to the school’s social bookmarks and tags them for the meeting that  she has just noted on the school’s collaborative social calendar.  Meanwhile, the principal is also looking at the school calendar. She is finishing  up a weekly blog entry that describes happenings at the school for the next seven  days, including two class podcasts, a band concert  also to be podcasted , a guest  speaker, an interesting lesson about ancient civilizations, and the PTO meeting.  The administrator subscribes to and scans all of the teachers’ Monday report blogs  for material to include in her weekly report. She always posts the blog entry by the  end of the day on Monday, which is read not only by parents but also by educators  at other schools, district leaders, and people from other parts of the community  and country.  Early that evening the district superintendent reads the principal’s recently posted  blog. He also subscribes to the teachers’ Monday report blogs, because he finds  that  their  writing  gives  him  a  bank  of  ideas  for  promoting  the  district  and  its  efforts toward continued improvement. After he finishes the reading, he briefly  accesses  the  wiki  site  where  he  and  a  committee  of  educators  and  community  members are collaborating to develop a district improvement plan. He jots down  a couple of ideas that occurred to him while reading the digital conversations that  have come to define the middle school. He moves on to publish the wiki version of  the improvement plan, which invites interested community members to edit the  improvement plan within the wiki and insert their reflections and ideas through  attached comments. This superintendent truly believes that “It takes a village… ”  David Warlick is a blogger, podcaster, author, programmer, and public speaker.

Once upon a time, Web sites were isolated information 'silos'--all content and no functionality. Today, the next generation of Web sites gives power to the end-user, providing visitors with a new level of customization, interaction, and participation. Many Web sites now allow users to upload, categorize, and share content easily. Weblogs and podcasts allow anyone to publish or broadcast on any topic. Wikis provide information that is constantly updated by the end-user. Open-source software is free and customizable. These new technologies are changing our relationship to the Internet.Web 2.0: New Tools, New Schools provides a comprehensive overview of the emerging Web 2.0 technologies and their use in the classroom and in professional development. Topics include blogging as a natural tool for writing instruction, wikis and their role in project collaboration, podcasting as a useful means of presenting information and ideas, and how to use Web 2.0 tools for professional development. Also included are a discussion of Web 2.0 safety and security issues and a look toward the future of the Web 2.0 movement. Web 2.0: New Tools, New Schools is essential reading for teachers, administrators, technology coordinators, and teacher educators
