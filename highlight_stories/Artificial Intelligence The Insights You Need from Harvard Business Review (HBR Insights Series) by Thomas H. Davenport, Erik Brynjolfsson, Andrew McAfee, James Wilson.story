Davenport  The most impor tant general- purpose technology of our era  is artificial intelligence. So Eric Brynjolfsson and Andrew  McAfee describe AI in the first article of this book. But  even as the significance of AI becomes irrefutable, it re- mains misunderstood. Executives view AI as a key dis- ruptive technology, employees fear it as a job destroyer,  con sul tants pitch it as a cure- all, and the media hype and  deride it endlessly.  This book  will help you tune out all this noise and   understand AI’s implications for you and your business. No   matter your industry, level, or the size of your com pany,   xi  054-80639_ch00_4P.indd   11  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Introduction  this collection of some of HBR’s best recent articles on AI   will show you where the technology is  going.  Let’s start with an overview of the state of AI in busi-  ness  today and its near- term implications.  AI  is  undoubtedly  booming  in  business—at  least  in  certain  seg- ments of it.   In my work, I’ve helped design and analyze  surveys suggesting that 25% to 30% of large U.S. com- panies are pursuing AI, many quite aggressively. Some  have hundreds or even thousands of proj ects underway.  The firms using AI most aggressively are large businesses  with the most data— online platforms, financial ser vices,  telecommunications, and retail. Small- to medium- sized  enterprises,  business- to- business  firms,  and   those  in  basic manufacturing industries are less likely to use AI.  They typically lack not only the data to succeed with AI,  but the expertise and awareness to pursue it effectively.  Firms outside the United States are also pursuing AI at  a slower pace, although  there are aggressive adopters in  China, the U.K., Canada, and Singapore.  A  variety  of  dif fer ent  AI  technologies  are  in  use.   You  need  to  be aware of which ones do what. As Emma Martinho-  Truswell  explains  in  her  article,  machine  learning  is  perhaps the most impor tant component of AI, but it has  multiple variations— ordinary statistical machine learn- ing, neural networks, deep learning neural networks,   xii  054-80639_ch00_4P.indd   12  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Introduction  and so on. Versions of AI also use semantic approaches  to understanding language and logic- based rule engines  for making  simple decisions. Each technology performs  a par tic u lar set of tasks; deep learning, for example, excels  at recognizing images and speech.  AI is being applied for vari ous business purposes.   The most com- mon uses enable us to make better decisions, improve op- erational pro cesses, and enhance products and ser vices.  The first two are an extension of business analytics and  typically  employ  machine  learning;  product- oriented  objectives are common in high- tech firms, automobiles,  and advanced manufacturing.  Many large companies are creating infrastructures and pro cesses  to manage AI.   More than a third of large U.S. firms report  in multiple surveys that they have a strategy in place for  AI, have created a center of excellence to facilitate its use,  and  have  identified  its  champions  in  the  management  team. As Vikram Mahidhar and I suggest in our article,  late adopters may have difficulty catching up.  Companies are finding success by focusing their AI efforts in certain  areas of the organ ization.   Given the combination of short-  term  incremental  value  and  long- term  opportunity,  many  companies  are  tempering  expectations  about  AI while still providing motivation to move forward   xiii  054-80639_ch00_4P.indd   13  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Introduction  aggressively with the technology. This is perhaps best  accomplished by undertaking several proj ects focused  in a par tic u lar area rather than spreading AI proj ects  throughout  the  organ ization.  Transforming  customer  ser vice, for example, might include proj ects involving  chatbots, intelligent agents, recommendation engines,  and so forth.  AI   hasn’t  transformed  business— yet.   While  surveys  suggest  high expectations for transformation and high percent- ages  of  respondents  say  they  have  achieved  economic  returns,  there are few examples of sweeping business re- invention thus far, for several reasons:     It’s still early in the life cycle of AI activity.     Not  every com pany has data that’s suited for AI,  as Ajay Agrawal, Joshua Gans, and Avi Goldfarb  explain in their article  although H. James Wilson,  Paul Daugherty, and my son Chase Davenport sug- gest in their article that data requirements for ef- fective AI may lessen in the  future .     Companies are undertaking pi lots with AI rather  than production deployments, as Andrew Ng rec- ommends in his piece.     AI tends to be a narrow technology that supports   par tic u lar tasks, not entire jobs or pro cesses.  xiv  054-80639_ch00_4P.indd   14  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Introduction     Highly ambitious moon- shot proj ects, such as   treating cancer, enabling autonomous vehicles, and  powering drone deliveries, have been unsuccessful  or slow to arrive.  Even  at  data  power houses  like  Amazon,  most  AI   activity has involved proj ects that “quietly but meaning- fully improve core operations,” according to CEO Jeff Bezos  in his 2017 letter to shareholders. It’s an evolutionary set of  improvements that  will eventually add up to revolution.  AI’s  overall  impact  on  employment   isn’t  certain,  but  jobs   will  clearly change.   Some observers have predicted dire lev- els  of  AI- driven  unemployment.  Thus  far—as  Wilson  and Daugherty discuss in their article on “collaborative  intelligence”— augmentation  of   human  work  by  smart  machines  has  been  far  more  common  than  large- scale  automation.  Therefore,  according  to  Mark  Knickrehm,  organ izations need to begin preparing employees to work  alongside smart machines and add value to their efforts.  Implementing AI raises ethical questions.   Other articles in the  book, including one by Roman Yampolskiy, suggest that  it’s not too early to consider the ethical concerns around  AI. Algorithmic bias and lack of transparency are two  critical issues that AI exacerbates.  These power ful tech- nologies  have  power ful  implications  for  the  workplace  and the broader society.  xv  054-80639_ch00_4P.indd   15  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Introduction  With  these fundamentals covered, it’s time to dive into  the articles. To best understand how AI  will impact your  com pany’s situation, consider  these questions as you read:     Which par tic u lar AI technologies have the greatest   potential benefit to your organ ization?     How might  those technologies enable new strate- gies, business models, or business pro cess designs?     What data resources do you have—or might you   obtain—in order to power AI proj ects?     How do you anticipate that AI  will impact your   workforce, and how can you begin to prepare em- ployees to augment AI capabilities?  If you and your organ ization  haven’t already confronted   these questions, let this book spark conversations. Think  about how the right AI initiative could help your division  perform better or make you more efficient at your own job.  Simply asking the questions may be the first step in start- ing your com pany down the path of transformation.  As a professor and a con sul tant on information tech- nology and business, I’ve spent the past several de cades  watching AI alternate from spring blooms to winter dol- drums. This time is diff er ent. AI is deeply ensconced in  business and is starting to bring about exciting change.  Now, it appears that winter  will not return.  xvi  054-80639_ch00_4P.indd   16  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Section 1  UNDERSTANDING   AI AND MACHINE   LEARNING  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   1  6 22 19   7:33 AM   054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   2  6 22 19   7:33 AM   1  THE BUSINESS  OF ARTIFICIAL  INTELLIGENCE  by Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee  F or more than 250 years the fundamental  drivers of   economic growth have been technological innova- tions. The most impor tant of  these are what econo- mists call general- purpose technologies— a category that  includes the steam engine, electricity, and the internal  combustion engine. Each one catalyzed waves of com- plementary innovations and opportunities. The internal  combustion engine, for example, gave rise to cars, trucks,  airplanes, chain saws, and lawnmowers, along with big- box   3  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   3  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Brynjolfsson and McAfee  retailers, shopping centers, cross- docking ware houses,  new supply chains, and, when you think about it, suburbs.  Companies as diverse as Walmart, UPS, and Uber found  ways to leverage the technology to create profitable new  business models.  The most impor tant general- purpose technology of our  era is artificial intelligence, particularly machine learning   ML — that is, the machine’s ability to keep improving its  per for mance without  humans having to explain exactly  how to accomplish all the tasks it’s given. Within just the  past few years machine learning has become far more ef- fective and widely available. We can now build systems  that learn how to perform tasks on their own.  Why is this such a big deal? Two reasons. First, we   humans know more than we can tell: We  can’t explain  exactly how  we’re able to do a lot of  things— from rec- ognizing a face to making a smart move in the ancient  Asian strategy game of Go. Prior to ML, this inability  to articulate our own knowledge meant that we  couldn’t  automate many tasks. Now we can.  Second, ML systems are often excellent learners. They  can achieve superhuman per for mance in a wide range of  activities, including detecting fraud and diagnosing dis- ease. Excellent digital learners are being deployed across  the economy, and their impact  will be profound.  4  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   4  6 22 19   7:33 AM   The Business of Artificial Intelligence  In the sphere of business, AI is poised to have a transfor- mational impact, on the scale of  earlier general- purpose  technologies. Although it is already in use in thousands  of companies around the world, most big opportunities  have not yet been tapped. The effects of AI  will be mag- nified in the coming de cade, as manufacturing, retail- ing, transportation, finance, health care, law, advertising,  insurance, entertainment, education, and virtually  every  other industry transform their core pro cesses and busi- ness models to take advantage of machine learning. The  bottleneck now is in management, implementation, and  business imagination.  Like so many other new technologies, however, AI has  generated lots of unrealistic expectations. We see busi- ness plans liberally sprinkled with references to machine  learning, neural nets, and other forms of the technology,  with  little connection to its real capabilities. Simply call- ing a dating site “AI- powered,” for example,  doesn’t make  it any more effective, but it might help with fund- raising.  This article  will cut through the noise to describe the real  potential of AI, its practical implications, and the barriers  to its adoption.  5  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   5  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Brynjolfsson and McAfee  What Can AI Do  Today?  The term artificial intelligence was coined in 1955 by John  McCarthy, a math professor at Dartmouth who or ga nized  the seminal conference on the topic the following year.  Ever since, perhaps in part  because of its evocative name,  the field has given rise to more than its share of fantas- tic claims and promises. In 1957 the economist Herbert  Simon predicted that computers would beat  humans at  chess within 10 years.  It took 40.  In 1967 the cognitive  scientist Marvin Minsky said, “Within a generation the  prob lem  of  creating  ‘artificial  intelligence’   will  be  sub- stantially solved.” Simon and Minsky  were both intellec- tual  giants, but they erred badly. Thus it’s understandable  that dramatic claims about  future breakthroughs meet  with a certain amount of skepticism.  Let’s start by exploring what AI is already  doing and  how quickly it is improving. The biggest advances have  been  in  two  broad  areas:  perception  and  cognition.  In  the former category some of the most practical advances  have  been  made  in  relation  to  speech.  Voice  recogni- tion is still far from perfect, but millions of  people are  now using it— think Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant.  The text you are now reading was originally dictated to  a computer and transcribed with sufficient accuracy to   6  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   6  6 22 19   7:33 AM   The Business of Artificial Intelligence  make it faster than typing. A study by the Stanford com- puter scientist James Landay and colleagues found that  speech recognition is now about three times as fast, on  average, as typing on a cell phone. The error rate, once  8.5%, has dropped to 4.9%. What’s striking is that this sub- stantial improvement has come not over the past 10 years  but just since the summer of 2016.  Image  recognition,  too,  has  improved  dramatically.  You may have noticed that Facebook and other apps now  recognize many of your friends’  faces in posted photos  and prompt you to tag them with their names. An app   running  on  your  smartphone   will  recognize  virtually  any bird in the wild. Image recognition is even replac- ing ID cards at corporate headquarters. Vision systems,  such as  those used in self- driving cars, formerly made a   mistake when identifying a pedestrian as often as once  in 30 frames  the cameras in  these systems rec ord about  30 frames a second ; now they err less often than once  in 30 million frames. The error rate for recognizing im- ages from a large database called ImageNet, with several  million photo graphs of common, obscure, or downright  weird images, fell from higher than 30% in 2010 to about  4% in 2016 for the best systems.  See figure 1-1.   The speed of improvement has accelerated rapidly in  recent years as a new approach, based on very large or  “deep” neural nets, was  adopted. The ML approach for   7  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   7  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Brynjolfsson and McAfee  F I G U R E   1 -1  Machines have made real strides in distinguishing among  similar- looking categories of images  Vision error rate 30%  Algorithms  25  20  15  10  5  0  Humans  2010  2011  2012  2013  2014  2015  2016  Source: Electronic Frontier Foundation  vision systems is still far from flawless— but even  people  have trou ble quickly recognizing puppies’  faces or, more  embarrassingly, see their cute  faces where none exist.  The second type of major improvement has been in cog- nition and prob lem solving. Machines have already beaten  the finest   human  players of poker and Go— achievements  that experts had predicted would take at least another de- cade. Google’s DeepMind team has used ML systems to   8  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   8  6 22 19   7:33 AM   The Business of Artificial Intelligence  improve  the  cooling  efficiency  at  data  centers  by  more  than 15%, even  after they  were optimized by  human ex- perts. Intelligent agents are being used by the cybersecu- rity  com pany  Deep  Instinct  to  detect  malware,  and  by  PayPal to prevent money laundering. A system using IBM  technology automates the claims pro cess at an insurance  com pany in Singapore, and a system from Lumidatum, a  data science platform firm, offers timely advice to improve  customer support. Dozens of companies are using ML to  decide which trades to execute on Wall Street, and more  and more credit decisions are made with its help. Amazon  employs ML to optimize inventory and improve product  recommendations to customers. Infinite Analytics devel- oped one ML system to predict  whether a user would click  on a par tic u lar ad, improving online ad placement for a  global consumer packaged goods com pany, and another  to improve customers’ search and discovery pro cess at a  Brazilian  online  retailer.  The  first  system  increased  ad- vertising ROI threefold, and the second resulted in a $125  million increase in annual revenue.  Machine learning systems are not only replacing older  algorithms in many applications, but are now superior  at many tasks that  were once done best by  humans. Al- though the systems are far from perfect, their error rate—  about 5%—on the ImageNet database is at or better than  human- level per for mance. Voice recognition, too, even   9  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   9  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Brynjolfsson and McAfee  in  noisy  environments,  is  now  nearly  equal  to   human  per for mance. Reaching this threshold opens up vast new  possibilities  for  transforming  the  workplace  and  the  economy.  Once  AI- based  systems  surpass   human  per- for mance at a given task, they are much likelier to spread  quickly. For instance, Aptonomy and Sanbot, makers re- spectively of drones and robots, are using improved vi- sion systems to automate much of the work of security  guards. The software com pany Affectiva, among  others,  is using them to recognize emotions such as joy, surprise,  and anger in focus groups. And Enlitic is one of several  deep- learning  startups  that  use  them  to  scan  medical  images to help diagnose cancer.   These are impressive achievements, but the applicability  of AI- based systems is still quite narrow. For instance,  their remarkable per for mance on the ImageNet database,  even with its millions of images,  doesn’t always translate  into similar success “in the wild,” where lighting condi- tions,  angles, image resolution, and context may be very  diff er ent. More fundamentally, we can marvel at a system  that understands Chinese speech and translates it into  En glish, but we  don’t expect such a system to know what  a par tic u lar Chinese character means— let alone where  to  eat  in  Beijing.  If  someone  performs  a  task  well,  it’s  natu ral to assume that the person has some competence  in related tasks. But ML systems are trained to do specific   10  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   10  6 22 19   7:33 AM   The Business of Artificial Intelligence  tasks,  and  typically  their  knowledge  does  not  general- ize. The fallacy that a computer’s narrow understanding  implies  broader  understanding  is  perhaps  the  biggest  source of confusion, and exaggerated claims, about AI’s  pro gress. We are far from machines that exhibit general  intelligence across diverse domains.  Understanding Machine Learning  The most impor tant  thing to understand about ML is that  it represents a fundamentally diff er ent approach to creat- ing software: The machine learns from examples, rather  than  being  explic itly  programmed  for  a  par tic u lar  out- come. This is an impor tant break from previous practice.  For  most  of  the  past  50  years,  advances  in  information  technology and its applications have focused on codifying  existing knowledge and procedures and embedding them  in machines. Indeed, the term “coding” denotes the pains- taking pro cess of transferring knowledge from developers’  heads into a form that machines can understand and ex- ecute. This approach has a fundamental weakness: Much  of the knowledge we all have is tacit, meaning that we  can’t  fully explain it. It’s nearly impossible for us to write down  instructions  that  would  enable  another  person  to  learn  how to  ride a bike or to recognize a friend’s face.  11  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   11  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Brynjolfsson and McAfee  In other words, we all know more than we can tell. This  fact is so impor tant that it has a name: Polanyi’s Paradox,  for the phi los o pher and polymath Michael Polanyi, who  described it in 1964. Polanyi’s Paradox not only limits  what we can tell one another but has historically placed  a fundamental restriction on our ability to endow ma- chines with intelligence. For a long time that  limited the  activities that machines could productively perform in  the economy.  Machine learning is overcoming  those limits. In this  second wave of the second machine age, machines built  by  humans are learning from examples and using struc- tured feedback to solve on their own prob lems such as  Polanyi’s classic one of recognizing a face.  Dif fer ent Flavors of Machine Learning  Artificial  intelligence  and  machine  learning  come  in  many flavors, but most of the successes in recent years  have been in one category: supervised learning systems,  in which the machine is given lots of examples of the cor- rect answer to a par tic u lar prob lem. This pro cess almost  always involves mapping from a set of inputs, X, to a set  of outputs, Y. For instance, the inputs might be pictures of  vari ous animals, and the correct outputs might be labels   12  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   12  6 22 19   7:33 AM   The Business of Artificial Intelligence  for  those animals: dog, cat,  horse. The inputs could also be  waveforms from a sound recording and the outputs could  be words: “yes,” “no,” “hello,” “good- bye.”  See  table 1-1.  Successful systems often use a training set of data with  thousands or even millions of examples, each of which  has been labeled with the correct answer. The system can  then be let loose to look at new examples. If the train- ing has gone well, the system  will predict answers with a  high rate of accuracy.  The algorithms that have driven much of this success  depend on an approach called deep learning, which uses   T A B L E   1 -1  Supervised learning systems As two pioneers in the field, Tom Mitchell and Michael I. Jordan, have  noted, most of the recent pro gress in machine learning involves mapping  from a set of inputs to a set of outputs. Some examples:  Input X Voice recording Historical market data Photo graph Drug chemical properties Store transaction details   Recipe ingredients Purchase histories Car locations and speed  Faces  Output Y Transcript  Future market data Caption Treatment efficacy Is the transaction  fraudulent?

Deep learning algorithms have a sig- nificant advantage over  earlier generations of ML algo- rithms: They can make better use of much larger data  sets. The old systems would improve as the number of ex- amples in the training data grew, but only up to a point,   after which additional data  didn’t lead to better predic- tions. According to Andrew Ng, one of the  giants of the  field, deep neural nets  don’t seem to level off in this way:  More data leads to better and better predictions. Some  very large systems are trained by using 36 million exam- ples or more. Of course, working with extremely large  data  sets  requires  more  and  more  pro cessing  power,  which is one reason the very big systems are often run on  supercomputers or specialized computer architectures.  Any situation in which you have a lot of data on be hav- ior and are trying to predict an outcome is a potential ap- plication for supervised learning systems. Jeff Wilke, who  leads Amazon’s consumer business, says that supervised  learning systems have largely replaced the memory- based  filtering algorithms that  were used to make personal- ized recommendations to customers. In other cases, clas- sic algorithms for setting inventory levels and optimizing  supply chains have been replaced by more efficient and  robust systems based on machine learning. JPMorgan  Chase introduced a system for reviewing commercial loan  contracts; work that used to take loan officers 360,000   14  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   14  6 22 19   7:33 AM   The Business of Artificial Intelligence  hours can now be done in a few seconds. And supervised  learning  systems  are  now  being  used  to  diagnose  skin  cancer.  These are just a few examples.  It’s comparatively straightforward to label a body of  data and use it to train a supervised learner; that’s why  supervised ML systems are more common than unsu- pervised  ones,  at  least  for  now.  Unsupervised  learning  systems seek to learn on their own. We  humans are ex- cellent unsupervised learners: We pick up most of our  knowledge of the world  such as how to recognize a tree   with  little or no labeled data. But it is exceedingly diffi- cult to develop a successful machine learning system that  works this way.  If and when we learn to build robust unsupervised  learners,  exciting  possibilities   will  open  up.   These  ma- chines could look at complex prob lems in fresh ways to  help us discover patterns—in the spread of diseases, in  price moves across securities in a market, in customers’  purchase  be hav iors,  and  so  on— that  we  are  currently  unaware of. Such possibilities lead Yann LeCun, the head  of AI research at Facebook and a professor at NYU, to  compare supervised learning systems to the frosting on  the cake and unsupervised learning to the cake itself.  Another small but growing area within the field is rein­ forcement learning. This approach is embedded in systems  that have mastered Atari video games and board games   15  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   15  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Brynjolfsson and McAfee  like Go. It is also helping to optimize data center power  usage  and  to  develop  trading  strategies  for  the  stock  market. Robots created by Kindred use machine learn- ing to identify and sort objects  they’ve never encountered  before, speeding up the “pick and place” pro cess in dis- tribution centers for consumer goods. In reinforcement  learning systems the programmer specifies the current  state of the system and the goal, lists allowable actions,  and describes the ele ments of the environment that con- strain the outcomes for each of  those actions. Using the  allowable actions, the system has to figure out how to get  as close to the goal as pos si ble.  These systems work well  when  humans can specify the goal but not necessarily  how to get  there. For instance, Microsoft used reinforce- ment  learning  to  select  headlines  for  MSN . com  news  stories  by  “rewarding”  the  system  with  a  higher  score  when more visitors clicked on the link. The system tried  to maximize its score on the basis of the rules its design- ers gave it. Of course, this means that a reinforcement  learning system  will optimize for the goal you explic itly  reward,  not  necessarily  the  goal  you   really  care  about   such as lifetime customer value , so specifying the goal  correctly and clearly is critical.  16  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   16  6 22 19   7:33 AM   The Business of Artificial Intelligence  Putting Machine Learning to Work   There  are  three  pieces  of  good  news  for  organ izations  looking to put ML to use  today. First, AI skills are spread- ing quickly. The world still has not nearly enough data  scientists and machine learning experts, but the demand  for them is being met by online educational resources as  well as by universities. The best of  these, including Udacity,  Coursera, and fast.ai, do much more than teach intro- ductory concepts; they can actually get smart, motivated  students to the point of being able to create industrial-  grade ML deployments. In addition to training their own   people, interested companies can use online talent plat- forms such as Upwork, Topcoder, and Kaggle to find ML  experts with verifiable expertise.  The second welcome development is that the necessary  algorithms and hardware for modern AI can be bought or  rented as needed. Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Salesforce,  and  other  companies  are  making  power ful  ML  infra- structure available via the cloud. The cutthroat competi- tion among  these rivals means that companies that want  to experiment with or deploy ML  will see more and more  capabilities available at ever- lower prices over time.  The final piece of good news, and prob ably the most  underappreciated, is that you may not need all that much   17  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   17  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Brynjolfsson and McAfee  data to start making productive use of ML. The per for- mance  of  most  machine  learning  systems  improves  as   they’re given more data to work with, so it seems logical  to  conclude  that  the  com pany  with  the  most  data   will  win. That might be the case if “win” means “dominate  the global market for a single application such as ad tar- geting or speech recognition.” But if success is defined  instead  as  significantly  improving  per for mance,  then  sufficient data is often surprisingly easy to obtain.  For example, Udacity cofounder Sebastian Thrun no- ticed that some of his salespeople  were much more effec- tive than  others when replying to inbound queries in a  chat room. Thrun and his gradu ate student Zayd Enam  realized that their chat room logs  were essentially a set of  labeled training data— exactly what a supervised learn- ing  system  needs.  Interactions  that  led  to  a  sale   were  labeled  successes,  and  all   others   were  labeled  failures.  Zayd used the data to predict what answers successful  salespeople  were likely to give in response to certain very  common  inquiries  and  then  shared   those  predictions  with the other salespeople to nudge them  toward better  per for mance.  After 1,000 training cycles, the salespeople  had increased their effectiveness by 54% and  were able to  serve twice as many customers at a time.  The AI startup WorkFusion takes a similar approach.  It works with companies to bring higher levels of au-  18  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   18  6 22 19   7:33 AM   The Business of Artificial Intelligence  tomation  to  back- office  pro cesses  such  as  paying  in- ternational  invoices  and  settling  large  trades  between  financial institutions. The reason  these pro cesses  haven’t  been automated yet is that  they’re complicated; relevant  information  isn’t always presented the same way  every  time  “How do we know what currency  they’re talking  about?” ,  and  some  interpretation  and  judgment  are  necessary.  WorkFusion’s  software  watches  in  the  back- ground as  people do their work and uses their actions  as  training  data  for  the  cognitive  task  of  classification   “This invoice is in dollars. This one is in yen. This one is  in euros . . .” . Once the system is confident enough in  its classifications, it takes over the pro cess.  Machine  learning  is  driving  changes  at  three  levels:  tasks and occupations, business pro cesses, and business  models. An example of task- and- occupation redesign is the  use of machine vision systems to identify potential can- cer cells— freeing up radiologists to focus on truly criti- cal cases, to communicate with patients, and to coordinate  with other physicians. An example of pro cess redesign is  the reinvention of the workflow and layout of Amazon  fulfillment centers  after the introduction of robots and  optimization  algorithms  based  on  machine  learning.  Similarly, business models need to be rethought to take  advantage  of  ML  systems  that  can  intelligently  recom- mend  music or movies in a personalized way. Instead of   19  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   19  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Brynjolfsson and McAfee  selling songs à la carte on the basis of consumer choices,  a better model might offer a subscription to a personal- ized station that predicted and played  music a par tic u lar  customer would like, even if the person had never heard  it before.  Note that machine learning systems hardly ever replace  the entire job, pro cess, or business model. Most often they  complement  human activities, which can make their work  ever more valuable. The most effective rule for the new di- vision of  labor is rarely, if ever, “give all tasks to the ma- chine.” Instead, if the successful completion of a pro cess  requires 10 steps, one or two of them may become auto- mated while the rest become more valuable for  humans  to do. For instance, the chat room sales support system at  Udacity  didn’t try to build a bot that could take over all the  conversations; rather, it advised  human salespeople about  how to improve their per for mance. The  humans remained  in charge but became vastly more effective and efficient.  This approach is usually much more feasible than trying to  design machines that can do every thing  humans can do.  It often leads to better, more satisfying work for the  people  involved and ultimately to a better outcome for customers. Designing and implementing new combinations of  technologies,  human skills, and capital assets to meet cus- tomers’  needs  requires  large- scale  creativity  and  plan- ning. It is a task that machines are not very good at. That   20  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   20  6 22 19   7:33 AM   The Business of Artificial Intelligence  makes being an entrepreneur or a business man ag er one  of society’s most rewarding jobs in the age of ML.  Risks and Limits  The second wave of the second machine age brings with  it  new  risks.  In  par tic u lar,  machine  learning  systems  often  have  low  “interpretability,”  meaning  that   humans  have difficulty figuring out how the systems reached their  decisions.  Deep  neural  networks  may  have  hundreds  of millions of connections, each of which contributes a  small amount to the ultimate decision. As a result,  these  systems’ predictions tend to resist  simple, clear expla- nation.  Unlike   humans,  machines  are  not   yet!   good  storytellers. They  can’t always give a rationale for why a  par tic u lar applicant was accepted or rejected for a job, or a  par tic u lar medicine was recommended. Ironically, even  as we have begun to overcome Polanyi’s Paradox,  we’re  facing a kind of reverse version: Machines know more  than they can tell us.  This creates three risks. First, the machines may have  hidden biases, derived not from any intent of the designer  but from the data provided to train the system. For in- stance, if a system learns which job applicants to accept  for an interview by using a data set of decisions made by   21  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   21  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Brynjolfsson and McAfee   human recruiters in the past, it may inadvertently learn  to perpetuate their racial, gender, ethnic, or other biases.  Moreover,  these biases may not appear as an explicit rule  but,  rather,  be  embedded  in  subtle  interactions  among  the thousands of  factors considered.  A second risk is that, unlike traditional systems built  on explicit logic rules, neural network systems deal with  statistical truths rather than literal truths. That can make  it difficult, if not impossible, to prove with complete cer- tainty that the system  will work in all cases— especially  in situations that  weren’t represented in the training data.  Lack of verifiability can be a concern in mission- critical  applications, such as controlling a nuclear power plant,  or when life- or- death decisions are involved.  Third,  when  the  ML  system  does  make  errors,  as  it  almost  inevitably   will,  diagnosing  and  correcting  ex- actly what’s  going wrong can be difficult. The under lying  structure that led to the solution can be unimaginably  complex, and the solution may be far from optimal if the  conditions  under which the system was trained change. While  all   these  risks  are  very  real,  the  appropriate  benchmark  is  not  perfection  but  the  best  available  al- ternative.  After all, we  humans, too, have biases, make   mistakes,  and  have  trou ble  explaining  truthfully  how  we arrived at a par tic u lar decision. The advantage of  machine- based  systems  is  that  they  can  be  improved   22  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   22  6 22 19   7:33 AM   The Business of Artificial Intelligence  over  time  and   will  give  consistent  answers  when  pre- sented with the same data.  Does that mean  there is no limit to what artificial in- telligence and machine learning can do? Perception and  cognition cover a  great deal of territory— from driving a  car to forecasting sales to deciding whom to hire or pro- mote. We believe the chances are excellent that AI  will  soon reach superhuman levels of per for mance in most or  all of  these areas. So what  won’t AI and ML be able to do? We sometimes hear “Artificial intelligence  will never  be good at assessing emotional, crafty, sly, inconsistent   human beings— it’s too rigid and impersonal for that.”  We  don’t agree. ML systems like  those at Affectiva are al- ready at or beyond human- level per for mance in discern- ing a person’s emotional state on the basis of tone of voice  or facial expression. Other systems can infer when even  the world’s best poker players are bluffing well enough  to beat them at the amazingly complex game Heads-Up  No- Limit  Texas  Hold’em.  Reading   people  accurately  is  subtle work, but it’s not magic. It requires perception and  cognition— exactly  the  areas  in  which  ML  is  currently  strong and getting stronger all the time.  A  great place to start a discussion of the limits of AI is  with Pablo Picasso’s observation about computers: “But  they are useless. They can only give you answers.”  They’re  actually far from useless, as ML’s recent triumphs show,   23  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   23  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Brynjolfsson and McAfee  but Picasso’s observation still provides insight. Comput- ers are devices for answering questions, not for posing  them. That means entrepreneurs, innovators, scientists,  creators, and other kinds of  people who figure out what  prob lem or opportunity to tackle next, or what new ter- ritory to explore,  will continue to be essential.  Similarly,   there’s  a  huge  difference  between  passively  assessing someone’s  mental state or morale and actively  working to change it. ML systems are getting quite good  at the former but remain well  behind us at the latter. We   humans are a deeply social species; other  humans, not ma- chines, are best at tapping into social drives such as com- passion, pride, solidarity, and shame in order to persuade,  motivate, and inspire. In 2014 the TED Conference and  the XPRIZE Foundation announced an award for “the first  artificial intelligence to come to this stage and give a TED  Talk compelling enough to win a standing ovation from  the audience.” We doubt the award  will be claimed any- time soon.  We think the biggest and most impor tant opportuni- ties for  human smarts in this new age of superpowerful  ML lie at the intersection of two areas: figuring out what  prob lems to work on next, and persuading a lot of  people  to tackle them and go along with the solutions. This is a  decent definition of leadership, which is becoming much  more impor tant in the second machine age.  24  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   24  6 22 19   7:33 AM   The Business of Artificial Intelligence  The  status  quo  of  dividing  up  work  between  minds  and machines is falling apart very quickly. Companies  that stick with it are  going to find themselves at an ever-  greater competitive disadvantage compared with rivals  who are willing and able to put ML to use in all the places  where it is appropriate and who can figure out how to ef- fectively integrate its capabilities with humanity’s.  A time of tectonic change in the business world has  begun, brought on by technological pro gress. As was the  case with steam power and electricity, it’s not access to  the new technologies themselves, or even to the best tech- nologists, that separates winners from losers. Instead, it’s  innovators who are open- minded enough to see past the  status quo and envision very diff er ent approaches, and  savvy enough to put them into place. One of machine  learning’s greatest legacies may well be the creation of a  new generation of business leaders.  In our view, artificial intelligence, especially machine  learning, is the most impor tant general- purpose technol- ogy of our era. The impact of  these innovations on busi- ness and the economy  will be reflected not only in their  direct contributions but also in their ability to enable and  inspire  complementary  innovations.  New  products  and  pro cesses are being made pos si ble by better vision sys- tems, speech recognition, intelligent prob lem solving, and  many other capabilities that machine learning delivers.  25  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   25  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Brynjolfsson and McAfee  Some experts have gone even further. Gil Pratt, who  now heads the  Toyota Research Institute, has compared  the current wave of AI technology to the Cambrian ex- plosion 500 million years ago that birthed a tremendous  variety of new life forms. Then as now, one of the key new  capabilities was vision. When animals first gained this  capability, it allowed them to explore the environment  far more effectively; that catalyzed an enormous increase  in the number of species, both predators and prey, and in  the range of ecological niches that  were filled.  Today as  well we expect to see a variety of new products, ser vices,  pro cesses, and orga nizational forms and also numerous  extinctions.  There  will certainly be some weird failures  along with unexpected successes.  Although it is hard to predict exactly which compa- nies  will dominate in the new environment, a general  princi ple is clear: The most nimble and adaptable com- panies and executives  will thrive. Organ izations that can  rapidly sense and respond to opportunities  will seize the  advantage in the AI- enabled landscape. So the successful  strategy is to be willing to experiment and learn quickly.  If man ag ers  aren’t ramping up experiments in the area of  machine learning, they  aren’t  doing their job. Over the  next de cade, AI  won’t replace man ag ers, but man ag ers  who use AI  will replace  those who  don’t.  26  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   26  6 22 19   7:33 AM   The Business of Artificial Intelligence  TAKEAWAYS    The  most  impor tant  new  general- purpose  technology  is  artificial  intelligence,  particularly  machine  learning.  ML systems are replacing older algorithms in many ap- plications and are now superior at many tasks previously  done best by  humans.  ✓  Machine learning is fundamentally diff er ent from  the software that preceded it: The machine learns  from examples, rather than being explic itly pro- grammed for a par tic u lar outcome.  ✓  Organ izations looking to put ML to use should  be aware that AI skills are spreading quickly; the  necessary algorithms and hardware for mod- ern AI can be bought or rented as needed; and  they may not need much data to start using ML  productively.  ✓  ML systems have low “interpretability,” meaning  that  humans have difficulty figuring out how the  systems reach their decisions.

Candela— bald,  compact,  thoughtful— runs  Face- book’s Applied Machine Learning  AML  group, the en- gine room of AI at Facebook, which increasingly makes  it the engine room of Facebook in general.  After some  verbal searching, he fi nally says:  29  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   29  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Candela and Berinato  Look, a machine learning algorithm  really is a  lookup  table, right? Where the key is the input, like  an image, and the value is the label for the input,  like “a  horse.” I have a bunch of examples of some­ thing. Pictures of  horses. I give the algorithm as  many as I can. “This is a  horse. This is a  horse. This   isn’t a  horse. This is a  horse.” And the algorithm  keeps  those in a  table. Then, if a new example comes  along—or if I tell it to watch for new examples—  well, the algorithm just goes and looks at all  those  examples we fed it. Which rows in the  table look  similar? And how similar? It’s trying to decide, “Is  this new  thing a  horse? I think so.” If it’s right, the  image gets put in the “This is a  horse” group, and  if it’s wrong, it gets put in the “This  isn’t a  horse”  group. Next time, it has more data to look up.  One challenge is how do we decide how similar  a new picture is to the ones stored in the  table. One  aspect of machine learning is to learn similarity  functions. Another challenge is, What happens  when your  table grows  really large? For  every new  image, you would need to make a zillion compari­ sons . . .  So another aspect of machine learning is  to approximate a large stored  table with a function  instead of  going through  every image. The func­ tion knows how to roughly estimate what the cor­  30  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   30  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Inside Facebook’s AI Workshop   responding value should be. That’s the essence of  machine learning—to approximate a gigantic  table  with a function. This is what learning is about.   There’s more to it than that, obviously, but it’s a good  starting point when talking about AI  because it makes it  sound  real,  almost  boring.  Mechanical.  So  much  of  the  conversation around AI is awash in mystical descriptions  of its power and in reverence for its near- magic capabili- ties. Candela  doesn’t like that and tries to use more- prosaic  terms. It’s power ful, yes, but not magical. It has limitations.  During  pre sen ta tions,  he’s  fond  of  showing  a  slide  with  a  wizard  and  a  factory,  telling  audiences  that  Facebook  thinks of AI like the latter,  because “wizards  don’t scale.” And that’s what Facebook has done with AI and ma- chine learning: scaled it at a breakneck pace. A few years  ago  the  com pany’s  machine  learning  group  numbered  just a few and needed days to run an experiment. Now,  Candela says, several hundred employees run thousands  of  experiments  a  day.  AI  is  woven  so  intricately  into  the platform that it would be impossible to separate the  products— your feed, your chat, your kid’s finsta— from  the algorithms. Nearly every thing users see and do is in- formed by AI and machine learning.  Understanding  how  and  why  Facebook  has  so  fully  embraced AI can help any organ ization that’s ready to   31  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   31  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Candela and Berinato  invest in an algorithmic  future. It would be easy to as- sume that Facebook, with all its resources, would simply  get the best talent and write the best algorithms— game  over. But Candela took a diff er ent approach. Certainly  the talent is strong, and the algorithms are good. Some of  them are designed to “see” images or automatically filter  them. Some understand conversations and can respond  to them. Some translate between languages. Some try to  predict what you’ll like and buy.  But in some ways the algorithms are not his main focus.  Instead, he’s been busy creating an AI workshop in which  anyone in the com pany can use AI to achieve a goal. Ba- sically,  Candela  built  an  AI  platform  for  the  platform.   Whether  you’re a deeply knowledgeable programmer or  a complete newbie, you can take advantage of his wares.  Here’s how he did it and what you can learn from it.  Candela,  a  veteran  of  Microsoft  Research,  arrived  at  Facebook in 2012 to work in the com pany’s ads business.  He and a handful of staffers inherited a ranking algo- rithm for better targeting users with ads.  Candela  describes  the  machine  learning  code  he  in- herited as “robust but not the latest.” More than once he   Soyuz  32  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   32  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Inside Facebook’s AI Workshop   compares it to Soyuz, the 1960s Soviet spacecraft. Basic  but reliable. Gets the job done even if it’s not the newest,  best  thing. “It’ll get you up  there and down. But it’s not  the latest covnet [convolutional neural net] of the month.” You might assume, then, that the first  thing Candela  set out to do was to upgrade the algorithm. Get rid of  Soyuz in  favor of a space plane. It  wasn’t. “To get more  value, I can do three  things,” he says. “I can improve the  algorithm itself, make it more sophisticated. I can throw  more and better data at the algorithm so that the existing  code produces better results. And I can change the speed  of experimentation to get more results faster.  “We  focused  on  data  and  speed,  not  on  a  better   algorithm.”  Candela  describes  this  decision  as  “dramatic”  and  “hard.” Computer scientists, especially academic- minded  ones, are rewarded for inventing new algorithms or im- proving  existing  ones.  A  better  statistical  model  is  the  goal.  Getting  cited  in  a  journal  is  validation.  Wowing  your peers gives you cred.  It requires a shift in thinking to get  those engineers to  focus on business impact before optimal statistical model.  He  thinks  many  companies  are  making  the   mistake  of  structuring  their  efforts  around  building  the  best  algo- rithms, or hiring developers who claim to have the best  algorithms,  because that’s how many AI developers think.  33  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   33  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Candela and Berinato  But  for  a  com pany,  a  good  algorithm  that  improves  the business is more valuable than vanguard statistical  models. In truth, Candela says, real algorithmic break- throughs are few and far between— two or three a year at  best. If his team focused its energies  there, it would take  lots of effort to make marginal gains.  He  hammers   these  points  home  constantly:  Figure  out the impact on the business first. Know what  you’re  solving for. Know what business challenge you need to  address. “You might look for the shiniest algorithm or  the  people who are telling you they have the most ad- vanced algorithm. And you  really should be looking for   people  who  are  most  obsessed  with  getting  any  algo- rithm to do a job. That’s kind of a profound  thing that I  think is lost in a lot of the conversation. I had a conver- sation with our resident machine learning geek at our  office, and we  were just talking about diff er ent  people   doing  AI.  He  said,  ‘Nobody   really  thinks  their  algo- rithms are very good or what ever.’ It makes me think,  maybe that’s fine.  “I’m not saying  don’t work on the algorithm at all. I’m  saying that focusing on giving it more data and better data,  and then experimenting faster, makes a lot more sense.”  So rather than defining success as building the best  natu ral  language  pro cessing  algorithm,  he  defines  it  as  deploying  one  that   will  help  users  find  a  restaurant   34  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   34  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Inside Facebook’s AI Workshop   when they ask their friends, “Where can I get a good bite  around  here?” Instead of being thrilled that some com- puter  vision  algorithm  is  nearing  pixel- perfect  object  recognition, he gets excited if that AI is good enough to  notice that you post a lot of pictures of the beach and can  help you buy a swimsuit.  The strategy worked when he started at Facebook. Ad  revenues   rose.  Candela’s  profile   rose.  It  was  suggested  that AML become a centralized function for all of Face- book. Candela said no. Twice. “I was concerned about  the ‘If you build it, they  will come’ phenomenon.” Just  creating  bits  of  artificial  intelligence  in  the  hope  that   people would see the value and adopt it  wouldn’t work.  But  he  did  pick  his  spots.  He  collaborated  with  the  feeds team while saying no to many other groups. Then he  worked with the Messenger team. His team grew and took  on more proj ects with other teams.  By 2015 Candela could see that his group would need  to  centralize,  so  he  turned  his  attention  to  how  he’d  build such an operation. He was still worried about the  “build it and they  will come” phenomenon, so he focused  less on how his team would be structured and more on  how the group would connect to the rest of Facebook.  “You build a factory that makes amazing widgets, and  you forget to design the loading docks into your factory?”  He laughs. “Well, enjoy your widgets.”  35  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   35  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Only  then,  about  three  years  in,  did  Candela  think  about upgrading some of his algorithms.  Incidentally,  even  today, the emergency escape spacecraft attached to  the International Space Station is a Soyuz.   Candela and Berinato  H2  Candela goes to a whiteboard to describe how he built his  AI factory inside Facebook. The key, he says, was figur- ing out where on the product development path AI fits.  He draws something like the graph in figure 2-1.  H3— Horizon 3, or three years out from product—is  the realm of R&D and science. Often, data scientists who   F I G U R E   2 -1  Where AI fits in at Facebook  H3 R&D  H2 AML  H1 Product delivery  i  s s e n d a e r   t c u d o r P  Time  Source: Facebook  36  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   36  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Inside Facebook’s AI Workshop   work on AI think of themselves as  here, improving al- gorithms and looking for new ways to get machines to  learn. Candela  didn’t put his team  here for the reasons  already mentioned. It’s too far from impact on the busi- ness.  H1,  approaching  product  delivery,  is  where  the  product teams live— the feeds team, the Instagram team,  the ads team. AI  doesn’t go  here  either,  because it would  be difficult to retrofit products this deeply developed. It  would be like building a car and then deciding that it  should be self- driving  after you started to put it together. That leaves H2, between the science and the product,  as the place AML lives at Facebook. AML is a conduit  for transferring the science into the product. It does not  do research for research’s sake, and it does not build and  ship products. As the upward slope in the product’s read- iness shows, it’s a dynamic space. Pointing to H2, Can- dela says, “This needs to feel uncomfortable all the time.  The  people you need to hire need to be okay with that,  and they need to be incredibly selfless.  Because if your  work is successful, you spin it out. And you need to fail  quite a bit. I’m comfortable with a 50% failure rate.”  If the team is failing less, Candela suspects its members  are too risk averse, or  they’re taking on challenges that  are sliding them closer to H1’s product focus. “Maybe we  do something like that and it works, but it’s still a failure,   because the product teams should be taking that on, not   37  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   37  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Candela and Berinato  us. If you own a piece of technology that the ads team  should  operate  themselves  to  generate  value,  give  it  to  them, and then increase your level of ambition in the ma- chine learning space before something becomes product.” So Candela’s team is neither earning the glory of in- venting new statistical models nor putting products out  into the world. It’s a factory of specialists who translate   others’ science for  others’ products and fail half the time.  Push Pull  All that being said, the lines between the three realms— H3, H2, and H1— still  aren’t crisp. In some cases Can- dela’s team does look at the science of machine learning  to solve specific prob lems. And sometimes it does help  build the products.  That was especially true as AML got off the ground,   because many  people in the business  hadn’t yet been ex- posed to AI and what it could do for them. In one case  AML built a translation algorithm. The team dipped into  the research space to look at how existing translation al- gorithms  worked  and  could  be  improved,   because  bad  translations, which  either  don’t make sense or create a  misleading interpretation, are in some ways worse than  no translation.  38  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   38  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Inside Facebook’s AI Workshop   “Early on it was more push, more tenacity on our part,”  Candela  says.  “But  it  was  gentle  tenacity.  We   weren’t   going  to  throw  something  over  the  fence  and  tell  the  product team, ‘This is  great, use it.’ ” That meant that his  team helped write some product code.  Doing a  little bit  of the science and a  little bit of the product in addition to  its core function was meant to inspire the product team  members to see what AML could do for them.  What  the  two  teams  built— a  product  that  allowed  community  pages  to  instantly  translate  into  several  languages— worked. Other proj ects  were similarly pushed  out, and now the international team and other product  groups at Facebook are pulling from AML, asking to use  code in their products themselves.  “Look, it’s nowhere near where I want it to be,” Can- dela says. “I’d like to have all the product leaders in the  com pany get together quarterly for AI reviews. That  will  certainly happen. But the conversation in the past two  years has completely changed. Now if I walk from one  end of this building to the other and I bump into, I  don’t  know, the video team or the Messenger team,  they’ll stop  me and say, ‘Hey,  we’re excited to try this. We think we  can build a product on this.’ That  didn’t happen before.” AML’s success, though, has created a new challenge for  Candela. Now that every one wants a piece of AML, the  factory has to scale.  39  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   39  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Candela and Berinato  Layer Cake  Candela  couldn’t scale just by saying yes to  every proj ect  and adding bodies to get the work done. So he or ga nized  in other ways. First he subdivided his team according to  the type of AI its members would focus on  see figure 2-2 . This created common denominators so that one team—  say, computer vision— could work on any machine learn- ing  application  involving  parsing  images  and  reuse  its  work whenever pos si ble.  Next  came  a  large- scale  engineering  effort  to  build  Facebook’s  own  AI  backbone,  called  FBLearner  Flow.   Here algorithms are deployed once and made reusable  for  anyone  who  may  need  them.  The  time- consuming  parts of setting up and  running experiments are auto- mated,  and  past  results  are  stored  and  made  available  and  easily  searchable.  And  the  system  runs  through  a  serious hardware array, so many experiments can be run  si mul ta neously.  The system allows for more than 6 mil- lion predictions a second.  All of this is to increase the  velocity of  running experiments on the data and scale.  The system was also designed to accommodate many  kinds  of  pos si ble  users.  Candela  believes  that  for  AI  to work, and to scale even further, he must help  people   40  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   40  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Inside Facebook’s AI Workshop   F I G U R E   2 - 2  Applied machine learning  Speech  Audio  Text  Visual  Translation  Natural language  Camera  Computer  vision  Computer photography  Source: Facebook  41  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   41  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Candela and Berinato   outside AML do the work themselves. He created what he  calls a layer cake of artificial intelligence  see figure 2-3 . The bottom layers focus on AML’s work: refining the  core engine  with a strong focus on optimizing per for- mance, especially for mobile  and working with machine  learning algorithms. The upper layers focus on tools that  make it pos si ble for  those outside AML to exploit the al- gorithms with less AML involvement. “It’s all about what  you expose to the user,” Candela says. In some cases he’s  built systems that developers outside AML can take ad- vantage of to build and run their own models.  A  good  example  of  Candela’s  team  structure  and  the  push pull  dynamic  comes  from  some  AI  built  to  sur- face content on the basis of what you type. The natural-  language  machine  learning  team  created  an  engine  to  understand conversational typing.  This bit of intelligence first found its way into the Mes- senger chat client. AML developed the models while the  product team developed use cases and “intents”— lingo  for the types of tasks you want the engine to learn. For  example, training natu ral language AI to recognize and   Rex  42  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   42  6 22 19   7:33 AM   F I G U R E   2 - 3  Layer cake of AI  AI ML expertise required  Less  More  More  Ease of use  Self-serve AI For non-technical users, e.g. Lumos Reusable engines For developers outside of AML, e.g. CLUE ML algorithms Generalizable by discipline Deep learning framework Caﬀe2 AI backbone FBLearner Flow  Self-serve AI For non-technical users, e.g. Lumos Reusable engines For developers outside of AML, e.g. CLUE ML algorithms Generalizable by discipline Deep learning framework Caﬀe2  AI backbone FBLearner Flow  Self-serve AI For non-technical users, e.g. Lumos Reusable engines For developers outside of AML, e.g. CLUE ML algorithms Generalizable by discipline Deep learning framework Caﬀe2 AI backbone FBLearner Flow  Less  Less  Ability to build and customize AI  More  Source: Facebook  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   43  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Candela and Berinato  reliably  respond  to  a  phrase  like  “I’m  looking  for  the  best . . .” is an intent.  The first few such intents  were deployed to Messenger   through a product called M Suggestions.  If you sent a chat to a friend that said “I’ll meet you   there in 30 minutes,” M Suggestions might prompt you  with an offer to hire a car.  As the tools for building intent models developed and  the product team became more conversant with them,  AML’s  role  diminished.  Now  the  Messenger  team  has  improved  M  Suggestions  by  building  dozens  more  in- tents on its own.  Still, this bit of natu ral language AI  wasn’t built just  for chat. It’s reusable. It was codified as CLUE, for “con- versational learning understanding engine.” It found its  way into more Facebook applications. It’s being adapted  for status updates and feeds. Social recommendations— or  social  rex,  as  every one  calls  them— are  increasingly  driven by AI. If you typed “I’m traveling to Omaha and  I  really want to find a good steak downtown,” AI might  respond  as  if  it   were  one  of  your  friends,  with  a  com- ment on your post, rex such as a list of steak houses, and  a  tagged  map  of  where  they  are  relative  to  downtown.  If your friend replied to you and said, “It also has some   great vegetarian restaurants,” the algorithm might again  reply with pertinent data.  44  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   44  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Inside Facebook’s AI Workshop   Social rex intents are not yet being developed without  AML, but the goal is to have them move out of Candela’s  group, just as M Suggestions did.  In  general,  the  idea  is  to  make  product  teams  AI-  capable  themselves.  “ We’ll  teach  you  to  fish,”  Candela  says, “and you go fish, and  we’ll drag up the next  thing.   We’ll  build  a  fishing  boat.  And  once   you’re  using  the  fishing boat, I’m  going to build a cannery, right?”  At the moment, about 70% of the AI work on the back- bone  is  done  by   people  outside  Candela’s  team.  That’s  pos si ble in part  because of the interface with AI. In some  cases, as with a tool called Lumos, machine learning can  be used by nondevelopers.  Horse back Riding and Cereal Boxes  Lumos  is  computer  vision  AI,  a  tool  that  can  comb  through photos on Facebook or Instagram or other plat- forms and learn what they contain. You can train it to  see anything. It has helped automate the discovery and  banning of pornographic or violent content, IP appro- priation  improper use of brands and log os , and other  unwelcome content. It can also help identify  things you  like and do  to drive personalized advertising and rec- ommendations  on the basis of photos in your feeds.  45  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   45  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Candela and Berinato  I  watch  a  demo  in  which  engineers  select  “horse back  riding” as our intent, the  thing  we’ll be looking for. The in- terface is  simple: A few clicks, a  couple of forms to fill out—  What are you looking for? How much data do you want to  look at?— and the algorithm gets to work finding pictures  of  horse back riding. Thumbnails start to fill the page.  The algorithm has searched for  horse back riding be- fore, so it’s already quite good at finding it. My guess is  that north of 80% of the images that pop up are indeed  of  horse back riding, and they show remarkable variety.   Here’s one with someone posing at a standstill.  Here’s  one with the  horse rearing.  Here’s an equestrian jump- ing. The algorithm finds shapes and bound aries between  shapes and builds on previous knowledge of what  those  interactions mean. It knows  things about what combina- tion of pixels is most likely a person, for example, and  what’s a  horse. It knows when it “sees” a person and a   horse together with the person situated close above the   horse. And it decides that this looks like  horse back riding. We  also  find  pictures  that   aren’t   horse back  riding—  one  is  a  person  standing  next  to  a   horse;  another  is  a  person on a mule— and check  those off as not matches.   They’re framed in red, in case  there’s any doubt. The al- gorithm  internalizes  that  information— adds  it  to  the  lookup  table— for use next time. A  simple chart at the  top of the page shows the algorithm’s accuracy and con-  46  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   46  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Inside Facebook’s AI Workshop   fidence over time. It’s always an S curve, slow to learn at  first, then rapidly improving, then tapering off on how  much more accurate it can get. It’s very good at seeing   horse back riding.  Other potentially valuable pictures are harder for AI to  parse. “Receipts” is tricky to suss out  because it can look  to a computer just like type on a page; but  there would  be some in ter est ing apps for AI that could recognize and  “read” receipts. The engineers show how bowling alleys  and escalators often confuse the algorithm  because they  have similar shapes and visual properties.  I ask, “What about something like ‘food’?” This brings  us to an impor tant point about machine learning: It’s only  as good as its training.  We call up food as a topic to train. Indeed, we see lots  of pictures of fruits and vegetables, a few of plates at res- taurants. All food. We also see a cereal box. Is that food? Well, yes. Or no. It’s a box. But  there’s food in it. When  we buy it,  we’re buying food, not the box. If I asked if   there was any food in the cupboard, you  wouldn’t say,  “No, just a cereal box.”  Or, more pertinent to Facebook,  if I posted a picture of a cereal box, should it think I’m  posting about food or about a box?  As a picture, as a  piece of data, it’s a box.  Should we mark this as a match or a miss?  Here’s part of  the art of machine learning. When training algorithms,   47  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   47  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Candela and Berinato  one  needs  to  use  clearly  definable  categories.  Food  is  prob ably too general in some ways, and the algorithm   will  either improperly hit or miss on images  because it’s  hard to know what we mean when we say “Show me pic- tures of food.” “Vegetable” is a better idea to train on.  And when training, every one must define terms in the  same  way.  Imagine  two   people  training  the  algorithm  when  one  always  marks  cereal  boxes  as  food  and  the  other marks them as not food. Now imagine that hap- pening at scale, on terabytes of visual data.  The  same  applies  to  natu ral  language  pro cessing.   Humans are very good at interpreting text in context to  find  sophisticated  meaning.  For  example,  I  may  type,  “Gee, I love that movie about the superheroes. It’s so, so  original! I hope they make a hundred more of them.” My  friends, who know me and know some of the mechanics  of sarcasm, may readily understand that my meaning  is the opposite of what I’m typing. Artificial intelligence  is still learning how to decide the meaning of something  like  that.  To  figure  out  if  I’m  being  sarcastic,  it  has  to  go much further than just learning how to parse gram- mar and vocabulary. It has to see what  else I’ve said and  posted and try to find other clues that  will tell it  whether  I  really loved the movie and I want 100 more or I actu- ally detested it— because getting that wrong is not good  for  a  platform  that  wants  to  create  affinities  with  me.   48  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   48  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Inside Facebook’s AI Workshop   If I  was  being  sarcastic  and  my  feed  starts  filling  up  with superhero movie ads, I’m prob ably not enjoying the  experience.  Not Magic  It’s details like  these— showing where AI is still  limited,  how  humans have such a core role in training it, and how  solving prob lems and creating value are more impor tant  than  finding   great  models— that  Candela  is  thinking  about near the end of the day, when he’s talking about  the  mythic  status  AI  has  gained.  He’s  railing  against  what he perceives as laziness in  those who find the idea  of AI- as- magic- bullet appealing and  don’t apply critical  thinking to it.  “What frustrates me,” he says, “is that every body knows  what a statistician is and what a data analyst can do. If I  want to know ‘Hey, what age segment behaves in what  way?’ I get the data analyst.  “So when  people skip that, and they come to us and  say,  ‘Hey,  give  me  a  machine  learning  algorithm  that   will do what we do,’ I’m like, ‘What is it that I look like?  What  prob lem  are  you  trying  to  solve?  What’s  your  goal? What are the trade- offs?’ ” Sometimes  they’re sur- prised that  there are trade- offs. “If that person  doesn’t   49  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   49  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Candela and Berinato  have  answers to  those questions, I’m thinking, ‘What the  hell are you thinking AI is?’ ”  They are thinking it’s magic. “But it’s not. That’s the part where I tell  people, ‘You   don’t need machine learning. You need to build a data  science team that helps you think through a prob lem and  apply the  human litmus test. Sit with them. Look at your  data. If you  can’t tell what’s  going on, if you  don’t have  any intuition, if you  can’t build a very  simple, rule- based  system— like,  Hey,  if  a  person  is  younger  than  20  and  living in this geography, then do this  thing—if you  can’t  do that, then I’m extremely ner vous even talking about  throwing AI at your prob lem.’  “I’m delighted when other executives come to me and  start not from wanting to understand the technology but  from a prob lem they have that  they’ve thought very, very  deeply about. And sometimes— often, in fact— a  simple,  good old rule- based system, if you have the right data,   will get you 80% of the way to solving the prob lem.  “And  guess  what?  It’s   going  to  have  the  benefit  that  every body understands it. Exhaust the  human brain first.”  50  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   50  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Inside Facebook’s AI Workshop   TAKEAWAYS    In Facebook’s Applied Machine Learning  AML  group,  several  hundred  employees  run  thousands  of  experi- ments a day.

Davenport  W hile  some  companies— most  large  banks,  Ford   and GM, Pfizer, and virtually all tech firms— are  aggressively adopting artificial intelligence, many  are not. Instead they are waiting for the technology to ma- ture and for expertise in AI to become more widely avail- able. They are planning to be “fast followers”— a strategy  that has worked with most information technologies.  We think this is a bad idea. It’s true that some technol- ogies need further development, but some  like traditional   53  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   53  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Mahidhar and Davenport  machine learning  are quite mature and have been avail- able in some form for de cades. Even more recent tech- nologies like deep learning are based on research that  took place in the 1980s. New research is being conducted  all the time, but the mathematical and statistical founda- tions of current AI are well established.  System Development Time  Beyond  the  technical  maturity  issue,   there  are  several  other  prob lems  with  the  idea  that  companies   will  be  able to adopt quickly once technologies are more ca- pable.  First,  there  is  the  time  required  to  develop  AI  systems. Such systems  will prob ably add  little value to  your business if they are completely generic, so time is  required to tailor and configure them to your business  and the specific knowledge domain within it. If the AI  you  are  adopting  employs  machine  learning,  you   will  have to round up a substantial amount of training data.  If it manipulates language—as in natu ral language pro- cessing applications—it can be even more difficult to get  systems up and  running.  There is a lot of taxonomy and  local knowledge that needs to be incorporated into the  AI system— similar to the old “knowledge engineering”  activity for expert systems. AI of this type is not just a   54  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   54  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Why Companies That Wait to Adopt AI May Never Catch Up  software coding prob lem; it is a knowledge coding prob- lem. It takes time to discover, disambiguate, and deploy  knowledge.  If your knowledge domain has not already been mod- eled by your vendor or con sul tant, it  will typically require  many months to design. This is particularly true for com- plex knowledge domains. For example, Memorial Sloan  Kettering Cancer Center has been working with IBM to  use Watson to treat certain forms of cancer for over six  years, and the system still  isn’t ready for broad use de- spite availability of high- quality talent in cancer care and  AI.  There are several domains and business prob lems for  which the requisite knowledge engineering is available.  However, it still needs to be manipulated to a com pany’s  specific business context.  Integration Time  Even  once  your  systems  have  been  built,   there  is  the  issue of integrating AI systems into your organ ization.   Unless you are employing some AI capabilities that are  embedded within existing packaged application systems  that your com pany already uses  for example, Salesforce  Einstein features within your CRM system , the fit with  your business pro cesses and IT architecture  will require   55  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   55  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Mahidhar and Davenport  significant planning and time for adaptation. The transi- tion from pi lots and prototypes to production systems  for AI can be difficult and time- consuming.  Even if your organ ization is skilled at moving pi lots  and prototypes into production, you  will also have to re- engineer the business pro cesses to have full impact on  your business and industry. In most cases AI supports  individual tasks and not entire business pro cesses, so you   will have to redesign business pro cesses and new  human  tasks around it. If you want to affect customer engage- ment,  for  example,  you   will  need  to  develop  or  adapt  multiple AI applications and tasks that relate to diff er ent  aspects of marketing, sales, and ser vice relationships.   Human Interactions with AI Time  Fi nally,   there  are  the   human  challenges  of  AI  to  over- come. Very few AI systems are fully autonomous but  rather  are  focused  on  augmentation  of  and  by   human  workers. New AI systems typically mean new roles and  skills for the  humans who work alongside them, and it   will typically require considerable time to retrain workers  on  the  new  pro cess  and  system.  For  example,  invest- ment advice companies providing “robo- advice” to their  customers have often attempted to get  human advisers   56  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   56  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Why Companies That Wait to Adopt AI May Never Catch Up  to shift their focus to “behavioral finance,” or providing  advice and “nudges” to encourage wise decisions and ac- tions in investing. But this sort of skill is quite diff er ent  from providing advice about what stocks and bonds to  buy and  will take some time to inculcate.  Even if the goal for an AI system is to be fully autono- mous, it is likely that some period of time in augmen- tation  mode   will  be  necessary.  During  this  period,  a  critical piece of machine learning occurs through inter- action between the system and its  human users and ob- servers. Called interaction learning, this is a critical step  for  organ izations  to  understand  how  the  system  inter- acts with its ecosystem. They can often gather new data  sets and begin to bake them into algorithms during this  period— which often takes months or years.  Governance Time for AI Applications  While AI systems are geared to provide exponential scale  and predictions, they  will need a much broader govern- ing approach than the classic controls-  and testing- driven  approach. The efficacy of AI algorithms decays over time   because  these are built based on historical data and re- cent business knowledge. The algorithms can be updated  as  the  machine  learns  from  patterns  in  new  data,  but   57  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   57  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Mahidhar and Davenport  they  will need to be monitored by subject- matter experts  to ensure the machine is interpreting the change in busi- ness context correctly. Algorithms  will also have to be  continuously monitored for bias. For instance, if an AI  system  is  trained  to  create  product  recommendations  based on customer demographics and the demographics  change dramatically in new data, it may provide biased  recommendations.  Governance  will also include watching for customer  fraud. As the systems become smart, so  will the users.  They may try to game the systems with fraudulent data  and  activities.  Monitoring  and  preventing  this   will  re- quire sophisticated instrumentation and   human moni- toring in the context of your business.  Winners Take All  It may, then, take a long time to develop and fully imple- ment AI systems, and  there are few if any shortcuts to  the  necessary  steps.  Once  they  have  been  successfully  undertaken, scaling— particularly if the com pany has a  plentiful supply of data and the knowledge engineering  mastered— can be very rapid. By the time a late adopter  has done all the necessary preparation,  earlier adopt- ers  will  have  taken  considerable  market  share— they’ll   58  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   58  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Why Companies That Wait to Adopt AI May Never Catch Up  be able to operate at substantially lower costs with bet- ter per for mance. In short, the winners may take all and  late adopters may never catch up. Think, for example, of  the learning and capability that a com pany like Pfizer—  which has, according to one of the leaders of the com- pany’s Analytics and AI Lab, more than 150 AI proj ects  underway— has  already  accumulated.  Tech  companies  like  Alphabet  have  even  more  learning;  that  com pany  had 2,700 AI proj ects underway as far back as 2015.  Admittedly, some steps can be accelerated by waiting,  if a com pany is willing to compromise its unique knowl- edge and ways of conducting business. Vendors are de- veloping a vast variety of knowledge graphs and models  that use techniques ranging from natu ral language pro- cessing to computer vision. If one exists for your industry  or business prob lem, and  you’re willing to adopt it with   little modification, that  will speed up the pro cess of AI  adoption. But you may lose your distinctive competence  or competitive advantage if you do not tweak it to fit your  context and build every thing around it.  The obvious implication is that if you want to be suc- cessful  with  AI  and  think   there  may  be  a  threat  from  AI- driven competitors or new entrants, you should start  learning now about how to adapt it to your business across  multiple  diff er ent  applications  and  AI  methods.  Some  leading companies have created a centralized AI group   59  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   59  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Mahidhar and Davenport  to do this at scale. Such central groups focus on fram- ing the prob lems, proving out the business hypothesis,  modularizing the AI assets for reusability, creating tech- niques to manage the data pipeline, and training across  businesses.  One  other  possibility  may  be  to  acquire  a  startup that has accumulated substantial AI capabilities,  but  there  will still be the need to adapt  those capabilities  to your business. In short, you should get started now if  you  haven’t already, and hope that it’s not too late.  TAKEAWAYS    Many companies are waiting for AI technology to mature  before  adopting  it— using  a  “fast  follower”  approach—  but  there are several prob lems with this plan.  ✓  Systems developed by a vendor or con sul tant  will  prob ably add  little value to your business if they  are completely generic. You’ll need time to tailor  and configure them to your business.  ✓  Even once your systems are built, the transition   from pi lots and prototypes to production systems  for AI can be difficult, and you  will also have to   60  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   60  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Why Companies That Wait to Adopt AI May Never Catch Up  reengineer certain business pro cesses for AI sys- tems to have their full impact.  ✓  New AI systems typically mean new roles and   skills for the  humans who work alongside them.  This  will require considerable, time- consuming  retraining for workers on the new pro cesses and  systems.  ✓  By the time a fast follower has done the neces-  sary preparation,  earlier adopters  will have taken  considerable market share, operating at lower cost  with better per for mance. The winners may take  all— and late adopters may never catch up.

But I think we get closer to  the heart of AI when we think about small and mundane   65  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   65  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Martinho- Truswell  ways in which AI makes work just a  little easier. And it’s  not necessarily the AI experts in your organ ization who   will identify  these mundane prob lems that AI can help  solve.  Instead,  employees  throughout  the  organ ization   will be able to spot the low- hanging fruit where AI could  make your organ ization more efficient, but only if they  know  what  AI  is  capable  of   doing,  and  what  it  should  never do.  For  example,  I  manage  the  finances  for  a  team  that  travels very often, and I’ve been grateful for the intelli- gent guesswork that my expenses software extracts from  receipts using machine learning: the merchant’s name,  the dollar amount spent, taxes, and likely expense cat- egorization. Finding opportunities for this kind of clever  improvement, saving  human time and energy, is not just  a leadership challenge. It’s a search best undertaken by as  many  people within the organ ization as pos si ble.  A fast- growing area of artificial intelligence is machine  learning, in which a computer program improves its an- swers to a question by creating and iterating algorithms  based on data. It is often regarded as the kind of tech- nology that only the cleverest and most mathematically  minded  people can understand and work with. Indeed,   those who work day to day building machine learning  programs  will tend to have postgraduate degrees in com- puter  science.  But  machine  learning  is  a  technological   66  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   66  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Three Questions About AI That Nontechnical Employees Should Be Able to Answer  tool like any other: It can be understood on vari ous levels  and can still be used by  those whose understanding is  incomplete.  People do not need to know how to fly a plane  to  be  able  to  spot  sensible  new  airline  routes.  Instead,  they need to know approximately what a plane can and  cannot do. For instance, laypeople might also have ideas  about what planes should not be used for, which could re- sult in positive outcomes such as reducing aircraft noise  in the  middle of cities or limiting costly flights for very  short journeys.  When leaders in companies, nonprofits, or governments  invest in artificial intelligence, much of their attention  goes to hiring machine learning experts, or paying for  tools. But this misses a critical opportunity. For orga- nizations to get the most that they can from AI, they should  also be investing in helping all of their team members  to  understand  the  technology  better.  Understanding  machine learning can make an employee more likely to  spot potential applications in her own work. Many of the  most promising uses for machine learning  will be hum- drum, and this is where technology can be at its most  useful: saving  people time, so that they can concentrate  on the many tasks at which they outperform machines.  An executive assistant who has a better understanding of  machine learning might suggest that calendar software  learn  more  explic itly  from  patterns  that  develop  over   67  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   67  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Martinho- Truswell  time, reminding him when his boss has not met with a  team  member  for  an  unusually  long  time.  A  calendar  that  learns  patterns  could  give  an  executive  assistant  more time for the  human specialties of his job, such as  helping his boss to manage a team.  So,  what  should  all  of  your  employees  be  learning  about AI?  There are three impor tant questions that any  member  of  your  team  should  be  able  to  answer:  How  does artificial intelligence work? What is it good at? And  what should it never do? Let’s look at each in more detail.  How Does It Work?  Team members who  aren’t responsible for building an AI  system should nonetheless know how it pro cesses infor- mation  and  answers  questions.  It’s  particularly  impor- tant  for   people  to  understand  the  differences  between  how they learn and how a machine “learns.” For example,  a  human trying to analyze one million data points  will  need to simplify it in some way in order to make sense  of it— perhaps by finding an average or creating a chart.  A machine learning algorithm, on the other hand, can  use  every individual data point when it makes its calcula- tions. It is “trained” to spot patterns using an existing set  of data inputs and outputs.  Because data is fundamental   68  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   68  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Three Questions About AI That Nontechnical Employees Should Be Able to Answer  to a machine’s ability to provide useful answers, a man- ag er  should  ensure  that  her  team  members  have  some  basic data literacy. This means helping  people to under- stand what numbers are telling us, and the biases and  errors that might be hidden within them. Understanding  data— the fuel of AI— helps  people to understand what  AI is good at.  What Is It Good At?  Machine learning tools excel when they can be trained  to solve a prob lem using vast quantities of reliable data,  and to give answers within clear par ameters that  people  have defined for them. My expenses software is a per- fect example: It has the receipts of its millions of users  to learn from, and it uses them to help predict  whether  a cup of coffee from Starbucks should be categorized as  travel, stationery, or entertainment. Learning what ma- chine learning is good at quickly helps someone to see  what machine learning is not good at. Prob lems that are  novel, or which lack meaningful data to explain them,  remain squarely in the realm of  human specialties. Help  your employees to understand this difference by show- ing them tools they already use that are powered by AI,   either within the organ ization or outside it  such as social   69  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   69  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Martinho- Truswell  media  advertising  or  streaming  ser vice  recommenda- tions .  These examples  will help team members to under- stand AI’s enormous potential, but also its limitations.  What Should It Never Do?  Just  because machine learning can solve a prob lem does  not mean it should do so. A machine cannot understand,  for example, the biases that data reveals, nor the conse- quences of the advice it gives.  There may be some prob- lems  that  your  organ ization  should  never  ask  an  AI  application to solve. For example, I would not want an  algorithm to make the final decision in my com pany on  whom to hire, what to discuss at a board meeting, or how  to manage a poorly performing staff member. If employees  have thought about the proper ethical limitations of AI,  they can be impor tant guards against its misuse.  The organ izations that  will do best in the age of artifi- cial intelligence  will be good at finding opportunities for  AI to help employees do their day- to- day jobs better and   will be able to implement  those ideas quickly. They  will  be  clear  about  where  to  deploy  machine  learning,  and  where to avoid it. Alongside their investments in tech- nology, they  will remind their teams of the importance  of  human specialties: supporting colleagues, communi-  70  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   70  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Three Questions About AI That Nontechnical Employees Should Be Able to Answer  cating well, and experimenting with novel ideas. To be  ready for pervasive AI, an organ ization’s  whole team  will  need to be ready too.  TAKEAWAYS    Employees  throughout  your  com pany  may  be  able  to  spot  the  low- hanging  fruit  where  AI  could  make  your  organ ization more efficient, but only if they have some  minimum knowledge of AI. Any member of your team  should be able to answer the following questions:  ✓  How does it work? Team members who  aren’t respon- sible for building an AI system should nonetheless  know how it pro cesses information and answers  questions. Understanding data— the fuel of AI—  helps  people understand what AI is good at.  ✓  What is it good at? Machine learning tools excel when   they can be trained to solve a prob lem using vast  quantities of reliable data, and to give answers  within clear par ameters that  people have defined  for them. Help your employees understand this  difference by showing them tools they already use   71  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   71  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Martinho- Truswell  that are powered by AI,  either within the organ i- zation or outside it.  ✓  What should it never do? Just  because machine learn-  ing can solve a prob lem does not mean it should. If  employees understand the ethical limitations of AI,  they can be impor tant guards against its misuse.

That’s  what   we’ve   heard over the past few years, and what  we’ll continue  to hear over the next few. For established businesses  that are not Google or Facebook, a natu ral question to  ask is: What have we got that is  going to allow us to sur- vive this transition?  73  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   73  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Agrawal, Gans, and Goldfarb  In our experience, when business leaders ask this with  re spect to AI, the answer they are given is “data.” This  view is confirmed by the business press.  There are hun- dreds  of  articles  claiming  that  “data  is  the  new  oil”— by  which  they  mean  it  is  a  fuel  that   will  drive  the  AI  economy.  If that is the case, then your com pany can consider it- self lucky. You collected all this data, and then it turned  out you  were sitting on an oil reserve when AI happened  to  show  up.  But  when  you  have  that  sort  of  luck,  it  is  prob ably a good idea to ask, “Are we  really that lucky?”  The “data is oil” analogy does have some truth to it.  Like internal combustion engines with oil, AI needs data  to run. AI takes in raw data and converts it into some- thing  useful  for  decision  making.  Want  to  know  the  weather tomorrow? Let’s use data on past weather. Want  to know yogurt sales next week? Let’s use data on past  yogurt sales. AIs are prediction machines driven by data. But does AI need your data?  There is a tendency  these  days  to  see  all  data  as  potentially  valuable  for  AI,  but  that  isn’t  really the case. Yes, data, like oil, is used day  to day to operate your prediction machine. But the data  you are sitting on now is likely not that data. Instead, the  data you have now, which your com pany accumulated  over time, is the type of data used to build the prediction  machine— not operate it.  74  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   74  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Is Your Com pany’s Data Actually Valuable in the AI Era?   The data you have now is training data. You use that  data as input to train an algorithm. And you use that al- gorithm to generate predictions to inform actions.  So, yes, that does mean your data is valuable. But it  does  not  mean  your  business  can  survive  the  storm.  Once  your  data  is  used  to  train  a  prediction  machine,  it is devalued. It is not useful anymore for that sort of  prediction. And  there are only so many predictions your  data  will be useful for. To continue the oil analogy, data  can be burned. It is somewhat lost  after use. Scientists  know this. They spend years collecting data, but once it  has produced research findings, it sits unused in a file  drawer or on a backup disk. Your business may be sit- ting on an oil well, but it’s finite. It  doesn’t guarantee you  more in the AI economy than perhaps a more favorable  liquidation value.  Even to the extent that your data could be valuable,  your ability to capture that value may be  limited. How  many other sources of comparable data exist? If you are  one  of  many  yogurt  vendors,  then  your  database  con- taining the past 10 years of yogurt sales and related data   price,  temperature,  sales  of  related  products  like  ice  cream   will have less market value than if you are the  only owner of that type of data. In other words, just as  with oil, the greater the number of other suppliers of your  type of data, the less value you can capture from your   75  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   75  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Agrawal, Gans, and Goldfarb  training data. The value of your training data is further  influenced by the value generated through enhanced pre- diction accuracy. Your training data is more valuable if  enhanced prediction accuracy can increase yogurt sales  by $100 million rather than only $10 million.  Moreover,  the  ongoing  value  of  data  usually  comes  from the actions you take in your day- to- day business—  the new data you accrue each day. New data allows you  to operate your prediction machine  after it is trained. It  also  enables  you  to  improve  your  prediction  machine  through  learning.  While  10  years  of  data  on  past  yo- gurt sales is valuable for training an AI model to pre- dict  future yogurt sales, the  actual predictions used to  manage the supply chain require operational data on an  ongoing basis. And this is the impor tant point for  today’s  incumbent companies.  An AI startup that acquires a trove of data on past yo- gurt sales can train an AI model to predict  future sales. It   can’t actually use its model to make decisions  unless the  startup obtains ongoing operational data to learn from.  Unlike  startups,  large  enterprises  generate  operational  data  every day. That’s an asset. The more operations, the  more data. Furthermore, the owner of the operation can  actually make use of the prediction. It can use the predic- tion to enhance its  future operation.  76  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   76  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Is Your Com pany’s Data Actually Valuable in the AI Era?   In the AI economy, the value of your accumulated  data is  limited to a onetime benefit from training your  AI model. And the value of training data is, like oil or  any  other  input,  influenced  by  the  overall  supply— it’s  less valuable when more  people have it. In contrast, the  value of your ongoing operational data is not  limited to  a onetime benefit, but rather provides a perpetual ben- efit for operating and further enhancing your prediction  machine.  So,  despite  all  the  talk  about  data  being  the  new oil, your accumulated historical data  isn’t the  thing.  However, it may be the  thing that gets you to the  thing. Its  value for your  future business prospects is low. But if you  can  find  ways  to  generate  a  new,  ongoing  data  stream  that delivers a per for mance advantage in terms of your  AI’s predictive power, that  will give you sustainable le- verage when AI arrives.  TAKEAWAYS    It is conventional wisdom that companies that are sitting  on troves of data enjoy  great advantages as they transi- tion to the AI- driven economy. But many leaders  don’t   77  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   77  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Agrawal, Gans, and Goldfarb   realize that the data they have is what they need to build  AI  systems, not to operate them and gain new insights  from them.  ✓  Even when your data is useful, your ability to   capture value from it may be  limited. If your com- petitors have compiled similar data sets, your data   won’t allow you to make predictions any better  than theirs  will.  ✓  Fully trained AI models must be fed ongoing op- erational data to make predictions that have busi- ness value. Large companies have an advantage   because they generate large sets of operational  data  every day.  ✓  Only companies that have both data to train their  AI models and ongoing data streams to make pre- dictions that have business value  will be able to  leverage AI for sustainable advantage.

It  will  create $13 trillion of GDP growth by 2030, according  to McKinsey, most of which  will be in non- internet sec- tors including manufacturing, agriculture, energy, logis- tics, and education. The rise of AI pre sents an opportunity  for executives in  every industry to differentiate and defend  their  businesses.  But  implementing  a  companywide  AI  strategy is challenging, especially for legacy enterprises.  My advice for executives, in any industry, is to start  small. The first step to building an AI strategy, drawn   79  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   79  6 22 19   7:33 AM   from  my  article  the  “AI  Transformation  Playbook,”  is  to choose one to two company- level pi lot AI proj ects.1   These proj ects  will help your com pany gain momentum  and gain firsthand knowledge of what it takes to build an  AI product.  Five Traits of a Strong AI Pi lot Proj ect  Tapping the power of AI technologies requires customi- zing them to your business context. The purpose of your  one or two pi lot proj ects is only partly to create value;  more importantly, the success of  these first proj ects  will  help convince stakeholders to invest in building up your  com pany’s AI capabilities.  When  you’re considering a pi lot AI proj ect, ask your-  self the following questions:  1. Does the proj ect give you a quick win?  Use your first AI pi lot proj ect to get the flywheel turning  as soon as pos si ble. Choose initial proj ects that can be  done quickly  ideally within 6 to 12 months  and have a  high chance of success. Instead of  doing only one pi lot   Ng  80  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   80  6 22 19   7:33 AM   How to Choose Your First AI Proj ect  proj ect, choose two to three to increase the odds of creat- ing at least one significant success.  2. Is the proj ect  either too trivial or too   unwieldy in size?  Your pi lot proj ect does not have to be the most valu- able AI application, as long as it delivers a quick win.  But it should be meaningful enough so that a success  convinces other com pany leaders to invest in further  AI proj ects.  In the early days of leading the Google Brain team,  I  faced  widespread  skepticism  within  Google  about  the potential of deep learning. Speech recognition was  much less impor tant to Google than web search and ad- vertising, so I had my team take on speech as our first  internal customer. By helping the speech team build a  much more accurate recognition system, we convinced  other teams to have faith in Google Brain. For our sec- ond proj ect, we worked with Google Maps to increase  data quality. Each successful proj ect increased the mo- mentum  in  the  flywheel,  and  Google  Brain  played  a  leading role in turning Google into the  great AI com- pany it is  today.  81  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   81  6 22 19   7:33 AM   3. Is your proj ect specific to your industry?  By  choosing  a  company- specific  proj ect,  your  internal  stakeholders can directly understand the value. For ex- ample, if you run a medical devices com pany, building an  AI + Recruiting proj ect to automatically screen résumés  is a bad idea for two reasons:  1   There’s a high chance  someone  else  will build an AI + Recruiting platform that  serves a much larger user base and  will outperform what  you could do in- house and or  will undercut you;  2  This  proj ect is less likely to convince the rest of your com pany  that AI is worth investing in than if your pi lot proj ect ap- plied AI to medical devices. It is more valuable to build a  health- care- specific AI system— anything ranging from  using AI to assist doctors with crafting treatment plans,  to  streamlining  the  hospital  check-in  pro cess  through  automation, to offering personalized health advice.  4. Are you accelerating your pi lot proj ect   with credible partners?  If you are still building up your AI team, consider working  with external partners to bring in AI expertise quickly.   Ng  82  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   82  6 22 19   7:33 AM   How to Choose Your First AI Proj ect  Eventually, you  will want to have your own in- house AI  team; however, waiting to build a team before executing  might be too slow relative to the pace of AI’s rise.  5. Is your proj ect creating value?  Most AI proj ects create AI value in one of three ways:  reducing costs  automation creates opportunities for cost  reduction in almost  every industry , increasing revenue   recommendation and prediction systems increase sales  and efficiency , or launching new lines of business  AI  enables new proj ects that  were not pos si ble before .  You  can  create  value  even  without  having  big  data,  which is often overhyped. Some businesses, such as web  search, have a long tail of queries, and so search engines  with more data do perform better. However, not all busi- nesses  have  this  amount  of  data,  and  it  may  be  pos si- ble to build a valuable AI system with perhaps as few as  100–1,000 data rec ords  though more does not hurt . Do  not choose proj ects just  because you have a lot of data in  industry X and believe the AI team  will figure out how to  turn this data into value. Proj ects like this tend to fail. It  is impor tant to develop a thesis upfront about how spe- cifically an AI system  will create value.  83  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   83  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Ng  84  Setting Up Your AI Proj ect for Success  So what do  these traits look like in practice?  AI is automation on ste roids. A rich source of ideas for  AI proj ects  will lie in automating tasks that  humans are   doing  today, using a technology called supervised learn- ing. You  will find that AI is good at automating tasks,  rather  than jobs.  Try  to  identify  the  specific  tasks  that   people are  doing and examine if any can be automated.  For example, the tasks involved in a radiologist’s job  may include reading X- rays, operating imaging machin- ery,  consulting  with  colleagues,  and  planning  surgery.  Rather than trying to automate their entire job, consider  if just one of the tasks could be automated or made faster  through partial automation.  Before executing on an AI pi lot, I recommend clearly  stating the desired timeline and outcome, and allocating  a reasonable bud get to the team.  Appoint a leader  Choose someone who can work cross- functionally and  bridge both AI and your industry’s domain experts. This   will ensure that when the proj ect succeeds, it  will influ-  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   84  6 22 19   7:33 AM   How to Choose Your First AI Proj ect  ence the rest of the organ ization. Their goal is not to build  an AI startup. Their goal is to build a successful proj ect  that  will influence the rest of the com pany’s beliefs and  state of knowledge about AI as a first step  toward building   future proj ects.  Conduct business value and technical diligence  Make  sure  that,  if  executed  successfully,  the  business  leaders agree that this proj ect  will create sufficient value  for the business. But also make sure that the proj ect is  feasible. Technical diligence can take a few weeks, re- quiring a technical team to examine what data you have  and perhaps even carry out small- scale experiments.  Build a small team  I have seen numerous pi lot ideas that  were executed with  about 5 to 15  people. The exact level of resources varies  wildly per proj ect, but scoping proj ects that can be done  with a small team ensures that every one can know every- one  else and work cross- functionally, and perhaps also  makes the allocation of resources more painless. While   there are some proj ects  today that require 100+  or even   85  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   85  6 22 19   7:33 AM   1,000+  engineers to do well, such a high level of resourc- ing is likely not necessary for your pi lot AI proj ect.  Communicate  When  the  pi lot  proj ect  hits  key  milestones,  and  espe- cially when it delivers a successful result, be sure to give  the  team  an  internal  platform— ranging  from  talks,  to  awards, to even external PR—to allow their work to be- come known inside the com pany. Making sure the proj ect  team is recognized by the CEO and is visibly successful   will be a key part to building momentum. If you have an  AI technology team working with a business team, make  sure also that the business team receives plenty of credit  and rewards for the success. This  will encourage other  business teams to jump into AI as well.  Having led Google Brain and Baidu’s AI Group, which   were respectively leading forces for turning Google and  Baidu into  great AI companies, I think most companies  can and should become good at AI. Your goal should not  be to compete with the leading internet companies, but  rather to master AI for your vertical industry sector. And  remember: The first step is to select the right pi lot proj- ects and execute on them.

Yampolskiy  W hen  you’re ready to incorporate artificial intelli-  gence technologies in your business, the analy sis  you should perform is this: What can possibly go  wrong? What is our product or ser vice expected to do?  What happens if it fails to do so? Do we have a damage  mitigation  plan?  Consider  the  embarrassing  situation  that Microsoft found itself in with its Tay chatbot fiasco,   89  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   89  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Yampolskiy  where internet trolls exploited vulnerabilities in the bot’s  code, feeding it racist, homophobic, and sexist content  that millions read on social media.  Accidents, including deadly ones, caused by software  or  industrial  robots  can  be  traced  to  the  early  days  of  such technology, but they are not necessarily caused by  the systems themselves. AI failures, on the other hand,  are directly related to the  mistakes produced by the in- telligence such systems are designed to exhibit. We can  broadly classify such failures into “ mistakes made during  the learning phase” and “ mistakes made during per for- mance phase.” A system can fail to learn what its design- ers want it to learn and might instead learn a diff er ent,  but correlated function.  A frequently cited example is a computer vision system  that the U.S. Army had hoped to use to automatically de- tect camouflaged  enemy tanks. The system was supposed  to classify pictures of tanks, but instead learned to distin- guish the backgrounds of such images. Other examples  include  prob lems  caused  by  poorly  designed  functions  that would reward AIs for only partially desirable be hav- iors, such as pausing a game to avoid losing, or repeatedly  touching a soccer ball to get credit for possession.  It can help to look at some recent examples of AI fail- ure to better understand what prob lems are likely to arise   90  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   90  6 22 19   7:33 AM   What  Will Happen When Your  Com pany’s Algorithms Go Wrong?  and what you can do to prevent them—or at least to clean  up quickly  after a failure. Consider  these examples of AI  failures from the past few years:1     An automated email-reply generator created    inappropriate responses, such as writing “I love  you” to a business colleague.     A robot for grabbing auto parts grabbed and killed   a man.  gorillas.     Image-tagging software classified black  people as      Medical AI classified patients with asthma as hav-  ing a lower risk of  dying of pneumonia.     Adult- content- filtering software failed to remove   inappropriate content, exposing  children to violent  and sexual content.     AI designed to predict recidivism acted racist.     An AI agent exploited a reward signal to win a   game without actually completing the game.     Video game NPCs  nonplayer characters, or any   character that is not controlled by a  human player   designed unauthorized superweapons.  91  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   91  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Yampolskiy     AI judged a beauty contest and rated dark- skinned   contestants lower.     A mall security robot collided with and injured a   child.     A self- driving car had a deadly accident.  And  every day, consumers experience more common  shortcomings of AI: Spam filters block impor tant emails,  GPS  provides  faulty  directions,  machine  translations  corrupt the meaning of phrases, autocorrect replaces a de- sired word with a wrong one, biometric systems misrecog- nize  people, transcription software fails to capture what is  being said; overall, it is harder to find examples of AIs that   don’t fail.  Analyzing the list of AI failures, we can arrive at a   simple generalization: An AI designed to do X  will even- tually fail to do X. While it may seem trivial, it is a power- ful  generalization  tool,  which  can  be  used  to  predict   future failures of AI. For example, looking at cutting- edge  current and  future AI, we can predict that:     AI doctors  will misdiagnose some patients in a way   a real doctor would not.     Video-description software  will misunderstand   movie plots.  92  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   92  6 22 19   7:33 AM   What  Will Happen When Your  Com pany’s Algorithms Go Wrong?     Software for generating jokes  will occasionally fail   to make them funny.     Sarcasm-detection software  will confuse sarcastic   and sincere statements.     Employee-screening software  will be systematically   biased and thus hire low performers.     The Mars robot explorer  will misjudge its environ-  ment and fall into a crater.     Tax-preparation software  will miss impor tant de-  ductions or make inappropriate ones.  What  should  you  learn  from   these  examples  and  analy sis? Failures  will happen! It’s inevitable. But we can  still put best practices in place, such as:     Controlling user input to the system and limiting   learning to verified data inputs     Checking for racial, gender, age, and other com-  mon biases in your algorithms     Explic itly analyzing how your software can fail,  and then providing a safety mechanism for each  pos si ble failure     Having a less “smart” backup product or ser vice   available  93  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   93  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Yampolskiy     Having a communications plan in place to ad-  dress the media in case of an embarrassing failure   Hint: Start with an apology.   I predict that both the frequency and seriousness of  AI failures  will steadily increase as AIs become more ca- pable. The failures of  today’s narrow domain AIs are just  the tip of the iceberg; once we develop general artificial  intelligence capable of cross- domain per for mance, em- barrassment  will be the least of our concerns.  TAKEAWAYS     There are countless examples of an AI designed for a task  eventually failing to do that task. As AI performs more  consequential  functions,  damage  caused  by  single  fail- ures  will become more severe.  ✓  When your business is ready to incorporate AI tech- nologies, perform this risk analy sis: What can pos- sibly go wrong with our AI? What is our product or  ser vice expected to do? What happens if it fails to do  so? Do we have a damage mitigation plan?  94  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   94  6 22 19   7:33 AM   What  Will Happen When Your  Com pany’s Algorithms Go Wrong?  ✓  To mitigate damage from AI failures, companies   should follow  these best practices:     Control user input into system and only use   verified data.     Check for racial, gender, age, and other com-  mon biases in algorithms.     Analyze how the software can fail, and then  provide a safety mechanism for each pos si ble  failure.     Have a less “smart” backup product or ser-  vice available.     Have a communications plan in place to ad- dress the media in case of an embarrassing  failure.  NOTE  1.

Here Are Five Schools of Thought  by Mark Knickrehm  T he  future of the workforce is one of the biggest is-  sues facing CEOs  today. It’s abundantly clear to all  that artificial intelligence, big data analytics, and ad- vanced robotics make it pos si ble for machines to take on  tasks that once required a person to do them. How should  companies prepare, strategically, to thrive in this world?  Views on what to expect vary dramatically. By some  accounts, almost half of all jobs in the U.S. economy could  be made obsolete.  Others have described how intelligent   99  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   99  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Knickrehm  machines  will actually create jobs— including entirely  new  categories  of  jobs.  Some   people  even  talk  about  a  world of superabundance where work  will be about pur- suing your passion, on your own terms.  It’s critical for companies to understand the range of  opinions on this issue,  because implicitly or explic itly, they   will influence the way business leaders create the work- force of the  future. And while a lot  will shake out in years  to come, this issue is already front and center. Companies  are making decisions  today that  will  matter hugely to their  ability to compete tomorrow and throughout the 2020s.  Most companies are already moving rapidly to acquire  new capabilities. In Accenture’s “Reworking the Revolu- tion” survey of 1,200 C- level executives worldwide, 75%  say that they are currently accelerating investments in AI  and other intelligent technologies. And 72% say they are  responding to a competitive imperative— they recognize  the need for new tools to keep up with rivals, both by  improving  productivity  and  by  finding  new  sources  of  growth.  Some  companies  are  transforming  themselves  into “intelligent enterprises,” in which all pro cesses are  digitized, decisions are data- driven, and machines do the  heavy lifting— both physical and cognitive.  The author thanks his colleagues in Accenture Research, Svenja Falk, David  Light, and Geoffrey Lewis, for their contributions to this article.  100  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   100  6 22 19   7:33 AM   How  Will AI Change Work?  So,  there’s a  great deal at stake in the debate over pro- ductivity and jobs. Leaders must understand the debate  and be prepared to address tough questions: What kind  of new skills do we need? How should we be or ga nized?  How do we define jobs? How can we bring our  people  along with us, in a way that benefits every one?  Through  research,   we’ve  identified  five  schools  of   thought in this debate.  The dystopians:   Man and machine  will wage a Darwinian  strug gle that machines  will win. AI systems  will take on  tasks at the heart of middle-  and high- skill jobs, while  robots  will perform menial work that requires low- skill   labor. The result  will be massive unemployment, falling  wages, and wrenching economic dislocation. Falling in- comes   will  have  grave  consequences  in  places  like  the  United States and Eu rope, where consumption accounts  for 56% or 69% of GDP, respectively, requiring new social  supports, such as a universal basic income.  The utopians:   Intelligent machines  will take on even more  work, but the result  will be unpre ce dented wealth, not  economic decline. AI and computing power  will advance  in  the  next  two  de cades  to  achieve  “the  singularity”—  when machines  will be able to emulate the workings of  the  human brain in its entirety.  Human brains  will be   101  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   101  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Knickrehm  scanned and downloaded to computers and billions of  replicated   human  brains   will  do  most  of  the  cognitive  work, while robots  will do all the heavy lifting. Economic  output could double  every three months. The singularity  may even lead to a world where  little  human  labor is re- quired, a universal income program covers basic needs,  and  people apply their talents to meaningful pursuits.  The  technology  optimists:   A  burst  of  productivity  has  al- ready begun but is not captured in official data  because  companies are still learning how intelligent technologies  can change how they operate. When companies do take  full advantage of intelligent technologies, a leap in pro- ductivity   will  produce  a  digital  bounty— creating  both  economic growth and improvements in living standards  not  counted  in  GDP,  such  as  consumer  surplus   from  better, cheaper products  and the value of  free apps and  information.  However,  based  on  current  trends,  the  bounty  won’t be distributed evenly, and many jobs  will  be displaced. To avoid negative income and employment  effects,  there  will be a need to invest in education and  training alongside investments in technology.  The productivity skeptics:   Despite  the  power  of  intelligent  technologies,  any  gains  in  national  productivity  levels   will be low. Combine that with headwinds from aging   102  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   102  6 22 19   7:33 AM   How  Will AI Change Work?  populations,  income  in equality,  and  the  costs  of  deal- ing with climate change, and the United States  will have  near- zero GDP growth. In the end,  there  isn’t much to do  except brace for stagnant growth in advanced economies.  The  optimistic  realists:   Digitization  and  intelligent  ma- chines can spur productivity gains that match previous  technology waves. Productivity  will advance rapidly in  certain sectors and for high- performing companies. New  jobs  will  be  created,  but  intelligent  technologies  may  exacerbate the trends of the recent past, in which de- mand  rose for both high-  and low- skill workers whose  jobs could be easily automated, while demand for middle-  skill workers fell. With no  simple solutions, more re- search  is  needed  into  the  true  relationship  between  productivity, employment, and wages to uncover effective  responses.  Three Actions for Shaping the  Future  Our crystal ball for what  things might look like in 10  years is cloudy. What we do know is that business leaders  must  take  steps  now  to  shape  their  workforces  for  the  emerging intelligent enterprise. Our research and experi- ence point to three critical imperatives.  103  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   103  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Knickrehm  Use technology to augment  human skills   and reinvent operating models  Companies  that  think  beyond   labor  substitution  and  cost savings  will see a much greater payoff. For example,  a new class of adaptive robots can function safely along- side workers and can take on difficult and tedious work.  Consider  this  example:  At  BMW’s  Spartanburg,  South  Carolina,  plant,  robots  are  installing  door- sealing  gas- kets, an awkward and tiring job for workers. This speeds  up  the  line,  improves  quality,  and  gives  workers  more  time to do higher- value work. Researchers estimate that  using adaptive robots this way could cut time wasted on  nonvalue- added  work  by  25%.  Employee  surveys  show  that workers have more positive views of the new robots,  which they regard as useful helpers. Away from the fac- tory,  companies  are  using  AI  to  offload  routine  work  from employees and to give them new analytical tools  to improve customer experience and discover new pos- sibilities for products, ser vices, and business models that  drive growth.  104  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   104  6 22 19   7:33 AM   How  Will AI Change Work?  Take the opportunity to redefine jobs and rethink  orga nizational design  Companies cannot optimize their investments if they  have the same old job descriptions and orga nizational  structures. Executives should assess the tasks that need  to be done, anticipate which ones  will be transferred to  machines, then reconfigure jobs by adding new tasks or  creating entirely diff er ent roles that are needed for man- aging  intelligent  technologies.  A  factory  worker,  for  ex- ample, can be trained to run robots. AI systems also need   human help to train and correct algorithms and override  fallible machine judgment. For example, at Stitch Fix, an  online clothing subscription ser vice, 3,400  human stylists  work with an AI recommendation engine to make person- alized suggestions for customers. The machines give styl- ists the speed they need to be productive, and the stylists  provide the additional judgment needed for accurate rec- ommendations  and fewer returns . To function effectively,  an intelligent enterprise should have a nonhierarchical  organ ization, in which employees collaborate across func- tional and operational silos. This enables the intelligent en- terprise to act quickly on the insights from data- crunching  machines and deploy  human talent to swarm on prob lems,  experiment, iterate, and get solutions into the market.  105  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   105  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Knickrehm  Make employees your partners in building the  intelligent enterprise  To strike the right balance between investing in intelligent  technologies and maintaining existing businesses, com- panies need help from their employees. In our  the pre- viously  referenced  Accenture  survey   research,  we  have  found that employees are far more willing— even  eager— to  master  new  technologies  than  employers  appreciate.  They want to learn new skills, not least  because they know  they  will need them to remain employed. Investments in  both technology and training  will help companies make  a smooth transition to the intelligent enterprise. Compa- nies that do this stand to outperform competitors  because  they  will unleash the  human talents that machines still   can’t match and that are essential to growth— creativity,  empathy,  communications,  adaptability,  and  prob lem  solving. “As basic automation and machine learning move   toward becoming commodities,” says Devin Fidler, re- search director at the Institute for the  Future, “uniquely   human skills  will become more valuable.”  The  debate  over  technology  and  jobs   will  rage  on.  Business leaders must follow this debate— and partici- pate in it, too. And much more research is needed to   106  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   106  6 22 19   7:33 AM   How  Will AI Change Work?  fully understand the implications of intelligent technolo- gies for work. In the meantime, companies that actively  seize control of what can be done to prepare  will position  themselves to thrive in this exciting new era.  TAKEAWAYS    Companies need to understand the varying opinions on  how AI  will change work and society,  because implicitly  or explic itly,  these beliefs  will influence the way they de- velop the workforce of the  future.  ✓  Five schools of thought are central to this debate:     Dystopians.

James Wilson and Paul Daugherty  A rtificial  intelligence  is  becoming  good  at  many   “ human” jobs— diagnosing disease, translating lan- guages,  providing  customer  service— and  it’s  im- proving fast. This is raising reasonable fears that AI  will  ultimately replace  human workers throughout the econ- omy. But that’s not the inevitable, or even most likely, out- come. Never before have digital tools been so responsive  to us, nor we to our tools. While AI  will radically alter  how work gets done and who does it, the technology’s   109  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   109  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Wilson and Daugherty  The Value of Collaboration Companies benefit from optimizing collaboration between   humans and artificial intelligence. Five princi ples can help  them do so: Reimagine business pro cesses; embrace ex- perimentation employee  involvement;  actively  direct  AI  strategy;  responsibly  collect  data;  and  redesign  work  to  incorporate AI and cultivate related employee skills. A sur- vey of 1,075 companies in 12 industries found that the more  of  these princi ples companies  adopted, the better their AI  initiatives performed in terms of speed, cost savings, rev- enues, or other operational mea sures  see the figure .  larger impact  will be in complementing and augmenting   human capabilities, not replacing them.  Certainly, many companies have used AI to automate  pro cesses,  but   those  that  deploy  it  mainly  to  displace  employees   will  see  only  short- term  productivity  gains.  In  our  research  involving  1,500  companies,  we  found  that firms achieve the most significant per for mance im- provements when  humans and machines work together.  Through such collaborative intelligence,  humans and AI  actively enhance each other’s complementary strengths:  the leadership, teamwork, creativity, and social skills of  the former, and the speed, scalability, and quantitative   110  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   110  6 22 19   7:33 AM      7x  6x  5x  4x  3x  2x  1x  t n e m e v o r p m  i   e c n a m r o f r e  0xP  Collaborative Intelligence                                       1  2  3  0 Number of human-machine collaboration principles adopted  O indicates the adoption of only basic, noncollaborative AI   4  5  capabilities of the latter. What comes naturally to  people   making a joke, for example  can be tricky for machines,  and what’s straightforward for machines  analyzing giga- bytes of data  remains virtually impossible for  humans.  Business requires both kinds of capabilities.  To take full advantage of this collaboration, companies  must understand how  humans can most effectively aug- ment machines, how machines can enhance what  humans  do best, and how to redesign business pro cesses to support  the partnership. Through our research and work in the field,  we have developed guidelines to help companies achieve  this and put the power of collaborative intelligence to work.  111  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   111  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Wilson and Daugherty   Humans Assisting Machines   Humans need to perform three crucial roles. They must  train  machines  to  perform  certain  tasks;  explain  the  outcomes of  those tasks, especially when the results are  counterintuitive or controversial; and sustain the respon- sible use of machines  by, for example, preventing robots  from harming  humans .  Training  Machine  learning  algorithms  must  be  taught  how  to  perform the work   they’re designed to do. In that effort,  huge  training  data  sets  are  amassed  to  teach  machine-  translation apps to  handle idiomatic expressions, medical  apps  to  detect  disease,  and  recommendation  engines  to  support financial decision making. In addition, AI systems  must be trained how best to interact with  humans. While  organ izations across sectors are now in the early stages of  filling trainer roles, leading tech companies and research  groups already have mature training staffs and expertise. Consider  Microsoft’s  AI  assistant,  Cortana.  The  bot  required extensive training to develop just the right per- sonality:  confident,  caring,  and  helpful  but  not  bossy.   112  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   112  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Collaborative Intelligence  Instilling  those qualities took countless hours of atten- tion by a team that included a poet, a novelist, and a  playwright. Similarly,  human trainers  were needed to  develop  the  personalities  of  Apple’s  Siri  and  Amazon’s  Alexa to ensure that they accurately reflected their com- panies’ brands. Siri, for example, has just a touch of sassi- ness, as consumers might expect from Apple.  AI  assistants  are  now  being  trained  to  display  even  more complex and subtle  human traits, such as sympa- thy. The startup Koko, an offshoot of the MIT Media Lab,  has  developed  technology  that  can  help  AI  assistants  seem to commiserate. For instance, if a user is having a  bad day, the Koko system  doesn’t reply with a canned re- sponse such as “I’m sorry to hear that.” Instead it may ask  for more information and then offer advice to help the  person see his issues in a diff er ent light. If he  were feeling  stressed, for instance, Koko might recommend thinking  of that tension as a positive emotion that could be chan- neled into action.  Explaining  As AIs increasingly reach conclusions through pro cesses  that are opaque  the so- called black- box prob lem , they  require   human  experts  in  the  field  to  explain  their   113  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   113  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Wilson and Daugherty   be hav ior to nonexpert users.  These “explainers” are par- ticularly impor tant in evidence- based industries, such as  law and medicine, where a practitioner needs to under- stand how an AI weighed inputs into, say, a sentencing  or  medical  recommendation.  Explainers  are  similarly  impor tant in helping insurers and law enforcement un- derstand why an autonomous car took actions that led to  an accident—or failed to avoid one. And explainers are  becoming  integral  in  regulated  industries— indeed,  in  any consumer- facing industry where a machine’s output  could be challenged as unfair, illegal, or just plain wrong.  For  instance,  the  Eu ro pean  Union’s  new  General  Data  Protection Regulation  GDPR  gives consumers the right  to receive an explanation for any algorithm- based deci- sion, such as the rate offer on a credit card or mortgage.  This  is  one  area  where  AI   will  contribute  to  increased  employment: Experts estimate that companies  will have  to create about 75,000 new jobs to administer the GDPR  requirements.  Sustaining  114  In  addition  to  having   people  who  can  explain  AI  out- comes,  companies  need  “sustainers”— employees  who  continually work to ensure that AI systems are function- ing properly, safely, and responsibly.  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   114  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Collaborative Intelligence  For example, an array of experts, sometimes referred  to as safety engineers, focuses on anticipating and try- ing to prevent harm by AIs. The developers of industrial  robots that work alongside  people have paid careful at- tention to ensuring that they recognize  humans nearby  and  don’t endanger them.  These experts may also review  analy sis  from  explainers  when  AIs  do  cause  harm,  as  when a self- driving car is involved in a fatal accident.  Other groups of sustainers make sure that AI systems  uphold  ethical  norms.  If  an  AI  system  for  credit  ap- proval, for example, is found to be discriminating against   people in certain groups  as has happened ,  these ethics  man ag ers are responsible for investigating and address- ing the prob lem. Playing a similar role, data compliance  officers  try  to  ensure  that  the  data  that  is  feeding  AI  systems complies with the GDPR and other consumer-  protection regulations. A related data- use role involves  ensuring that AIs manage information responsibly. Like  many tech companies, Apple uses AI to collect personal  details  about  users  as  they  engage  with  the  com pany’s  devices and software. The aim is to improve the user  experience, but unconstrained data gathering can com- promise privacy, anger customers, and run afoul of the  law. The com pany’s “differential privacy team” works to  make sure that while the AI seeks to learn as much as  pos si ble about a group of users in a statistical sense, it is  protecting the privacy of individual users.  115  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   115  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Wilson and Daugherty  Machines Assisting  Humans  Smart  machines  are  helping   humans  expand  their  abilities in three ways. They can amplify our cognitive  strengths; interact with customers and employees to  free  us for higher- level tasks; and embody  human skills to ex- tend our physical capabilities.  Amplifying  Artificial intelligence can boost our analytic and decision- making  abilities  by  providing  the  right  information  at  the right time. But it can also heighten creativity. Con- sider  how  Autodesk’s  Dreamcatcher  AI  enhances  the  imagination of even exceptional designers. A designer  provides Dreamcatcher with criteria about the desired  product— for example, a chair able to support up to 300  pounds, with a seat 18 inches off the ground, made of  materials costing less than $75, and so on. She can also  supply information about other chairs that she finds at- tractive. Dreamcatcher then churns out thousands of de- signs that match  those criteria, often sparking ideas that  the designer might not have initially considered. She can  then guide the software, telling it which chairs she likes  or  doesn’t, leading to a new round of designs.  116  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   116  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Collaborative Intelligence  Throughout the iterative pro cess, Dreamcatcher per- forms  the  myriad  calculations  needed  to  ensure  that  each proposed design meets the specified criteria. This   frees the designer to concentrate on deploying uniquely   human  strengths:  professional  judgment  and  aesthetic  sensibilities.  Interacting  Human- machine  collaboration  enables  companies  to  in- teract  with  employees  and  customers  in  novel,  more  ef- fective  ways.  AI  agents  like  Cortana,  for  example,  can  facilitate communications between  people or on behalf of   people, such as by transcribing a meeting and distributing  a  voice- searchable  version  to   those  who   couldn’t  attend.  Such applications are inherently scalable— a single chatbot,  for instance, can provide routine customer ser vice to large  numbers of  people si mul ta neously, wherever they may be. SEB, a major Swedish bank, now uses a virtual assis- tant called Aida to interact with millions of customers.  Able  to   handle  natural- language  conversations,  Aida  has access to vast stores of data and can answer many  frequently asked questions, such as how to open an ac- count or make cross- border payments. She can also ask  callers follow-up questions to solve their prob lems, and  she’s able to analyze a caller’s tone of voice  frustrated versus   117  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   117  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Wilson and Daugherty  appreciative,  for  instance   and  use  that  information  to  provide better ser vice  later. Whenever the system  can’t  resolve an issue— which happens in about 30% of cases—it  turns the caller over to a  human customer- service rep- resentative and then monitors that interaction to learn  how to resolve similar prob lems in the  future. With Aida   handling basic requests,  human reps can concentrate  on  addressing  more- complex  issues,  especially   those  from unhappy callers who might require extra hand-   holding.  Embodying  Many  AIs,  like  Aida  and  Cortana,  exist  principally  as  digital entities, but in other applications the intelligence  is embodied in a robot that augments a  human worker.  With their sophisticated sensors, motors, and actuators,  AI- enabled  machines  can  now  recognize   people  and  objects and work safely alongside  humans in factories,  ware houses, and laboratories.  In  manufacturing,  for  example,  robots  are  evolving  from potentially dangerous and “dumb” industrial ma- chines into smart, context- aware “cobots.” A cobot arm  might, for example,  handle repetitive actions that require  heavy  lifting,  while  a  person  performs  complementary   118  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   118  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Collaborative Intelligence  tasks that require dexterity and  human judgment, such  as assembling a gear motor.  Hyundai is extending the cobot concept with exoskel- etons.  These wearable robotic devices, which adapt to  the user and location in real time,  will enable industrial  workers to perform their jobs with superhuman endur- ance and strength.  Reimagining Your Business  In order to get the most value from AI, operations need  to be redesigned. To do this, companies must first dis- cover and describe an operational area that can be im- proved. It might be a balky internal pro cess  such as HR’s  slowness to fill staff positions , or it could be a previously  intractable prob lem that can now be addressed using AI   such as quickly identifying adverse drug reactions across  patient populations . Moreover, a number of new AI and  advanced analytic techniques can help surface previously  invisible prob lems that are amenable to AI solutions.  Next,  companies  must  develop  a  solution  through  co-  creation— having  stakeholders  envision  how  they  might  collaborate with AI systems to improve a pro cess. Consider  the case of a large agricultural com pany that wanted to de- ploy AI technology to help farmers. An enormous amount   119  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   119  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Wilson and Daugherty  Revealing Invisible Prob lems Former U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld once fa- mously distinguished among “known knowns,” “known un- knowns,” and “unknown unknowns”— things  you’re not even  aware you  don’t know. Some companies are now using AI  to uncover unknown unknowns in their businesses. Case in  point: GNS Healthcare applies machine learning software  to  find  overlooked  relationships  among  data  in  patients’  health rec ords and elsewhere.  After identifying a relation- ship,  the  software  churns  out  numerous  hypotheses  to  explain it and then suggests which of  those are the most  likely. This approach enabled GNS to uncover a new drug  interaction hidden in unstructured patient notes. CEO Colin  Hill points out that this is not garden- variety data mining  to find associations. “Our machine learning platform is not  just  about  seeing  patterns  and  correlations  in  data,”  he  says. “It’s about actually discovering causal links.”  of data was available about soil properties, weather patterns,  historical harvests, and so forth, and the initial plan was to  build an AI application that would more accurately predict   future crop yields. But in discussions with farmers, the com- pany learned of a more pressing need. What farmers  really   120  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   120  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Collaborative Intelligence  wanted was a system that could provide real- time recom- mendations on how to increase productivity— which crops  to plant, where to grow them, how much nitrogen to use in  the soil, and so on. The com pany developed an AI system to  provide such advice, and the initial outcomes  were promis- ing; farmers  were happy about the crop yields obtained with  the AI’s guidance. Results from that initial test  were then  fed back into the system to refine the algorithms used. As  with the discovery step, new AI and analytic techniques can  assist in co- creation by suggesting novel approaches to im- proving pro cesses.  The third step for companies is to scale and then sus- tain the proposed solution. SEB, for example, originally  deployed  a  version  of  Aida  internally  to  assist  15,000  bank employees but thereafter rolled out the chatbot to  its one million customers.  Through our work with hundreds of companies, we  have identified five characteristics of business pro cesses  that  companies  typically  want  to  improve:  flexibility,  speed, scale, decision making, and personalization. When  reimagining a business pro cess, determine which of  these  characteristics is central to the desired transformation,  how intelligent collaboration could be harnessed to ad- dress it, and what alignments and trade- offs with other  pro cess characteristics  will be necessary.  121  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   121  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Wilson and Daugherty  Flexibility  For Mercedes- Benz executives, inflexible pro cesses pre- sented a growing challenge. Increasingly, the com pany’s  most  profitable  customers  had  been  demanding  indi- vidualized  S- class  sedans,  but  the  automaker’s  assem- bly  systems   couldn’t  deliver  the  customization   people  wanted.  Traditionally, car manufacturing has been a rigid pro- cess with automated steps executed by “dumb” robots.  To improve flexibility, Mercedes replaced some of  those  robots  with  AI- enabled  cobots  and  redesigned  its  pro- cesses  around  human- machine  collaborations.  At  the  com pany’s  plant  near  Stuttgart,  Germany,  cobot  arms  guided by  human workers pick up and place heavy parts,  becoming an extension of the worker’s body. This system  puts the worker in control of the building of each car,   doing less manual  labor and more of a “pi loting” job with  the robot.  The com pany’s human- machine teams can adapt on  the  fly.  In  the  plant,  the  cobots  can  be  reprogrammed  easily  with  a  tablet,  allowing  them  to   handle  diff er ent  tasks depending on changes in the workflow. Such agility  has enabled the manufacturer to achieve unpre ce dented  levels  of  customization.  Mercedes  can  individualize   122  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   122  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Collaborative Intelligence  vehicle  production  according  to  the  real- time  choices  consumers  make  at  dealerships,  changing  every thing  from a vehicle’s dashboard components to the seat leather  to the tire valve caps. As a result, no two cars rolling off  the assembly line at the Stuttgart plant are the same.  Speed  For some business activities, the premium is on speed.  One such operation is the detection of credit- card fraud.  Companies have just seconds to determine  whether they  should  approve  a  given  transaction.  If  it’s  fraudulent,  they  will most likely have to eat that loss. But if they deny  a legitimate transaction, they lose the fee from that pur- chase and anger the customer.  Like most major banks, HSBC has developed an AI-  based solution that improves the speed and accuracy of  fraud detection. The AI monitors and scores millions of  transactions daily, using data on purchase location and  customer  be hav ior,  IP  addresses,  and  other  informa- tion to identify subtle patterns that signal pos si ble fraud.  HSBC first implemented the system in the United States,  significantly reducing the rate of undetected fraud and  false positives, and then rolled it out in the United King- dom and Asia.

AI helps analyze any type of  software proj ect, no  matter  the size or complexity,   enabling  humans to quickly  estimate the work required,  or ga nize experts, and adapt  workflows in real time. AI screens credit-  and  debit- card transactions to  instantly approve legitimate  ones while flagging ques- tionable ones for  humans to  evaluate. AI aggregates patient data  from disparate IT systems,  speeding collaboration  among specialists.

The reduction in the num- ber  of  false  positives   frees  investigators  to  concentrate  their efforts on equivocal transactions the AI has flagged,  where  human judgment is needed.  The fight against financial fraud is like an arms race:  Better detection leads to more- devious criminals, which  leads to better detection, which continues the cycle. Thus,  the algorithms and scoring models for combating fraud  have a very short shelf life and require continual up- dating. In addition, diff er ent countries and regions use  diff er ent models. For  these reasons, legions of data ana- lysts, IT professionals, and experts in financial fraud are  needed at the interface between  humans and machines  to keep the software a step ahead of the criminals.  For many business pro cesses, poor scalability is the pri- mary obstacle to improvement. That’s particularly true  of pro cesses that depend on intensive  human  labor with  minimal  machine  assistance.  Consider,  for  instance,  the employee recruitment pro cess at Unilever. The con- sumer goods  giant was looking for a way to diversify  its  170,000- person  workforce.  HR  determined  that  it   Scale  126  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   126  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Collaborative Intelligence  needed to focus on entry- level hires and then fast- track  the  best  into  management.  But  the  com pany’s  existing  pro cesses  weren’t able to evaluate potential recruits in suf- ficient numbers— while giving each applicant individual  attention—to ensure a diverse population of exceptional  talent.   Here’s how Unilever combined  human and AI capabili- ties to scale individualized hiring: In the first round of  the application pro cess, candidates are asked to play online  games that help assess traits such as risk aversion.  These  games have no right or wrong answers, but they help Uni- lever’s AI figure out which individuals might be best suited  for a par tic u lar position. In the next round, applicants are  asked to submit a video in which they answer questions de- signed for the specific position  they’re interested in. Their  responses are analyzed by an AI system that considers not  just what they say but also their body language and tone.  The best candidates from that round, as judged by the AI,  are then invited to Unilever for in- person interviews,  after  which  humans make the final hiring decisions.  It’s too early to tell  whether the new recruiting pro cess  has resulted in better employees. The com pany has been  closely tracking the success of  those hires, but more data  is still needed. It is clear, however, that the new system  has greatly broadened the scale of Unilever’s recruiting.  In part  because job seekers can easily access the system   127  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   127  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Wilson and Daugherty  by  smartphone,  the  number  of  applicants  doubled  to  30,000 within a year, the number of universities repre- sented surged from 840 to 2,600, and the socioeconomic  diversity of new hires increased. Furthermore, the aver- age time from application to hiring decision has dropped  from four months to just four weeks, while the time that  recruiters spend reviewing applications has fallen by 75%.  Decision making  By providing employees with tailored information and  guidance, AI can help them reach better decisions. This  can  be  especially  valuable  for  workers  in  the  trenches,  where making the right call can have a huge impact on  the bottom line.  Consider the way in which equipment maintenance is  being improved with the use of “digital twins”— virtual  models  of  physical  equipment.  General  Electric  builds  such software models of its turbines and other industrial  products and continually updates them with operating  data streaming from the equipment. By collecting read- ings from large numbers of machines in the field, GE has  amassed a wealth of information on normal and aber- rant  per for mance.  Its  Predix  application,  which  uses   128  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   128  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Collaborative Intelligence  machine learning algorithms, can now predict when a  specific part in an individual machine might fail.  This  technology  has  fundamentally  changed  the  decision- intensive  pro cess  of  maintaining  industrial  equipment.  Predix  might,  for  example,  identify  some  unexpected rotor wear and tear in a turbine, check the  turbine’s operational history, report that the damage has  increased fourfold over the past few months, and warn  that if nothing is done, the rotor  will lose an estimated  70% of its useful life. The system can then suggest ap- propriate  actions,  taking  into  account  the  machine’s  current condition, the operating environment, and ag- gregated data about similar damage and repairs to other  machines. Along with its recommendations, Predix can  generate information about their costs and financial ben- efits and provide a confidence level  say, 95%  for the as- sumptions used in its analy sis.  Without Predix, workers would be lucky to catch the  rotor damage on a routine maintenance check. It’s pos si- ble that it would go undetected  until the rotor failed, re- sulting in a costly shutdown. With Predix, maintenance  workers are alerted to potential prob lems before they be- come serious, and they have the needed information at  their fingertips to make good decisions— ones that can  sometimes save GE millions of dollars.  129  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   129  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Wilson and Daugherty  Personalization  Providing  customers  with  individually  tailored  brand  experiences is the holy grail of marketing. With AI, such  personalization  can  now  be  achieved  with  previously  unimaginable precision and at vast scale. Think of the  way the  music streaming ser vice Pandora uses AI algo- rithms to generate personalized play lists for each of its  millions of users according to their preferences in songs,  artists, and genres. Or consider Starbucks, which, with  customers’ permission, uses AI to recognize their mobile  devices and call up their ordering history to help baris- tas make serving recommendations. The AI technology  does what it does best, sifting through and pro cessing  copious amounts of data to recommend certain offerings  or actions, and  humans do what they do best, exercising  their intuition and judgment to make a recommendation  or select the best fit from a set of choices.  The Carnival Corporation is applying AI to personalize  the cruise experience for millions of vacationers through  a  wearable  device  called  the  Ocean  Medallion  and  a  network that allows smart devices to connect. Machine  learning dynamically pro cesses the data flowing from the  medallion  and  from  sensors  and  systems  throughout  the ship to help guests get the most out of their vacations.   130  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   130  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Collaborative Intelligence  The medallion streamlines the boarding and debarking  pro cesses, tracks the guests’ activities, simplifies purchas- ing  by  connecting  their  credit  cards  to  the  device,  and  acts as a room key. It also connects to a system that antici- pates guests’ preferences, helping crew members deliver  personalized ser vice to each guest by suggesting tailored  itineraries of activities and dining experiences.  The Need for New Roles and Talent  Reimagining a business pro cess involves more than the  implementation of AI technology; it also requires a sig- nificant commitment to developing employees with what  we call “fusion skills”— those that enable them to work ef- fectively at the human- machine interface. To start,  people  must  learn  to  delegate  tasks  to  the  new  technology,  as  when physicians trust computers to help read X- rays and  MRIs. Employees should also know how to combine their  distinctive  human skills with  those of a smart machine to  get a better outcome than  either could achieve alone, as  in robot- assisted surgery. Workers must be able to teach  intelligent agents new skills and undergo training to work  well  within  AI- enhanced  pro cesses.  For  example,  they  must know how best to put questions to an AI agent to get  the information they need. And  there must be employees,   131  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   131  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Wilson and Daugherty  like  those on Apple’s differential privacy team, who en- sure that their companies’ AI systems are used responsi- bly and not for illegal or unethical purposes.  We  expect  that  in  the   future,  com pany  roles   will  be  redesigned around the desired outcomes of re imagined  pro cesses,  and  corporations   will  increasingly  be  or ga- nized around diff er ent types of skills rather than around  rigid job titles. AT&T has already begun that transition as  it shifts from landline telephone ser vices to mobile net- works and starts to retrain 100,000 employees for new po- sitions. As part of that effort, the com pany has completely  overhauled its orga nizational chart: Approximately 2,000  job  titles  have  been  streamlined  into  a  much  smaller  number of broad categories encompassing similar skills.  Some of  those skills are what one might expect  for ex- ample, proficiency in data science and data wrangling ,  while  others are less obvious  for instance, the ability to  use  simple machine learning tools to cross- sell ser vices .  Most activities at the human- machine interface require   people to do new and diff er ent  things  such as train a chat- bot  and to do  things differently  use that chatbot to pro- vide better customer ser vice . So far, however, only a small   Conclusion  132  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   132  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Collaborative Intelligence  number of the companies  we’ve surveyed have begun to  reimagine their business pro cesses to optimize collabora- tive intelligence. But the lesson is clear: Organ izations  that use machines merely to displace workers through  automation  will miss the full potential of AI. Such a strat- egy is misguided from the get-go. Tomorrow’s leaders  will  instead be  those that embrace collaborative intelligence,  transforming their operations, their markets, their indus- tries, and—no less impor tant— their workforces.  TAKEAWAYS    AI is having the most significant impact— and compa- nies are seeing the biggest per for mance gains— when it  augments  human workers instead of replacing them. To  take full advantage, companies must understand how   humans and machines can work together, and how to  redesign business pro cesses to support the partnership.  ✓   Humans need to perform three crucial roles  to help augment machines: train machines to  perform certain tasks, explain the outcomes of   those tasks, and sustain the responsible use of  machines.  133  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   133  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Wilson and Daugherty  ✓  Smart machines are helping  humans enhance   their abilities by amplifying our cognitive  strengths; interacting with customers and employ- ees to  free us for higher- level tasks; and embodying   human skills to extend our physical capabilities.  ✓  Companies should reimagine their business pro- cesses, focusing on using AI to achieve more op- erational flexibility or speed, greater scale, better  decision making, or increased personalization of  products and ser vices. Determine which charac- teristic is central to the desired transformation,  how to harness intelligent collaboration to address  it, and what alignments and trade- offs with other  pro cess characteristics  will be necessary.

A combination  of facial analy sis, voice pattern analy sis, and deep learning   137  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   137  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Kleber  can already decode  human emotions for market research  and po liti cal polling purposes. With companies like Af- fectiva, Beyond Verbal, and Sensay providing plug- and-  play sentiment analy sis software, the affective computing  market is estimated to grow to $41 billion by 2022, as  firms like Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Apple race to  decode their users’ emotions.  Emotional inputs  will create a shift from data- driven  IQ- heavy  interactions  to  deep  EQ- guided  experiences,  giving brands the opportunity to connect to custom- ers on a much deeper, more personal level. But reading   people’s emotions is a delicate business. Emotions are  highly personal, and users  will have concerns about pri- vacy invasion and manipulation. Before companies dive  in, leaders should consider questions like:  1.  What are you offering? Does your value proposi-  tion naturally lend itself to the involvement of  emotions? And can you credibly justify the inclu- sion of emotional clues for the betterment of the  user experience?  2.  What are your customers’ emotional intentions  when interacting with your brand? What is the   nature of the interaction?  3.  Has the user given you explicit permission to ana- lyze their emotions? Does the user stay in control   138  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   138  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Three Ways AI Is Getting More Emotional  of their data, and can they revoke their permission  at any given time?  4.  Is your system smart enough to accurately read   and react to a user’s emotions?  5.  What is the danger in any given situation if the  system should fail— danger for the user, and or  danger for the brand?  Keeping   those  concerns  in  mind,  business  leaders  should be aware of current applications for emotional AI.   These fall roughly into three categories.  Systems that use emotional    analy sis to adjust their response  In  this  application,  the  AI  ser vice  acknowledges  emo- tions and  factors them into its decision- making pro cess.  However, the ser vice’s output is completely emotion- free. Conversational interactive voice responses  IVRs  and  chatbots promise to route customers to the right ser vice  flow faster and more accurately when factoring in emotions.  For example, when the system detects a user to be angry, it  routs the user to a diff er ent escalation flow or to a  human. AutoEmotive, Affectiva’s Automotive AI, and Ford are  racing  to  get  emotional  car  software  market- ready  to   139  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   139  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Kleber   detect  human emotions such as anger or lack of atten- tion, and then take over control or stop the vehicle, pre- venting accidents or acts of road rage.  The  security  sector  also  dabbles  in  emotional  AI  to  detect stressed or angry  people. The British government,  for instance, monitors its citizens’ sentiments on certain  topics over social media.  In this category, emotions play a part in the machine’s  decision- making pro cess. However, the machine still re- acts like a machine— essentially, as a  giant switchboard  routing  people in the right direction.  Systems that provide a targeted emotional  analy sis for learning purposes  In 2009, Philips teamed up with a Dutch bank to develop  the idea of a “rationalizer” bracelet to stop traders from  making  irrational  decisions  by  monitoring  their  stress  levels, which it mea sures by monitoring the wearer’s pulse.  Making  traders  aware  of  their  heightened  emotional  states  made  them  pause  and  think  before  making  im- pulse decisions.  Brain Power’s smart glasses help  people with autism  better understand emotions and social cues. The wearer  of this Google Glass– type device sees and hears special   140  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   140  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Three Ways AI Is Getting More Emotional  feedback geared to the situation— for example, coaching  on facial expressions of emotions, when to look at  people,  and even feedback on the user’s own emotional state.   These targeted emotional analy sis systems acknowledge  and interpret emotions. The insights are communicated to  the user for learning purposes. On a personal level,  these  targeted applications  will act like a Fitbit for the heart and  mind,  aiding  in  mindfulness,  self- awareness,  and  ulti- mately self- improvement, while maintaining a machine-  person relationship that keeps the user in charge.  Targeted  emotional  learning  systems  are  also  being  tested for group settings, such as by analyzing the emo- tions of students for teachers, or workers for man ag ers.  Scaling to group settings can have an Orwellian feeling:  Concerns  about  privacy,  creativity,  and  individuality  have  these experiments playing on the edge of ethical  ac cep tance.  More  importantly,  adequate  psychological  training for the  people in power is required to interpret  the emotional results and to make adequate adjustments.  Systems that mimic and ultimately  replace human- to- human interactions  When smart speakers entered the American living room  in 2014, we started to get used to hearing computers refer   141  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   141  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Kleber  to themselves as “I.” Call it a  human error or an evolu- tionary shortcut, but when machines talk,  people assume  relationships.   There are now products and ser vices that use conver- sational user interfaces and the concept of “computers as  social actors” to try to alleviate mental- health concerns.   These  applications  aim  to  coach  users  through  crises  using  techniques  from  behavioral  therapy.  Ellie  helps  treat  soldiers  with  PTSD.  Karim  helps  Syrian  refugees  overcome trauma. Digital assistants are even tasked with  helping alleviate loneliness among the el der ly.  Casual  applications  like  Microsoft’s  XiaoIce,  Google  Assistant, or Amazon’s Alexa use social and emotional  cues for a less altruistic purpose— their aim is to secure  users’ loyalty by acting like new AI BFFs. Futurist Rich- ard van Hooijdonk quips: “If a marketer can get you to  cry, he can get you to buy.”  The discussion around addictive technology is starting  to examine the intentions  behind voice assistants. What  does it mean for users if personal assistants are hooked up  to advertisers? In a leaked Facebook memo, for example,  the social media com pany boasted to advertisers that it  could detect, and subsequently target, teens’ feelings of  “worthlessness” and “insecurity,” among other emotions. Judith Masthoff of the University of Aberdeen says, “I  would like  people to have their own guardian angel that   142  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   142  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Three Ways AI Is Getting More Emotional  could  support  them  emotionally  throughout  the  day.”  But in order to get to that ideal, a series of  collectively  agreed upon  experiments  will need to guide designers  and brands  toward the appropriate level of intimacy, and  a series of failures  will determine the rules for maintain- ing trust, privacy, and emotional bound aries.  The biggest hurdle to finding the right balance might  not be achieving more effective forms of emotional AI  but  finding  emotionally  intelligent   humans  to  build  them.  TAKEAWAYS    AI   will  soon  recognize,  interpret,  pro cess,  and  sim- ulate   human  emotions.  Users  whose  emotions  are   analyzed  will have concerns about privacy invasion and  manipulation.  ✓  Before companies dive into emotional AI, leaders  should consider questions ranging from  whether  the value proposition lends itself to involving emo- tions, to  whether customers have given permission  to analyze their emotions, to what the dangers are  if the system fails.  143  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   143  6 22 19   7:33 AM   ✓  Keeping  those concerns in mind, leaders should   be aware of the three categories of current applica- tions for emotional AI:     Systems that use emotional analy sis to adjust   their response     Systems that provide a targeted emotional   analy sis for learning purposes     Systems that mimic and ultimately replace   human- to- human interactions  ✓  Companies that navigate  these challenges effec- tively  will shift from data- driven IQ- heavy inter- actions to deep EQ- guided experiences, giving  brands the opportunity to connect to customers  on deeper, more personal levels.  1.

That’s the single most   common question the three of us are asked by cor- porate executives, and it’s not trivial to answer. AI  is fundamentally a prediction technology. As advances  in AI make prediction cheaper, economic theory dictates  that  we’ll use prediction more frequently and widely, and  the  value  of  complements  to  prediction— like   human  judgment— will  rise.  But  what  does  all  this  mean  for  strategy?  145  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   145  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Agrawal, Gans, and Goldfarb   Here’s a thought experiment  we’ve been using to an- swer that question. Most  people are familiar with shop- ping at Amazon. As with most online retailers, you visit  its website, shop for items, place them in your basket, pay  for them, and then Amazon ships them to you. Right now,  Amazon’s business model is shopping- then- shipping.  Most  shoppers  have  noticed  Amazon’s  recommen- dation engine while they shop—it offers suggestions of  items that its AI predicts you  will want to buy. At pre- sent, Amazon’s AI does a reasonable job, considering the  millions of items on offer. However, it is far from perfect.  In our case, the AI accurately predicts what we want to  buy about 5% of the time. In other words, we actually  purchase about 1 out of  every 20 items it recommends.  Not bad!  Now for the thought experiment. Imagine the Ama- zon AI collects more information about us: In addition  to our searching and purchasing be hav ior on its website,  it also collects other data it finds online, including social  media, as well as offline, such as our shopping be hav ior  at Whole Foods. It knows not only what we buy, but also  what time we go to the store, which location we shop at,  how we pay, and more.  The ideas  here are adapted from our book Prediction Machines: The  Simple  Economics of Artificial Intelligence  Harvard Business Review Press, 2018 .  146  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   146  6 22 19   7:33 AM   How AI  Will Change Strategy  Now, imagine the AI uses that data to improve its pre- dictions. We think of this sort of improvement as akin  to turning up the volume knob on a speaker dial. But  rather than volume,  you’re turning up the AI’s predic- tion accuracy. What happens to Amazon’s strategy as its  data scientists, engineers, and machine learning experts  work tirelessly to dial up the accuracy on the prediction  machine?  At some point, as they turn the knob, the AI’s predic- tion accuracy crosses a threshold, such that it becomes  in Amazon’s interest to change its business model. The  prediction becomes sufficiently accurate that it becomes  more profitable for Amazon to ship you the goods that it  predicts you  will want rather than wait for you to order  them.  Every week, Amazon ships you boxes of items it  predicts you  will want, and then you shop in the com- fort and con ve nience of your own home by choosing the  items you wish to keep from the boxes it delivered.  This approach offers two benefits to Amazon. First, the  con ve nience  of  predictive  shipping  makes  it  much  less  likely that you purchase the items from a competing re- tailer, as the products are con ve niently delivered to your  home before you buy them elsewhere. Second, predictive  shipping nudges you to buy items that you  were consid- ering purchasing but might not have gotten around to.  In  both  cases,  Amazon  gains  a  higher  share- of- wallet.   147  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   147  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Agrawal, Gans, and Goldfarb  Turning the prediction dial up far enough changes Am- azon’s  business  model  from  shopping- then- shipping  to  shipping- then- shopping.  Of course, shoppers would not want to deal with the  hassle  of  returning  all  the  items  they   don’t  want.  So,  Amazon would invest in infrastructure for the product  returns— perhaps a fleet of delivery- style trucks that do  pickups once a week, con ve niently collecting items that  customers  don’t want.  If  this  is  a  better  business  model,  then  why   hasn’t  Amazon done it already? Well, it may be working on it.  But if it implemented the model  today, the cost of col- lecting and  handling returned items would outweigh the  increase in revenue from a greater share- of- wallet. For  example,  today we would return 95% of the items it ships  to us. That is annoying for us and costly for Amazon. The  prediction  isn’t good enough for Amazon to adopt the  new model.  That said, one can imagine a scenario where Amazon  adopts the new strategy even before the prediction accu- racy is good enough to make it profitable  because the  com pany anticipates that at some point it  will be profit- able. By launching sooner, Amazon’s AI  will get more  data  sooner,  and  improve  faster.  Amazon  realizes  that  the sooner it gets started, the harder it  will be for com- petitors to catch up. Better predictions  will attract more   148  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   148  6 22 19   7:33 AM   How AI  Will Change Strategy  shoppers, more shoppers  will generate more data to train  the AI, more data  will lead to better predictions, and so  on, creating a virtuous circle. In other words,  there are  increasing returns to AI, and thus the timing of adopting  this kind of strategy  matters. Adopting too early could be  costly but adopting too late could be fatal.  The  key  insight   here  is  that  turning  the  dial  on  the  prediction machine has a significant impact on strategy.  In this example, it shifts Amazon’s business model from  shopping- then- shipping to shipping- then- shopping, gen- erates the incentive to vertically integrate into operating  a  product- returns  ser vice   including  a  fleet  of  trucks ,  and  accelerates  the  timing  of  investment  due  to  first-  mover advantage from increasing returns. All this is due  to the single act of turning the dial on the prediction  machine.  Most  readers   will  be  familiar  with  the  outcome  of  companies  like  Blockbuster  and  Borders  that  underes- timated how quickly the online consumer be hav ior dial  would  turn  in  the  context  of  online  shopping  and  the  digital distribution of goods and ser vices. Perhaps they   were lulled into complacency by the initially slow adop- tion rate of this technology in the early days of the com- mercial internet  1995–1998 .   Today, in the case of AI, some companies are making  early bets anticipating that the dial on the prediction   149  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   149  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Agrawal, Gans, and Goldfarb  machine  will start turning faster once it gains momen- tum. Most  people are familiar with Google’s 2014 acqui- sition of DeepMind— over $500 million for a com pany  that had generated negligible revenue, but had developed  an AI that learned to play certain Atari games at a su- perhuman per for mance level. Perhaps fewer readers are  aware  that  more  traditional  companies  are  also  mak- ing bets on the pace at which the dial  will turn. In 2016,  GM  paid  over  $1  billion  to  acquire  AI  startup  Cruise  Automation, and in 2017, Ford invested $1 billion in AI  startup Argo AI, and John Deere paid over $300 million  to acquire AI startup Blue River Technology— all three  startups had generated negligible revenue relative to the  price at the time of purchase. GM, Ford, and John Deere  are each betting on an exponential speedup of AI per- for mance and, at  those prices, anticipating a significant  impact on their business strategies.  Strategists face two challenges in light of all of this.  First,  they  must  invest  in  developing  a  better  under- standing of how fast and how far the dial on their predic- tion machines  will turn for their sector and applications.  Second,  they  must  invest  in  developing  a  thesis  about  the strategy options created by the shifting economics of  their business that result from turning the dial, similar to  the thought experiment we considered for Amazon.  150  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   150  6 22 19   7:33 AM   How AI  Will Change Strategy  So, what is the overarching theme for initiating an AI  strategy? Close your eyes, imagine putting your fin gers  on the dial of your prediction machine, and, in the im- mortal words of Spinal Tap, turn it to eleven.  TAKEAWAYS    AI  will make prediction cheaper, faster, and more accu- rate. When the accuracy of predictions passes a certain  threshold, it  will have a profound impact on strategy.  ✓  Strategists must first invest in determining how   fast and how much better predictions  will become  for their sectors and applications. Then they must  try to imagine what new strategic options  these  predictions  will create.  ✓  Better predictions  will enable novel business   models that  will reshape the strategic playing field  in many industries. Industrywide business model  reinvention would bring with it strategic concerns  such as seizing first- mover advantage and invest- ing in diff er ent kinds of capabilities.  151  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   151  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Agrawal, Gans, and Goldfarb  ✓  For example, an online retailer like Amazon   could implement a prediction- based “ship- then-  shop” model in which it delivers products to cus- tomers before they have selected them. Amazon  might begin executing this model before it is  profitable to be the first mover, and it might invest  further in shipping and logistics infrastructure in  order to accommodate the increase in customer  returns such a model would generate.

James Wilson, Paul Daugherty, and Chase Davenport  C ompanies considering how to invest in AI capabili-  ties  should  first  understand  that  over  the  coming  five  years  applications  and  machines   will  become  less artificial and more intelligent. They  will rely less on  bottom-up  big  data  and  more  on  top- down  reasoning  that more closely resembles the way  humans approach  prob lems and tasks. This general reasoning ability  will  enable AI to be more broadly applied than ever, creating   153  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   153  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Wilson, Daugherty, and Davenport  opportunities for early adopters even in businesses and  activities to which it previously seemed unsuited.  In the recent past, AI advanced through deep learn- ing and machine learning, building up systems from the  bottom by training them on mountains of data. For in- stance, driverless vehicles are trained on as many traffic  situations as pos si ble. But  these data- hungry neural net- works, as they are called, have serious limitations. They  especially have trou ble  handling “edge” cases— situations  where  little data exists. A driverless car that can  handle  crosswalks,  pedestrians,  and  traffic  has  trou ble  pro- cessing anomalies like  children dressed in unusual Hal- loween costumes, weaving across the street  after dusk.  Many systems are also easily stumped. The iPhone X’s  facial  recognition  system   doesn’t  recognize  “morning   faces”— a user’s puffy, haggard look on first awakening.  Neural networks have beaten chess champions and tri- umphed at the ancient Japa nese game of Go but turn an  image upside down or slightly alter it and the network  may misidentify it. Or it may provide “high confidence”  identifications of unrecognizable objects.  Data- hungry  systems  also  face  business  and  ethical  constraints. Not  every com pany has the volume of data  necessary to build unique capabilities using neural net- works. Using huge amounts of citizens’ data also raises  privacy issues likely to lead to more government action   154  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   154  6 22 19   7:33 AM   The  Future of AI  Will Be About Less Data, Not More  like the Eu ro pean Union’s General Data Protection Reg- ulation  GDPR , which imposes stringent requirements  on the use of individuals’ personal data. Further,  these  systems are black boxes— it’s not clear how they use input  data to arrive at outputs like actions or decisions. This  leaves them open to manipulation by bad actors  like the  Rus sians in the 2016 U.S. presidential election , and when  something  goes  embarrassingly  wrong,  organ izations  are hard put to explain why.  In  the   future,  however,  we   will  have  top- down  sys- tems that  don’t require as much data and are faster, more  flexible, and, like  humans, more innately intelligent. A  number of companies and organ izations are already put- ting  these more natu ral systems to work. To craft a vi- sion of where AI is heading in the next several years, and  then plan investments and tests accordingly, companies  should look for developments in four areas.  More-Efficient Robot Reasoning  When  robots  have  a  conceptual  understanding  of  the  world, as  humans do, it is easier to teach them  things,  using far less data. Vicarious, a Union City, California,  startup  whose  investors  include  Mark  Zuckerberg,  Jeff  Bezos, and Marc Benioff, is working to develop artificial   155  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   155  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Wilson, Daugherty, and Davenport  general intelligence for robots, enabling them to general- ize from few examples.  Consider  those  jumbles of letters and numerals that  websites use to determine  whether  you’re a  human or a  robot. Called CAPTCHAs  Completely Automated Pub- lic  Turing  tests  to  tell  Computers  and   Humans  Apart ,  they are easy for  humans to solve and hard for computers.  Drawing on computational neuroscience, researchers at  Vicarious have developed a model that can break through  CAPTCHAs at a far higher rate than deep neural net- works and with 300- fold more data efficiency. To parse  CAPTCHAs with almost 67% accuracy, the Vicarious  model required only five training examples per charac- ter, while a state- of- the- art deep neural network required  a  50,000- fold  larger  training  set  of   actual  CAPTCHA  strings. Such models, with their ability to train faster  and generalize more broadly than AI approaches com- monly used  today, are putting us on a path  toward robots  that have a human- like conceptual understanding of the  world.

Siemens is using top- down AI to control the highly com- plex combustion pro cess in gas turbines, where air and  gas flow into a chamber, ignite, and burn at temperatures  as  high  as  1,600  degrees  Celsius.  The  volume  of  emis- sions created and ultimately how long the turbine  will  continue to operate depend on the interplay of numerous   factors, from the quality of the gas to air flow and inter- nal and external temperature.  Using bottom-up machine learning methods, the gas  turbine would have to run for a  century before produc- ing  enough  data  to  begin  training.  Instead,  Siemens  researchers Volar Sterzing and Steffen Udluft used meth- ods that required  little data in the learning phase for the  machines.  The  monitoring  system  that  resulted  makes  fine adjustments that optimize how the turbines run in  terms of emissions and wear, continuously seeking the  best solution in real time, much like an expert knowl- edgeably twirling multiple knobs in concert.  Common Sense  A  variety  of  organ izations  are  working  to  teach  ma- chines to navigate the world using common sense—to   157  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   157  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Wilson, Daugherty, and Davenport  understand  everyday  objects  and  actions,  communi- cate naturally,  handle unforeseen situations, and learn  from experiences. But what comes naturally to  humans,  without explicit training or data, is fiendishly difficult  for machines. Says Oren Etzioni, the CEO of the Allen  Institute for Artificial Intelligence  AI2 , “No AI system  currently deployed can reliably answer a broad range of   simple questions, such as, ‘If I put my socks in a drawer,   will they still be in  there tomorrow?’ or ‘How can you  tell if a milk carton is full?’ ”  To help define what it means for machines to have com- mon sense, AI2 is developing a portfolio of tasks against  which  pro gress  can  be  mea sured.  DARPA  is  investing  $2 billion in AI research. In its Machine Common Sense   MCS   program,  researchers   will  create  models  that  mimic core domains of  human cognition, including “the  domains of objects  intuitive physics , places  spatial nav- igation , and agents  intentional actors .” Researchers at  Microsoft and McGill University have jointly developed  a  system  that  has  shown   great  promise  for  untangling  ambiguities in natu ral language, a prob lem that requires  diverse forms of inference and knowledge.  158  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   158  6 22 19   7:33 AM   The  Future of AI  Will Be About Less Data, Not More  Making Better Bets   Humans  routinely,  and  often  effortlessly,  sort  through  probabilities  and  act  on  the  likeliest,  even  with  rela- tively   little  prior  experience.  Machines  are  now  being  taught to mimic such reasoning through the application  of  Gaussian  processes— probabilistic  models  that  can  deal with extensive uncertainty, act on sparse data, and  learn from experience. Alphabet, Google’s parent com- pany, launched Proj ect Loon, designed to provide inter- net ser vice to underserved regions of the world through  a system of  giant balloons hovering in the stratosphere.  Their navigational systems employ Gaussian pro cesses to  predict where in the stratified and highly variable winds  aloft  the  balloons  need  to  go.  The  balloons  then  move  into a layer of wind blowing in the right direction, ar- ranging  themselves  to  form  one  large  communication  network. The balloons can not only make reasonably ac- curate predictions by analyzing past flight data but also  analyze data during a flight and adjust their predictions  accordingly.  Such  Gaussian  pro cesses  hold   great  promise.  They   don’t require massive amounts of data to recognize pat- terns; the computations required for inference and learn- ing are relativity easy, and if something goes wrong, its   159  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   159  6 22 19   7:33 AM   Wilson, Daugherty, and Davenport  cause  can  be  traced,  unlike  the  black  boxes  of  neural  networks.  Though all of  these advances are relatively recent, they  hark back to the very beginnings of AI in the 1950s, when  a number of researchers began to pursue top- down mod- els  for  mimicking   human  intelligence.  But  when  pro- gress proved elusive and the rich potential for  bottom-up  machine  learning  methods  became  apparent,  the  top-  down approach was largely abandoned.  Today, however,  through power ful new research and computational tech- niques, top- down AI has been reborn. As its  great prom- ise begins to be fulfilled, smart companies  will put their  money where the mind is.  TAKEAWAYS    As AI develops, it  will rely less on bottom-up big data  and more on top- down reasoning that resembles the way   humans approach prob lems and tasks. This  will enable  us to apply AI more broadly than ever, creating opportu- nities for early adopters even in businesses and activities  to which AI previously seemed unsuited.  160  054-80639_ch01_4P.indd   160  6 22 19   7:33 AM   The  Future of AI  Will Be About Less Data, Not More  ✓   Until recently, most AI advanced through deep  learning and machine learning, building up sys- tems by training them on mountains of data. But   these data- hungry networks have serious limita- tions and difficulty  handling situations where  little  data exists.  ✓  To craft a vision of where AI is heading in the next   several years, and plan investments and tests ac- cordingly, companies should look for the follow- ing developments:     More-efficient robot reasoning. When machines   have a conceptual understanding of the  world, as  humans do, it is easier to teach  them using far less data.     Ready expertise.
