in Pasadena, California. Nonscriptum consults for educational and  scientific users in the areas of 3D printing and maker technologies. Joan  and Rich find ways to use maker tech to teach science and math in a  hands-on way, and want to make scientific research cheaper and more  accessible to the public.  This book is their seventh collaboration for Apress. They teach online   classes in 3D printing and maker tech for LERN Network’s U Got Class  continuing education program. They have also authored online courses  for LinkedInLearning Lynda.com. Links for all of the above are on their  website, www.nonscriptum.com.  In addition to her work with Rich, Joan also  has an appointment as adjunct faculty for  National University’s College of Letters and  Sciences. She has taught at the university level  in a variety of institutions, both in Southern  California and online. Before she and Rich  started Nonscriptum, she held a variety of  entrepreneurial positions, including VP of  business development at a Kickstarter-funded  3D-printer company.  xv   abouT The auThors abouT The auThors  Joan started her career with 16 years at the NASA Caltech Jet Propulsion   Laboratory, where she worked in programs including the technology  transfer office, the Magellan spacecraft to Venus, and the TOPEX Poseidon  oceanography spacecraft. She holds an undergraduate degree from MIT  in aeronautics and astronautics and a master’s degree in engineering from  UCLA.  Rich  known online as “Whosawhatsis”   is an experienced open source developer  who has been a key member of the RepRap  3D-printer development community for  many years. His designs include the original  spring lever extruder mechanism used on  many 3D printers, the RepRap Wallace, and  the Deezmaker Bukito portable 3D printer.  By building and modifying several of the  early open source 3D printers to wrestle  unprecedented performance out of them, he   has become an expert at maximizing the print quality of filament-based  printers. When he’s not busy making every aspect of his own 3D printers  better, from slicing software to firmware and hardware, he likes to share  that knowledge and experience online so that he can help make everyone  else’s printers better too.  xvi   Acknowledgments  The consumer 3D-printing ecosystem would not exist in its current form  without the open source 3D-printing hardware and software community.  The maker community as a whole has also been very supportive. We  appreciate how much we learn by looking at projects made by everyone at  maker events large and small.  The Apress production team was there for us to solve problems as they   arose and let us have great creative freedom otherwise. We dealt most  directly with Natalie Pao, Jessica Vakili, Corbin Collins, and Welmoed  Spahr, but we also appreciate the many we did not see. This book includes  some materials from our other Apress 3D-printing titles, notably the 2014  Mastering 3D Printing and the 2016 and 2017 3D Printed Science Projects  books.  We talked to many 3D-printing professionals and maker-educators to  develop this book and we are grateful for the advice, images, and in some  cases permission to use screenshots or photographs of their work, which  is credited in more detail in the text. On the 3D-printing side of the family,  we want to particularly call out Steve Wygant of SeeMeCNC; Shelley Sun  and Russell Singer of MAKEiT, Inc.; Mara Hitner and Dave Gaylord at  MatterHackers; Diego Porqueras of Deezmaker; Marius Kintel and the  other OpenSCAD developers; the teams at Ultimaker and Formlabs; and  Thatcher Chamberlain, Metalnat Hayes, Giovanni Salinas, and David  Shorey.  Educators  and their students  who particularly inspired us were   Simon Huss, Regina Rubio, Tri Nguyen, Karalyn Ramon, and others at the  Windward School; Dori Friedman and Paul Way of Crossroads School;  Omeed Shahhosseini and Will Kalman, Granada Hills Charter High   xvii   aCknowledgmenTs aCknowledgmenTs  School, and maker-educators John Umekubo, Lucie deLaBruere, and  Rodney Batschelet. We were inspired to create 3D-printable educational  models for visually impaired students by discussions with people in the  community of teachers of the visually impaired, notably Mike Cheverie,  Lore Schindler, Yue-Ting Siu, and Jim Allan. We have spoken to quite a  few librarians to understand their issues and are particularly grateful to  Vivienne Bird, Los Angeles Public Library, and Michael Pierce and his  colleagues at the Pasadena Public Library.  Finally, we are grateful to our families for putting up with our endless  brainstorming and test runs of explanations, particularly Joan’s husband  Stephen Unwin, Rich’s sister, Rachel Cameron, and Diamond the Wonder  Puppy.  xviii   Introduction  It has only been four years since the original 2014 Mastering 3D Printing  went to press. In the intervening years, the field has exploded so much  that we are to focusing this book on the needs of the educational and  scientific markets. Printers have dropped in price down to a few hundred  dollars for a basic model and a few thousand for a fairly sophisticated  one. Yet adoption has been remarkably slow in education, and we hope  to change that.  This book focuses on consumer-level printers and their applications  in the educational and scientific environments. We focus primarily on 3D  printers that create objects by melting plastic filament, but also include a  little about printers that use liquid resin.  3D printing can be defined pretty simply: creating an object by  building it up layer by layer, rather than machining it away the way  you would by making something from a block of wood, or by squirting  something into a mold as you would for injection-molded plastic parts. Its  flexibility and the sheer magic of seeing something built from nothing have  captured people’s imaginations, and it is clear that surprising applications  will continue to pop up for years to come.  This book is intended for several audiences. It is meant to be a self-   contained tutorial on consumer 3D printers and the open source software  that runs them, particularly for educators who are trying to set up or run  a school makerspace or librarians who are trying to figure out what to do  about a mandate to buy printers or create a community space.  Although we say the book is for “classroom, library, and lab,” a   broader audience will find the core information helpful. If you are not  an educator and want to focus on the 3D printing per se, Chapters 1–6   xix   InTroduCTIon InTroduCTIon  apply to anyone’s use of consumer-level printers; Chapter 8 gives a lot  of information on post-processing prints to make them look good; and  Chapter 9 discusses making prints as strong as possible. The examples in  the other chapters, although primarily classroom oriented, may inspire  you for your projects as well.  This book also is intended to be used as a text for a semester-length   class or university extension course series covering 3D printing, its  applications, and its place in education. It might be paired with an in-  depth class on 3D computer-aided design  CAD  software for students  interested in teaching engineering and industrial or product design.  Similarly, it might be paired with instruction in one of the sculptural  3D-modeling programs for students developing skills in 3D animation or  fine art.  Part I  Chapters 1–3  of the book gives background on the history of  3D printers, talks about how the hardware and software work, discusses  available materials, and gives some detail of the 3D-printing workflow.  Part II  Chapters 4–6  reviews how to decide what kind of printer you  need to buy, based on what you want to build with it and what materials  you think you will want to be able to use. This part also reviews what  kinds of facilities different 3D printers require, and the hands-on details of  dealing with issues that might arise during a print. Finally, this part reviews  options you can use to create 3D-printable model files.  Part III  Chapters 7–12  discusses the classroom use of 3D printing in  different subject disciplines, with a particular focus on K–12. We start off  with a brief introduction to common issues in classroom 3D printing, and  then look at art and theater concerns, considering print post-processing  topics like gluing, sanding, and painting, as well as a bit about casting  jewlery. We also consider engineering concerns, like making a print strong  enough for a functional job. Next, we take up using printers in language  arts and social studies, and in the elementary school environment.  Finally, we talk about how 3D prints might help special-needs students,  particularly the visually impaired.  xx   InTroduCTIon InTroduCTIon  Finally, in Part IV  Chapters 13 and 14 , we discuss university and  community uses of 3D printing and how to think about careers in 3D  printing in the near and long term. Chapter 13 focuses on research into  both applications of 3D printing and technology development for 3D  printers per se. Chapter 14 winds up the book with a discussion of the  opportunities and challenges for teaching entrepreneurship, and tries to  predict where the manufacturing and other applications of the technology  are likely to be in the near and longer term.  We also include an appendix, in which we have gathered all the links  from the book, plus a few news sources that cover the 3D printing world  and some books that might provide other places to explore.  Librarians will likely find Chapters 1–6 and 13–14 the most useful,   although the materials in Chapters 7–12 may suggest community projects.  The field is still evolving. As in the 2014 Mastering 3D Printing, we  have avoided detailed descriptions of software packages. We stick with  descriptions that will let you get started but will not be wrong three months  after publication. We like to say that 3D printing is about as complex as  cooking. In cooking terms, you will find that this book has a bias away from  providing recipes to follow exactly and instead leans toward teaching you  how to cook using your own judgement for the long haul.  If you are just starting your exploration of the field, welcome. Hopefully   this book will be a good guide for you, and you will finish it ready to take  on challenges and try to help build this new frontier along with us.  xxi   PART I  3D Printing: State of  the Art  In Part I  Chapters 1–3  we introduce you to 3D printing and discuss why  you may want to use a 3D printer instead of other digital manufacturing  tools, like laser cutters or computer numerically controlled  CNC  milling  machines. We cover the basics of printer technologies. These days, which  materials you want to use and what types of things you want to build will  drive your choice of printer, and we detail the issues in Chapter 2. Finally,  in Chapter 3 we introduce you to the overall workflow of 3D printing and  discuss the details of using “slicing” programs to create 3D-printable files.   CHAPTER 1  Why Use a   3D Printer?  In the last five years, 3D printing has gone from a technology hyped  as capable of solving any problem to one of disillusionment as people  realized it took more expertise than some advertisements implied. Now  machines are getting both easier to use and more powerful, and there is  a creative explosion in both printer technology and applications. But we  are still not quite at the point of clicking Print without any thought on the  user’s part.  In this book, we attempt to give you a clear-eyed view of the state of   the art in 3D printing: what you can do, what you might be able to do soon,  and what you really do not want to do, at least not yet. This chapter focuses  on when you want to use a 3D printer, and, perhaps more importantly,  when you do not. The most fundamental question is: when do you want to  use a 3D printer in the first place?   Subtractive vs. Additive 3D printers create objects one layer at a time. The way they do that—by  extruding melted plastic, by sintering materials, by hardening resin with  UV light—can vary. But the basic premise is the same: a layer of material  is created, controlled by a digital design stored in a computer, followed     Joan Horvath, Rich Cameron 2018  J. Horvath and R. Cameron, Mastering 3D Printing in the Classroom, Library, and Lab,   https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-3501-0_1  3   Chapter 1    Why Use a 3D printer?   by another layer, and so on until the object appears, seemingly by magic.  The key distinction from most other means of manufacturing is that 3D  printing is additive—material is not cut away, but is added to a piece as it is  built  Figure 1-1 .  Figure 1-1.  A 3D printed part in progress  Consumer-level 3D printers are very simple robots. We often say that   they are, more or less, computerized hot glue guns  using a somewhat  different plastic, though .  3D printing is a form of additive manufacturing, which starts with   nothing and builds up parts by laying up material on some sort of build  platform. A lot of conventional manufacturing is subtractive, meaning that  you start with a block of material  like metal or wood  and start cutting  away material until you have the part you want plus a pile of sawdust or  metal shavings.  3D printers require that you have a 3D computer model of your object  in an appropriate format. A photo or other 2D image is not enough—you  need to have data that is stored as a full 3D model of the object. We talk  about this in depth in Chapter 6.  Although Tinkercad and other software  discussed in Chapter 6 can “extrude” an image to make a “2.5D” raised  version of a drawing.   4   Chapter 1    Why Use a 3D printer?    Nature’s 3D Printers 3D printing seems like an advanced technology, but many organisms  and natural processes have been doing the equivalent for eons. Many  rock formations in the southwestern United States were laid down when  ancient oceans built up layers of silt. The resulting sandstone has since  been carved away by wind, rain, and plant roots. Figure 1-2, taken in Zion  National Park in Utah, is an example of the current state of processes that  build up material a layer at a time and then erode some of it away. This is  a mix of an additive process  like 3D printing , followed by a subtractive  process  like conventional manufacturing .  Figure 1-2.  Sandstone layering  Zion National Park, Utah   5   Chapter 1    Why Use a 3D printer?   When people watch a natural process, they are often inspired to create   a fabrication process that will work the same way. Some types of additive  manufacturing have been around for a long time. A very simple example is  the humble brick wall. A brick wall is built up one brick at a time, with the  addition of a bit of mortar, based on either a formal plan drawn out by an  architect or engineer, or perhaps just built out of a contractor’s head if the job  is routine enough. All the steps you will see in 3D printing are there in building  a brick wall: designing a desired end product, planning out how to arrange the  layers so that the structure will not fall down while it is being built, and then  executing the product one layer at a time. 3D printers add the elements of  robotic control to this process of building an object up a layer at a time.   History of Robotic 3D Printing Charles W.  Chuck  Hull is generally credited with developing the first  working robotic 3D printer in 1984, which was commercialized by 3D  Systems in 1989. These machines were systems that used a laser to harden  liquid resin, and many machines still use this technology. Other early work  was taking place at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  MIT  and  the University of Texas.  Meanwhile, S. Scott Crump and Lisa Crump patented fused deposition   modeling  FDM  in 1989 and cofounded printer manufacturer Stratasys,  Ltd. This technology  more generically called FFF, for fused filament  fabrication  feeds a plastic filament into a heated extruder and then  precisely lays down the material. When key patents expired in 2005,  this technology became the basis of the RepRap movement. This book  mostly focuses on this type of printer, but we go on some forays into resin  stereolithography  SLA  printers as well.  A flurry of patents followed in the early 1990s for various powder- based  systems. These systems use inkjets to deposit a binder very precisely on the  surface of a bed of powder to create layers on a downward-moving platform.  By adding ink to these binders, this process can make full-color prints.   6   Chapter 1    Why Use a 3D printer?   These inkjet 3D-printing patents became the basis for Z Corp, another early  printer company that created large industrial printers. Z Corp is now part of  3D Systems. Other powder-based printing technologies manufactured by 3D  Systems and others use a laser to fuse powdered plastic or metal together in a  process called selective laser sintering  SLS .   The RepRap Movement When some of the key patents expired on the FFF printing method, it  occurred to Adrian Bowyer, a senior lecturer in mechanical engineering at the  University of Bath in the United Kingdom, that it might be possible to build a  filament-extruding 3D printer that could create the parts for more 3D printers   except for readily available electronic and hardware-store components .  Furthermore, Bowyer decided he would put the designs for the parts   for his 3D printer out on the Internet, making them available to anyone  and encouraging others to improve them—with the requirement that  anyone who improved it had to post their versions with the same terms   called an open source license . He called this concept the RepRap project  and obtained some initial funding from the UK’s Engineering and Physical  Sciences Research Council.  Bowyer’s team called their first printer Darwin  released in March   2007  and the next one, Mendel  released in 2009—for more details, see  http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki RepRap_Project . The printers were  named after famous evolutionary biologists because they wanted people  to replicate the printers and evolve them as they did so. Files to make  the plastic parts were posted online, freely available with alterations and  improvements encouraged. Necessary metal parts were ideally available  at hardware stores or could be made in a garage. More exotic metal parts,  like gears to grip filament and nozzles to push it through, became available  for online purchase pretty early on from entrepreneurial printer builders  with access to machine tools to make them. Stepper motors and some of  the electronic components needed to drive them were already available   7   Chapter 1    Why Use a 3D printer?   online, but became much cheaper and easier to find as the 3D printer  market increased the demand for them.  The early printers were difficult to put together and to get to print well.  In the Czech Republic in 2010, Josef Prusa released a design now called the  Prusa Mendel. It simplified the original Mendel design, and after that there  was an acceleration in printer designs as people tried out the open source  designs, modified them, and posted their own. Prusa Research is now one  of the larger consumer 3D-printer companies, still based in the Czech  Republic. You can look at a “family tree” of this period at http:  reprap. org wiki RepRap_Family_Tree.  After a while there was a transition from making files for printer parts   downloadable to making whole printer kits available for purchase. One  of the better-known kits was the Makerbot Cupcake CNC, which started  shipping in April 2009. It was superseded by the Makerbot Thing-O-Matic  in 2010. These were mostly made of lasercut wooden parts with some  3D-printed parts  plus of course motors and electronics . Eventually,  Makerbot became one of the earlier commercial consumer printer  companies, and was purchased by Stratasys in 2013.   Crowdfunding and Makers What really caused a blossoming of different designs, though, was the  availability of funding for hardware projects through crowdfunding— websites that allow entrepreneurs to put out early-stage products and take  contributions from the public to fund development and early production.  Because the key patents had run out, entrepreneurs typically did not  have any type of proprietary technology, which made traditional startup  funding difficult to obtain.  By 2009, 3D-printer developers split into two main camps: those  supplying large, industrial printers  typically with some proprietary  technology  and a big informal network of people working on open source  RepRap or similar filament-based consumer printers.  8   Chapter 1    Why Use a 3D printer?   On April 28, 2009, the Kickstarter crowdfunding platform launched    www.kickstarter.com . Kickstarter is one of many crowdfunding  platforms that allow an entrepreneur to post a project and ask people to  support the endeavor. Various crowdfunding platforms have different  rules about which types of projects are acceptable, and open source 3D  printers are a very good fit for crowdfunding because most crowdfunding  sites require a clearly defined project. Developing a 3D printer is a project  with a natural endpoint, and often the developer seeking funding offers a  printer as the reward for those who support the development.  In 2012, the Form 1 stereolithography printer raised nearly three   million dollars on Kickstarter. Many other 3D printers have raised in the six  figures on Kickstarter and other platforms.  Figure 1-3 shows two RepRap heritage printers. Rich designed the 2011   RepRap Wallace  a proof-of-concept machine, never sold commercially   and was a key team member in the design of the 2013 Deezmaker Bukito,  which was launched on Kickstarter.  Figure 1-3.  The 2011 Wallace and 2013 Bukito  9   Chapter 1    Why Use a 3D printer?   At the same time that open source hardware was becoming common,   open source or free software also began to stabilize and become useful  to a non-expert consumer. Software to design models of 3D printers and  to prepare them for printing made great strides around this time. Today,  some printers come with proprietary software, but printers that support  generic protocols can use free or open source software end-to-end to  create models and print them.  It is quite stunning to look at Figure 1-3 and see how rapidly open   source printer design matured in a little over two years. Of course,  innovation does not stop. In the intervening years, many 3D-printer  companies have been started, and many have gone out of business or  been acquired. This tumult is typical of a new industry and probably will  continue for a while. In Chapters 4 and 5, we talk about how to select a  printer for your needs and how to set up a good workflow. For the most  part, we have tried to avoid naming brand names because the industry is  still changing rapidly.  The pace of development in the field is very rapid; new methodologies  are being invented both by commercial companies and by academics, and  it can be a real challenge to keep up with it all and distinguish between a  new capability and a dubious idea. The reach of consumer-level printers  has expanded beyond maker hobbyists to more commercial applications.  We discuss the opportunities and limitations in later chapters.   A Word About Kits Up until about 2013 or so, most consumer 3D printers required at least  some assembly. It was worth mentioning in marketing materials if  the assembly did not require soldering, since kits in those days often  consisted of bags of wires, screws, and small parts. Currently, kits  usually require minimal assembly, typically involving tightening a few  screws and plugging some keyed and labeled electrical connectors in  to the appropriate ports. The cost can be a lot lower than buying a fully   10   Chapter 1    Why Use a 3D printer?   assembled printer, since printers often have a few pieces that will fit well in  a small package when disassembled, leading to lower shipping costs.  Obviously, though, if you are not comfortable with doing some   assembly and calibration, you are likely to be happier with a fully  assembled printer. However, even minimal assembly teaches you  something about how the machine works, making you more likely to know  how to fix something that goes wrong later.   When to Use a 3D Printer 3D printing is a very versatile technology, but there are times when  other technologies are preferable. For example, laser cutters and small  computer-numerically controlled  CNC  machines may be more  appropriate tools in some circumstances. And sometimes you can just use  a piece of cardboard and an X-acto knife to make something too.  We can do a comparison of the three common forms of digital   manufacturing, machines that make something based on a computer  file that gives the machine commands resulting in a physical part. Laser  cutters work from a 2D file, and 3D printers and CNC machines from  different types of 2D and 3D files, although there are similarities. All three  have come down in price, although 3D printers probably have made the  biggest strides there. The “maker movement,” a renewed interest in making  physical things, has created a market for these machines, which has  bubbled up into professional applications.  For details on 3D printer options, see Chapter 2 for different types   of printer. Chapter 4 discusses criteria to use when buying one based on  what you want to do. There are a few major drawbacks to a 3D printer in a  school environment. First, prints take a long time. A 12-hour or even multi-  day print is not uncommon. Second, either you can buy an expensive  machine with expensive proprietary raw materials, or you can learn how  to use more generic systems with some trial and error. The cost difference  can be a factor of 10 or 20, so this is a tricky thing to trade off.  11   Chapter 1    Why Use a 3D printer?   Caution  Be wary of marketing metaphors to paper printers.    We address 3D printer resolution in Chapter 4.  a recent trend  we have seen are advertisements for “all in one” 3D printer,  scanners, CnC machines, and even laser cutters, sometimes  with interchangeable heads. since the tools have such different  requirements to run optimally, we are dubious about this. if your  budget is limited, buy just one tool now  we would vote for a 3D  printer  and consider branching out in the future.   Laser Cutting vs. 3D Printing Laser cutters use a laser to burn through material. The bigger the laser,  the tougher the material they can cut through. The key word here is burn.  Because laser cutters are basically vaporizing a thin line of raw material,  you have to exercise a lot of care that something unfortunate is not cut. For  example, plastics with some chlorine content  like PVC  will emit chlorine  gas when cut with a laser cutter. At best, this destroys the machine; at  worst, it injures the operator.  Therefore, a laser cutter in a school environment needs very strict  protocols to make sure that only things that can be cut safely are ever  placed in the machine. A fire extinguisher  along with training on how  to use it  is critical too, because sometimes a cut line will catch fire in  the machine. Fires are caused by failing to cool the surrounding material  and deprive it of the fuel oxygen mixture required to sustain a fire—for  example, by letting the air nozzle get blocked. For that reason, laser cutters  need to always have someone watching so that any fire does not get out of  hand. Laser cutters need to either be vented to the outside or used with a  specialized air filter.  12   Chapter 1    Why Use a 3D printer?   Having said all that, laser cutters are a lot faster than other digital   fabrication for anything that is essentially a thick 2D slab. So, if you have  pieces that can be slotted together, or if something is a flat cutout  like a  stencil , then laser cutters are great. Most consumer-level ones can cut  paper, acrylic, and fabric, perhaps leather, and can maybe etch metal,  depending on the power of the laser. If you need to make 30 of something  in a morning and the geometry and materials fit, a laser cutter might be the  way to go, if you can create secure processes for operating it.  Laser cutters are usually between three and ten times the cost of an   equivalent-quality 3D printer, but then, they usually have the ability to cut  a relatively large part. A tradeoff for many education environments is: a  bunch of 3D printers, or one laser cutter? Because of their versatility, we  would likely vote for the 3D printer, but your circumstances might warrant  a different decision.   CNC Machine vs. 3D Printing Small CNC machines, like 3D printers, have started to drop in price  and  size . Ones that can handle cutting small pieces of wood are available  now in desktop-scale sizes. These may have some limited ability to  cut soft metals like aluminum, though they need to do so slowly and  carefully. Ones designed to cut other metals are still pretty beefy, though,  and beyond most hobbyists’ expertise level  and budget . Obviously  if you want to make things out of a material that a 3D printer cannot  make but a small CNC can cut, that can be a discriminator. Typically,  in a school environment, a small CNC is used for wood, usually  supplementing hand tools.  CNC machines are subtractive, and start with a block of raw material.  They make a lot of dust unless they are enclosed very well, and their speed  to make one of something is more comparable to a 3D printer than a laser  cutter. Like 3D printers, cost rises rapidly with size and range of materials  the machine can work with.  13   Chapter 1    Why Use a 3D printer?   it is usually a bad idea to put a CnC machine, wood- carving   Caution  machinery, or anything that makes lots of fine dust in the same room  as a 3D printer, especially if one or both machines are unenclosed.   the dust will get picked up on the filament and clog the nozzle.   Complexity One of the favorite mantras of 3D printing is complexity is free. That is  true, to a point. If a part is designed to be 3D printed  as we discuss in  the Chapter 6, in particular , then often it does not matter that a shape is  complicated. This does matter, a lot, for subtractive technologies because  sometimes it is physically impossible to carve certain types of pieces.  Subtractive technologies are good if the shape of the final part is not very  different from your block, or rod, or sheet of raw material so that not a lot  will need to be cut away.  For a 3D printer, the main thing that determines how much time a   print will take is how much plastic it contains, including any support  material that needs to be printed. There are some exceptions to this, but  by and large a simple and complex shape with similar amounts of plastic  will take close to the same time to build with a 3D printer. Because a  typical 3D print is mostly hollow, the surface area of a model is usually a  better predictor of the print time than the volume. The kinetic sculpture  in Figure 1-4  and on this book’s cover  is a good example of a complex  part that takes a while to print but has no real challenges. It would be very  difficult if not impossible to machine.  Size of a print, though, matters a lot. As printers get bigger, their cost  rises very quickly. Typical classroom-level printers can build things from  a few inches to a foot or so in each dimension. Getting much bigger than   14   that may involve either glue or other assembly techniques to make a large  piece out of smaller ones.  Chapter 1    Why Use a 3D printer?   Figure 1-4.  A kinetic sculpture by Rich, printed in one piece  The sculpture in Figure 1-4 is printed in one piece  Figure 1-5  fully   assembled. It has matching male and female pivots that let it turn freely.   If you want to make one, the open source design is available able at   www.youmagine.com designs arc-gimbal.  15   Chapter 1    Why Use a 3D printer?   Figure 1-5.  How the piece in Figure 1-4 looks on the printer  Note  an implication of this ability to make complicated parts is that  you may be able to reduce the part count if you go from a traditionally  manufactured part to a 3D printed one. the 3D printed part might  be able to include a merged version of other parts that might be  impossible to mold or machine. this might not come up all that often  in a classroom setting, but reducing part count is a valuable thing in  industrial applications, where assembly costs money.  Finally, we should not lose sight of the fact that 3D printing feels   magical. An industry in-joke is that the second thing you print is a chin  rest—so you can stare into your printer as objects seem to materialize from  nothing. Even those of us who deal with this every day still sometimes  pause to watch and appreciate the power of a technology that can be so  inexpensive and yet so capable.  16   Chapter 1    Why Use a 3D printer?    Summary In this chapter, we laid out the basics of additive manufacturing, building  up an object from raw materials one layer at a time, and talked a little  about how 3D printers do that. We also gave the highlights of recent history  of 3D printer development and showed how the open source RepRap  movement turned into an industry. We reviewed the relative merits of  the three commonest digital manufacturing machines: 3D printers, laser  cutters, and CNC machines. And we discussed the advantage that 3D  printers have in creating complex parts, tempered by the fact that 3D prints  on affordable 3D printers need to be relatively small.  Moving forward, Chapters 2 through 6 introduce the technology and  guide you through selecting the right type of printer and understanding  the workflow. Chapters 7 through 14 discuss different applications in the  classroom, library, and lab spaces, and give you pointers to many other  resources so that you can see what is possible with a consumer-level  printer and decide if climbing the learning curve is appropriate for what  you would like to do.  17   CHAPTER 2  3D Printers and   Printable Materials  In the last 10 years or so, 3D printers have gone from being large pieces  of industrial equipment, to hobbyist novelties, to classroom staples.  This chapter reviews the range of technologies that all fall into the  broad category of 3D printing. There are many different 3D printers, but  fundamentally they all create an object by building up one layer at a time  on some sort of platform. As we discuss in Chapter 1, the basic idea of 3D  printing  or additive manufacturing, if you prefer  is that you create objects  by building them up one layer at a time.  The commonest type of 3D printer works with spools of plastic    called filament , which it melts and lays down to create objects. Others  use lasers or projectors to harden light-sensitive resin. Still others either  sinter powder or lay down binders to form objects from powder. The  sheer number of technologies can be overwhelming. There is a lot of  experimentation going on in the field at the moment, and hundreds of  companies are developing new printers on what seems like a daily basis.  The materials available have proliferated too.  In this chapter, we survey the field and give you a basic idea of what   each of the technologies is and what it can do. We explain some basic  vocabulary so that you can understand what we will be talking about later     Joan Horvath, Rich Cameron 2018  J. Horvath and R. Cameron, Mastering 3D Printing in the Classroom, Library, and Lab,   https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-3501-0_2  19   ChapTer 2    3D prInTerS anD prInTable MaTerIalS   in the book. Later chapters focus more on the how-to aspects: the software  of 3D printing  Chapters 3 and 6 , things to consider when buying a printer   Chapter 4 , and how to fit a printer into your space and daily routines   Chapter 5 .  Note  The 3D printing world uses metric measurements, and you  will need to get comfortable with them if you are not already. The  commonest measures you will encounter are millimeters  mm  and  degrees Celsius. If you are used to Imperial units, 25.4 mm is an inch.  To convert temperature in degrees Celsius to Fahrenheit, multiply the  temperature in Celsius by 9 5, then add 32 degrees. So, an extruder  temperature of 210 C is the same as 410 F.   Filament Printers By far the commonest consumer-level 3D-printing technology is  fused deposition modeling, sometimes called FDM  which technically  applies to just one manufacturer  or more generically FFF for fused  filament fabrication. In this book, we just refer to these printers as filament  3D printers. These printers pull plastic filament off a spool, melt it, and lay  down the melted plastic in a fine line, typically around 0.2 mm high and a  few times as wide.  Figure 2-1 shows a typical filament printer, which would have a   spool of filament next to it if it were running. We have also labeled the  common convention for naming the axes of a printer. The x-axis here  is left to right, the y-axis is toward and away from you, and the z-axis is  vertical.  20   ChapTer 2    3D prInTerS anD prInTable MaTerIalS   There are several different architectures of filament printers, which  we can divide into Cartesian and non-Cartesian. Cartesian printers  like  the one in Figure 2-1  have one motor or pair of motors for each drive axis.  Non-Cartesians have no particular relationship between any one motor  and axis.  Figure 2-1.  A typical consumer 3D printer  The commonest non-Cartesian architecture is the delta printer,  or deltabot, which uses a mechanism similar to those found in many  pick-and-place robots. A typical delta is shown in Figure 2-2. Deltas are  commonest for applications needing big build areas; Figure 2-3 is a photo  of the giant demonstration deltabot, the Part Daddy, made by the same  manufacturer as the consumer printer in Figure 2-2.  21   ChapTer 2    3D prInTerS anD prInTable MaTerIalS   Figure 2-2.  The Artemis deltabot  Note  There are philosophical debates about whether Cartesians  or deltas are “better” for any purpose, somewhat along the lines  of debates about the virtues of Windows versus Mac personal  computers. In the end, the quality of manufacture and the features  you need should drive your choice.  22   ChapTer 2    3D prInTerS anD prInTable MaTerIalS   Figure 2-3.  The Part Daddy demonstrator   Parts of a Filament Printer A filament printer is pretty simple—a common analogy is to call it a  computerized hot glue gun. However, there are several critical parts that  affect reliability, print quality, and what kinds of materials you can use.   Stepper Motors  Consumer 3D printers usually have four or more stepper motors,  commonly called steppers. As the name implies, these are precise motors  that move their shafts in predefined angular steps. The availability of very   23   ChapTer 2    3D prInTerS anD prInTable MaTerIalS   reliable, precise, yet cheap steppers like those in Figure 2-4 has been an  enabler for many consumer goods. Typically, one motor drives each axis   sometimes two, on the vertical  z-  axis  by being coupled through pulleys  to a belt or cable, or to a drive screw for an axis  often used for the z-axis .  Another motor drives the extruder gear. The steps per millimeter of your  gears  how much an axis, or the filament, moves as the motor turns  is one  of the things limiting how accurate a 3D printer can be, although it is not  usually the principal limitation. Motors for 3D printers typically have 200  steps per revolution.  Figure 2-4.  A stepper motor   Control  3D printers are controlled by microcontrollers. Many of these use a  processor that is an adaptation or descendant of the Arduino open source  microcontroller standard. Surprisingly, many printers run on very little  computing horsepower. As of early 2017, most printers use open-loop  control, meaning that they do not have sensors checking that the printer  is running as planned, except for sensors monitoring key temperatures   of the print bed and extruder . Deltas take more processing power than   24   ChapTer 2    3D prInTerS anD prInTable MaTerIalS   Cartesians, generally speaking, and you may want a more powerful  controller on a delta to keep up.  3D PRINTER CONTROLLERS  The most common type of 3D printer controller is based on the aTmega2560,  an 8-bit microcontroller that runs at 16 Mhz. The first 3D printer controller  to use this processor was the raMpS board  short for reprap arduino Mega  pololu Shield . This was a shield, or daughterboard, designed to be used with  the arduino Mega development board that was designed to carry several  small stepper driver boards in a form factor originally designed by electronics  manufacturer pololu. Most modern versions have the atmega2560 chip  onboard rather than using a separate circuit board, but many are still designed  to use replaceable stepper drivers in the pololu form factor. More advanced  stepper drivers are now available in pin-compatible formats that allow you to  upgrade your printer or replace a damaged driver.  There are several different projects developing open source firmware to run  on these 8-bit microcontrollers. The most common of these is the Marlin  firmware. Some newer controllers use 32-bit arM microcontrollers running at  48–120 Mhz. These are generally designed to use a specific firmware, such as  Smoothieware or Duet Firmware, and they are generally not compatible with  other firmware options the way 8-bit controllers are.  Most printers do not need to be tethered to a computer. If they are, it is  to feed the commands to create a model, not to directly control the motors  and temperatures.  A printers runs some sort of firmware on its controller to do that    low- level control. Firmware is just software that is used to control a machine.  Many printers that are descendants of the RepRap project described in  Chapter 1 run a variation of the open source Marlin firmware. Makerbots and  their distant cousins and clones tend to run a version of the Sailfish firmware.  25   ChapTer 2    3D prInTerS anD prInTable MaTerIalS    Build Platform  Prints are created on a flat platform, interchangeably referred to as the  print bed or print platform. It might or might not have a heater, which  allows you to use more materials, as we discuss in detail in Chapter 4.  Depending on the printer design, the print bed may move in one or two  directions, or not at all.   Extruder  The extruder is the part of the printer that melts and moves the filament. It  is made up of several parts. We have already mentioned the extruder drive  gear and its motor, which push the filament into the hot end. The hot end  in turn is comprised of a heater, a nozzle, and a sensor  called a thermistor   to sense how hot the nozzle is.  The nozzles are very precise. They typically measure 0.35–0.50 mm   in diameter and can be made entirely of metal, or they may be lined with  a material called PTFE to minimize jamming. All-metal hot ends are  required for printing many materials, as discussed in Chapter 5.  The hot end includes a heating element and a sensor to regulate  temperature, a thermal transition zone  often with a heatsink and fan  on the cold end , and a nozzle that is usually made of brass. Recently  hardened-steel and ruby-tipped nozzles have appeared—some filaments  are very abrasive, and these are more resistant to abrasion. Figure 2-5 is a  close-up of a nozzle.  26   ChapTer 2    3D prInTerS anD prInTable MaTerIalS   Figure 2-5.  A nozzle   How Printing Works First, filament has to be pulled from the spool into the printer, usually with  a gear driven by a stepper motor. There are a variety of geometries for this.  Sometimes a gear is right next to where the plastic will be melted  the hot  end , and sometimes it is separated by a long tube, called a Bowden tube.  Extruders with a gear pulling in filament without an intermediary tube are  called direct-drive extruders  though, confusingly, the same term is used  to distinguish extruders with the drive gear mounted directly to the motor  from ones that have a gear reduction . In either case, the gear gripping the  filament is called the extruder drive gear. Figure 2-6 shows the drive gear  on a Bowden-style printer.  Some manufacturers like direct-drive extruders; many have moved   now to some form of Bowden extruder. The main advantage of having the  gear right at the extruder is simplicity, though it also means that the motor  is being carried around with the hot end, which may mean slower printing  and other issues.  27   ChapTer 2    3D prInTerS anD prInTable MaTerIalS   Figure 2-6.  Extruder gear on a printer with a Bowden tube  A print starts with a 3D CAD design, which is turned into a series   of commands for the stepper motor and the temperature controls. This  process is discussed in detail in Chapters 3 and 6. Once those commands  are loaded onto the printer, via cable, SD card, or wireless connection, the  printer will first heat up the nozzle and the platform  if it has a heater .  Once everything is up to temperature and the printer performs whatever  self-checks it is capable of, printing begins.  The first layer of the print has to stick well to the platform. There   are various techniques for ensuring this. Some involve software settings   Chapter 3 , and others are related to using the correct platform surface for  the material you are printing  Chapter 4 . Assuming that the print sticks, as  a layer builds up there are areas that do and do not have plastic within one  layer. This means that the nozzle will be extruding during some parts of the  layer, and not during others.  During the time that the printer is not laying down plastic, the extruder   gear will first pull the filament back a bit to relieve pressure in the nozzle.  This is called retraction, and getting it right is something of a black art that   28   ChapTer 2    3D prInTerS anD prInTable MaTerIalS   involves a process of trial and error for particular combinations of printer  hardware and filament material. Poor retraction settings can make a print  stringy or blobby, like the one in Figure 2-7.  Figure 2-7.  A print with poor retraction settings  If the print fails to stick, most printers do not know that and will   happily continue to print. This will result in a big pile of plastic  Figure 2- 8 .  It is something of a rite of passage to leave a printer for a while and come  back to a big hairball. Take a picture, sigh, and take comfort that you are  now an official member of the 3D-printing tribe.  29   ChapTer 2    3D prInTerS anD prInTable MaTerIalS   Figure 2-8.  A failed print  Suppose that you were printing something that had a part sticking out,  like someone reaching out an arm. As you built up your print layer by layer,  you would eventually reach the first layer of the bottom of the arm. But as  you laid out plastic to form the first layer, it would just fall down since there  was nothing to support it. To address problems like that, we use support  material. Support is extra material that is added to the model to allow it to  print a layer at a time. Figure 2-9 shows a print with support. The process  of creating support is discussed in Chapter 3.  Printers can handle overhangs of about 45 degrees— the subsequent  layers overlap a bit and allow you to print these moderate slopes. Printers  can also bridge over open areas. If you are printing a hollow cube, for  instance, the top will be over open space, but supported on all four sides.  Many of the support and bridging decisions that need to be made are  somewhat automated these days, but in Chapter 3 we talk about the  human intervention that is still required.  30   ChapTer 2    3D prInTerS anD prInTable MaTerIalS   Figure 2-9.  A print with support  Assuming that everything went well, you will have a print that builds   up from the platform layer by layer. The layers will be more visible in some  filaments than others. Layer height is something that most printers allow  you to set; common heights run from about 0.1 to 0.3 mm. Figure 2-10 is  a close-up of the output from the Part Daddy giant printer in Figure 2-3,  which is a little easier to see than some.  This printer uses plastic pellets  rather than filament, which is why the colors are variable.   Figure 2-10.  A close-up of layers  31    3D prInTerS anD prInTable MaTerIalS   ChapTer 2   Filament Choices There are many choices for 3D-printer filament. Your printer, however, will  likely only be able to handle a subset of them, and will either use 3 mm or  1.75 mm diameter filament. The quality of your 3D-printing filament will  make the difference between endless frustration and a good experience, so  let’s go over what “filament quality” means first.  Consumers 3D printers, as we have just seen, are really not all that  sophisticated. They have, in a way, outsourced their complexity to their  filament. Consistency and quality is better now than it was a few years ago,  but can still be uneven.  If you are 3D printing, you need a pair of digital calipers to check your  filament’s diameter. A “3 mm” filament will typically be about 2.85 mm. A  1.75 mm filament will usually be about that. If you have a printer that uses  cartridges, you will need to assume that the extra money you pay for your  filament is taking care of this step for you. Be sure to adjust the filament  diameter setting in your software  Chapter 3  to the actual value of your  filament diameter. Typically we just leave the value at 1.75 or 2.85 without  adjustment most of the time these days. Figure 2-11 shows checking  filament diameter with a pair of calipers.  32   ChapTer 2    3D prInTerS anD prInTable MaTerIalS   Figure 2-11.  Checking filament diameter with a pair of calipers  If your printer stops extruding mid-print, your first suspect   Tip  should be a bulge in the filament, which will jam the extruder. The  extruder gear will also usually chew into the filament and therefore  have a lot of ground filament in it. brush the ground filament out  gently and measure the filament. If it is significantly wider than you  expected, break off a few meters and measure again.  The other filament problem that can cause this symptom is filament  impurity or poor color mixing. again, try breaking off some and  printing again. If your printer has a restart function, it probably  will not work in this case, because you do not know how long the  filament has been grinding. You will probably have to restart from the  beginning.  33   ChapTer 2    3D prInTerS anD prInTable MaTerIalS   There are a lot of different filaments available. We discuss some of the  commonest ones, and what 3D-printer hardware and software you need to  use them.  Tip  Filaments come labeled with a range of appropriate  temperatures for the extruder and the platform  often a disturbingly  large range . There may be a label on the spool or on the website  where you ordered it. If in doubt, start in the middle of the range. See  the discussions of settings in Chapter 3 to see whether you should  move up or down if you do not like the results.  Filaments need to be kept in a cool, dry place. Do not open a spool  of filament out of its shrink wrap until you are ready to use it, because  keeping it sealed will keep moisture out of it. After a while, you will have a  bunch of partial spools on the go. We keep ours in airtight plastic boxes— a  5-gallon paint bucket with a good lid works well; Joan is partial to 22-liter  stacking plastic boxes with good seals.  Nylon is particularly sensitive to humid conditions. If nylon gets damp,  the water will pop and sizzle out as it heats up, leaving pits and gaps in the  print. If you live someplace with routinely high humidity, you may want to  explore reviews of the various filament-drying systems out there, or DIY  equivalents.  Caution  Many low-cost printers have no temperature limiters in  their software or hardware and will be perfectly happy trying to heat  the nozzle to the point where it will burn, or the heated bed to beyond  its design temperature. Check your manufacturer’s limitations before  trying a filament that your printer was not designed to use.  34   ChapTer 2    3D prInTerS anD prInTable MaTerIalS    PLA  By far the commonest filament material is PLA, polylactic acid. It is a  biodegradable, corn-based  sometimes sugarcane-based  plastic. It  melts at a relatively low temperature and will stick to a variety of platform  surfaces. PLA usually requires an extruder temperature of around 210  degrees C.  One of the reasons it is so popular is that PLA does not require a heated   platform. Low-cost printers usually suggest that you put blue painter’s  tape  1.88-inch wide 3M ScotchBlue 2090 works well  and use that as  your surface. If you do have a heated platform, follow your manufacturer’s  suggestions for what to put on the bed. Often it will be plain glass, or you  might smear on some glue stick first. Do not use blue tape on a heated  platform—doing so will create a sticky mess.  The downside of PLA is that, well, it melts at a low temperature. A PLA  print on a hot car dashboard will warp and creep.  Creeping is a tendency  to flow slowly under pressure—for example, a PLA print might develop a  dent if something is pressing against it in a warm room.  If that is not an  issue, PLA is a very good material for quick prototypes, student projects,  and the like.  There are specialty filled PLA mixes that contain stone, wood, metal,   or glow-in-the-dark fine particles. Objects made with this can look  surprisingly like they are made of the respective substance, with a bit of  polishing. However, these mixes are hard on nozzles and tend to abrade  them; hardened or ruby-tipped nozzles can get around this problem.  There are also formulations of PLA that have a nice sheen without any  post-processing. Experiment a little  many filament sellers have sample  packs  to see what you might like to work with.  Figure 2-12 shows the bad side of PLA: a garden sign that sat out in a   California agave desert garden in the sun for about two years gradually  sagged under its own weight. Back in Chapter 4, Figure 4-2, on the other  hand, shows how fine a finish one can get with PLA.  35   ChapTer 2    3D prInTerS anD prInTable MaTerIalS   Figure 2-12.  PLA sign after time in the California sun   PET   ABS  36  PET  polyethylene terephthalate  is a very common plastic in the non-  3D- printing world, used for water bottles and many other things. PETG  is a type of PET that is often used in 3D printing; some varieties are  translucent. You can in principle print PETG on blue tape, although people  use heated beds if they have one. It needs an extruder temperature higher  than PLA—around 230–260 C. PET filaments are typically a little more  expensive than PLA, sometimes as much as twice the price. But they can  look really good, particularly if you want something transparent, and they  are not as vulnerable to warm temperatures as PLA is.  Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene  ABS  is the plastic used for LEGO bricks,  among many other things. It is durable and far less vulnerable to warping  in warm temperatures. The flip side of that is that it requires a high nozzle  temperature—from about 220–260 C. A heated bed is also an absolute    ChapTer 2    3D prInTerS anD prInTable MaTerIalS   requirement for ABS, at 90–110 C. People often use PET or Kapton tape  on a heated bed for ABS. As ABS cools, it wants to shrink and will pull up  from the bed, as you can see in the print that was stopped after a few layers  shown in Figure 2-13. Some trial and error is required to get it to stick and  lay flat.  Figure 2-13.  An ABS part that pulled up from the heated bed  Caution  although we recommend ventilation with any 3D printer,  abS fumes in particular are an issue. however, blowing a fan directly  on the print will tend to make it fail. arrange your ventilation if  possible to be pulling air off the print rather than blowing on it.  ABS can be smoothed and post-processed in a variety of ways. We   talk about some of those in Chapter 8, where we discuss art and theater  applications.  37   ChapTer 2    3D prInTerS anD prInTable MaTerIalS    Nylon  Nylon is a strong printing material, which also requires a high temperature  of around 240–270 C. Be sure your nozzle is all-metal before trying to print  with nylon, because nozzles lined with plastic cannot handle that high a  temperature.  The biggest challenge with nylon, other than the high extruder   temperature, is that it does not want to stick to anything. The best option  we have found is a cold platform made of Garolite LE, a type of composite.  Failing that, we have heard that glue stick on a platform heated to about  75 degrees C will work. As noted earlier, nylon also needs to be kept very  dry, or pitting can result. Nylon can be dyed after printing with dyes  appropriate for it.   Challenging Filaments  Some materials are difficult to print well. Filaments that are very strong  tend to require correspondingly higher temperatures and often want  to peel up from the print bed. Some printers can handle materials  like polycarbonate, which typically requires higher nozzle and bed  temperatures than consumer machines can achieve safely.  There are also filaments that are flexible which can create parts that  also can flex. However, they tend to jam in the extruder, particularly for  printers using 1.75 mm filament and Bowden tubes.   Dissolvable Support  Some printers have more than one extruder. One reason for buying such a  machine is to allow the use of support material that can be dissolved away,  either with water or other chemicals.  The commonest water-soluble support, PVA  polyvinyl alcohol , is  basically Elmer’s Glue. As you might imagine, it has a tendency to clog  nozzles, and it has to be extruded fairly cold. Check your local rules about   38   ChapTer 2    3D prInTerS anD prInTable MaTerIalS   disposal—you should not put water full of dissolved glue into your plumbing.  PVA has to be kept extremely dry, for obvious reasons. It also tends not to  stick well to the other materials you are using to make your print.  Other materials like HIPS  high impact polystyrene  dissolve in   limonene  a solvent made from oranges , but this leaves you with a rather  smelly mess to deal with.  In other words, this is not a particularly easy route to go. You will need  to talk to your local waste-disposal person to see how best to handle your  waste stream. In the end, you may decide to stick with support you can  pull off with pliers. We talk more about support in Chapter 3’s discussion of  software settings.   Multimaterials vs. Multiple Extruders The other reason you might buy a printer with multiple extruders is to  print objects in more than one color at a time. With only one extruder, 3D  printers print with just one color of filament for the entire print. In essence,  you develop two interleaved computer models, one for each color, and the  printer alternates extruders in each layer. Because the extruders would  interfere if they tried to print at the same time, typically dual-extruder  prints take longer than single-extruder ones do because one extruder  prints, then wipes itself off  so it does not dribble on the layer once it is  done , and so on, back and forth.  Alternatively, some machines now come with a device that can take   filament from two spools and splice a mixed filament to mimic what  two heads would have done, but with one nozzle. This is an interesting  development to watch; there are some aftermarket devices available as  add-ons to existing printers.  39    3D prInTerS anD prInTable MaTerIalS   ChapTer 2   Aftermarket Upgrades If you want to be able to print some materials that will not stick to your  original print bed material, there are now a variety of aftermarket materials  you can stick on to your platform. A commonly used one is BuildTak  www. buildtak.com , which can be glued on to your existing platform. The only  issue is that some materials stick too well to BuildTak, and getting the  prints off it is challenging. You will need to recalibrate your printer if you  add a clip-on or stick-on platform on top of your original. See “Calibrating  Your Printer” in Chapter 5.  Similarly, there are replacement third-party nozzles. Here, however,   the replacement process is more sophisticated, and if you are not a tinkerer  who is comfortable with building a printer from a kit, you probably should  not go that route.   Advanced Filament Printers As the consumer and higher-end “prosumer” markets expand, some  specialty printers have emerged. Some are very large, having a build  volume of a cubic meter or more. Some have up to five extruders, or one of  the multimaterial extruders we mentioned earlier.  Another niche is occupied by Markforged  www.markforged.com . This  company has a printer that lays down nylon in parallel with another head  that lays down one of several continuous fibers. Thus, they are 3D printing  carbon fiber or other composite parts; Markforged has stated in webinars  that its early adopters often use their printers to make tooling. Some  Markforged printers use a filament with chopped carbon fiber filler, which  increases the stiffness of the base nylon. This evolution of materials with   40   ChapTer 2    3D prInTerS anD prInTable MaTerIalS   custom printers is probably a niche that will grow as specialty applications  emerge; novel materials are now driving a lot of the 3D-printing universe  as the printers become more commoditized.  Markforged is also one of several companies developing printers  that are designed to print with filament  or, in some cases, rods  with  a high percentage of metal filler. Metal-filled filament is available for  many printers, but although most of these filaments can only give the  appearance of metal, these machines are designed to create real metal  parts by allowing you to put the printed parts into a furnace that will burn  out the plastic matrix material and fuse the metal particles together.  3D-PRINTING PENS  3D-printing “pens”  Figure 2-14  heat up 3D-printing filament  usually 1.75  mm  and allow you to freehand draw with the melted plastic. They are useful  for gluing together broken prints, since you can use a thin line of the same  material as you are using for your 3D print. In other words, they are more or  less hot glue guns that use 3D printer filament.  The pens can also be used to do 3D freehand drawing. however, unless  you have really steady hands, it is not as easy as it looks. Cover a piece  of cardboard with the same blue painter’s tape you would use on a cold  3D-printer platform and use it as your work area.  41   ChapTer 2    3D prInTerS anD prInTable MaTerIalS   Figure 2-14.  A 3D printing pen  Vendors sell short strips of pla filament to use with these devices, but you can  use 1.75 mm regular 3D-printer filament, which is much cheaper. We usually  cut a few meters or so off at a time to use because the regular spools can be  annoying to use with a pen. You can use as many colors as you want in one  design, since you will just load strips of filament one at a time to create an object.  We usually save the last few meters of filament on a spool to use with pens.  Some pens can use both pla and abS, with an ability to set temperatures  appropriate for both, and most have a speed control to manage how much  plastic you are using at a time. Using one of these pens can be a good  exercise in building your intuition about what a 3D printer is doing, as you will  most likely make a stringy mess the first time you use a pen.  42   ChapTer 2    3D prInTerS anD prInTable MaTerIalS   Concerns about ventilating an area where you are melting plastic, abS in  particular, still apply with a pen. and of course the pen tip gets very hot, just  like the extruder on a 3D printer. If you are using pla, you will need to have  some sort of air flow anyway to cool the material as it hardens out of the pen if  you want to build in 3D.  There are stencils and such things too; search online for “3D art pen” for  examples and videos. eiffel Tower models are the aspirational thing to build,  but you obviously should not start there. no computer modeling is required  to use a 3D pen, but manual dexterity and a bit of artistic ability help. pens  with good temperature control and ability to use multiple materials cost about  $50–$100.   Resin Printers: SLA and DLP The consumer resin printer market has been coming into its own recently  with a great deal of experimentation. There are two types of resin printer  on the market right now: stereolithography  SLA  and Digital Light  Processing  DLP . Technically, both are SLA, but the terminology is used  somewhat ambiguously. Laser SLA printers use optics to move around an  ultraviolet laser spot to cure UV-curable resin within one layer at a time.  This layer is peeled off the bottom of a tank  or dropped down into the  tank, in the older but now less-common top-down orientation , and then  the next layer is cured, and so on. Figure 2-15 shows a Formlabs Form 2,  one of the higher-end consumer SLA machines.  DLP, on the other hand, uses a projector to cure a whole layer at a time.   A new class of DLP printers uses a cell phone screen as the projector. In  Chapter 4’s discussion of purchase decisions for these printers, we go into  the pluses and minuses of these in more detail, and the operational issues.  43   ChapTer 2    3D prInTerS anD prInTable MaTerIalS   Figure 2-15.  A Formlabs Form 2 SLA resin printer  Printing Process Resin 3D printers have an ability to create far finer detail than filament-  based printers. A resin printer is limited by its laser spot size  SLA  or the  pixel size of the projector  DLP . This means that resin prints can have very  smooth surfaces relative to those created by a printer using filament.  Resin printers still need to create support, but the nature of the support   is a little different. Typical printers are “bottom-up” and build a layer at  a time, which is peeled off the bottom of a tray. To survive the peeling  process with every layer, support is required. However, the object prints  upside-down and support is primarily withstands the forces associated  with peeling off the bottom at the end of each layer. Figure 2-16 shows a  print building upside-down on a Form 2. The greenish glow is the laser.  Printers that use a laser to cure resin use a series of coordinates that the   laser spot moves through, philosophically similar to the commands that  control a filament-based printer. They can generally move the laser spot  much faster than a printer can move a heated nozzle, though. Although  most have proprietary software, some of them have adapted software  developed for filament printing.  44   ChapTer 2    3D prInTerS anD prInTable MaTerIalS   Printers that use a projector need a series of 2D images, one for each   layer. Some of these printers have an HDMI port as an input, and their  software treats the printer as a second monitor on which it displays those  images. A popular way to run these machines is to connect a Raspberry  Pi running NanoDLP to avoid tying up a larger computer. This avoids  potentially ruining a print or even damaging the printer if the computer  tries to display something else on that “screen.”  Figure 2-16.  A resin print in progress   Post-processing Post-processing is required on SLA prints, and typically involves washing  off the print with isopropyl alcohol to remove uncured resin and exposing  the print to UV light to ensure that the resin is fully cured. This can be a  challenge in environments that are not set up for disposing of chemicals.  Each manufacturer will have a process for its own resins; read the   process on the manufacturer’s site before purchasing your printer so you  are sure you will be set up to handle it. Typically, prints emerge from the  printer a little sticky and need to be washed off and light-cured. Figure 2-17  shows a resin print just after its wash but before curing. You can also see  how much more open support is on a resin printer.  45   ChapTer 2    3D prInTerS anD prInTable MaTerIalS   Figure 2-17.  Washing off a resin print  Notice that this process requires wearing nitrile gloves to keep the resin   off your skin. We talk a little more about resin printers in Chapter 5.   Materials Resin printers use a variety of light-cured resins. Most of them are sensitive  to UV light so that you do not have to use them in a dark room, since visible  light does not harden them. But because by definition you cannot see UV  light, you might be surprised if you don’t control the environment around  the printer. For example, having a resin printer in direct sunlight can  destroy the printer  or at least its resin tank  by hardening a brick of resin  into it.  46   ChapTer 2    3D prInTerS anD prInTable MaTerIalS   Much of the development in resin 3D printing at the moment is in  proprietary resins with special properties. Formlabs, for example, has  a high-temperature resin that it says can be used for injection molds.  Biocompatible resins for dental work has been an active area of study  as well. Because the materials are so crucial, many manufacturers have  closed systems with materials cartridges and proprietary software. These  may have great properties, but they will be correspondingly expensive.  Some specialty resin applications include the following:     High-temperature for injection molds     Biocompatible resins for dental work     Castable resins for jewelry     Resins that cure into a flexible material  Formlabs  www.formlabs.com  has been an innovator in the materials   space. If you want to know more, you can read up on its proprietary  materials on the website, which includes case studies.   Other Technologies The overall field of 3D printing has been expanding in many different  directions. There are a few other major categories of printer that are  unlikely to come into the classroom in the near term, but given the rate of  progress, one never knows!  There are some just-for-fun technologies, like a printer that makes  pancakes  www.pancakebot.com  and ones that print in sugar or other  foodstuffs. But the industrial market has been moving onward too. In  this section, we talk about some of the categories of industrially oriented  printers.  47    3D prInTerS anD prInTable MaTerIalS   ChapTer 2   SLS One of the oldest technologies in this space is selective laser sintering   SLS . Typically, a very fine powder is spread on a build platform, and  a laser is used to sinter the powder together. More and more powder is  added as the print grows. SLS can be used to make very fine, detailed  prints. SLS prints do not need support, because the unfused powder acts  as a support. However, the powder is very fine and hard to deal with, and  SLS has been an expensive technology. Some “desktop” SLS machines are  beginning to come on the market, and this may be an area to watch.  Many machines that print metal use a process called direct metal laser  sintering  DMLS , which is the SLS process used for metals. Metal powder  has to be worked in an inert atmosphere to prevent fires, so DMLS machines  are very expensive since they need to be completely enclosed and filled with  an inert gas. Other processes like selective laser melting  SLM  and electron  beam melting  EBM  use even higher power to more fully fuse metal powder.  The alternative discussed earlier in this chapter under “Advanced   Filament Printers” is to mix the powder with something else. This too is an  evolving area to watch.   Binder Jetting and Material Jetting There are also processes that use a powder bed which do not require a  laser  or other highly-directed heat source . These processes typically use  an inkjet head similar to what you would find in a desktop photo printer.  Instead of heating the powder to fuse it, they deposit glue or other binding  agents onto the powder. Binder-jetting machines typically use gypsum  powder, and can deposit ink along with the binding agent to create   full- color prints. Binder jetting can also be done with metal, but that  requires a second step in which the loosely bound particles are infused  with a lower- temperature metal. Some machines even sinter nylon powder  by using inkjet heads to deposit sensitizing and or inhibiting agents to the  powder before heating it with a more diffuse heat source.  48   ChapTer 2    3D prInTerS anD prInTable MaTerIalS   Other processes do away with the powder entirely and use inkjet heads  to deposit liquid resin. These printers deposit tiny droplets of UV-sensitive  resin and then quickly expose it to UV light to solidify it. This process  requires that multiple materials be used—a build and support material at  least—and can be used to produce prints with gradients of color and even  of material properties like flexibility.   Bioprinting Printing with biological materials has become fairly mainstream now in  lab environments. In some cases, the printer is using some sort of paste  to create an object for a biology lab. In others, the printer is very precisely  squirting a liquid. The lower-cost “bioprinters” are basically a robotic  pipette that can move in three dimensions; there are several competitors in  this space already, and there will probably be more. Search for “bioprinter”  to see the huge range of capabilities and price ranges.  Organovo  www.organovo.com  has been printing human tissue, as   have other researchers. Right now most people are looking at projects like  skin or ear repairs, but there is long-term interest in building entire human  organs. At the other end of the scale are companies like SE3D  www.se3d. com , which makes simple syringe-based devices that come with kits of  materials to use with the printer to learn biological concepts.   Summary This chapter reviewed the different types of 3D-printer technology  available in the consumer market, with a particular focus on printers  that use plastic filament. We also gave a brief introduction to other  technologies, particularly printers that use liquid resin. 3D-printer  evolution is being driven now by inventions of new materials, too, and we  discussed some of the wide variety of materials you might want to explore.  49   CHAPTER 3  3D Printer Workflow  and Software  People are often startled and intimidated when they discover that a 3D  printer is not really the same as a paper printer. Although some consumer  3D printers have a “print” button, there are some steps needed to get to  the point of pushing it, not to mention the need to monitor what happens  afterwards. We prefer to think of 3D printing as more like cooking than  printing. Just as you would not expect to cook by just pressing a “bake”  button without setting some temperatures and timers first, 3D printing  requires some knowledge of your printer, the materials you are using, and  the design you are trying to print. If any of those have issues, getting good  results is challenging.  As happens with cooking, everyone wants to start out creating a   multitier wedding cake. However, it is wise to try for brownies instead,  at least for a while. In this chapter, we help you understand what is  hard to print versus what is easy, and give you some insight into more  sophisticated techniques. Different printers have evolved variations  on the basic workflow. Some are the equivalent of an Easy-Bake Oven,  whereas others are like equipment in a commercial kitchen, for similar  reasons of capability versus complexity. Your expectations need to match  your hardware. Price is not always a guide to capability and quality in the  current market; see Chapter 4’s discussion on how to buy a printer.    Joan Horvath, Rich Cameron 2018  J. Horvath and R. Cameron, Mastering 3D Printing in the Classroom, Library, and Lab,   https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-3501-0_3  51   Chapter 3    3D printer WorkfloW anD SoftWare  As you will see, unlike with cooking, some basic computer skills are  necessary to get started. This chapter walks through the steps needed to  go from zero to plastic in as generic a way as possible, with some nods to  common variations on the theme. 3D-printing software is updated often,  so the precise options we show here may change by the time you read this.  The overall workflow should stay much the same, though. For that reason,  we have just a few screenshots and narrate the types of printer settings  rather than go step-by-step through any particular program.   Workflow Overview 3D printing typically requires three steps  Figure 3-1  that might be  combined into fewer than three pieces of software, might require some  scrolling around on a screen on your printer for the last step, or might  involve other variations. In all cases, though, you need to create or acquire  a 3D computer-aided design  CAD  model, slice this model into layers  and generate the commands needed to physically create the model, and,  finally, physically create the print.  This chapter is mostly focused on the middle step of slicing the model   and creating commands. Some printers use proprietary software that  integrates the last two steps. They may automate some of the decisions we  describe in this chapter, or have hard-coded some compromise settings  that will work decently in some common situations but perhaps create bad  prints in others. As the market has expanded, printers have fallen into two  camps: printers with proprietary ecosystems  typically more expensive   and open printers that allow you to use a variety of free software and  generic materials. The closed printers position themselves as easier to use,  and the open ones as allowing users more flexibility.  52   Chapter 3    3D printer WorkfloW anD SoftWare  Figure 3-1.  3D-printing workflow  Note  for historical reasons, people sometimes refer to the set  of software that runs an automated tool like a 3D printer as its  toolchain. the word does not imply any physical objects—in the case  of a 3D printer, at least. We use the word workflow here, which we  feel may be more familiar in educational or scientific settings.   Models The first step in the 3D-printing process is developing a 3D model of  the design you want to create. This is done in CAD software, which we  introduce here and explore in depth in Chapter 6.   Types of 3D-Printable Files Typical consumer 3D printers want a model to be in stereolithography   STL  format. This format is quite old and inefficient, but universal.  When software generates an STL file, it converts the surface to a mesh of   53   Chapter 3    3D printer WorkfloW anD SoftWare  triangles. An STL file consists of a giant list of the coordinates of the three  vertices of each triangle in 3D space, and the orientation of the normal  vector to the plane of that triangle.  A similar standard supported by many slicers is an OBJ file, an open   format originally developed by Wavefront Technologies that also supports  texture mapping for color and NURBS curvature, though use of these  features is rare and they are ignored by slicers if present. A superset  standard that can be a grouping of multiple STL files is an additive  manufacturing  AMF  file, which also supports material definitions  required for printing with multiple filaments  for different colors or  different material properties . More recently, Microsoft has formed a  consortium to introduce the 3D manufacturing  3MF  format, which has  similar capabilities  for more, see https:  3mf.io what-is-3mf  .   File Repositories The other way to get an STL file is to download one that someone else  has already created. Many repositories are full of files that people have  put out for free, including www.thingiverse.com, www.youmagine.com,  www.instructables.com, and www.pinshape.com. There are repositories  on www.github.org that include 3D-printable models as well.  For better or worse, these repositories are populated by anyone who   wants to post something. Although many of the designs are amazing, some  of the objects may never have actually been printed, or the designer might  be nine years old and posting for fun without any idea of what is printable.  Models for education might or might not be accurate. So if you use one, be  sure to review it and read the license that spells out how you are allowed to  use it.  54   Chapter 3    3D printer WorkfloW anD SoftWare  CREATIVE COMMONS LICENSES  3D-printing software and models are often released under a creative commons  license, which you might encounter in the form of notations like “released  under a Creative Commons 4.0 international license, CC-BY-nC-Sa,” typically  including a link to the relevant license text at www.creativecommons.org.  these licenses allow you to share your models or software freely while  retaining some rights for yourself. the licenses are written in a somewhat  modular fashion so you can add on restrictions to a basic license, shown by  adding letter codes to the license name. a CC-BY-NC-SA license, for instance,  allows anyone to do the following:     Use your material  CC, creative commons      as long as they attribute it to you in a certain way  BY           and do not use it for commercial purposes  NC         and anyone who uses your materials must release their   materials  including the part you contributed  under the same  license  SA, for share alike   Deciding how to release and use materials is complex, and you should consult  a lawyer versed in software intellectual property if you are embarking on a  major project, particularly if money and friendships are involved. the Creative  Commons website is a good and lucid place to get some background first,  though.  Many 3D printers have heritage to the reprap project  www.reprap.org ,  which is an ongoing project to build an open source community of creative  commons hardware and software. these printers are typically referred to as  open source printers.  55   Chapter 3    3D printer WorkfloW anD SoftWare  Tip  Chapter 5 includes a quick-start guide that talks you through  how to create a small cube as a test. You can use that as a first test  model and then move on to more complex things in Chapter 6. it may  be tempting to download something from a repository and try that  first, but if you have issues, you will not know if it is a printer problem  or a model that has issues.   Scanning Consumer-priced 3D scanners either require you to take multiple pictures  from multiple angles or scan using a device that produces multiple laser  beams or some other structured light pattern. Either way, you typically  end up a lot of artifacts that have to be cleaned up manually in software, a  process that can be tedious and time-consuming. Typically, people use a  scan as a starting point for what they are doing or a dimensional reference  and then draw over it in a CAD program to correct and clean up the scan.  Software is the hard part of 3D scanning, and some professional scanners  have software to automate some of this, but as of this writing these  packages tend to cost many thousands of dollars. Figure 3-2 shows a 3D  print of Rich, based on a scan made with a DIY scanner.  if you would like to build your own scanner, there are open   Tip  source designs out there, like the Cyclop 3D scanner  an open  hardware scanner for small objects built with 3D-printed parts that  uses open source software  and Skanect  software that allows you to  repurpose an Xbox kinect for human-scale 3D scanning .  56   Chapter 3    3D printer WorkfloW anD SoftWare  Figure 3-2.  Scanned and 3D printed sculpture   Slicing Software: Filament Printers 3D printers cannot use a CAD output file  that is, an STL file  directly.  A piece of software known as a slice engine has to take the STL file and  figure out the commands that the 3D printer will execute a layer at a  time. Slice engines might be in freestanding programs, or combined with  other relevant software in the 3D-printing workflow. We call programs  containing one or more slice engines slicing software.  if you come into this from a machine-shop environment, slicing   Tip  software can also be thought of as computer-aided manufacturing   CaM  software.  57   Chapter 3    3D printer WorkfloW anD SoftWare  Slicing programs use different settings to allow for variations in the   geometry of the printer, the type of filament you are using, and so on. Resin  and other technologies are philosophically similar, but the differences are  big enough that we talk about them in a different section of this chapter. In  this section, we focus on filament printers.  There are many different slicing engines out there now. In most cases   they are freestanding programs or code embedded in programs that are  proprietary to a particular printer. Because getting all the settings right for  a particular 3D printer can be fiddly, a lot of manufacturers modify one  of these open source programs and create a proprietary program just for  their machine. However, many printers can still use the basic open source  program. We will describe several of those programs here, and go over  some of the commonest 3D-printer settings and what they control.  Some of the more common, freely available programs are Slic3r, Cura,  and MatterControl. Printers built around open source standards will often  make a file of settings for one of these programs available, or create a  custom program around one of these slicing engines.  Tip  Most slicing software allows you to simulate what the printer  will do during your print with a graphic to step through the layers, and  in some cases to simulate within a layer. Be sure to use this feature  to walk through every print. it will save you a lot of grief and filament.  We show some examples of this later in the chapter.   Slic3r Slic3r  pronounced “slicer”—the 3 is silent  has been around for a long  time and is maintained by an open source community led by Alessandro  Ranellucci. Its slicing engine has been incorporated into other programs over  time. Slic3r has a reputation for getting cutting-edge functionality first, which  always has pluses and minuses. You can download it at  www.slic3r.org.  58   Chapter 3    3D printer WorkfloW anD SoftWare   MatterControl MatterControl  www.mattercontrol.com  is a free program maintained by  3D printer retailer MatterHackers. As of this writing, it is in the process of a  major upgrade to version 2.0. Version 1.x combined access to Slic3r, Cura,  and its own slicing engine, MatterSlice. MatterControl 1.x is also a host  program that allows users to send single commands to a printer, jog axes,  and change extruder temperature. The update to 2.0 is planned to include  a minimal CAD program as part of the front end, and a simplification to  just its own slice engine.  Figure 3-3 is a screen shot of the current version  1.7 . By the time you  read this, it may be updated and generally available. Our book 3D Printing  With Matter Control  Apress, 2015  details the operation of version 1.x.  Figure 3-3.  Screen shot of MatterControl 1.7  59    3D printer WorkfloW anD SoftWare  Chapter 3   Ultimaker Cura 3 Utimaker Cura 3 is maintained as an open source program by 3D  manufacturer Ultimaker, and can be downloaded from https:   ultimaker.com en products ultimaker-cura-software. In 2017 a major  update to Cura 3.0 added many different control options to fine-tune  prints. We will use Ultimaker Cura 3 for the rest of the screenshot examples  in the “Using a Slicing Program” section of this chapter, with the kind  permission of Ultimaker.  in the past, Cura numbered its releases based on the year of   Note  release, ending in 2015  Cura 15.x , and then changed numbering  to Cura 2 and now Cura 3. Several 3D printer companies based their  software on one version or other of Cura 15, so that version will be  around for a while. Cura 15 is a lot simpler but very robust. the main  point here is that Cura 15 is several years older than Cura 3.   Other Programs The proliferation of 3D printers has been accompanied by a flurry of  slicing programs. Some manufacturers  like Makerbot  have their own  proprietary software. There are also printer-agnostic third-party programs  out there, like Simplify3D, which is a powerful  but not free  program that  also has some editing and mesh repair functions.   Using a Slicing Program Slicing programs typically require that you give the program both some  information about your 3D printer’s geometry  the size of the print bed,  whether it is heated or not, how tall a print can be, what size filament it   60   Chapter 3    3D printer WorkfloW anD SoftWare  uses, and so on . Often this is a file of some sort that your manufacturer  will provide. If not, you will have to guesstimate as best you can. Failing  that, you can always try the default settings in a slicer. Documentation  on the download site for the slicing program you select should walk you  through that. Once you have defined your printer, you will be facing the  daunting list of settings to select.  Different programs may call similar settings by different names, and   may change those names over time. We will not walk through step-by-  step screen shots here, since by the time you read this they may well have  changed. Instead, we will talk about the big groups of settings that you will  need to think about, and what these settings do.   Example: Ultimaker Cura 3 We give a general introduction to slicer settings here using Ultimaker Cura 3.   Like most slicing programs it requires you to input some information  about your printer, then make some selections that are related to the  material you are using, and then finally tweak some settings that might  vary model to model.  Because there are dozens of settings  and because hovering over any  setting in Custom mode gives you an explanation , we do not go through  them exhaustively here. Rather, we suggest good ways to get started and  then talk about exceptions and case studies in the later chapters of this  book.  To get started, in the menus at the top of the opening screen, click  Settings ➤ Printer ➤ Add Printer. Unless you have an Ultimaker, click  Other to see if your make and model is listed. If not, click Custom.   A first window labeled Printer will come up; input the dimensions  in  millimeters  of your printer and whether or not it has a heated platform.   61   Chapter 3    3D printer WorkfloW anD SoftWare  Then click the Extrude tab at the top of the window and input nozzle  diameter and “compatible material diameter,” which most other software  would call “filament diameter.” Start with either 2.85 for “3 millimeter”  filament, or 1.75 for anything else. Save those settings, and then you will  see a screen that looks something like Figure 3-4, but without a model  displayed in the window.  To get started, drag an STL file into the window showing an empty   platform. Figure 3-4 shows Recommended mode, which gives you a  limited number of things to change. You can use the pulldown menu to  select a material, and then select a layer height and whether or not to use  support. Cura slices a file automatically each time you change something.  Figure 3-4.  Opening screen for Ultimaker Cura 3, basic setting  62   Chapter 3    3D printer WorkfloW anD SoftWare  Tip  We use the names of settings in Ultimaker Cura 3 in this  discussion; if you use different software, the names might be a  little different. Where similar settings have very different names in  different common slicers, we will try to mention the other names you  might want to look for. We have case studies scattered throughout  the later chapters of this book. in this chapter we focus on the major  slicer settings that you are likely to need to worry about often.  You may fairly rapidly decide you want to play with more of the   settings. Select Custom to see more settings  Figure 3-5 . If you know  what a setting is called, you can search for it. Alternatively, you can click  the gears next to each of the major categories to see more options; many  settings are hidden by default, but clicking any gear lets you scroll around  all settings. Hover your cursor over a setting to see what it does, and what  else it affects. You can make a setting permanently visible by selecting what  you want to have visible by default.  63   Chapter 3    3D printer WorkfloW anD SoftWare  Figure 3-5.  Custom settings screen for Ultimaker Cura 3   Simulating Your Print You can see one of the most important tools in a slicer in Figures 3-4 and  3-5: the ability to simulate how your print will build up layer by layer. If you  select Layer View from the pulldown menu above your print, you will be  able to drag around sliders to move within a single layer, or from one layer  to the next. Even if you are an advanced 3D printer user, it is always a good  idea to walk quickly through a print to see if you forgot something, or if  something does not look remotely like you expected. In particular, look at  the very first layer of your object  the first layer beyond the raft, if you are  using a raft—see the discussion about rafts that follows  because if pieces  are missing, your print will likely fail.  64   Chapter 3    3D printer WorkfloW anD SoftWare   Print Quality and Layer Height 3D printers print each layer in one plane parallel to the build platform and  then step up and do the next layer. The extruder head moves upward, away  from the platform, after completing each layer. The two axes in the plane  of the platform are referred to as x and y, and the vertical axis is the z-axis,  as we describe in Chapter 2. Layer height is defined as the thickness of the  material in each step up of the z-axis. In Chapter 8 we discuss how to get as  smooth a surface as possible.  Caution  layer height has to be less than  not equal to!  the nozzle  diameter. about 80% of the nozzle diameter is a good maximum  value for layer height. Minimum layer height is not really dependent  on the nozzle, and is determined by other factors. We talk more about  layer height and surface smoothness in Chapter 8.   Shells In an STL file, the surface is represented by a mesh of triangles. The slicer  produces surfaces facing the sides with one or more perimeters around  each layer, and surfaces facing up or down with solid layers  or solid areas  of layers . The space inside this outer surface is then partially filled in  to make the object stronger and to create a base for the next layer. The  perimeters and solid areas are called the print’s shell. The material that the  slicing software will create for the interior support is called infill.  Your slicer will allow you to specify the thickness of the horizontal shell,   either as a number of perimeters or in millimeters  which will be rounded  to a multiple of your perimeter extrusion width . Two is typically a good  number. The width  in the x-y plane  of this perimeter is the extrusion width,  which must be no smaller than your nozzle diameter, and might be larger.  65   Chapter 3    3D printer WorkfloW anD SoftWare  You can similarly set the thickness of the vertical shell, which your slicer   might offer as a setting in millimeters or a number of top bottom solid  layers, or both. You will generally want at least three or four layers to avoid  gaps. Setting the thickness in millimeters can be advantageous because it  allows you to match your horizontal shell thickness when changing layer  heights, and because very thin layers often have more trouble bridging over  infill, so they may need the extra layers to smooth themselves out.   Platform Adhesion One of the challenges with a 3D printer is getting the model to stick to  the platform. Sometimes a model has a relatively small contact area  with the platform, and when the extruder lays down the next layer it  knocks the model loose. When that happens, the plastic that is intended  to make up subsequent layers falls in random places as the structure  gets knocked around. The resulting mess is typically called printing hair   in polite company, anyway . There are few worse feelings than smugly  demonstrating a 3D printer to your friends and then noticing that your  model is being merrily dragged around the platform, trailing strands of  filament. Techniques to prevent such bad hair days follow.  A brim expands the first layer by creating additional perimeters to increase  contact area with the platform, and is intended to be peeled away along  the edge of the print’s base. A brim usually is specified in terms of width  away from the object. A few millimeters usually make a big difference.  Figure 3-6 shows a brim stabilizing a print.  Note  experts often make the first layer of a print a lot thicker than  subsequent layers. a thick layer plus a brim can make it a lot more  likely a print with a small contact area will survive to the end.   Brims  66   Chapter 3    3D printer WorkfloW anD SoftWare  Figure 3-6.  A brim, skirt, and some bridging   Skirts  A skirt is a few loops of filament laid down at the beginning of a print  that outline all the objects being printed at a given time and show the  maximum size of the first layer of the print. You can see one in Figure 3-6;  it is the double line that does not touch the print. A skirt can solve several  problems that might be encountered at the very start of a print.  It is possible to print more than one thing at a time on a 3D printer’s   platform. The programs for arranging the objects for a print run show you  where the prints will be positioned relative to each other. However, it is  always possible to create something that would wind up too big to print,  since the  virtual  version can be hanging off the platform. When the skirt  is drawn around all the objects that you are planning on printing, it allows  you to quickly see whether there are any problems so you can stop the  print right away.  Also, if you have just switched filaments from one color to another, it   is good to print something away from your object first so that any material  of a different color that is still in the nozzle is melted out before starting to  print the main object. Plastic may also ooze out of the nozzle after a print,  or while heating up for the next one, which can leave a void that causes  a delay before plastic starts coming out again. Generally, a skirt allows  the printer to finish filling the extruder with filament  known as priming   before the main object starts printing.  67   Chapter 3    3D printer WorkfloW anD SoftWare  The skirt is usually a few millimeters away from the location on the   platform where the first layer of the main object being printed will reside.  By the time a few loops are done, any previous filament should also be  flushed out of the nozzle. Most programs allow the user to specify both the  distance that the skirt is from the main model and the number of loops  constituting the skirt.  Tip  add a few loops to the skirt when you change to a light- colored  filament after printing a previous print with a dark filament. Doing  so clears out the nozzle so there will not be any mixing of colors and  resulting staining of your print.   Rafts  When you look at the lists of settings in a slicing program you may see  options for a raft. A raft is a few layers of support material underneath a  print. In the early days of 3D printing, when beds were often uneven and  there were no heated platforms, rafts could help prints stick better. This  practice has largely gone out of favor since a good first layer and perhaps a  brim are a better combination on a modern printer.  A raft is a good solution if a print does not have many contact points   with the bed and you want to be sure it will not fall off—for example, a  large object that you do not want to fail midway through a 12-hour print.  Rafts are also useful if you need the bottom surface to be dimensionally  accurate, since direct contact with an uneven platform can leave it slightly  skewed or not entirely flat.  The bottom layer of a raft is printed with extrusion lines that are not  only taller than a normal layer, but wider so that they have more contact  area with the platform. The larger volume of plastic being pushed out of  the nozzle also makes the print less sensitive to being a little too far from  the platform surface in some areas, whereas having the nozzle further from   68   Chapter 3    3D printer WorkfloW anD SoftWare  the surface reduces the risk of jamming the extruder or even damaging the  nozzle or the platform by getting too close in others.  Modern slicers give you the ability to do this without a raft by using  a setting called “initial layer line width” or “first layer extrusion width.”  In conjunction with the initial layer height setting, this allows you to  configure the first layer of your print to stick like a raft’s base layer, without  the added time or wasted plastic. Because you will be putting out a lot  more plastic at once, it a good idea to slow this layer down significantly if  you are going to use these features, to prevent jams, and slower printing  is good for first layer adhesion anyway. If you are using these features and  decide that a print needs a raft, be sure to set them closer to your normal  printing settings—otherwise you will be increasing adhesion to the raft,  and you may not be able to get it off!   Supporting and Orienting a Model Consumer 3D printers build up their models from a platform, whether the  extruder is fixed and the platform drops away or the extruder head moves  up and away from a platform. This means that in some cases, a print head  would be laying down material in air. For example, imagine a statue with an  outstretched arm. Assuming that the statue is being printed up from its base,  the initial bottom layers of the arm would print into the air and fall down  unless something was printed into the open space all the way up from the  platform. Material printed like this is called support. Sometimes this problem  can be minimized or eliminated altogether by printing the model in a  different orientation. This section talks about these interacting considerations.   Support  In a 3D print, the first layer sticks to the platform. Then the second layer  is added above that, and so on, like a brick wall. The printer depends on  having something below the nozzle to compress the extrusion against,  much like the mortar between bricks. In the case of the wall, if there are   69   Chapter 3    3D printer WorkfloW anD SoftWare  no bricks under the second layer  or at least some bricks partially lapped  under it , the second layer of brick will fall to the ground. If you want  to lay bricks across the top of an opening in the wall, like a window or  doorway, you need a scaffolding to support them as you are building.  For  exceptions to this, see the section on bridging later in this chapter.    In 3D printing, the structures that prevent the equivalent problem  are called support  Figure 3-7 . The slicing process generates support  automatically in some programs, and with some user control in others. In  general, it is best to avoid support if possible because removing it is  time-  consuming and the process of pulling it off can damage the model. Unless  you are using a second soluble print material as support, you will then  need to remove the support mechanically. You may need needle-nosed  pliers, a screwdriver, and ultimately tweezers or other small tool to take off  the last bits, as discussed in Chapter 5  plus some eye protection—those  bits can be sharp .  Figure 3-7.  A model with support  70   Chapter 3    3D printer WorkfloW anD SoftWare   Orientation  A particular model may seem to have a side that is “supposed” to be the  bottom of the model. Sometimes, though, turning a model so that it lies on  its side or even upside-down can increase the first-layer contact with the  platform and decrease the amount of support. Particularly if you are going  to be printing the object more than once, spending some time playing with  the orientation of a complex model is worthwhile.  A bit of thought can sometimes also eliminate support that the slicing  software would automatically create in hard-to-get-at places, like internal  narrow spaces. Sometimes turning a complicated object through some  arbitrary rotation—for example, 10 degrees about the x-axis, and 15  degrees about the y-axis —will result in the best situation with the least  support needed.  Printers that can only use one filament at a time print support in   the same material as the rest of the model. Printers that have multiple  extruders can lay a dissolvable filament, though this process is often more  costly, time-consuming, and error-prone than using your print material.  In addition to not needing supports, surfaces that are close to vertical   will have less obvious layer lines than ones that are close to horizontal,  because the distance along the surface from one layer line to the next is  shorter. This makes the surface appear smoother and allows fine details in  the design to show  some of which the slicer might otherwise have to omit  because they are less than two extrusions wide , so you should consider  this as well when reorienting a model. Figure 3-8 shows a print that was  created vertically  gravitational waves, from our 2017 Apress book, 3D  Printed Science Projects, Volume 2 .  71   Chapter 3    3D printer WorkfloW anD SoftWare  Figure 3-8.  Gravitational wave model, printed vertically   Avoiding Support by Cutting a Model into Pieces  For an object with a complex surface that requires support, sometimes you  can cut the object into two or more pieces, print the pieces cut-side-down,  and then glue the parts together later. Some CAD programs have tools to  make this sort of cut. If the program you are using does not, there are a  few free or open source programs that allow the user to rotate an object  around all three axes and then make a cut along a resulting convenient  axis. Because this is a rapidly evolving area, search online for “cutting STL  files free software.” Often printed support can be avoided entirely with  one judicious cut. After printing, the halves will have to be glued together.  Chapter 8 discusses paint, glue, and finishing.  72   Chapter 3    3D printer WorkfloW anD SoftWare   Managing Internal Open Space Just as there is open space around the outside of a model  like the statue’s  outstretched arm mentioned earlier  similar problems arise inside a model  or in space enclosed by a model. Imagine a closed box: it would need some  sort of support to run between the top and bottom. This support is called  infill. Sometimes it is not necessary to have infill everywhere, and you can  get away with just stringing filament across  usually  small gaps, a process  called bridging. This section gives you some ideas about the design issues  that arise with internal support.   Bridging  It is possible to bridge across open areas in a model without support if  the open area is not too wide  say, less than 20–30 mm, depending on  your printer’s cooling fans and other factors . There are several schools of  thought about the best settings to use when bridging across a gap. On the  one hand, having the printer move more slowly than usual while trying to  increase filament flow rate slightly may result in the bridge sagging a little.  Conversely, having the printer move faster and push out less may mean  the filament will not stretch enough to cross the open area and will break.  Finding an optimum between the two requires some experimentation with  your printer.  Some slicing programs have settings for adjusting speed and flow of  plastic specifically for bridging. Defaulting these settings to the rate the  slicing program creates is a good place to start.  Another way to get around bridging is to terrace or arc under the  bridged area so that the printer is in fact just climbing a 45-degree  or  shallower  slope underneath. An overhang climbing at about a 45-degree  angle is about the limit that can be consistently printed without support.  However, sometimes a steeper slope will work with some combinations  of settings; a bit of experimentation is often worthwhile to avoid needing   73   Chapter 3    3D printer WorkfloW anD SoftWare  to use support, particularly in a complex structure. If bridges are too long,  though, as with the print in Figure 3-6, the bridge may sag a bit or have  drooled bits of filament on it.   Infill  Users of 3D printers do not usually want to create solid objects, because  that uses a lot of filament. However, typically objects cannot be hollow,  either, because upper layers would be printed in air.  Exceptions to this are  discussed in Chapter 8.  As a result, most slicing software creates internal  support called infill inside the solid surfaces of an object to minimize  filament use  as well as to make the print faster . Figure 3-9 shows typical  infill patterns.  Another purpose of using infill patterns  as opposed to printing solid   plastic , and possibly the most important one for some materials, is to  control shrinkage. Infill patterns are sparse enough to stretch axially as  they shrink radially so that they do not pull the perimeters inward as they  cool and shrink. This can make 3D-printed parts maintain dimensional  accuracy much better than injection-molded parts, which have to be  designed with a significantly different size and shape from the final part in  order to turn out the way the designer intends after shrinkage.  74   Chapter 3    3D printer WorkfloW anD SoftWare  Figure 3-9.  Typical infill patterns  Print infill is usually specified in terms of percentage fill. So, 12% infill   means that 12% of the interior volume of the object will be occupied by  material and 88% will be open.  This percentage does not include the outer  perimeter of the print.   Although infill adds some strength by bracing the interior of the object   against collapsing, most of the print’s strength comes from the solid  surfaces, and if you want to make a print stronger, it is usually better to  increase the thickness of the skin rather than increasing infill. Compared  to printing completely hollow, infill is more important for its ability to  act as a support structure for a model’s internal overhangs, to prevent  sagging or gaps in the top surface of a print. Most slicers have some more  exotic options for infill patterns, but unless you are printing with a highly  transparent filament, these patterns are unlikely to be visible once the  print has finished.  75   Chapter 3    3D printer WorkfloW anD SoftWare  For the best results with top surfaces, you want a pattern that is   very regular and not too sparse where it meets that surface, since overly  large gaps often result either in sagging or pillowing between infill lines   Figure 3-10 . Pillowing occurs when instead of drooping downward where  it is unsupported by infill, the plastic curls upward, and it is an especially  common failure mode when printing thinner layers. Adding more solid top  layers helps to even these surfaces out, but for very small prints, you may  find that this uses more plastic than just using a higher infill density.  Figure 3-10.  Pillowing on a 20 mm cube  Although there are now some infill patterns that are designed to create   3D structures within a model, most are the same every layer or print in  different directions on alternating layers. This means that the shape and  size of the gaps between lines will be consistent when they intersect with  the top and bottom surfaces. But why do those surfaces need to be solid?  If you think of a square filled with a grid of squares, it would be fairly easy  to crush that shape by applying force to opposite corners. You can brace   76   Chapter 3    3D printer WorkfloW anD SoftWare  it with a triangular grid instead, but filling the front and back faces is  even more effective, so strength is rarely a big factor in the choice of infill  patterns.  There is such a thing as a print created without top and bottom solid   layers. Vase mode prints  Chapter 8  omit the infill and top layers to turn a  solid model into a vessel that is open on top.  Note  printing solid  100% infill  is a special case, and we discuss  the issues and printer settings relevant to that in Chapter 8.   Retraction and Stringing  One of the big advantages of 3D printing is that complex shapes that might  be impossible to create via traditional machining can often be made very  easily on a 3D printer. But there are some features that are challenging to  3D print—with a consumer printer, anyway. For example, one thing that  can be difficult to print is an object with two skinny towers. To “leave out”  the space between the towers, the extruder needs to pump out material to  make one tower, stop extruding, and start up again on the other tower. This  is referred to as retraction. When retraction is not adequate, the print may  have fine hairs of filament scattered across the spaces that were supposed  to be open; this is referred to as stringing  Figure 3-11 .  77   Chapter 3    3D printer WorkfloW anD SoftWare  Figure 3-11.  Stringing  Retraction is typically handled as an automatic feature in slicing   software with some limited user control. In Cura, there are many settings  to fine-tune retraction under the Material heading. Also, in the Travel  section, you can tick a box to allow combing. This is a way to avoid  retracting if printing sparse or complex infill might otherwise require it. It  does not matter if infill strings a bit, because it will only be visible inside  the model when the model is complete. Doing a lot of retraction can  wear on the filament in some printer configurations and slows down the  printing process, so avoiding it where possible is a big plus.   Temperatures You may find that you need to tweak settings as you print in different  materials. The temperature of your extruder  and your heated build  platform, if yours has a heater  will vary with the materials. In Chapter 2 we  talked about the requirements for several common materials. The reality  is that every time you use a new brand  or even color  of filament, you may  need to experiment a bit.  78   Chapter 3    3D printer WorkfloW anD SoftWare  In Cura 3, temperatures are under the Materials section. There are a   bunch of temperatures you can change, but to start just make them all the  same as each other. Filament spools usually suggest a temperature range.  In the absence of other information from your experience or manufacturer,  just start in the middle of the range. Too hot can result in stringing or  blobby prints; too cool can result in poor adhesion between layers and the  platform or between two layers.  Be sure that your nozzle and platform can handle the temperature you  are asking them to reach. Printers have very limited error checking, and it  is possible to damage your printer by telling components to get hotter than  they are rated for.   Speeds, Cooling, Extrusion Multipliers Your slicer will include several settings for speeds of a print. Unless the  slicer specifies otherwise, all of its speeds are speeds of linear motion.  This is the maximum speed that the printer will move for this portion of  the print, but acceleration my not allow it to reach that speed, and cooling  settings may also limit it.  Travel speeds control how fast the printer moves when it is moving   between parts without extruding. This should generally be set as fast as the  machine can handle, since going slower will not only increase print time, it  will allow more time for plastic to ooze out of the nozzle in areas where you  do not want it.  Most slicers also include several different printing speeds. Perimeters,  infill, and solid surfaces all generally have their own printing speeds. You  may be tempted to speed up your print by printing the infill quickly and  slowing down the outer perimeters to get smoother motion—be careful,  because residual pressure in the nozzle might cause a blob where the  perimeter starts. The one place it is always good to set a slower speed is for   79   Chapter 3    3D printer WorkfloW anD SoftWare  the first layer, because slowing it down helps with platform adhesion and  reduces the chances of something bad happening if the platform is not  aligned perfectly.  In Cura 3, the Minimum Layer Time setting tells the slicer to reduce  speeds if a layer will take less than the specified time to complete. This  is done to allow time for the plastic to cool before printing another  layer on top of it. If the plastic does not cool sufficiently, you can get a  misshapen blob of plastic instead of the fine features of your model. There  are also settings to control the speed of fans pointed down at your print.  Depending on the strength of your fans, you may be able to cool the plastic  faster, allowing lower values for minimum layer time to be used.  If your print has a single narrow feature at the top, minimum layer time  might not be able to do its job because the plastic stays in contact with the  hot nozzle and does not have a chance to cool. In this case, printing two  of your object at once or adding a cylinder the same height as your print   known as a cooling tower  will give the printer something else to do so  that it moves away from that feature and allows it to cool properly.  The speed at which plastic is pushed out is controlled by the   combination of this speed and the specified layer height and extrusion  width according to a calculation of volume. The slicer needs to know the  diameter of the filament so it knows how much volume of plastic is in one  millimeter of it. If this calculation results in the wrong volume of plastic,  usually because the extruder is not properly calibrated, the Flow setting,  otherwise known as an Extrusion Multiplier, gives you a fudge factor to  tweak this calculation.   More Exotic Settings Settings often interact with each other, and the details of a particular case  matter. We have relegated talking about some of the more exotic options— like printing vases or printing solid, transparent objects—to the case  studies in Chapter 8, where we discuss arts applications.  80   Chapter 3    3D printer WorkfloW anD SoftWare   Troubleshooting Troubleshooting a print that does not look right is a complex subject.  In this chapter we are summarizing some of the big categories of slicer  settings. In later chapters we will go over some case studies and go into  more depth for particular types of prints there. Table 3-1 shows a quick  guide to where to find solutions to different types of issues.  Tip  Joan and rich have courses on lynda.com linkedin learning  that go into greater detail on these topics. You can find them by going  to lynda.com and searching on our names.  Table 3-1.

Typically, this works by printing  all of them in parallel. The first layers of all parts are printed before the  second layer of any part starts.  81   Chapter 3    3D printer WorkfloW anD SoftWare  Some slicers offer a sequential printing option as well, which allows  you to print one object and then print another on an unused part of the  print bed. This requires careful arrangement, though, to ensure that no  other part of the printer will collide with the parts that have already been  completed. This prevents you from using as much of the space as you can  when printing all at once.   Multiple Extruders A printer with more than one extruder allows you to print in multiple  colors or materials. Exactly how this works depends a lot on the multiple-  extruder machine in question, but this general guide will give you some  ideas on how to get started with your machine. This usually does not mean  you can print faster, since only one extruder can be active at once  though  as of this writing, there are experimental machines that are designed to  work this way, based on Autodesk’s Project Escher . Rather, a printer with  multiple extruders usually cannot move them entirely independently, so  only one can be used at a time.  Some machines have multiple nozzles mounted to a single toolhead   so that they move together, and simply offset the toolhead’s position when  they are using one nozzle or the other. Others use various types of splitter  mechanisms to run filament from several different extruder mechanisms  through a common nozzle. Still others have somewhat independent  motion that allows one extruder to be parked to one side of the machine  while the other is working. One company, Mosaic Manufacturing, even  sells an add-on device that cuts and splices filament before feeding it to  the printer.  Printers that use a single nozzle are generally only useful for printing   multiple colors, since materials with different properties usually need  different printing temperatures, and may not play well with the switching  mechanisms. Though some attempts have been made at color mixing,   82   Chapter 3    3D printer WorkfloW anD SoftWare  most of these are only able to switch filaments automatically, so creating  a gradient of color usually is not possible. Single-nozzle solutions usually  result in a lighter toolhead that can handle high acceleration better than  multi-nozzle ones, and have the advantage of avoiding ooze from the  inactive nozzle and various alignment issues.  Those with multiple extruders, each with their own nozzle, can use   the second one to print a soluble support material, or a flexible material to  have a mixture of print properties. Some of these also have software that  allows them to be used in duplication mode, where two identical objects   which must be smaller than the distance between the nozzles  are printed  simultaneously.  If the machine is able to move the two extruders independently in   one axis  known as independent dual extruder, or IDEX, machines , their  duplication mode can usually use half of the platform for each copy.  However, multiple nozzles on a single carriage are usually situated as close  as possible to one another, leading to much stricter limits on these modes.  Some IDEX printers even have a mirror duplication mode, in which the  motion of the independent axis is reversed to create copies that are mirror  images of one another  like a pair of shoes .  One common use of dual-extruder machines is to use one of the   extruders to print support material that can be dissolved away later. To  use one of these systems for dissolvable support, you need to configure  the slicer to print its support with a different extruder, and make sure that  extruder has appropriate settings for your support material.  When you are printing models in two colors  or two materials , you need   to follow a somewhat different process than printing dissolvable support,  or printing in one material. To do this, you need to create two STL files that  represent the areas of the print that are to be printed with each color.  You also have to split your model into two STL files so that there are   no places with structure created with both colors trying to occupy the  space. If something penetrates something else, there must be a hole in the  one object to accommodate the second, just as in physical space. These   83   Chapter 3    3D printer WorkfloW anD SoftWare  files then need to be interleaved into an .AMF file. Note that any rotation  needed when arranging the files for printing has to be done in the STL file  generation. We walk through an example in detail in Chapter 6.  if you are using a dual-extruder 3D printer to print two colors   Tip  and, on top of that, support is needed, you will need to pick one of the  extruders to do the support for both materials.   Mesh Repair Programs Sometimes a mesh  the type of data found in an STL file  comes into the  slicing program with issues, and the sliced file does not look like you would  expect. Some CAD programs create models that are not watertight  the  boundary of the shape would not hold water because it has holes in it .  Some models are not manifold, which means that two parts of the model  in the computer are trying to occupy the same physical space. This is not  a problem in a computer model, but can have unexpected results when  the slicer program tries to reconcile conflicts into something that will work  physically. If your model does weird things when you slice it, you might  need to repair the mesh.  There are several programs that work well to repair meshes, or to   reduce the number of triangles that make up the mesh surface. Sometimes  a model can be computationally so big that it can overwhelm the program,  and you need to cut down  decimate, in the lingo  on the number of  triangles. Sometimes, too, you want to cut a model in half to make it easier  to print, and then glue it together. Some mesh repair programs let you do  that, too.  The venerable Meshlab  www.meshlab.net  is an open source, very  powerful program. But it is not particularly intuitive, although its 2016  update has a good web page with some instructions. To clean up a mesh,   84   Chapter 3    3D printer WorkfloW anD SoftWare  open the program and click File ➤ Import Mesh to bring in your STL file.  Then just agree to its cleanup suggestions and use File ➤ Export as to send  it back out it again  be sure to select STL, which is not the default .  To use it to decimate a mesh, click Filters ➤ Remeshing, Simplification  and Reconstruction ➤ Simplification: Quadric Edge Collapse Decimation,  which we are sure you would have guessed on your own. Then you can  see how many vertices all the triangles add up to and suggest a smaller  number. Or in the box Percentage reduction type a number between 0 and  1 to reduce it—typing 0.5 drops the number of vertices by 50%. Click the  Apply button to have your changes take effect. The program will display  what it did. If you like it, you can use File ➤ Export As to save your changes.  If not, just abandon the effort and start over.  If the free software is not enough for you, you can look into Simplify3D    described earlier in this chapter  or Netfabb  www.autodesk.com  products netfabb overview . Chapter 6 also discusses how to create  good meshes in the first place.   G-code Most open source, filament-using 3D printers are controlled with a series  of commands, called G-code. G-code loads onto the printer from a host  computer via USB port, wifi, or other network connection, or is read from  an SD card or USB drive, depending on which options a particular machine  has. The firmware  software running on the printer itself  then interprets the  G-code one command at a time and controls the hardware functions needed  to execute it. Status information  temperatures and the like  returns to the  user’s computer through the USB. In some other cases, a G-code interpreter  runs on a host computer, and control signals are sent to the printer.  Many open source printers use Marlin firmware, which runs on  Arduino-compatible microcontrollers. There is no operating system  running on a microcontroller in system architectures like the Arduino.    85   Chapter 3    3D printer WorkfloW anD SoftWare  The processing hardware performs minimal command retrieval buffering  and interpretation functions, and returns requested signals to the user.  There are variations on this theme: for example, some printers can read  from an SD card rather than needing to use a USB port.  G-code is a very old programming language originally designed to  control machine tools with a computer. Its origins are in the 1950s and  1960s and it has survived this long because of its flexibility and ability  to run with minimal computing power. G-code is very low-level and is  typically written such that all the commands are interpreted one at a time  sequentially. Typical G-code functions include commanding an extruder  to heat up to a particular temperature, instructing the printer to pause  until an extruder reaches a certain temperature, moving the extruder to  some  x, y, z  position, and conducting similar activities.  G-code for machine tools evolved gradually, with different dialects for  each tool manufacturer. A standard of sorts called RS274D stabilized in the  mid-1980s. Because the computer numerical control  CNC  market was  pretty stable when the first low-cost 3D printers came along, a lot of the  early users borrowed firmware and concepts to program those machines,  and so a G-code dialect for 3D printers developed.  Each line of G-code commands the printer to do some small task or  to set some parameter to a value that will be used for a task later on. For  example, the snippet of code in the example that follows first sets the units  that the firmware will use for calculation to millimeters  G21 . It then tells  the firmware to use absolute, not relative, coordinates  G90 . The G1 ...   command advances the extruder to position  3.000, 8.111, 4.444 .  During that move, 0.1234 mm of filament will have extruded, relative to the  last time the zero point was reset; resets occur periodically during a print.   Retractions are negative E values.   G21 G90 G1 X3.000 Y8.111 Z4.444 E0.1234  86   Chapter 3    3D printer WorkfloW anD SoftWare  The firmware interpolates the movements required to get from one  absolute position to the next and similarly determines how to feed the  filament to extrude the requested amount before the next step. Millimeters  of filament moved is currently the most common unit for the E values, but  some machines have begun the switch to units of volume instead.  Not all G-codes begin with G. For example, codes beginning with M are  used  with some variation among manufacturers  for most functions that  are not directly related to movement of the axes. M104 is commonly used  in open source printers to set the extruder temperature to a particular  value. M140 sets the temperature of heated build platforms—in the  example following this paragraph, to 115 degrees C. M109 waits for the  temperature of the extruder to reach the specified level, and M190 waits for  the temperature of the heated platform to reach the specified temperature.   Note that though the code is usually written as shown in the example,  M109 and M190 do not need to have a temperature specified. If none is  given, then the temperature that was set with M140 and M104 commands  will be used.   Tip  each line of G-code needs to be on one line  no newlines . a  semicolon on the line makes the rest of the line a comment  see the  example that follows .  M104 S210 ;comments here M140 S115 M109 S210 M190 S115  Printers with multiple extruders need to address lines of G-code to  the correct extruder. This is done with a tool change command, T. For  example, in the case of most open source dual-extruder printers, T0 will  select the first extruder, and T1 will select the second extruder  following   87   Chapter 3    3D printer WorkfloW anD SoftWare  the common computing convention of beginning to count at zero . A T0  code will cause everything that follows to be executed on extruder 1. Some  G-codes allow a Tx to be appended on the same line to show that just that  command is for extruder x.  Tip  a list of 3D-printer G-codes and a detailed discussion of their  functions is available at http:  reprap.org wiki G-code.  In Chapter 5, we discuss how it is sometimes useful to be able to type   in these low-level codes to debug possible hardware failures  such as  blocked extruders or lack of connection to the printer  or to change the  G-code built by your slicing program. Sometimes it is convenient to test  that the printer is working correctly with a few simple commands rather  than a complex G-code file.   Host Programs Programs that give you an interactive interface to control your 3D printer  are called host programs. They allow you to upload a whole file of G-code  commands to create a print, or to send single commands when that is  needed. Most 3D printers have a USB port that allows you to connect  them to software running on a computer to stream instructions in real  time. This is useful for manual control  used for maintenance operations,  for instance , but it is not the best way to run a long-running print. If the  computer goes to sleep, or you move your laptop and the cable comes out,  hours of printing can be wasted.  Today, most printers have an option to store G-code  or whatever   format the printer uses for its instructions  on the printer so that it can run  untethered. Most often, this is done with an SD card  or microSD , though  there are now some printers that use a USB stick or have onboard storage  that you can upload to via a wifi connection. It is possible to upload to   88   Chapter 3    3D printer WorkfloW anD SoftWare  an SD card over USB, but for complex prints, that can take several hours  because the protocols that 8-bit microcontrollers use for USB and SD card  access are much slower than the ones your computer uses to communicate  with the SD card directly. If your printer uses an SD card, you will want to  take the card out and transfer files to it directly from your computer. Those  that have wifi usually have faster protocols, but it may still be faster to  move the SD card.  Many slicing programs have a limited host functionality to allow you   to either save a G-code file to an SD card or upload it to a printer. Some  allow you to send single-command controls to move an axis and so on,  and others are limited to just uploading. MatterControl and Ultimaker  Cura  discussed earlier  allow both.    Octoprint If your printer only has USB, or if you really want wifi control but your printer  did not come with it, there is an option. Octoprint  www.octoprint.org  is  a printer host program that is accessed through a web interface, and it also  has an API that many desktop host programs now support. It is designed  to run on a computer without a keyboard or monitor that is permanently  connected to the printer’s USB. Although it is possible to run the Octoprint  server on a Mac or Windows PC, it is designed to run on inexpensive  single-board computers like the Raspberry Pi.   Resin Printers There is surprisingly little commonality between printing with filament  and with plastic. Within resin printers, too, there are some big differences  between the two major technologies: SLA cures the resin one small spot  at a time. DLP cures an entire layer at a time. Typically, the laser for either  one shines in through an optical window at the bottom of a tray of resin,   89   Chapter 3    3D printer WorkfloW anD SoftWare  and a layer forms on the window. The window is then mechanically  separated from the print by moving the print, the tray, or some  combination to separate them.  Support is still necessary with a resin print. However, most print  upside-down, so support is needed both to keep the print adhering  correctly to the platform, and to resist the forces encountered when the  print is peeled off the window. One might think that a print should just be  printed upside-down from the way you would print it with filament, but it  is more complex than that.  The first layer is tricky, because there is very little room between the   platform and the optical window. Often people orient their resin prints to  rest  upside-down  on top of a bed of thin support with a sacrificial solid  layer on the build platform.  Another issue that makes slicing resin prints tricky is that exposure  time and other parameters can depend critically on the characteristics  of the resin. This and the fact that creating support is more challenging  to think about have resulted in many resin printers having proprietary  interfaces. Formlabs has a software package called PreForm, for instance.  A screenshot of a print with typical support is shown in Figure 3-12.  PreForm allows you to create custom supports too if the defaults are not  exactly what you wanted. Note that this is the same model shown  with  filament-printer supports  in Figure 3-7, so you can do some comparisons.  90   Chapter 3    3D printer WorkfloW anD SoftWare  Figure 3-12.  Screen shot from PreForm  courtesy of Formlabs   When printing in a liquid, you also have to worry about bubbles  forming. If any air gets trapped in the print as it forms, that can result  in voids in the print since nothing will harden there. Prints have to be  designed and oriented carefully to allow a way for air to escape.  For DLP printers that do not have proprietary software, there are a few   options, notably Datatree3D’s Creation Workshop  needs a paid license  fee, https:  datatree3d.com software  . Alternatively, NanoDLP    www.nanodlp.com download   runs on a Raspberry Pi and is free to users.  91   Chapter 3    3D printer WorkfloW anD SoftWare   Summary This chapter reviewed the overall workflow of 3D printing, with a  particular focus on the process of slicing a model into layers. It discussed  different software packages that are available for the process, and some of  the many settings that are available to tweak for the best print. The chapter  focused primarily on filament-based 3D printers, with a summary of key  difference for resin printers.  92   PART II  Living with Your   3D Printer  Part II  Chapters 4–6  review how to decide what kind of printer you need  to buy, based on what you want to build with it and what materials you  think you will want to be able to use. This part also reviews what kinds  of facilities different 3D printers require and offers hands-on details of  dealing with issues that might arise during a print. Finally, this part reviews  options that you can use to create 3D-printable model files.   CHAPTER 4  Selecting a Printer:  Comparing  Technologies  There are now hundreds of different models of 3D printer on the market. But  how do you even start to think about which one to buy? In this chapter, we will  look at what 3D printer features are likely to be important for your intended  uses, and also discuss how to estimate the long-term cost of ownership.  Because 3D printer models  and even manufacturers  come and go   on a pretty regular basis, we will avoid suggesting particular models. Once  you know what you are looking for, you can be a more skeptical reader of  advertisements. You can also be more confident that you will purchase  what you will need.  In Chapter 2 we review different types of 3D printer hardware, and   in Chapter 3, of software. Refer back to those chapters if you are not sure  about terminology. We cover selected hardware decisions here in the  context of deciding what to purchase, but you should read the prior two  chapters first for the full details of what part of the printer does what.  In Chapter 5, we talk about what happens when you bring the printer   into its new home. That should drive your buying decisions, too. The space  your printer will live in, who will maintain it, and how often you intend to  move it are things you should think about before settling on a model.    Joan Horvath, Rich Cameron 2018  J.

Cameron, Mastering 3D Printing in the Classroom, Library, and Lab,   https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-3501-0_4  95   Chapter 4    SeleCting a printer: Comparing teChnologieS   Who Is Your User? The first thing to consider with a printer purchase is how it will be used.  If it is going to be in a home office and used occasionally by one adult,  obviously it will not need to be as robust as if it is going to be in a room full  of kids.  Most 3D printers are labeled for ages 13 and up, and on average that is  probably about when it makes sense to let kids run them. There are a few  that are marketed specifically for kids to use directly, but those machines  needed to make tradeoffs to be able to do that  limiting functionality  that  might or might not make sense. Typically, an adult will manage the printer  hardware for the younger set because there are hot moving parts involved.  Before your purchase, imagine a day in the life of the printer and    have that scenario in mind as you read through this chapter and Chapter 5.   Many academic labs have huge pulses in use around deadlines, so  consider both your routine periods and your peak weeks.   3D Printer Resolution When you buy a conventional printer to print on paper, you can note a few  familiar metrics about how good the image quality will be, often stated  in dots per inch  dpi . However, in the case of a 3D printer, it is a little  more complicated. You are dealing with somewhat different processes  in the cross-layer direction  usually vertically, the z-axis  versus the two  dimensions in the plane of the build platform  x- and y-axes .  3D printers often quote their resolution in the z-axis  the vertical one   as a number in millimeters  or microns—one millimeter is 1,000 microns ;  this is equivalent to the thinnest layer the printer can produce. Typically,  this number is better  smaller  than the feature size in the x-y plane. It also  is a good proxy for how smooth the surface will be. For most filament- based  3D-printing technologies, resolution is typically on the order of 0.1 mm,   96   Chapter 4    SeleCting a printer: Comparing teChnologieS  or 100 microns. For practical reasons, such as the fact that smaller layers  require a longer print time, going that low can be challenging. Beyond  about 0.1 mm, the print time increase is usually much more noticeable  than the difference in quality, so even if your printer claims 0.05 mm  resolution or better, for practical reasons, you will usually end up using  0.1 mm or larger layers.  For 3D printers that use plastic filament, that plastic is being heated  and squeezed out of a nozzle that is typically about half a millimeter in  diameter. This string of plastic can be compressed between the nozzle and  the previous layer down to that 0.1 mm thickness  or even smaller  in the z  direction, but in the x-y plane it cannot be thinner than the diameter of the  nozzle. The printer’s control over the placement of these lines is much finer  though—usually significantly better than 0.1 mm.  Comparisons of claims about resolution in the x-y plane for these  machines are mostly meaningless because of the way the motors are  controlled and how that interacts with extrusion on small scales.  Furthermore, the shape of each layer must be enclosed by a perimeter   that is a closed loop, so features need to be at least two extrusion widths  thick in that plane, or about 1 mm across.  There are exceptions to this  through software that allows you to create single-width sections, but as  a practical matter you may not want to.  So, you may find that your “50  micron” printer really is limited to features about 20 times that big, just  because that resolution does not really apply in all three dimensions!  Figure 4-1 shows how thick layers  in the foreground  might not be   able to fill a curved surface completely compared to thinner ones. The real  benefit of higher resolution  of thinner layers  is that the deviations from a  smooth surface where one layer transitions to the next are smaller. All other  things being equal, this means that a higher resolution print has smoother  surfaces with sharper edges. Corners in the x-y plane still will not have a  radius smaller than half the nozzle diameter, though. Thus, whether a finer  resolution actually makes smaller features visible depends on the print’s  orientation with respect to the x-y plane, as you can see in Figure 4- 1.  97   Chapter 4    SeleCting a printer: Comparing teChnologieS  Figure 4-1.  Resolution showing effects of layer thickness   Selecting a Printer Two of the most critical questions when you are thinking about buying  a 3D printer are who is going to use it, and what they are going to use it  for. Art projects and robotics teams have different materials needs, for  example. In later chapters, we go into this in some depth for different types  of users, but here we will summarize the aspects that affect a purchasing  decision. We have organized this section around the choices of features  that you need to make when buying a 3D printer.   Filament vs. Resin The main choice facing most educational and scientific users is whether to  buy a 3D printer that uses spools of plastic as a raw material, or one that uses  liquid resin. Filament printers are still far more prevalent and diverse, so we  focus on them more here. A filament printer will be more practical for most  users because the raw material is relatively easy to store and transport, and  there is very little waste. The main drawback with a filament printer is that,   98   Chapter 4    SeleCting a printer: Comparing teChnologieS  as noted in the discussion of resolution, the smallest feature you can print  is about twice your nozzle diameter—about a millimeter for typical 0.35 to  0.5 mm nozzles. That is plenty fine enough resolution for many things, but it  is usually a little too coarse for jewelry or other delicate structures.  Resin printers  which come in several types, as discussed in Chapter 2    can create prints with smaller feature sizes since they are only really  limited by the spot size of a laser or the pixel size of a projector. Print  volume, though, also tends to be correspondingly small, and except for  exotic, very expensive technologies, resin printing is significantly slower  than filament printing  individual layers might be faster, but those layers  are usually thinner, requiring more of them to print a given part .  The resin and the cleanup chemicals are messy and will have to be   managed and disposed of. If you can handle that and you are looking  at doing sophisticated projects that require fine detail, you may want to  explore resin printers. If in doubt, buy a low-cost filament printer and get  some experience there first.  We are going to assume in this chapter that if you want to go to   the more sophisticated technologies described in Chapter 2, you will  have good reasons and a specialized problem to solve. We will not  explore powder-based, composite, and the more expensive and exotic  technologies in the purchase tradeoffs in this chapter.   Time to Print 3D printers build up objects one layer at time. Typically, this layer is about  as thick as one or two sheets of paper. This means that 3D prints take a  long time. Often 3D printers are purchased by people with little or no  exposure to traditional manufacturing, and the expectation is that the  print will pop off the platform in the time it takes to print a page with ink.  Making anything with a subtractive tool takes surprisingly long, too; precise  manufacture of physical things is just inherently slow. Think how long it  takes to build a brick wall, or for that matter, to paint a mural on one.  99   Chapter 4    SeleCting a printer: Comparing teChnologieS  Tip  print times will drive a lot of your workflow and probably  narrow the types of projects that will be feasible in a school or library  environment. a fist-sized print may take from several hours to a day  to print, depending on a lot of things. as we note later in this section,  smaller printers are often faster, if the thing you want to make will fit  in the smaller build volume.   Selecting a Filament-Based 3D Printer For most educational users, the basic decision will be which filament-  based 3D printer to purchase, so we will focus most of our analysis on that  topic in the following sections. For a discussion of the different types of  resin printers on the market as of this writing, see Chapter 3.   Platforms and Nozzles Whether or not your printer has a heated platform will determine what  types of materials you can print. To determine what materials you want to  print, consider the intended uses of your 3D prints. The first question is  whether you want to create functional parts—parts that will be under some  sort of load, like a motor mount on a robot.  Pretty much all the printers that use filament can print in polylactic acid    PLA , the biodegradable corn-based plastic we talk about in Chapter 2.   However, PLA deforms at relatively low temperatures by plastic-melting  standards  like that of a car dashboard in summer  and so is of limited use  anyplace it will both be under load and warm. If a constant load is acting  on it, it will deform slowly over time  known as creeping  even at room  temperature. Many low-cost printers  and some pricier ones, too  are not  designed to handle any materials other than PLA.  100   Chapter 4    SeleCting a printer: Comparing teChnologieS  If your printers will mostly be used for small, decorative student   projects like keychains, you should be able to stick with the simplicity of  printing in PLA, which is by and large pretty forgiving to print with and  relatively cheap. Figure 4-2 shows how good a PLA part can look—there are  many different kinds now, and some have very good finishes.  Figure 4-2.  A PLA vase  If you are making parts that have to withstand some banging around  or do something useful, you will probably need a printer that can print in  a wider range of materials. This in turn means that the printer needs to  handle a bigger temperature range. For that, it will probably need to have  an all-metal hot end  as opposed to one lined with polytetrafluoroethylene   PTFE , itself a plastic  and possibly a heated print bed. Some of these  materials need to be used in an area that is ventilated well; see Chapter 5’s  discussion of ventilation. People often make parts that need to stand up to  some repeated motion out of nylon, like Figure 4-3’s extruder mount from  a Bukito 3D printer  the white part .  101   Chapter 4    SeleCting a printer: Comparing teChnologieS  Figure 4-3.  Nylon functional part  Note  Some filaments are very abrasive and will quickly wear out  a nozzle. the “filled filaments,” which consist of a pla or other base  polymer mixed with metal or composite materials like chopped  carbon fiber, fall into this category, as do glow-in- the-dark filaments.  hardened steel or ruby-tipped replacement nozzles are intended to  withstand abrasive filaments.  Some 3D printers can handle more exotic materials like polycarbonate,  but these materials can require specialized hot ends, a platform that can be  heated to a very high temperature, and a platform surface material that is  compatible with the material being printed  see the discussion of materials  in Chapter 2 .  Higher-temperature materials tend to shrink as they cool if they are   not kept continuously warm, hence the need for a heated platform. If the  build platform is cold, each layer will shrink as it cools. The hot layer on  top will misalign, and over time the corners of a print will warp and peel  up from the platform. Having a heated platform mitigates this. There are   102   Chapter 4    SeleCting a printer: Comparing teChnologieS  exceptions. Nylon can be printed on a printer without a heated platform   the piece shown in Figure 4-3 was printed that way , but the platform  material needs to be one that nylon will stick to, like Garolite LE.  An intermediate choice is polyethylene terephthalate glycol-modified    PETG , which can be printed on a printer without a heated bed. The  material is usually a little more expensive than PLA, but tends to creep  less than PLA. Figure 4-4 shows a hollow cube 20 mm on a side, printed in  translucent PETG.  Figure 4-4.  Hollow cube printed in PETG  So, the bottom line is: if you want to make 3D prints that do something  mechanical, you are probably going to need a heated platform and an all-  metal hot end. Table 4-1 summarizes this information. Note that you can  use a heated bed with some of the materials listed here as not necessarily  needing one, but you will need to use a platform surface other than blue  painter’s tape, because that tape’s adhesive cannot handle heated bed  temperatures.  103   Chapter 4    SeleCting a printer: Comparing teChnologieS  Tip  there are a few published papers and dissertations on the  strength of 3D printed aBS and pla parts. they have found rather  inconsistent results. Joshua pearce’s lab at michigan technical  University has done some systematic studies in this sphere—for  example, a paper by nagendra g. tanikella, Ben Wittbrodt, and  Joshua m. pearce: “tensile Strength of Commercial polymer materials  for Fused Filament Fabrication 3-D printing.” Additive Manufacturing  15: pp. 40–47  2017 . Doi: 10.1016 j.addma.2017.03.005.  Table 4-1.  Material Effects on Printer Requirements  Material  Heated Bed Required?

The purpose of the second one is  to let you create prints with two colors or two materials. The best reason  to use one of these is to use dissolvable support material. As we discuss  in Chapter 2, because prints are created a layer at a time on the platform,  anything with a steep enough overhang will require support material.  Support material on a single-extruder printer requires that you snap off the  material with pliers or other tools.  104   Chapter 4    SeleCting a printer: Comparing teChnologieS  Dissolvable support is one solution to this, although the material tends   to clog nozzles, and when you dissolve it you then need to get rid of the  water with the dissolved material. Polyvinyl alcohol  PVA , the commonest  material, is a relative of Elmer’s glue, and it is not a great idea to put much  Elmer’s glue into your plumbing  and might not be legal . Talk to your  waste-management person before creating a lot of gluey water.  High-impact polystyrene  HIPS  is another material used for   dissolvable support. It dissolves in limonene, a cleaning solvent made from  oranges. Here too you will need to check on local restrictions on getting rid  of solvents. See Chapter 2 for more about materials, including these.  Caution  a two-extruder printer will not use both extruders to print  something in half the time, although a few two-extruder printers have  a limited ability to print two copies of the same object at once, and  some offer more ambitious experimentation. typically, printers will  print a lot more slowly in two-material mode because they have to  pause on each layer and execute commands to wipe off each nozzle  so that it does not drool onto the print while the other extruder is  laying down material. in other words, do not buy a dual-extruder  printer thinking you will print two objects in parallel. there is no way  to do that with printers on the market as of this writing, because you  might bang into one object with the opposite extruder.  There are new systems appearing that will analyze your model and in  effect print in two colors from one nozzle. As of this writing, they are still a  little experimental for most consumer use but are something to watch in  the future.  105    SeleCting a printer: Comparing teChnologieS  Chapter 4   One Big Printer or Several Small Ones? Libraries and schools often have the impulse to buy the biggest printer  their budget will allow. However, 3D prints take a long time. If you have  three small printers, they can all be chugging away creating different  projects. If you only have one, then you will have a queue.  You can print more than one thing at a time on a print bed, but that   has its own issues. First, you need to start them all at once. Second, if one  print out of five on the bed has an issue that makes it fall off or fall over,  most likely you will need to stop the entire print. It is usually better to have  beginner prints run in isolation, one per printer, so that you can kill a print  that has problems and send the student back to the drawing board.  Except in the case of tall, thin prints that would require extra cooling   time, usually not much time is saved when you try to print multiple things  on the same printer plate rather than print one after the other. These  longer-running prints are more prone to failure. So this, too, argues that  spreading prints across several small printers is often a better idea than  plating them all at once on a big printer.  Small printers are easier to move around. Although it is not a good   idea to move a printer if you can help it, if you are going to move it much  you are better off with something that is, well, moveable. On the flip side,  if you are concerned about theft  in a library public room, for example , a  big printer is harder to steal, but also more awkward to move and lock up  in a closet when a room is unattended. We have run a bicycle cable lock  through the metal handle of our portable printer when we needed to leave  it unattended at a show, but obviously you need to be sure any locking  mechanism does not get in the way when the printer is moving.  There are exceptions, but by and large smaller printers are faster than   bigger ones if they are printing something that will fit on either printer.  3D printers have to move the build platform and or a carriage that is big  enough to get to all parts of the print. Whipping around bigger carriages  and platforms makes precise movement more challenging, and often you   106   Chapter 4    SeleCting a printer: Comparing teChnologieS  can print at better resolution in less time on a smaller printer. Smaller  frames can also be stiffer, with similar positive results.  There are a few special cases when it is nice to have a bigger printer.   Obviously, if you want to print something substantial frequently, and you  think it would be a bad idea to glue several smaller pieces together, you  may want a bigger printer.  Also, if you often print tall, skinny things, remember that printers can  only put down material for a new layer when the previous one has cooled  enough to hold its shape. This does not take very long, but tall, skinny  prints will be limited by this minimum layer time. For these, it may take  the same amount of time to print two or three things as it does to print just  one  and the quality may be better, since the plastic cools better if the hot  nozzle does not remain in contact with it . Of course, if something is tall  and skinny, you can probably fit a few on your small print bed, as long as  the print area is big enough.  We usually recommend buying a few small printers rather than one  large one, unless there is a specific use case that requires a large printer.   Printer Connectivity In Chapter 3, we talk about the types of software involved in using a 3D  printer. Regardless of the printer, one way or another a set of commands  to print a model has to get to the printer from a computer somewhere.  Printers handle that in one of several ways: they require a USB cable to be  connected to the computer that created the file of commands; they accept  those commands wirelessly; or they read a file off an SD card or USB flash  drive. Depending on your environment, each one of these has advantages.  Printers that require a hard USB connection the entire time they are  running are somewhat unusual now. That is a disadvantage, because if  the computer sleeps or is otherwise interrupted, the print can fail  not  to mention that it ties up a computer . One way around this is to use  Octoprint on a Raspberry Pi to control your printer  see Chapter 3’s   107   Chapter 4    SeleCting a printer: Comparing teChnologieS  discussion of Octoprint . A MatterControl tablet  also in Chapter 3  will  work as well.  Printers that receive files over wifi work well if you are in a stable  wifi environment, but obviously it causes problems if you are not. We  are partial ourselves to printers that hold their models on SD cards or  other outside storage, since this works everywhere and does not tie up  a computer. However, SD cards are small and easily misplaced. Printers  often have an LCD screen to choose among the files on an SD card or files  transmitted wirelessly.   Open Source Materials vs. Cartridges Some printer manufacturers require  or at least encourage  you to use their  proprietary materials. In some cases, a computer chip in the cartridge will  take care of software settings for you automatically. The catch is that these  materials will be vastly more expensive than their generic equivalents— sometimes three to five times more expensive. It also may mean you will  not be able to try new materials that come along.  Particularly if you are in a cost-conscious environment, it is best to   avoid being locked in to one manufacturer for your raw material. If nothing  else, if your manufacturer goes out of business or stops supporting your  printer, you will not be stuck if you can use open source materials. That said, if you use generic  often called open or open source    filament, read reviews on Amazon and other popular retail websites. Very  cheap filament sometimes has impurities that clog printers, or varies in  diameter enough that it can cause printers to jam. Low-cost printers have  in a way outsourced their precision to their filament, and if it varies more  than a few percent in diameter or composition, you may not be able to use  it at all. People become very brand loyal after a time. If you are starting out,  you might consider getting recommendations for one or two brands and  buy a small amount to be sure that it works well for your printer before  stocking up.  108   Chapter 4    SeleCting a printer: Comparing teChnologieS   Filament Size Printer filament comes in two standard diameters: 1.75 mm and what  is called  for historical reasons  “3 mm” filament but is usually close to  2.85. When you first buy your printer, you will typically buy two or three  spools of filament with it. Over time, you will want to try a different color  or material, and you will build up a pile of partial spools. It gets very  irritating to have a mix of the two kinds, both because of the double storage  space and, if you are moving your printers around, the possibility that  the filament spool and printer will not match. As of this writing, Lulzbot  and Ultimaker were the major manufacturers using 3 mm filament; most  others use 1.75.  Tip  Filament should be kept in its original sealed package until  first use, and then if at all possible in an airtight container to keep  out moisture. materials that absorb moisture  especially pVa,  polycarbonate, and nylon  will tend to outgas and pop when heated,  which can make pits in the print or jam the extruder and can weaken  the prints. Five-gallon buckets with tight lids are a common solution.  resist the temptation to open and display every colorful spool as it  arrives, unless you are in an extremely dry climate.   Enclosed or Open Some 3D printers have open gantries  like a miniature construction  crane , whereas others are completely sealed boxes. If you are printing  acrylonitrile butadiene styrene  ABS , there are advantages to an enclosed  box to keep the temperature more even. If young kids are around, a closed  box will keep their hands away. An enclosure limits the visibility into what  is going on, of course. This decision is closely related to the issue of where   109   Chapter 4    SeleCting a printer: Comparing teChnologieS  you are going to put it, discussed in Chapter 5. Some printers also have  the option of built-in air filtration, which only makes sense with a closed  printer.   Buy Within a Brand If you are starting out and supplying a new makerspace, you may be  tempted to try out several different brands of 3D printer. We recommend  against that, because every 3D printer has quirks. If you stick to a particular  brand, you will be able to learn and anticipate the issues a little better. It  may also make training staff or students a little easier.   Should You Buy a Kit? A lot of printers still come as kits. If you are confident in your ability to put  together an electronic device, building a kit is a good way to really know  how the printer works. However, if you have not tried anything like this  before, and if there are no hackerspaces around that could help you, it  might not be a good idea. Sometimes a high school robotics team is the  early adopter and buys the first printer. If coaches and students are up for  it, it might be a good off-season project.   Initial Costs, Filament Printing We are often asked, “What will it cost for us to start a 3D printing lab?” As  with everything to do with 3D printing, the answer is that it depends on  what you are doing. If you want to buy, say, two small printers and one  bigger one and run five to ten smallish projects a day, the cost of just the  equipment breaks down something like this:     Smaller printers: $500–$1000 each     Bigger printer: $1500–$2500 each  110   Chapter 4    SeleCting a printer: Comparing teChnologieS     Tools: Initial purchase of incidental tools such as pliers,   spatulas, tape, and glue: $200     Filament: 4–8 kg PLA per month at $30 kg, or $120-  $240 month     Miscellaneous supplies: $20 month  Some printer manufacturers provide support contracts but most   assume you will be on your own. Chapter 5 talks about living with your  3D printer and discusses facilities, ongoing costs such as training and  maintenance, and similar staffing issues that affect lifecycle costs.   Selecting a Resin Printer Resin printers can be divided into two major categories. The original  technology, stereolithography  SLA , is less common today but is still used  by some of the most popular manufacturers, including Formlabs. SLA  printers use a laser galvanometer to draw out each layer in toolpaths that  resemble those used by filament-based printers, though with a smaller  spot size and moving much more quickly.  Most newer designs adapt technology used by visual display systems to  expose a layer. This usually involves using a Digital Light Processing  DLP   projector, though in an effort to get the price down, some newer designs  are using liquid-crystal display  LCD  masking to selectively illuminate  the resin. In either case, the light intensity is much lower than with a laser,  but these technologies have the advantage that they can illuminate an  entire layer at once. The terminology of resin printers is in flux and is used  somewhat inconsistently in the marketplace.  Some DLP printers have a built-in projector, and sometimes you have   to provide an external one. If you see a suspiciously cheap DLP printer, you  probably will have to buy a projector, too. These printers are coming down  in price, but are still expensive to purchase and to run relative to filament  printers.  111   Chapter 4    SeleCting a printer: Comparing teChnologieS  Fundamentally, resin printers use a source of light to harden a light-  sensitive resin. Some sort of solvent has to be used when the print comes  out of the printer to wash off excess resin. The operational tradeoff comes  down to whether you have a space that can handle a device that is more  at home in a chemistry lab than a computer lab. Of course, if you have a  chemistry lab, that is a pretty good place to keep it.  Caution  there have been many new resin printers on crowdfunding  sites and exhibiting at maker events. they often use a cell phone as  a source of light. although this makes the “printer” incredibly cheap,  there are several fundamental issues. First, your phone will be tied  up for many hours for the print. Second, if you get a call or text, it  will probably ruin the print. Finally, we will just say that we would not  want to put one of our phones under a vat of resin that will harden  when exposed to light from the phone.   Cleaning and Curing Resin prints require cleaning and curing. Cleaning usually means washing  them off with alcohol, which leaves you with a solution of alcohol and  dissolved resin to dispose of. Curing can mean putting the prints out in the  sun or exposing them to some source of UV light.  The resin in the vat must be kept extremely clean. Any stray bits of  cured resin floating around can damage a print in progress or even the  printer itself.   DLP vs. SLA DLP printers, as discussed in Chapter 2, illuminate an entire layer at a  time and can generate very fine detail. SLA printers move a laser spot. DLP  theoretically can produce smaller features but will also show pixelation   112   Chapter 4    SeleCting a printer: Comparing teChnologieS  artifacts in all directions. SLA printers, on the other hand, should show  smoother outlines within a layer but have a minimum spot size bigger than  a DLP pixel. Relative speed of the technologies depends more on brand  and the formulation of the resin being used than on the difference between  the technologies. The technique used to peel each layer off the base of the  vat makes an even bigger difference.   Proprietary Resins As with filament printers, there are printers that require you to buy a  proprietary resin  or at least highly encourage it  and there are those that  allow you to use some types of generic resin. However, the tradeoffs are a  little different here. One advantage of resin printing is the materials—it can  create dental and other specialized parts, for example.  If you want to do something that requires a specialty material, you   might want a printer that uses resin cartridges that communicate with the  printer to optimize its settings. Resins optimized for metal casting exist, too,  for jewelry making. But if you do not have a specialized technical objective  in mind, you may want to buy a printer that can use generic resins.   Initial Costs, Resin Printing Resin printing costs are pretty variable right now, but for rough  comparison with our earlier estimates for filament printers  assuming  several printers, averaging about 10 small prints per day , here are some  rough numbers as of this writing  in early 2018 :     SLA system: $1300–$5000 each     DLP system  with integrated projector : $1400–$5000 each     Resin: 4–8 liters per month at $60–$150 liter  113   Chapter 4    SeleCting a printer: Comparing teChnologieS     Drying cleaning devices: Not essential but might save   solvent and other materials—around $1000     Replacement trays vats: Replace every 5–10 liters for   low end, more than that for higher end: $50–$100 each     Solvents  IPA, most commonly : Varies—consider   disposal costs in your jurisdiction.   Using a Service Bureau Instead If you want to let your students design objects to 3D print but all these  choices sound overwhelming, you can always use a service bureau. That  will be far more expensive, of course, than printing yourself. You may be  hesitant to pay for printing a student project.  The cheapest bureau is likely to be a shared service, where people who   have printers bid on jobs. Two of the big ones are www.3dhubs.com and  www.makexyz.com. But even the lowest-cost one will charge many times the  materials cost you would have if you did prints yourself. The way it works is  that you post an STL file, and a service provider fulfills it—sort of like Uber  for 3D printers. It will be a mix of bigger and smaller vendors.  You may want to have some small test part printed as a data point to   see the cost, quality, and turnaround time. Remember, though, that many  of these providers are one-person shops with a few printers  and may even  be a teenager , so if you throw a whole school at them, they may not be the  ones who end up handling a sudden large order.   Summary This chapter discussed some of the major hardware choices that you have  to make in selecting a 3D printer, particularly a filament-using one. We  went over the different types of materials you might want to use to create   114   Chapter 4    SeleCting a printer: Comparing teChnologieS  objects and the requirements for common filament types. We also gave  some rough estimates of startup costs. In the next chapter, we talk about  what happens once your printers arrive, and what the facilities and staff  issues might be.  115   CHAPTER 5  Living with Your   3D Printer  In Chapter 4, we talk about how to buy a 3D printer. In this chapter,  we discuss what to anticipate when you bring it into its new home  and unpack it. You do not need an expensive, special space for it, but  knowing a few things about what a 3D printer really does not like might  save you a lot of grief.  We cover what physical space makes a printer less prone to fail,   what it takes to train typical non-technical staff users, and maintenance  requirements. In this chapter, we also talk you through how to create and  print a small cube, a 3D printing equivalent of printing “hello world” when  learning a new programming language.  Note  The bulk of this chapter focuses on filament-based printers,  which are far more common in the school and library environment.  We have a short section at the end of this chapter summarizing the  issues for a resin printer.    Joan Horvath, Rich Cameron 2018  J. Horvath and R. Cameron, Mastering 3D Printing in the Classroom, Library, and Lab,   https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-3501-0_5  117   ChapTer 5    Living WiTh Your 3D prinTer    Getting Started with a Filament Printer When you look at many consumer-level filament-based 3D printers,  it is easy to forget that you are looking at a little precision factory. The  temperature, airflow, vibration environment, and ambient dust in the room  all matter to the quality of your print  and to the lifetime of your printer . Bigger, enclosed printers are less vulnerable to some of these things,   but for the price of one of those you may be able to get several smaller ones  that can live tucked into suitable corners. In this chapter, we give you some  background you can use to trade off those costs.   Where to Put It Very often, people do not ask this question until the box arrives.   Filament- based 3D printers should be in a room as free of dust as possible.  Yet you want them in a ventilated area  particularly if you plan to use ABS .  We will go through some of the common options here and talk about  pluses and minuses.  A first impulse with a 3D printer in an educational environment is to   think about making up a nice cart with the printers on top and the filament  spools in the bottom part. However, doing this has many issues:      3D prints take a long time. Typical print times will  range from an hour or two to several days. Most  consumer printers cannot be reliably stopped and  restarted, but features that allow a printer to recover  from a power failure  with varying degrees of reliability   are becoming more common. Without this ability,  you cannot unplug it and move it while printing, and  even for printers that do have the capability, it is not  intended to be used routinely  and will likely leave a  visible artifact in the print .  118   ChapTer 5    Living WiTh Your 3D prinTer      Carts are wobbly and often pretty flimsy, and do not  provide a very stable base for the printer. You might  have to recalibrate the printer every time you move  around if you are jouncing over thresholds and other  obstacles when you move the cart.      If you have more than one printer running on a cart,  that can end badly if they move around and you neglect  to check that they are clear of each other for the whole  range of their motion.     Carts can get jounced around during a print, also   causing artifacts.     Filament needs to be protected from heat and   moisture, which can be hard to do consistently rolling  around on a cart.      It can be challenging to think through ventilation issues  if the cart will be going many arbitrary places.  In our experience, 3D printers that start off moving on a cart fairly  quickly wind up in a permanent home instead. Or the cart gets tucked  solidly in some corner and never moved, which defeats the purpose.  Tip  although it is good for students to see their creations being  made, one option is to do some short in-class demonstration prints  and then print from an SD card, cloud storage, or whatever your  printer supports thereafter. a science room or art room that students  pass through on some regular basis can be a home for printers, if  there is no “maker space” per se.  119   ChapTer 5    Living WiTh Your 3D prinTer   That then brings us back to the question: where should I put it? For   most printers, a sturdy table or shelf in a reasonably clean room with good  ventilation is the best bet. A printer should never be in direct sunlight,  and all printers should not be too close to a heat vent or area that gets very  hot when the air conditioning is off. One particular early printer of our  acquaintance  that had 3D printed parts  turned into a Dali version of itself  when left in a sunny window with the air conditioner off on a particularly  hot summer weekend.  if you do have to move a printer frequently, be sure you   Caution  are picking it up by its frame and not it up by one of its precision  parts, like one of the axes, or  worse  by a belt. printers intended to  be portable sometimes have a handle. if yours does not, stop and  think about whether you might be bending or otherwise putting  unusual stress on a critical part when you pick it up.   Ventilation and Drafts  3D printers are melting plastic, which means it is always prudent to make  sure you have adequate ventilation. If you are printing ABS or one of the  more exotic filaments in particular, it is wise to have active ventilation  a  fan  pulling air away from the printer. A lab or art space that is designed  with similar issues in mind can be a good home for a printer for those  reasons as well. Some spaces use freestanding filters in addition, and some  printers come enclosed with filtration.  One person’s “ventilation” can be another’s “draft.” Drafts can either be a  plus or minus, depending on the material. Air flowing across the printer may  make the bed struggle to maintain temperature, particularly if the ambient  air is chilly. The exception to this is that having a fan blowing on a PLA print  can improve print quality, particularly if you are printing on blue tape at  ambient temperature  and thus not affecting heated bed temperature .  120   ChapTer 5    Living WiTh Your 3D prinTer   There are aftermarket “safety enclosures” for some printers that you   can consider, and filtration is available for some enclosed printers.  3D printers vary widely in how much noise they make when running. Your  best bet is to see if you can be around whatever one you are going to buy  to assess whether it can live in a particular room without bothering the  occupants. On the other hand, a 3D printer wants to live in a reasonably  low-vibration environment, so you probably do not want to banish it to a  loading dock either.  In noisy trade show environments, it is often difficult to hear the noise   a printer makes at all. The same printer may be annoyingly loud in an  otherwise silent room. Some tables, lightweight wooden ones in particular,  may resonate in a way that more than doubles the apparent volume of  the noise the printer makes. If your printer sounds significantly quieter  when lifted just above the table while printing, you might want to consider  special vibration-dampening feet or other means of isolating the printer  from the table.   Noise   Dust  3D printers are precision machines. Nozzles on filament machines are  typically less than half a millimeter in diameter, and it does not take much  to clog them. For a filament printer, the little kludge in Figure 5-1 works  quite well. Take a piece of microfiber fabric  like a Swiffer  or just a paper  towel, and binder-clip it loosely onto the filament ahead of the extruder  gear so that the filament slides freely through it. Be sure it is well clear of  any moving part. Swap it out once in a while and judge whether or not it is  necessary by how dirty it is when you take it off.  121   ChapTer 5    Living WiTh Your 3D prinTer   Figure 5-1.  A DIY dust catcher  If you search on “filament cleaner” you will get other gadgets and  folklore on ways to deal with this issue. Some of these advise using a  cotton ball or sponge, but a cotton ball can be a source of particles that will  cause an even worse clog. Sponges can dry out and lose contact with the  filament. We do not recommend either of these methods.  There are also aftermarket enclosures and covers that you can buy to  manage these issues. Joan leaves an upside-down large fabric shopping  bag  handles down  over her open-frame printer if she is not going to use it  for a while.  If, despite all your best efforts, your nozzle clogs, see the section on   unclogging a nozzle later in this chapter.  Caution  Do not have 3D printer in a room with woodworking,  pottery, or other activities that create fine dust.  122   ChapTer 5    Living WiTh Your 3D prinTer    Storing Filament Filament should be stored in a cool, dry place without big temperature  swings. Keep them in their original packaging until you are ready to use  them. Consumer 3D printers have in some ways outsourced their precision  to their filament manufacturers. Filament can absorb water from the air,  and this is a bigger problem for some materials than others. For ones that  absorb it very easily  notably nylon and PVA , the water will pop and boil  off when the filament is heated, which can cause pitting on the surface and  poor layer to layer adhesion.  If you live in a humid climate, keep your filament tightly sealed in a  plastic bag with desiccant when you are not using it. Avoid leaving your  printer and filament outside overnight or allowing water to condense on  them. There are also filament-drying devices, but because we live in a  mostly arid climate, we have not tried them personally.  PLA filament is the most forgiving of conditions except excessive heat.  Do not leave a spool of PLA filament in a hot car on a summer day. Other  than that, most reasonably sealed filament will be useable for years.  Tip  Tightly sealed 5-gallon paint containers work well to keep  several rolls of filament sealed up. Stacking plastic boxes with tight  lids work well too. You can place a renewable dehumidifier in the  container with filament to keep its environment dry. These plastic  modules contain a desiccant and a heating element that you can use  by plugging it in once it has been saturated to remove the absorbed  moisture from it.  123    Living WiTh Your 3D prinTer   ChapTer 5   Your First Print In Chapter 3, we discuss all the many and varied software settings that  come up in the general case of creating a 3D print. Here we give you a short  summary of how to print something to get started. Resist the beginner  temptation to download something complicated for your first print.  Instead, create a small cube. The classic test cube is 20 mm on a side—a  little under an inch.  3D printing is a metric world.   The simplest way to do that is to use the free software package   Tinkercad  www.tinkercad.com.  Tinkercad is web-based and  recommends using a Chrome browser, or Firefox in a pinch. You will need  to set up an Autodesk account. Then open Tinkercad. It has tutorials, but if  you just want to make a simple cube, click Create New Design and drag the  cube from the menu of shapes on the side to the workplane.  The default cube is, as it happens, 20 mm on a side. You do not have to  do anything now except save the file. Figure 5-2 is a picture of a 20 mm 3D  printed cube, with the bottom of the cube in the foreground so that you can  see the pattern on the bottom as well as the layers. A happy print should look  like this—nice clean bottom layer, and regular layering up from it.  Figure 5-2.  A 20 mm cube  124   ChapTer 5    Living WiTh Your 3D prinTer   To save it, click Export ➤ Download for 3D Printing. You should now   have a file with a name ending in .stl.  The next step is to load this STL file into software that will turn this  model into commands for your printer, usually called a host program or  slicing software. Hopefully your manufacturer pointed you to either its  own program or one of the open source free options. If not, MatterControl   www.mattercontrol.com , Ultimaker Cura 3  https:  software. ultimaker.com , and Slic3r  www.slic3r.org  are all commonly  used. Chapter 3 details how to use these programs to create a file that  can control your printer, called a G-code file on most printers  but a  proprietary format on others .   Calibrating Your Printer A critical requirement for good 3D prints is having the printer’s parts  align correctly to each other. This requires that the printer be both square  and tram. Squaring refers to ensuring that the axes are at right angles to  one another, whereas tram and tramming are used specifically to refer  to adjustment of the build platform to ensure that it is parallel to the x y  motion of the machine.  A 3D printer that is square but not tram will have the axes at right   angles, but the nozzle will not maintain the same distance from the  platform as the x and y axes move. A machine that is tram but not square  will usually print fine, but the angles will be wrong so that rectangles will  become parallelograms and circles will become ovals.  If you suspect that your machine’s axes are out of alignment because  prints that should be rectangles are skewed, first check that the axes are  square relative to each other  use a carpenter’s square or, in a pinch, any  other stiff, accurate rectangular object . If they are not, use whatever  adjustments your printer manufacturer provides.  125   ChapTer 5    Living WiTh Your 3D prinTer   Depending on how your printer is constructed, this may require   loosening several screws, nudging parts into alignment, and retightening  the screws to lock them in place. Other designs may make this more  difficult if the misalignment is due to bad manufacturing tolerances. These  issues can be more difficult to fix, but can often be solved with strategic use  of shims. If the error is in a part that can be printed and you feel competent  to modify your printer, consider making a new one without the error as a  more permanent fix  but save the old one, just in case .  If the width of an extruded line is inconsistent from one end of the   platform to the other, check the alignment of the build platform relative to  the axes, hereafter referred to as tramming the platform. Always check your  squareness first, though, because if you have to make any adjustment your  frame, you will need to tram the platform all over again.  Caution  Some manufacturers refer to “leveling” a platform, but we  try to avoid this terminology because it often leads to confusion about  how to go about dealing with a platform that is not “level.” Do not  use a bubble level to align your platform. if you have your printer on a  table that is not level, but your printer is otherwise square, changing  any printer adjustment based on a bubble level would most likely  not fix the problem. We use the word tram to draw this distinction  about internally consistent alignment of the printer axes relative  to the platform versus level relative to gravity. note that the axes  are imaginary lines in space; normally, the printer’s linear motion  components will be lined up with the axes, but in principle software  can compensate if they are not. Be sure you understand what your  printer does and does not compensate for before attempting to fix  problems.  126   ChapTer 5    Living WiTh Your 3D prinTer   If the build platform gets out of tram, either you can wind up printing   in air in places where the platform is lower than expected or mashing  the first few layers on parts of the platform that are too close to the  nozzle. Prints that do not stick in one corner and are a bit mashed  with  wider-than-normal extrusion lines  on another part of the platform are  symptoms of this problem.  A typical way to fix this for most printers is to home the axes manually   see the section “Manually Controlling Your Printer” in Chapter 3 . Then  take a piece of paper  we like to use a sticky note by sticking it to our  fingers and placing it sticky-side-up on the platform  and move your  extruder in x and y near each of the adjustment screws for your platform.  For most printers, the piece of paper should be able to get between the  platform and the nozzle, but there should be a bit of resistance. There is a  device called a feeler gauge that does the same thing, but do not use one—a  feeler gauge is made of a metal that is harder than your nozzle and might  damage it.  As a quick test, you can print a small item with a big skirt  a skirt that is  near the edges of the platform  to check platform tram. If the skirt does not  lay down evenly, then you need to try again.  Some machines have “auto-leveling” features. These features use some   kind of sensor to probe the height of the platform in various locations to  ascertain how it is  mis aligned and then apply a transformation matrix  in software to align the printer’s coordinate system to the platform, rather  than vice versa. This can make it a lot easier for a beginner to set up a  printer, but it is better not to rely on these features if you can avoid it. In  some cases, rounding errors in these calculations can cause unsightly lines  in the surfaces of prints, especially if your logical axes end up very close to,  but not quite perfectly aligned to, the physical axes of a Cartesian printer.  This is less of an issue for non-Cartesian printers, because their physical  axes are not straight and they are already doing similar math to translate  Cartesian coordinates.  127   ChapTer 5    Living WiTh Your 3D prinTer    When a Print Starts When you have successfully sliced a part to create G-code and used a  host program to send it to the printer  both of which are described in  Chapter 3 , what happens next depends on what is in the G-code, and  also on the printer’s firmware. If your manufacturer gave you standard  settings files, it is likely that there are some G-codes that are added to  the beginning of every print to home one or more of the axes  to bring  the nozzle to some known point relative to the platform . Homing  involves moving the extruder to a predetermined starting point, usually  with each of the printer’s physical axes at one of its two extremes, and  touching a switch or triggering some other feedback mechanism to let  the controller know that it is there. Aside from homing, most printers  run their axes open- loop, moving the motors in discrete steps and  counting steps to determine their location relative to home. The printer  will also need to wait for the extruder and the platform heater  if there  is one  to reach the specified temperature s , and may do this before or  after homing, depending on the order of commands in the start code.  Once the extruder and platform reach the right temperature, the  extruder will usually drool a little to get some filament melted before  the print proper starts. Then the printer will start to print a skirt  if you  specified one  and then your print.  The first time you see a 3D printer making an object, it is mesmerizing.  There is an in-joke in the community that the second item people print out  is a chin rest so that they can watch their prints in comfort.  128   ChapTer 5    Living WiTh Your 3D prinTer   Tip  Slicing programs give estimates of build times, but the actual  build times may vary. This is because the firmware does not move  at exactly the speeds specified in the g-code, but rather accelerates  and decelerates each time it changes direction, making its average  speed lower. These calculations occur in the firmware, so the host  program does not know how much this will affect the print time;  some hosts offer better estimates than others.   During a Print Once a print starts successfully, there is not a lot to do except to keep an  eye on it in case something goes wrong. It is not a good idea to leave a  3D printer unattended, just as you would not go too far from a turned-on  stove or oven. After a while, you will be able to tell from the sounds your  printer makes if all is well. 3D prints can take a long time  many hours  is common , and in the beginning we recommend small tests of new  techniques and materials so you can watch the proceedings actively and  intervene if the print does not go as planned.  The commonest failure is having the print come loose and slosh   around. The only thing to do in that case is to kill the job  from the host  program, or by resetting the printer  and change some of the design  to have a bigger footprint on the build platform, or perhaps print at a  bit higher temperature. If a print just does not look right, go back to  Chapter 3 and consider changing some of the slicing settings; look  at Chapter 2 to see if the filament properties might be the problem;  and consider troubleshooting ideas in this chapter if you suspect  your printer. The platform may not have been adequately aligned and  prepared.  129   ChapTer 5    Living WiTh Your 3D prinTer    When a Print Finishes Normally When your part finishes printing, ideally the result will be a part sitting on  the build platform looking just like you imagined it would. However, you  still need to get the piece off the platform without breaking it. How do you  get any support, brims, and so on off the part? And what should you do to  be sure the printer is ready either to be turned off for the day or to print the  next job?  if your printer has a heated build platform, wait for it to   Caution  cool down somewhat before you remove the part. otherwise, the part   which is still a little soft  may bend or warp as you take it off or if it  cools too quickly off the platform.   Getting a Part off the Build Platform Once the print has cooled down  see the preceding Caution , sometimes  you can just grasp a part firmly and snap it off the platform. Depending on  the combination of platform surface and print material you use, you may  find that a print releases almost on its own as the platform cools. Usually,  though, you need a little leverage to get it started. You may also find that  there is some intermediate temperature at which the print is easier to pry  loose, but that it is more difficult once the print and platform have fully  cooled. Keeping a part firmly attached while printing but allowing it to be  easily removed afterward is one of the more difficult issues in 3D printing.  If a print breaks loose too early, it can ruin a print, but sometimes the  pieces adhere a little too well.  130   ChapTer 5    Living WiTh Your 3D prinTer   Unless your manufacturer recommends another implement, a   common tool to pry pieces off the build platform is one of the tools used by  artists: a paint knife  shown in Figure 5-3 , an artist’s spatula, or a palette  knife. These work well on blue and Kapton tape. Get one that is fairly stiff  so that it is strong enough to move a substantial part. The exact form factor  is a matter of taste and experience, but the shape in Figure 5-3 works well.  Figure 5-3.  A painting knife is a good tool to remove a part from a  tape-covered platform  Any art supply house should carry these tools  for example, Blick’s, at  www.dickblick.com . Very sharp edges should not be necessary, and you  particularly want to avoid sharp corners like those of a razor blade that will  scrape your platform, as these can damage the surface and force you to  replace it more often. Once you get your tool under a corner, try twisting  it to lift that corner rather than sliding the tool further under where it may  scrape the platform surface.  While we are talking about small, handy tools to have in your kit, you  should also get a good pair of tweezers, which are useful for plucking bits  of drooled filament out of places they should not be.  131    Living WiTh Your 3D prinTer   ChapTer 5   Picking Off Support and Cleaning Up the Print If your part needed support, you now have to pick it off. This can be a  painstaking process, and the precise procedure you use will depend on the  shape of your print and the tools you have available. Be careful because  the plastic can be sharp; protect your eyes with safety glasses from the  possibility of small, flying, sharp bits.  Grasping the support with needle-nosed pliers and twisting it   sometimes works well for sparse support; experiment and see what works  for you. As discussed in Chapter 6, it is best to design your model in the  first place to avoid big areas of support because they are very hard to  remove. Chapter 8 discusses finishing techniques.   Restarting or Shutting Off the Printer When you take your print off the build platform, you can either turn off  the printer or create your next print. If your manufacturer gave you slicing  settings, it is likely that there are some shutdown lines of G-code in the  standard setting, or the firmware may take care of some activities.  For example, a printer without a heated build platform might add a   few lines to every G-code file like those in the following example. The first  line turns off the extruder heater  sets the temperature to zero ; the second  line sends the x-axis to its home  zero  position; and the last command  disables all motors:  M104 S0 G28 X0 M84  132  In general, if a print finished normally, you probably can create or   load in another G-code and just run the next job. If you are not planning  on using the printer again right away, it is best to turn it off and possibly  unplug it.   ChapTer 5    Living WiTh Your 3D prinTer    Manually Controlling Your Printer From time to time, you may suspect that your printer has a problem, or  you may need to manually back out of an awkward failure that left a part  skewered on the extruder. In those cases, you will want to use the Print or  Control window in one of the host programs to send a G-code single line or  two, or use the other manual controls that most host programs provide.  There are measures you may want to take as part of routine printing.   For example, what do you do if you want to change filament colors, but  you forgot to pull out the previous filament when you turned off the printer   and now it has cooled down and gotten stuck in the nozzle ?  Note  Some printers allow you to perform some or all of  the functions we describe here from an LCD interface on the  printer rather than in software as we describe here. Check your  manufacturer’s directions for the precise steps to take to solve these  common issues.  All the procedures that follow use the printer control mode in the   host program you are using, as described in Chapter 3’s discussion of host  programs. There are variations among the hosting programs, but all of  them allow sending a single line of G-code at a time, as well as moving the  extruder in any axis, heating the extruder, and heating the platform.  Tip  By default, most printers use degrees Celsius  C  for  temperature and millimeters  mm  for length measurements. if you  are having trouble thinking in metric, keep in mind that there are  exactly 25.4 mm in an inch, 210 degrees C equals 410 Fahrenheit,  115 C is 239 F, and 230 C is 446 F  to pick some commonly  encountered temperatures .  133    Living WiTh Your 3D prinTer   ChapTer 5   Stopping a Print Sometimes a print does not stick to the platform and starts to slosh around,  or the print you thought would be fine without support is not going to work  after all, or you just look at what is building and scratch your head about  how your lovely computer image could have turned out like that. When a  problem like this becomes obvious, the best thing to do is to click the “Kill  Job” or “Stop” button, as the case may be in your host program.  If the print got jammed under the extruder somehow, you may want   to move the extruder away manually  see “Backing Out of a Bad Situation”  later in this chapter  and then retract the filament. Once you get the failed  print off the build platform, turn off the printer if you are not going to try  again. Note that G-code to turn off heaters and other shutdown activities  will not be executed if the job was killed partway through. Your host  program’s stop function may shut down the heaters for you, but probably  will not do any of those other things.  Typically, it is a good idea to cycle  turn off, wait, then turn back on    power to the printer just in case the partial print left it in some strange  mode. If the failure rammed anything into the extruder, you might want to  check that the build platform was not thrown out of alignment. Check your  manufacturer’s alignment instructions.   Changing Filament When you finish printing a part, it is a good practice to retract the filament  out of the nozzle before it cools completely, so that you will not have to  heat it up again to remove it if you want to print with a different one next  time. To retract the filament, as soon as the print job finishes, open the  printer control panel and type in 10 mm of retraction. You can click the  button to extrude 10 mm a few times; the filament should pop out of the  input device after an appropriate number.  134   ChapTer 5    Living WiTh Your 3D prinTer   If you have a Bowden extruder  see Chapter 2 , you only really need  to get it out of the hot end to have the option of pulling it out easily later.  Some printers also add commands to retract after every print job so you  do not have to think about it. Even these printers, though, normally do not  retract if you kill a job mid-print for some reason.  Suppose you forgot to retract the filament last time. You have bright  pink ABS filament in the nozzle and you want to make an object in white  in PLA. If your printer does not have a touchscreen option to facilitate  this process, you will need to use one of the host programs described in  Chapter 3. The steps will be something along these lines, with details  dependent on which software package you elect to use:     Type in the temperature appropriate to the filament   that is in the nozzle  in this case, ABS, so about 230  degrees; see Chapter 2 .     Turn on the extruder heater  typically by clicking a   button .     Look at the monitoring display in the host software and   wait until the temperature is near the right level  but  not all the way there, because then you will just melt  more filament into the nozzle .     Retract 10 mm at a time until the filament springs   out  or until you can pull it out the rest of the way, for  printers that have a release .     Then change the extruder temperature to the level   appropriate for the new filament  in this case, PLA, so  about 210 degrees . If there is plastic left in the nozzle,  purge it by pushing it out with the new filament. This  has to be done at the higher of the two extrusion  temperatures  in this case, 230 C . If there is a big   135   ChapTer 5    Living WiTh Your 3D prinTer   temperature difference between the two filaments, you  may have to use an intermediate filament to purge out  the old one, or use the “cold pull” technique described  later in this chapter to clean it out.     Start the new filament into the extruder in whatever   way is appropriate for your printer once the extruder is  at the appropriate temperature  look at the temperature  status graph .     Once it is nearly in, type in 40 mm or so and extrude.     Keep extruding an additional 10 mm or so at a time   until the filament stops coming out the old color. Using  a skirt on your next print will take some of that away  too.     You can then run your next print with the new color   and material.  Tip  You could, in principle, use the preceding process to change  out filament mid-run to have a multi-color or multimaterial print with  one extruder. experts can and do try this  by using “pause” . it is very  tricky, though, and results may be unpredictable.   Changing Temperatures During a Print If a print looks like it may be having trouble sticking to a heated platform,  you might want to raise the platform temperature just a few degrees.  Your printer might have a way to do this through a touchscreen or other  controls on the printer itself. Assuming you are not so lucky but that you  have a computer connected while the printer is running, you will need   136   ChapTer 5    Living WiTh Your 3D prinTer   to type a new temperature in a host program  but not a slicing program   under Heated bed. There will be a Set or similar button to click to confirm  changing the settings. You can change your extrusion temperature on the  fly this way too  by changing extruder temperature and clicking Set  if you  decide you should be running a little hotter or cooler.   Basic Hardware Troubleshooting Sometimes you will want to determine whether a printer is having  hardware issues of some type, so it is good to be able to try some basic  commands to debug what is going on.   Checking the Motion of One Axis at a Time If you want to check the motion of one axis in a controlled fashion to see  whether something is broken or loose, the printer control panel in the  host programs  see Chapter 3  allows you to move the axis in a positive or  negative direction by typing in a positive or negative number  or in some  cases by clicking buttons with fixed positive and negative increments .  In Chapter 2, you saw that the z-axis is the vertical axis; x and y are in the  plane of the build platform.  If nothing happens when you enter a value, you may be at an end stop.  Try entering a small value to move in the opposite direction.  For example,  if nothing happens when you input -10 mm in x, then try +10 mm . Use small  values—a few millimeters —if you are trying to debug a problem. Some  machines are also configured with software endstops. It is not uncommon  for machines to refuse to move in the negative direction past the point  where they were when the machine started up until it has been homed,  because it thinks that that position is zero.  137   ChapTer 5    Living WiTh Your 3D prinTer   If no axis will run, you may have a connection problem; be sure your  USB connector is firmly attached and that your printer hardware settings  are correct for your printer. Some printers may be able to power up their  controllers and communicate with a host program using USB power, even  if the printer’s power supply is not plugged into the wall or its switch is off.  Power to drive the motors and heaters can only come from the printer’s  power supply, though, so these functions will not work without it.   Backing Out of a Bad Situation If you forget to take a previous print off the platform, or otherwise do  something you are not supposed to do, you may find the extruder jammed  into a print or blocked somehow. Because it is hard to figure out which  way is +x and which way is –y under battle conditions, you might want to  familiarize yourself now with how your printer is set up in case you need to  walk your way out of a problem with the manual controls.   Extruder Not Extruding If the extruder is moving around but no material is coming out, there are  a few possible problems. The extruder nozzle might be jammed, or the  extruder motor might not be pushing out filament. To debug this problem,  you may have to trick the printer a little to get the information you need.  Most printers are set up so that the drive system does not try to push   filament through a cold extruder. However, for printers with a visible filament  drive gear, it is helpful to see whether the gears are turning even though  nothing is coming out. A drive gear and its relationship to filament are shown  in Figure 5-4. You may not be able to see anything if filament is stuck in the  nozzle. But if no filament is in the extruder drive, you might be able to send an  M302 G-code command to the printer to tell it to override the need to heat up  the extruder. Then tell the gear to extrude a few tens of millimeters of filament.  See if the gears are turning. If not, you have some other failure.  138   ChapTer 5    Living WiTh Your 3D prinTer   Figure 5-4.  A visible  Bowden extruder  filament drive gear  If the gears do turn, then your nozzle is probably clogged. To unclog a  nozzle, follow your manufacturer’s instructions. If your manufacturer did  not provide any suggestions, you can try the following:     Heat the extruder a little above what you used for your   last print and try manually extruding, as we did for  the filament-changing process earlier this chapter.  If you have input an M302 command, be careful not  to try to extrude any filament until the head is at the  appropriate temperature.          If nothing comes out, manually retract the filament.  Take a look at the end of it—is there anything burned or  strange on it?  If not, try breaking off the end cleanly and extruding  again.  139   ChapTer 5    Living WiTh Your 3D prinTer       If all that fails, try the “cold pull” procedure described  in this chapter.     You might also try searching online using the phrase   “Unclog extruder  .”   Clearing a Clogged Nozzle One of the more common problems with a 3D printer is that the printer  stops extruding plastic because the extruder nozzle is clogged. The nozzle  hole is small and it can fairly easily be blocked with debris that was  embedded in the filament, dust, or plastic that got too hot and scorched or  burned.  Caution  try to use nylon for this procedure.  if your nozzle is not rated to 240 degrees C, you should not    Cold Pull  In the past, the only way to get a clog out of a nozzle was to take the entire  hot end  nozzle, barrel, and heater block  apart or take it off and put it in a  solvent. Because that is not very convenient, and taking the hot end apart  can damage it, the cold-pull technique was developed. Somewhere along  the line it also developed the name atomic pull, but we call it by its older  name here. A cold pull starts with inserting filament in the nozzle just as if  you were going to print with the filament.  Instead of using the usual extrusion temperature, though, which   would melt the filament, a cold pull involves pulling the plastic out at a  lower temperature. The temperature is warm enough to allow the plastic  to stretch enough to pull away from the sides of the barrel so that it does  not seize up entirely, but cold enough so that the filament remains solid   140   ChapTer 5    Living WiTh Your 3D prinTer   enough to stay in one piece. Usually, any debris in the nozzle will then  come out with the filament. We estimate the best cold-pull temperature in  the following description.  The cold-pull technique works best with printers that have polished-  smooth stainless steel nozzle barrels. It also works for nozzles that have a  polytetrafluoroethylene  PTFE  internal coating if they are rated to 240 C.  The cold-pull technique has been successfully done with ABS  cold-pull  temperature of about 160–180 C . PLA is much more difficult to work with,  but a cold-pull temperature of 80–100 C will sometimes work. Nylon 618  filament  cold-pull temperature of 140 C  is far easier and more reliable to  use for this purpose due to its strength, flexibility, and low friction.  The cold-pull technique works as follows: to begin, remove as much of  the plastic that you’ve been using as possible. To do this, you can attempt a  cold pull with ABS or PLA with the temperatures listed previously. For the  rest of the instructions, we will assume that this failed to fully remove the  filament.  Next, heat your nozzle to 240 C so that it can thoroughly melt the nylon   and push the nylon filament in. If your printer has a Bowden tube, you  may find it easier to remove it so that you can push and pull the filament  by hand. Attempt to extrude the nylon slowly. Most clogs  especially those  caused by accumulated dust  will not actually block the nozzle entirely,  but will be pushed into the nozzle and stop it when the nozzle pressure  increases and then float up out of the way when left to sit.  If you do not have a hard clog  usually a solid foreign particle lodged   in the nozzle , a slow, pausing extrusion should allow you to purge the old  printing material.  Once nylon starts coming out of the tip, you can begin cooling your   nozzle. See Chapter 3 for information on manually controlling your printer  to see how to extrude some filament by hand. You want to keep trying to  push the filament slowly into the nozzle as it cools to prevent voids from  plastic oozing out.  141   ChapTer 5    Living WiTh Your 3D prinTer   When your extruder temperature is well below the pull temperature,   start heating it again to the specified temperature. When it gets close,  start pulling on the filament manually if your printer mechanism  allows it, or by retracting it using a host program  this requires the M302  command . Pulling as the temperature is rising allows you to ensure  that it releases at the lowest possible temperature, which will make the  filament more solid. Nylon should come out solid and nozzle-shaped,  which is why it works best. Other materials often will not release until  they are soft enough that they will stretch significantly. If this happens,  you may still be able to get a successful pull if you are careful not to let  the long, thin strand of plastic break.  Note  The temperatures specified in the preceding directions are  maximum temperatures—temperatures above which the plastic is  unlikely to come out solid. For best results, you should always pull the  plastic at the lowest possible temperature.  Figure 5-5 shows some examples of cold pulls. If you pull the nylon  out and the surface is rough, dark, discolored, or has black spots around  the sides, this indicates that there is residue of overheated or carbonized,  burned plastic in the nozzle. If you see this, you should clip off the end and  repeat the process until the nylon comes out smooth, clean, and mostly  white. Figure 5-6 shows similar examples from with a nozzle that was  clogged with overheated plastic, rather than burned plastic.  142   ChapTer 5    Living WiTh Your 3D prinTer   Figure 5-5.  Burned residue on cold-pulled filament  Tip  You might want to do cold pulls from time to time as a  preventative measure if your print quality seems to be degrading.  Figure 5-6.  Nylon with residue of overheated plastic  143   ChapTer 5    Living WiTh Your 3D prinTer    Dealing with a Hard Clog  Usually a cold pull can remove debris from a nozzle. However, if you  cannot get the plastic all the way in to perform one, there is probably a  hard bit of debris blocking your nozzle.  One solution is to pluck a bristle from a wire brush and push it into   the nozzle using needle-nose pliers. Figures 5-7 and 5-8 show the process  of pulling a bristle from a wire brush and pushing it into the nozzle. Once  you have poked it through, try a cold pull to see if you can pull the debris  out. Note that the nozzle has to be hot for this maneuver to work, because  otherwise the nozzle will be clogged with solid plastic. Be careful not to get  your fingers near the hot nozzle.  Using one of these tools does not usually remove the blockage from the  nozzle entirely. It only dislodges the clog so that hot plastic can flow past it  and then harden around it so that it can be pulled out, though occasionally  it will break up the clog enough to allow it to be pushed out of the nozzle in  smaller pieces.  Figure 5-7.  Extracting a single bristle from a wire brush  144   ChapTer 5    Living WiTh Your 3D prinTer   Figure 5-8.  Using the wire brush bristle to clear out the nozzle  Caution  Some sellers sell tiny drill bits for this purpose, but using  these is a bad idea because they are brittle and are likely to break off  in the nozzle, making your problem worse. even if they work, their  hard, sharp edges can scrape the softer brass of the nozzle  this is  the same type of drill bit that was used to create that hole in the first  place  and result in uneven extrusion.   Clicking or Grinding Noises One of the first signs of trouble with a 3D printer is an unfamiliar noise.  You will know you are an experienced 3D printer user when certain noises  make you immediately execute a high-speed dive across the room toward  your printer. Because prints can take many hours, listening to your printer  is often the best way to monitor it  with an occasional glance, of course .  in addition to being sensitive to abnormal noises, be aware of   Tip  what a “normal” print run smells like. a burning smell is never a good  thing around electronics. Be able to distinguish problems from, say,  the smell of aBS printing.  145   ChapTer 5    Living WiTh Your 3D prinTer   A filament-based printer has to drive the filament into the extruder   somehow. Clicking noises usually means that the filament is not going into  the nozzle smoothly  or at all . Here are some possible causes:     The filament might be hung up on the spool or catching   on something.     The nozzle might be clogged, as just discussed.     The filament might not have been seated correctly   when it was inserted.  This applies at the beginning of a  print; if the ticking starts mid-print, this is unlikely.      The filament might be too wide to go into the nozzle    check it with calipers as discussed in Chapter 2 .     Something might be hitting one of the fans on your   printer. Check that the fans are clear.      If your nozzle is too close to the platform, you may have  trouble extruding in the early layers because the plastic  coming out of the nozzle does not have anywhere to go.  Sudden grinding noises usually mean that the print came loose and is  jammed under the nozzle. This warrants a sprint across the room to turn  off the printer, because the jammed part can exert some unexpected forces  on the platform and its supports. Get your printer into a safe condition by  stopping the print job. Then manually walk the extruder back out using the  techniques in the section “Backing Out of a Bad Situation.” You may have  to re-adjust the build platform as described earlier in this chapter.  146   ChapTer 5    Living WiTh Your 3D prinTer   if you have been trying to extrude filament into a clogged   Note  nozzle, the drive gear may have been digging into the filament and  clogging up the gears with ground-up filament. Check this too if you  had to clear the nozzle. otherwise, filament may not feed well, and  you might think that the nozzle is still clogged. pick and or blow it  off carefully and be sure you are not blowing plastic dust someplace  where it will cause other problems.   Post-processing Tools and Space Depending on what you are doing with your 3D prints, you may need  some additional tools to use to clean up or otherwise post-process prints.  In Chapter 8 we talk about artist studio considerations, which may require  gluing, sanding, painting, and similar operations  and thus a facility  that can handle those things . Earlier in this chapter we discuss printers  needing to be in a clean environment; this may mean that you will want  the post-processing to happen away from the printers.  Removing support can be a little messy and result in lots of small bits   of plastic everywhere. Doing this over carpet is a bad idea since you will be  picking the bits out forever. If the 3D printers are in a computer-lab type  environment with carpets and nice tables, you may want to designate a  “messy room” for the post-processing activities.  Chapters 8 through 12 address applications of 3D printers in various   discipline situations. If you are outfitting a makerspace at a school or  catering to teachers, you may want to skim through those chapters to get  an idea of what types of materials you might want to keep in stock, beyond  filament.  147   ChapTer 5    Living WiTh Your 3D prinTer    Recycling Prints People ask us all the time if you can recycle your 3D prints into filament.  Many people are working on that. The challenge, though, is that consumer  3D printing has, in a way, outsourced its precision to filament. If the  filament diameter is off even a few hundredths of a millimeter, it can cause  you problems. So, any local machine would need to produce very high  quality and high volume extrusion of plastic.  Parts you make yourself are not currently appropriate to put into  recycling streams, because the filament typically is not clearly labeled  with an appropriate recycling number, nor are the resulting prints. PLA  composts in commercial composting facilities  but will not break down at  the temperatures of a typical home compost bin . Whereas bottles made  from PET plastics are commonly recycled, PET filaments are different  formulations, and are not appropriate for the same recycling stream.   Getting Started with Resin Printers To this point, most of what we have been talking about is specific to  the care and feeding of filament-based 3D printers. Resin printers  magnify some of these issues. The printers need to be in a very dust-  free environment since they can be damaged by small bits of debris in  the wrong place at the wrong time. Treat those as you would treat an  equivalently priced microscope in terms of clean and stable environment.  Do not ever move a resin printer in mid-print.  Complicating matters is the post-processing for resin printers.   Different resins and printers require processes that will vary in detail, but  go something like this: the print will be created in a tray of resin. When it  is done, the platform  on which it has been created upside-down  will be  removed from the machine. The print will still be tacky, and the surface   148   ChapTer 5    Living WiTh Your 3D prinTer   may be marred if touched. Figure 5-9 shows a small print on a resin  platform. The person doing the post-processing needs to wear chemical-  resistant  not latex  gloves, like nitrile ones.  Figure 5-9.  A resin print just out of the printer  Next, the print needs to be washed and cured. Typically, the wash  is done with isopropyl alcohol  various concentrations are advised by  manufacturers . The wash alcohol with resin in it needs to be captured for  disposal along the way  Figure 5-10 .  149   ChapTer 5    Living WiTh Your 3D prinTer   Figure 5-10.  A resin print being washed with alcohol in a Formlabs  wash station  Finally, the print needs to be UV cured, either in a special box or in  the sun. Figure 5-11 shows the print after it has been UV cured and then  the supports snipped off. Supports for resin prints tend to be spindly and  usually are snipped off with flush cutters or other small cutting tools.  150   ChapTer 5    Living WiTh Your 3D prinTer   Figure 5-11.  The completed print  and its cut-off supports    After the prints are done, the alcohol with dissolved resin needs to be  appropriately disposed of, which varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.  Check with your facilities manager on whether they can handle however  much material you will generate, and take a careful look at your  manufacturer’s instructions.  Also review your manufacturer’s requirements for storing resin and   disposing of any unused and expired materials.   Staff and User Training As should be obvious by now, it is challenging to learn how to use a 3D  printer on your own. We hope that our books are a good solution if there  are no other options, but it is helpful to most people to take a course. We  find that two sessions of two hours each work well.  In the first session, we give an overview of the 3D printers that have  been purchased, and an introduction to a basic CAD program that the  group thinks they want to use. We get them to the point of making a cube   151   ChapTer 5    Living WiTh Your 3D prinTer   or other simple thing and then leave them to play for a week or two. Then  we come back and cover the material in Chapter 3, see what has happened  in the interim, and get them started with applicable material for what they  want to do.  We and others offer online courses on various platforms, which are an  option as well—ours can be found at www.nonscriptum.com. Many schools  with ambitious maker plans have systems for training and certifying  students to run equipment as well.   Summary This chapter covered the day-to-day issues of supplying and housing a 3D  printer and its supplies and associated tools, with a particular emphasis  on 3D printers that use filament. We went over basic calibration, facilities  issues, and solutions to common problems. We concluded with a review of  the basics of resin printers, and touched on staff and user training issues.  152   CHAPTER 6  3D Models  Your first step in using a 3D printer will be to create a 3D computer model. You  do that by scanning an existing object, downloading a model from the web,  or creating a model yourself. In each case, there are a lot of options to choose  from. There is more to design than picking a software package, though, and  there are design decisions you can make that can simplify the printing process.  This chapter first covers the basic file requirements for a 3D printer.   Then it reviews options for scanning and downloading 3D models. Finally,  the chapter looks at 3D computer-aided design  CAD  and CAD-related  programs that you can use to make a 3D model. By the end of the chapter,  you should have a computer model that is ready to go on to the next stage  of processing. Models can be made from scratch using a 3D CAD program.  Some 3D CAD programs are intended for simple beginner projects, but  others are more capable  and complex .  If starting from zero seems daunting, you might consider   Note  downloading a pre-existing model from a database. However, models  from these databases often have problems or will not print at all.  In Chapter 5, we give the workflow for creating a cube measuring  20 mm on a side. We recommend trying out something like that first  before getting into a situation where you do not know if problems are  being caused by the model, the slicing settings  Chapter 3 , or the  printer hardware.    Joan Horvath, Rich Cameron 2018  J. Horvath and R. Cameron, Mastering 3D Printing in the Classroom, Library, and Lab,   https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-3501-0_6  153   CHaPTeR 6    3D MoDeLS   3D Model File Formats The term 3D computer model is used in many different contexts, which  can cause confusion when someone wants to print something using a  3D printer. In this book, 3D computer model means a computer file that  contains enough information about the surface of an object to allow the  object to be printed. In the open source consumer 3D printer world, the  most common file format is the STL file. This acronym is sometimes said  to stand for STereoLithography and sometimes for Standard Tessellation  Language.  STL is something of a lowest-common-denominator file format,   consisting essentially of a long list of triangles that collectively cover the  surface of the object. This is not a terribly efficient format  particularly in  its ASCII version, which is a text file , but it has the virtue of being relatively  simple to generate and deal with and therefore has become a de facto  standard. STL standards exist for both ASCII and binary file versions.  On some Windows computers, you may get an error when saving or  moving around an STL file. On Windows, the STL filename extension is  presumed to mean Certificate Trust List, and STL files will show up that  way in directory listings. STL files will work with 3D printing programs on  Windows machines, but sometimes opening the file or saving them will  result in an error message complaining about Certificate Trust Lists.  Tip  The open source program MeshLab  discussed under “Mesh  Repair Programs” in Chapter 3  is able to translate many different  types of files into STL. It can also fix the problems that sometimes  occur during translation or as a result of printing incompatibilities in  the original model itself.  154   CHaPTeR 6    3D MoDeLS   CT Scans We introduce the issues with scanning a model in Chapter 3 and discuss  commercial scanners. Here we will add a bit to that for scientific users. A  scientist may need detailed, high-resolution information about biological  structures. Medical professionals and those with access to computerized  tomography  CT  scanners have been using CT scans as a starting point  for 3D printing. CT scans can capture internal and complex, concave  structures. CT scanners are not consumer items, but if you are a scientist or  researcher, you might see whether a local hospital or research center offers  scans on a fee-for-service basis. Different CT scanners can handle different  densities and sizes of objects.  There are also “micro-CT” scanners with smaller beam sizes.   University imaging centers and labs buy these smaller scanners for  research projects, but often they’re not used full-time, and the facilities  will do a scan as a fee-for-service arrangement. Facilities with micro-CT  scanners are not cheap, and thus neither are these scans. But if you are  solving a real problem, micro-CT scanning may be a powerful way to get  the information you need to create 3D models of structures of interest. CT scanners usually output a DICOM file. A web search will reveal  various free and proprietary tools to convert DICOM files to STL files,  depending on the specific application at hand. One readily available  conversion package is InVesalius. Do a web search for their download  page, because the software is available in various versions and you may  want to hunt around for one that is right for you.   Downloading and Modifying Models Sometimes a model of something that you would like to print already  exists. In that case, you may be able to download it from one of a  growing number of model databases. Some databases contain fun   155   CHaPTeR 6    3D MoDeLS  items and household objects. Some of the existing models in databases  are of complex, specialized objects that might be very useful to you  professionally.   Models of Everyday Things Many databases of 3D-printable objects are available online. The  Thingiverse  www.thingiverse.com , Youmagine  www.youmagine.com ,  Pinshape  www.pinshape.com , and Instructables  www.instructables.com    websites all feature a wide range of objects, from sci-fi figurines to parts for  enhancing 3D printers. These models have been contributed by users and  as such vary widely in the quality of their design both for printing and for  their intended purposes.  Sometimes model creators will upload both the STL file for printing  and the file in the original format of the software that created the model.  That means if you happen to be conversant in the original program, you  can start with an object and modify it. For example, in Thingiverse, when  you click the Download This Thing! button, you get both a list of the  available files and the type of license under which each is being made  available. Sometimes the developer just wants you to credit them if you  use it. Sometimes commercial use is not allowed. If you obtain something  from one of these databases, be sure to look carefully at the requirements,  particularly if you’re going to modify the object or sell something based on  it. See Chapter 3’s notes on Creative Commons licenses.   Specialized Databases Chemists and biologists visualize complex molecules and analyze   how these molecules will interact. The Research Collaboratory for  Structural Bioinformatics  RCSB  manages the Protein Databank  PDB    at www.rcsb.org pdb . Anyone can search this databank to find collections   of published data about nearly 100,000 protein structures  as of early 2014 .    156   CHaPTeR 6    3D MoDeLS  These structures are identified by a PDB ID, which is a four-character  alphanumeric code. Once you find the PDB ID, you can use a program that  can then take the ID and generate an STL file for printing. The following  are two such programs:     Chimera, from the University of California, San   Francisco  www.cgl.ucsf.edu chimera       Visual Molecular Dynamics  VMD , from the University   of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign  www.ks.uiuc.edu  Research vmd    Both programs have extensive documentation. They are freely   available, but have some restrictions on commercial use.  The National Institutes of Health  NIH  in the United States maintains  a repository of medicine-related models  https:  3dprint.nih.gov . The  Smithsonian  https:  3d.si.edu  and other institutions are increasingly  putting together “greatest hits” downloadable sets from their collections.  Often, though, these files are huge and may have other issues. You will  probably want to repair and decimate them — see the section “Repairing a  Mesh” in Chapter 3.  Tip  Do not assume that an STL file you download from a site is  perfect or that it will work on your printer. It is usually wise to run  files through MeshLab  see Tip earlier in this chapter  or a similar  program to see if they are watertight and manifold  see Chapter 3  on  download sites that allow comments or that have an “I made one!”  contribution area, see whether anyone besides the author has made  one. If not, that might be a bad sign.  157   CHaPTeR 6    3D MoDeLS   Creating a New Model If you want to print out something that does not exist anywhere, you will  need to use software yourself to develop a new model. Fortunately, many  software packages are available that make developing particular types of  models as simple as possible. This section helps you think about which  CAD software package you may want to learn about, if you do not already  use one.   Using a CAD Program Most CAD programs will either save a file as STL directly or offer an  option to “export to” STL. Which CAD program is the right one for the job?  This section describes commonly used programs ranging in price from  open source and or free to quite expensive. The programs also vary in  the steepness of their learning curves. In general, the more powerful the  program, the longer it takes to be reasonably proficient in its use.  Some software packages are geared toward creating models meant to  be viewed on a computer or theater screen  called 3D rendering . A “3D”  movie normally does not contain the parts of the model that are not on the  screen at that moment. Various tricks exploit the way your eyes perceive  3D and fool you into thinking you are seeing a 3D image when really all  you are seeing is two offset versions of a 2D image.  If you are at a 3D movie looking at a 3D stereo image of the north side  of a tree, that side was generated in a computer. The south side of the tree,  the underside of the trunk, and some of the top, east, and west sides are  not needed for the movie viewer to see the tree in 3D. However, all of that  is needed for printing an object. Be sure the software you are looking into  can export an STL file or a format that can be converted into STL.  Some programs have the user write computer-code–like instructions,   whereas others require a lot of mouse use and more of an artistic bent.  This is a quick overview of some of the available options; for the most part,   158   CHaPTeR 6    3D MoDeLS  the open source programs offer extensive documentation available for free  download. The proprietary software programs typically offer training or  have help available.   Options for Getting Started Quickly If you want to go from “zero to plastic” as soon as possible, you might try  Tinkercad  www.tinkercad.com  and OpenSCAD  www.openscad.org ,  both of which are free. Tinkercad requires registration; OpenSCAD is open  source. Both have example files available that you can play with and use as  guidelines for your own first project.   Tinkercad: Drag and Drop  If you want to use something simple that requires no programming  knowledge at all, you will like Tinkercad. Tinkercad is a member of  Autodesk’s suite of 3D printing productivity tools. The program is free  as of this writing, although it requires the user to register. Tinkercad is a  purely drag-and-drop program that supplies a lot of simple shapes such  as rectangular solids, spheres, cylinders, three-dimensional letters of the  alphabet, numbers, and so on. Printable objects are created by assembling  them out of these standard virtual pieces.  Tinkercad requires a good Internet connection because the program is  entirely cloud-based and frequently saves incrementally. If several people  are using it on one wifi node, the result can be frozen screens and frustration.  However, it’s a great way to develop something quickly just to test the   end-to-end process of creating a model, slicing it, and printing it. Figure 6-1  shows a simple “star and Saturn” pendant designed by Joan in Tinkercad.  159   CHaPTeR 6    3D MoDeLS  Figure 6-1.  Saturn and star pendant  Tinkercad has extensive tutorials that are arranged into bite-sized brief  walkthroughs of the key features, and there are a lot of examples that others  have designed and put out there for you to play with and build upon. The  classic project to try first on a 3D printer is a small keychain fob decorated  with 3D initials or a few hearts. Most people can do a project of that scale  in an hour or so starting from zero with Tinkercad. In Chapter 5, we suggest  just printing a cube from Tinkercad as an end-to-end plastic “hello world.” To get started in Tinkercad, follow the process at the Tinkercad home   page, www.tinkercad.com. Autodesk also has special accounts for teachers  to register their students; click the Learn tab for details. First, you will need  to create an account  with Autodesk  to use the program. There are good  tutorials on the site that appear by default when you go in for the first time. When you feel comfortable, you can close the tutorial and click “Create   new design” to open a new open build plate. You can drag the preexisting  shapes onto the build plate, select two or more of them, and use the group  icon to merge them into more complex building blocks. You can make  any shape a hole  negative space  by selecting the shape you want to use  as a hole and then clicking the “hole” graphic. By adding and subtracting  shapes, you can build up fairly complex models.  Tinkercad also has features that are new as of this writing – scribble  and a coding capability. We describe those in some detail in Chapter 11.  160   CHaPTeR 6    3D MoDeLS  Save your model by clicking the Export button and selecting the option  to download for 3D printing. Laser cutting is an option too, for models that  can be made as a flat cutout.  You should now have an STL file in your downloads folder that you   can import into your slicer of choice  see Chapter 3  and ultimately print.  Tinkercad makes up weird, pseudo-Swedish names for models. You can  make them something more memorable by clicking the name it made up  and typing in what you would like to call it. Alternatively, you can take one  of the public Tinkercad models and alter it a bit, if the model creator allows  that, and then save it to STL. Remember to start small and simple—see the  “3D Printing Design Rules” section at the end of this chapter about what  makes a model “simple.”  Tinkercad also has the ability to model basic circuits and create   enclosures for some electronics components in your 3D print.   See www.tinkercad.com circuits for details.  Note  There are a variety of other low-cost, school-oriented CaD  programs, and more pop up all the time. Morphi  www.morphiapp.com    has a small cost per seat, but does not require a live wifi connection   which Tinkercad does . People sometimes try to use Inkscape   https:  inkscape.org  for 3D printing, but it is not designed  for it, and you will need to export your drawing to another program  to extrude it into the third dimension. The result after all that will be  better suited for a laser cutter.   OpenSCAD: A CAD Programming Environment  OpenSCAD follows the opposite philosophy from Tinkercad in that it is not  drag and drop at all, except for adjusting how you view the model you have  developed. OpenSCAD uses a programming language very similar to C to  define geometrical shapes, translations, rotations, and so on.  161   CHaPTeR 6    3D MoDeLS  The program has built-in functions for most common shapes, although   the names can be a little misleading. For example, all the rectangular  solids are called “cubes.” Figure 6-2 shows a simple file with three “cubes”  assembled into a simple bridge by moving  translating  the top and  one side of the bridge away from the zero point. Note that the cubes  were designed to be slightly overlapping—because shapes with purely  coincident faces may not have created a manifold STL.  Figure 6-2.  OpenSCAD simple demonstration  To try out a simple model in OpenSCAD, first either click File ➤ New  to start a new model or pick an example from the Example submenu. You  can also type in the little example shown in Figure 6-2—the three lines  shown are all you need for the model shown. As with any program, saving  frequently is a good idea, which you do from the File menu. This will save  the program in OpenSCAD format, not STL.  162   CHaPTeR 6    3D MoDeLS  If you want to see what your model will look like, select Design ➤   Preview. This creates a quick visualization of your model without taking  the time to calculate all the geometry.  Click and drag with your mouse in the preview pane to roll your model   around and see it from different angles. This is also useful to give you a  better idea of what the shape actually looks like in 3D.  If you like the looks of what you see in the 3D preview, you’ll want to  render the model and create an STL. Go back to Design ➤ Render. This  may take longer than the preview step  especially if your model is very  complex or uses certain computationally-intensive elements , which is  why the preview is available.  When rendering has finished, the preview pane will update. If you had   used colors or certain other features, you may notice that they disappear,  because they are not supported by STL and thus are only usable for  previewing. Roll your model around in the 3D view again and make sure  it still looks like you expect. If it does, go to File ➤ Export and then choose  STL as the file format.  You can then take the STL file and run it through a slicing program  see  Chapter 3  and you will be ready to print. OpenSCAD is particularly suited  to modeling objects that can be built up out of geometric shapes. Complex  objects are possible by starting with these basic shapes and rotating them.  You can make impressive geometries with a little programming experience  and the OpenSCAD manual. We have two books of 3D printed science and  math models, all of which were created in OpenSCAD  3D Printed Science  Models  Apress, 2016  and 3D Printed Science Models Volume 2  Apress,  2017 . Figure 6-3 shows a botanical model from the “Plants and their  Ecosystems” chapter of the 2016 book.  163   CHaPTeR 6    3D MoDeLS  It is helpful if you create an STL and export it in the orientation   Tip  you expect to print it in. Consider minimizing support. one special  case is thin objects with a lot of surface detail, like the models in  Figure 6-3. In that case, you may want to print the objects standing  on end, as these were printed. as long as the overhangs are  manageable, this should work well.  Figure 6-3.  Botanical model  agave plant  from 3D Printed Science  Models  Apress, 2016    Programs for Specific Applications Tinkercad and OpenSCAD are great for beginners. If you are using your  printer mostly as a hobbyist, in a classroom, or to make fun objects around  the house, you can probably be happy for a long time with these programs.  However, if you need to create professional-level sculptural models, or if   164   CHaPTeR 6    3D MoDeLS  you need dimensioned drawings, then these programs probably are not  enough. Many, many design programs can either produce an STL file or a  file that can be translated into STL. Most of these programs deserve  and in  some cases have  their own book-length tutorials.  Generally speaking, you need to consider a few key attributes when   selecting a design program. First, think about your own strengths: are you  good at programming, or are you better at drawing with a mouse? Do you  have decent hand-eye coordination and drawing skills? How much time  do you have to devote to becoming proficient, and how much design are  you really going to do? A program with a short learning curve but limited  capability may be okay if you are only going to make a few complicated  objects, but learning a more-capable program may be worth it if those  features will vastly enhance your productivity.  Some software only runs on either Mac or Windows, not both. If you   only have access to one or the other operating system, that may force a  choice.  Next, consider budget. Free and open source software varies in quality;   documentation can be uneven or incomplete for open source software.  However, it is free. For pricey software, research whether demonstration  versions of the software are available, and if so, try before you buy. If you  are a student, check with your school to see whether any discounts are  available to you.  With all that said, programs to create models for 3D printing need to  serve various constituencies. Engineers, architects, industrial designers,  mathematicians, and similar professionals need drawings with each part’s  dimensions shown and great precision. Often, they will need to integrate  3D printed parts with traditionally manufactured ones and thus will need  both the ability to create a file for printing and a traditionally dimensioned,  human-readable drawing. Artists may want good drawing tools that allow  them to sketch freely but not require as much precision. Different tools  have evolved for these respective communities, as we will see next.  165   CHaPTeR 6    3D MoDeLS   Engineering and Architecture Programs  Engineers, industrial designers, and architects use 3D modeling programs  oriented toward applications that require precision. A relatively new arrival  on the engineering CAD scene is Onshape  www.onshape.com . Onshape  is cloud based and free for many educational uses. It has a growing suite  of plug-ins for modeling and analysis. It runs in a browser, so it runs on  Chromebooks, Macs, and Windows and Linux machines, and it also has  apps for iOS and Android devices.  Fusion360  www.autodesk.com products fusion-360  is Autodesk’s   entry in this category. Autodesk used to have a line of CAD programs  called “123D…”. The simpler end of these applications has been rolled  into Tinkercad, and the more sophisticated, into Fusion360. Fusion360  has some CAM  computer-aided manufacturing  capability included. It  also has  confusingly  a “slicer” function, but it slices models into pieces  suitable for laser cutting as interlocking pieces. As of this writing, its CAM  abilities were limited to CNC machines, and not 3D printers. The program  is free for many educational and personal applications at the moment; see  the website for terms and conditions, or to purchase it.  A common  but expensive  engineering tool is Solidworks, from Dassault   Systèmes  www.solidworks.com . Solidworks is designed to create real  engineering projects and as such is a good end-to-end program to go from  concept to final dimensioned parts. It does take a while to become proficient  in Solidworks, though, and cost can be a barrier once one is beyond the  reach of educational discounts. Solidworks is only available for Windows   although there is a free viewer called eDrawings that works on Macs . Sketchup  www.sketchup.com  is a program focused on making it   easy to lay out an architectural project, including a large library of many  common home fixtures from various manufacturers. Sketchup can be used  more broadly, but it focuses mostly on assembling geometrical and precise  models, and the resulting models may require format conversion and have  problems with 3D printing.  166   CHaPTeR 6    3D MoDeLS  Mathematica  www.wolfram.com mathematica   is a programming  system that allows users to model complicated mathematical functions.  Mathematica creates STL files based on user-generated mathematical  models. That means it’s possible to develop sophisticated mathematical  models and then visualize them in physical form. This possibility has  many implications, particularly for people who teach courses that use  Mathematica. A natural spectrum of mathematics visualization options  starts with OpenSCAD and moves up to Mathematica.   Visual-Effects and Sculptural Programs  Visual-effects developers, animators, and similar artists develop 3D  models in computer programs that are good for complex, curved, organic  objects such as characters in animated films. Most of these either can  export an STL file directly or employ translation utilities and procedures to  take their output and turn it into STL. The commercial program Rhino, for  example, exports directly into STL.  Zbrush  www.zbrush.com  is another commercial program for artists.   It’s a complex but very capable program that allows the user to sculpt  in virtual clay. Users often abandon the mouse and draw instead on a  graphic tablet with a stylus to create very sophisticated, realistic designs of  animated characters and the like.  Blender is an open source visual-effects development program,   available from www.blender.org. It is extremely powerful—you can make  an entire animated film with it—but has a correspondingly steep learning  curve. If you are very fast with a mouse, this may be the program for you,  but the program is notorious for “thinking” differently from all other  programs. It is, however, free.  If you are interested in creating 3D models with Blender, you might   Tip  try to locate a class or, even better, a local Blender community or Meetup  group. Lynda.com LinkedIn Learning has online Blender courses.  167   CHaPTeR 6    3D MoDeLS  Maya  www.autodesk.com products maya , an animation program,  exports OBJ files that some slicing programs, including Cura 3, can read.  However, Maya is a mesh-based modeler. That means when you draw  something, you are creating a “mesh” that defines surfaces rather than  working with geometric solids and letting the software generate their  surfaces.  For example, if you model a ball and cut it in half, you are creating a  cup-shaped hemispherical surface, facing outward, but it doesn’t have  an inward-facing surface, and does not enclose any volume. The software  later in the 3D-printing workflow will do unpredictable things with this.  You need to use the solidify functions of the modeling software to give  your mesh some thickness, or add faces to the open sides to create a half-  sphere. Once you are sure your mesh has no holes connecting the inside  to the outside, and that the surface does not intersect with itself, you can  safely export it as an OBJ file.  Because programs like Maya or Blender are intended only for creating  models that will look right when rendered as 2D images, the user has to do  some extra work to ensure that the models it produces will be manifold.  You will have to make sure that your meshes are all closed and have  no unnecessary internal geometry or self-intersections, or your slicing  program and printer might both do unpredictable things.  If you want to turn a 2D surface into a printable mesh, you will need to   extrude or “solidify” it so that it has a thickness of at least a millimeter or  two. Be sure you are working in millimeters first or you might make inch-  or centimeter-thick walls!  Tip  as of this writing, Maya comes with a plug-in that generates  oBJ files, but the plug-in by default is not enabled. Use Maya’s Plugin  Manager to enable the oBJexport plug-in so you can then export  Maya’s native format to oBJ files.  168   CHaPTeR 6    3D MoDeLS   Creating Multiple-Extruder Files A printer with dual extruders allows you to print in two colors or, in some  cases, two materials. Exactly how this works depends a lot on the dual  extruder machine in question, but this general guide will give you some  ideas on how to get started with your machine. You can use a dual extruder  machine in a couple of different ways. First, you can use a different color  of the same material in each extruder. You can also load one extruder with  a dissolvable support material so that you can just wash off support. You  may also be able to combine different materials with different properties,  or your printer may have the ability to use the second extruder in parallel  to make two identical objects. There are now several different types of  multi-extruder setups, each with its own capabilities and caveats.   Using One Extruder for Support Material If you are printing something with significant amounts of support material,  you may want to simplify the removal of that support. Dissolvable support  is made for this purpose. In this case, no extra steps are necessary prior to  sending an STL file to your slicing program  Chapter 3 . You will need to  tell the slicer which extruder is using the support material.  Water-soluble support filament is usually relatively expensive, and   may come in smaller quantities  both for cost reasons and because it  can be ruined by leaving it out to absorb moisture from the air . For this  reason, it can be advantageous to minimize how much of it you use. Most  slicers now have the ability to configure the extruder used for the support  interface separately from the rest of the support structures, which allows  you to print the bulk of the supports with the cheaper print material and  only use the soluble material for the interface between the supports and  the part. Depending on the geometry and orientation of your part and of  its support structures, this may allow the supports to just fall off, or some  breaking of the supports might still be required to remove them, but it   169   CHaPTeR 6    3D MoDeLS  makes support removal easier and less likely to mar the surface of your  part than using break-away supports.  If your printer has multiple extruders that share a single nozzle,  you may find there is no way to use them for materials with different  properties, or if you can, that it requires significant purging of the extruder  to switch back and forth. Using a support material that is formulated to  have similar printing temperatures to your print material will help.   Two-Color or Two-Material Prints As mentioned, dual-extruder printers allow you to print objects in two  colors or materials. It is still a little complicated, though. First, you need  to create the STL files for each of the extruders separately, so that you can  assign each one to an extruder. In the example here, we will be printing a  red heart pendant with a light blue star and exclamation point. This entire  object was created in Tinkercad, with the exclamation point, star, and heart  all in the same file.  To create a two-color object, we needed to create two separate STL   files. To create the first one, we turned the heart pendant hook into a  “hole” in Tinkercad and subtracted it from the merged item to ensure that  the two shapes would not overlap. We then saved that much into what we  will call STL number 1.  Then, to make the second STL, we undid the merging, turned the   heart pendant back into a regular object, and deleted the star and  exclamation point so that we could export just that part as STL number 2.  Remember to undo the deletion  or better yet, work with a copy of your  original file  so that you don’t lose the ability to edit your file and try again.  These two STLs are shown in Cura 3  Figures 6-4 and 6-5  as they   look when they are dragged in separately. Note that some of the model in  Figure 6-4 is just hanging in air, because the models need to have the same  coordinate system as each other to begin with.  170   CHaPTeR 6    3D MoDeLS  Figure 6-4.  The first of two models to be merged in a dual   extruder print  Figure 6-5.  The second model  While making these two files, we were careful not to move anything  around during this process so that the STL files would line up properly  when we re-merged them.  171   CHaPTeR 6    3D MoDeLS  The following directions assume you have two STL files that were  created with a process similar to what we just described for our heart  pendant—that is, two STLs created in a way that maintains the same  coordinate system across the two files and avoids overlaps. If your printer  has multiple nozzles, check your documentation for determining the  offset between them and making sure that they are at the correct relative  heights. For some printers, you will need to enter the correct offset values  in the slicer; others carry this information in the firmware. The offset is the  distance between the two extruder heads in the x and y directions.  In a pinch, you could measure from the center of one nozzle to the   center of the other nozzle, but this is difficult to do and your manufacturer  should have given you either a number or a means of determining the  number from a print. Unless your printer has some method of moving the  inactive nozzle out of the way, height adjustments will need to be made  mechanically—otherwise, the lower extruder could collide with the plastic  that came out of the other nozzle. Single-nozzle dual extruder systems do  not have any offsets to worry about.   Cura’s Process for a Dual Extruder Print As we note in Chapter 3, slicing software gets updated a lot. However, the  general processes stay about the same. We are going to walk through the  process of creating a dual print in Ultimaker Cura 3, since it is so tightly  tied to the model generation. For the example here, we used a MAKEiT Pro  3D printer, which automatically handles the extruder offsets in firmware. First, we brought both STLs into Cura 3 and selected the MAKEiT Pro   M, which has two extruders. We selected each STL in turn and chose an  extruder for it  Figure 6-7 . Then we right-clicked one of the models and  selected Select All Models and then Merge Models. The result is Figure 6-8.  172   CHaPTeR 6    3D MoDeLS  Figure 6-6.  Assigning an extruder to an STL  Finally, under the Dual Extrusion settings  visible in Figures 6-7    and 6-8 , we added a prime tower and an ooze shield. This figure  highlights a single layer simulation in Cura, with the tower and shield  you  have to select “show helpers” to see these  and the travel among them  shown in light purple.  173   CHaPTeR 6    3D MoDeLS  Figure 6-7.  The merged STLs  174   Figure 6-8.  A simulation partway through the print  These features, visible in the photos in Figures 6-9 and 6-10 taken   during printing, keep the extruder not being used from dripping plastic  onto the print when it is supposed to be idle.

The completed print on the printer  The prime tower can get a little uneven and get knocked off near the end;   if that happens near the end of a long print, you can let the print finish just  drooling over where the prime tower was as long as the prime tower wound  up somewhere out of the way. Note that the wipe shield curves around the  print and does not go straight up. Figure 6-11 shows the print after it has  been removed from the platform and separated from the wipe shield.  176   CHaPTeR 6    3D MoDeLS  Figure 6-11.  The final print  3D Printing Design Rules Chapter 3 discusses the software used to create commands for a printer given  an STL model. Sometimes minor design changes can make a big difference  in how well your print will come out. In 3D printing, the devil is in the details.  This section offers a few things to keep in mind when you are designing a 3D  print. Then we go into a few philosophical issues about what you can do with  a 3D printer that uniquely exploits the value of the technology.  Here are a few design rules to keep in mind when developing models   for 3D printing with filament:     Know your printer’s minimum feature size; for most   printers, this will be around 1 mm. Anything smaller will be  marginal to print, particularly in the plane of the platform.     Prints can be hollow  as long as the internal overhangs  can be bridged , or they can have any infill percentage  up to and including solid  100% .  177   CHaPTeR 6    3D MoDeLS     To make a print sturdier, first up the number of   perimeters before increasing the percentage infill.     Fine detail should be printed on the side of a print for   maximum resolution.     Minimize support by cutting your model into pieces,   reorienting it, and so on, while maximizing contact  with the build platform. Overhangs of up to about 45  degrees can be handled without support.              If the print is functional and will be stressed, orient it so  that loads are in the plane of the platform, not stressing  the layer-to-layer bond.  More on this in Chapter 9.   If you are going to be sanding or otherwise finishing a  print in a way that will remove material, or if you will be  adding a filler to the surface to smooth it out, allow for  that in the print.  10 mm holes are too small for 10 mm parts to fit inside.  Leave at least 0.1 mm tolerance as a general rule. You  may need more or less depending on your printer, the  layer height you are using, the facet size of your model,  and how much resistance you want between the two  parts, to name a few factors.     Bear in mind the heat, UV light, and chemical sensitivity   of your print if it will be used in environments where  those things matter. PLA will warp in a hot window  in summer, and will deform over time even at room  temperature if there is a constant load on it.     Print tall, skinny parts with a cooling tower  Chapter 8 .  178   CHaPTeR 6    3D MoDeLS      If a model has a thin part  such as a fin , try to add  perimeters until the thin part is solid and work out the  thickness so that an even number of perimeters fits, if  you have flexibility on sizes. Otherwise infill might be  spotty and uneven and distort the surface.  For resin printers, somewhat different rules apply:     For resin printing, support can be a virtue. Design   your model so that the contact area with the platform  is minimal, because those layers may be compressed  or distorted. To minimize support scarring and peel  force, it is often best to print a flat object at 45 degrees  in resin.     Resin prints should not have completely enclosed   hollow spaces or bowl-shaped areas that could trap  resin or air during the print. If they do, the geometry  has to have a hole to allow the resin to flow.     Because the prints are more isotropic and can handle   smaller features, resolution and strength issues are less  of a driver for most resin prints.     Different thermal, chemical, and UV exposure issues   affect resins. Because there is now a large range of types  of resin, you will need to understand the environmental  requirements of your particular resin.  Caution  Most CaD programs and 3D printers use millimeters as a  default. Be careful that you do not accidentally save a file in inches,  since your print might be interpreted as a teeny version of itself when  the slicer opens it and interprets inches as millimeters.  179    3D MoDeLS  CHaPTeR 6   Complexity Is Free: Hardware as a Service One of the mantras of the 3D-printer community is that complexity is  free. Because 3D-printed parts are built up one layer at a time, it really  doesn’t matter whether that layer is one unbroken sheet or an intricate  design. There are models that would be essentially impossible to machine,  but people who know what they are doing can print them on a low-cost  consumer printer.  Consumer-level printers have one more strong advantage: the   opportunity to iteratively design something, see how it came out, and then  change the design if necessary. When that became possible in the 1980s  for computing  versus overnight batch jobs , there was a real change to the  nature of creating software. We all hope the same thing is about to happen  for making physical things!  This phenomenon is starting to be called hardware as a service  an   analogy to software as a service , and the business models are still unclear.  Resolution and materials are likely to continue improving, and all the  pictures in this book will probably look primitive to anyone reading this  a few years down the road. Chapter 14 speculates on how 3D-printing  businesses may evolve toward short-run manufacturing or mass  customization.   Speed vs. Customization Complexity is not entirely free because the amount of material used   and the time it takes to print  is more proportional to surface area than  to volume of the part. Complexity may matter less in 3D printing than  in conventional fabrication, but complex prints may take a long time.  Consumer 3D printers take a while to print anything out—it’s rare for a  print of any size to take less than a few hours, and prints that take a day are  routine. If you’re making one of something or a prototype for a mold, such a  length of time may be competitive. The other option is a machinist or other   180   CHaPTeR 6    3D MoDeLS  professional making a prototype in a way that involves a lot of labor. But if  the part is simple or you want a lot of them, a 3D-printed part is probably  not the way to go. If you are happily creating injection-molded parts for  something now, then 3D-printing that part is definitely not the way to go. To narrow it down a bit more, consumer 3D printers may not be the   best fit for your project if everything you do will require a lot of hand  finishing after the fact. You might consider using a service bureau to do  one of the more industrial processes. To put it another way, only the right  kind of complexity is free.  3D printing has a role for items that are by their nature one-of-a-kind    or a-few-of-a-kind  and that work well with the technology. Time will  tell what the best applications are. Our sense is that one key role for 3D  printing is that it makes the front of the product-development process  faster. People who would have made a computer model and then created a  foam-core physical mockup as two separate chores are obviously better off  with a 3D printer.  Other promising markets exist in industries that make custom parts for  one-of-a-kind applications  or, even better, industries that should operate  that way but cannot do so economically at the moment . The biggest  market now, though, is a somewhat intangible one: allowing people to  make stuff again just because they want to and can.   Summary In this chapter, you learned about the beginning of the 3D-printing  process. The first step is creating or finding a 3D digital model of your  object, which requires you to visit a website with objects available for  download, 3D-scan something that already exists, or learn one of the  many available 3D modeling software packages. The chapter went over  the various types of software packages available for the engineer versus  the artist to generate a standard  STL  3D-printing file and some rules of  thumb about best design practices for 3D printing.  181   PART III  3D Printing Curriculum  Development  Part 3  Chapters 7–12  discuss the use of 3D printing in different subject  disciplines, with a particular focus on the K–12 classroom. We start off with  a brief introduction to common issues in classroom 3D printing, and then  look at art and theater concerns, considering print post-processing topics  like gluing, sanding, and painting, as well as a bit about casting jewelry.  Then we consider engineering concerns, such as making a print strong  enough for a functional job. Next we take up using printers in language arts  and social studies, and in the elementary school environment. Finally, we  talk about how 3D prints might help special-needs students, particularly  the visually impaired.   CHAPTER 7  Classroom Issues  To this point, we have been focusing on the mechanics of choosing and  using a 3D printer. However, the mechanics of using a printer to produce a  good print is just a start. Deciding how to use the technology effectively is  challenging, too. In this chapter, we discuss some issues common to most  educational settings. In the remaining chapters of the book, we discuss  particular opportunities and challenges for different disciplines and age  groups.   Workflow Most teachers have not dealt with digital fabrication tools  3D printers,  CNC machines, laser cutters, and so on  before encountering them in  a makerspace. Marketing videos usually show a time lapse of an object  magically appearing on a build platform. The reality, though, is different.  A modest print can take hours or even days, depending on the printer, the  material, and the geometry of the print.  For filament-based printers, there are limits to how much faster the  technology will get, based on physics. One layer has to cool enough for  the next one to be laid down, and fans can only do so much. So these will  always be slow. There are  currently exotic  techniques to do resin prints  faster, but they are extremely expensive.    Joan Horvath, Rich Cameron 2018  J. Horvath and R. Cameron, Mastering 3D Printing in the Classroom, Library, and Lab,   https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-3501-0_7  185    Classroom Issues  Chapter 7   Time to Print Most methods of one-at-a-time 3D fabrication are pretty slow, even for a  professional practitioner. We talked about laser cutters and CNC machines  versus 3D printers in Chapter 1 and will not repeat those tradeoffs here.  Consider the time it might take for a person to carve the same shape with  hand tools, and perhaps it might not seem slow at all!  All this does not help, though, when you have a 50-minute class period  with 30 students and you want to involve all of them in making a 3D print.  Here are a few options:     Have each student make something small, and print  them in batches. Because of the cooling-time issue,  often several small objects take the same time to print  as one small object.     Only 3D print what really needs to be 3D printed. If a  student is making a sculpture that will stand on a big  cube of a base, use something else for the base and  only print the sculpture.     Have 3D printing as part of a group project, and have   one 3D printed part per group. Ideally, have this project  spread over several weeks or stagger group project  stages somehow to spread out demand.     Teach good design practices that minimize support.     Have a review process that sends prints that will fail  or use inordinate resources back to the student, with  feedback and an opportunity for the student to fix the  design problem. This also spreads out the load on the  printers if a lot of prints bounce on first submittal, but  overall class timelines will need to allow for this.  186   Chapter 7    Classroom Issues  There are philosophical questions to consider, too. For example, will   you allow a student to print something they have downloaded from a  database and not changed in any way? Can they include such a file in their  projects, or do you want to require that anything they print on a school  printer has at least some original work? Or, perhaps, will you only allow  them to print things they have designed from scratch? Are there things you  will forbid your students to print? If you are new to this, you might check  with a peer school that is ahead of you to see what has worked for them.   Print Queue Management If you have a lot of students creating files to print, managing the optimal  use of the printers you have can be challenging. You will need to create a  priority system. Even if it’s just “first come, first served,” write it down and  post it. Do classroom projects have priority over after-school activities, like  the robotics team? Here are some options for managing priorities based on  the type of print job:     Short jobs cut the queue ahead of long ones.     Small jobs wait until they can be plated together and   printed at once.  due for a few days.     Risky experiments might wait until no class projects are   You will also need a way to track which prints are waiting to be printed,   have been printed, have been attempted but have had the print fail, or  have been rejected without printing for technical reasons. It is best to keep  the sliced file until you are sure the print worked; otherwise you might  need to waste time slicing it again if something went wrong  like a power  outage  that does not require changing anything before printing again.  187   Chapter 7    Classroom Issues  Finally, you will need to decide what to do about prints that take more  than one school day. Will you allow overnight  or over-weekend  printing?  If, say, the robotics team meets after school and only has a few hours, can  they start a print and have it finish unattended? At any rate, you should get  a fair amount of experience before leaving a printer unattended for any  length of time so you know what will fail. You might come back to find a  mess you have to clean up.  Many people put a webcam on their printer so they know if something   has gone very wrong and can sprint over and deal with it. If you have a  remote interface like Octoprint  Chapter 3 , you can even stop the print  remotely if you see that something has gone wrong. You will still have to  remove the print and clean up whatever mess it made before you can try  again, though.   Curriculum Issues We are often asked where to find “maker curriculum” materials. We always  find the request a little odd, because it seems to us that the right thing to do  is to use tools like 3D printing to enhance learning in the typical subjects,  rather than treat it like something to be learned per se.  Constructivist Seymour Papert famously suggested that student   projects needed to have a low floor and a high ceiling, by which he meant  that students should be able to at least get a toehold in a concept if they are  struggling, but that there should be a lot of flexibility for stronger students  to explore to the limits of their ability.  Right now, 3D printing’s “low floor” is seen as finding and   downloading an existing model. This is unfortunately a common model of  “using 3D printing in the curriculum.” We feel that designing a model—or  perhaps altering ones that get you started—is where a lot of the learning  takes place. For examples, see Chapter 9’s discussion about our science  and math models and the philosophy behind them.  188   Chapter 7    Classroom Issues  Except in some specialized cases  like teaching the visually impaired,   as we describe in Chapter 12  just downloading a model and printing  it probably does not add much value and is more or less a new version  of ordering a model from a supply house. Database models can be  misleading or represent a concept incorrectly, too.  So the question becomes: can students use Tinkercad, say, to have just   a bit higher floor to visualize something they have just learned about, or  to express themselves creatively? More importantly, how does doing this  serve having them learn what they are trying to learn?  Currently, we are working on a project to reimagine calculus from zero  and to create a hands-on version we call “Hacker Calculus.” It has become  clear that to do it right one has to throw out the usual order of teaching.  Time will tell how well this works!   What “Design Thinking” Means Joan is trained as an aeronautical engineer and worked for 16 years as a  rocket scientist. In that role she participated in many design meetings. Rich  designed one of the earliest ancestors of today’s consumer 3D printers, as  well as a modern consumer device. If you are teaching “design thinking”  in a middle-school context, you may be confronted with many charts of  the process that are wonders of color and complexity. Some we have seen  would have given people planning missions to Venus pause, or made them  roll their eyes.  Design is something we all do every day, and it does not have to be,  well, rocket science. A generic design process goes something like this:     Figure out what you want to do, or what problem you   are trying to solve  without stating, yet, how you want to  do it . Engineers call this “specifying requirements and  not implementation,” which means: “Tell me what you  need my design to do, and stop telling me how to do it.”  189   Chapter 7    Classroom Issues     Think about what makes a design “the best” for this   purpose and what “success” is and how to measure it.   Who decides what is “best”?      Next, come up with some ways to do what needs to be   done. Pick the one that seems “best”  given 2  and   try it.     Did it work, by your definition of success? You are good!   If not, roll back as far as you have to and try again.  Making the process itself something to learn, with terminology   and vocabulary and many steps and arrows, seems to us to defeat the  purpose of encouraging students to explore and prototype, and it can also  intimidate teachers. Keep it simple and commonsense. Clear metrics of  success can help with figuring out how to grade a project, too.  One reason why 3D printing and its sister digital fabrication   technologies are challenging is that they require fluency in both digital  design and the realities of what will happen when that design is created   or not  with an imperfect machine using real-world materials. The latter  takes some amount of experience and willingness to live with failures  along the way. Being able to live comfortably in both these worlds—to be  able to design something that will actually work—will always be an in-  demand skill and a key preparation for many STEM careers. But it requires  an orderly approach and some discipline to get things to work.  It is still early days for us all to figure out the implications of this in the  K-12 environment. For more on the big picture about 3D printing and the  future workforce, see Chapter 14.  190   Chapter 7    Classroom Issues   Summary In this chapter, we discussed issues that arise in working with 3D printing  in a school setting, including developing printing policies and workflows.  Printer time needs to be managed, and makerspace managers must decide  whether or not students need to develop their own designs, versus just  printing something that already exists. We also considered how to make  the concept of design thinking a bit less intimidating, and closed with  some thoughts about the big picture of what students will need to learn  now to be competitive in the world in which they will eventually work.  191   CHAPTER 8  Art and Theater  3D printing is a mixed blessing for artists. Like all media, it has situations  where it is particularly powerful, and others where it is limited. The big  minus for many artists is the need for a computer model to start with. Some  like the texture of layer lines, while others consider them a nonstarter. In  this chapter, we discuss some of the issues that arise when printing art  objects and theatrical props in particular, from some challenging object  shapes to ways to post-process a print for particular effects.  We know that art and theater teachers are often early adopters of 3D  printing in their schools, and also are the ones to push the envelope the  most on surface quality and unusual geometries. If you teach  or practice   in one of these disciplines, this chapter gives you some idea of what is  possible. We hope you will go on to innovate even cooler techniques.  We start off with a discussion of materials and geometries that result in   prints that are a little challenging to deal with, and end with a discussion  of designing for casting. In-between we cover some of the techniques and  products available for finishing a print.  As with the rest of this book, our primary focus in this chapter is on  techniques that apply to filament-based printing. In some cases, resin  prints start out where filament prints are after the post-processing, due to  their superior surface smoothness in the first place. Most materials  except  for nylon  can be hand-sanded and painted.    Joan Horvath, Rich Cameron 2018  J. Horvath and R. Cameron, Mastering 3D Printing in the Classroom, Library, and Lab,   https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-3501-0_8  193   CHApter 8    Art AnD tHeAter  For resin prints, the composition of “resin” is varied and proprietary   to different printers, so for the most part you will need to depend on  suggestions from your manufacturer. In this chapter, we point to resources  from Formlabs  www.formlabs.com , which has extensive material online.  However, what works for Formlabs proprietary resins may or may not carry  over to your printer, so bear that in mind as you read on.  Note  Our book with Lyn Hoge, Practical Fashion Tech  Apress,  2016 , discusses a variety of other techniques to create technical  costumes that go beyond the 3D printing–centric suggestions here.   Specialty Materials One way to get particular effects in your prints is to use a novel material.  However, not every printer can use every filament or resin. In the case of  filament printers, one way to get interesting surface effects is to use a filled  filament. These are typically PLA-based filaments with metal or wood  powder mixed in. The filaments can be challenging to use, with a tendency  to clog the nozzle, and the metal or fiber ones can abrade a nozzle. But the  effects can give the appearance of wood or metal.  Figure 8-1 shows four pieces that were printed and then sanded with  many progressively finer grits of sandpaper. The top left and lower right  pieces are plain PLA. The upper right is steel-filled PLA, and the lower left  is wood-filled. Filled PLA can be printed on blue tape at PLA temperatures.  194   CHApter 8    Art AnD tHeAter  Figure 8-1.  Sanded PLA pieces  Flexible filaments made of various elastomers also are readily   available. They can be challenging to print, though, because they can tend  to jam  particularly in machines that use 1.75 mm filament and Bowden  tubes . However, if you can get past that, you can make some pretty  interesting flexible objects.  In the case of resin printers, it is difficult to generalize because a lot of  the differentiation from manufacturer to manufacturer is in development  of specialty resins. Resins exist that are flexible, particularly durable,  suitable for high-temperature applications like making injection molds,  and more. Your choice of a resin printer is likely to be driven in part by  what type of material you want to use.  See detailed discussions of this in  Chapters 2 and 4.    Challenging Geometries Not every print is equally hard to create. There are a few special cases that  require particular setups, and because they arise often in art projects and  theatrical prop-making, we cover them in this chapter. These prints involve  extremes in one physical property or another—hollow, or completely solid,  or thin, or otherwise a shape that pushes the envelope of filament printing.  195    Art AnD tHeAter  CHApter 8   Vase Prints Slicing programs allow us to specify how many solid layers are on the top  or bottom of a print, as opposed to the interior of the print that is partially  filled with an infill pattern  Chapter 3 . But suppose you want a print that  is solid on the bottom and otherwise open, like a vase? As it happens, most  slicing programs have a “spiral vase mode” that prints a specified number  of bottom layers, and then spirals up an outer contour that is just one  perimeter thick. In Ultimaker Cura 3 this is a check box: Special Modes ➤  Spiralize Outer Contour. The vases in Figure 8-2 were created this way.  There is also a fun option for vases: Special Modes ➤ Fuzzy Skin. The  right-hand vase in Figure 8-2 used the two options together to produce a  textured vase.  Figure 8-2.  Two spiralized vases, the one on the right with “fuzzy skin”  196   CHApter 8    Art AnD tHeAter  There is also “old-school vase mode,” which explicitly specifies zero   infill and no top layers, which is how vases were printed before slicers had  special modes for that purpose. The difference is that in old-school vase  mode, you do not have the continuous spiral that theoretically removes  all seams  though in some cases, spiral mode actually makes the seams  more visible . The old-school version also allows you to have layers with  multiple islands or with holes  which in spiral mode would either result in  unpredictable behavior or throw an error , and you can also use multiple  perimeters to create a thicker-walled vase  which also makes it easier to  make it water-tight .   Other Uses of Vase Mode Vase mode can come in handy if you are printing something very thin with  surface detail on both sides. If you print such a thing vertically you might  find yourself with gaps and other issues. For example, the gravitational  wave print from our book 3D Printed Science Projects Volume 2  Apress,  2015  had areas where it was not quite the right thickness for either never  or always having some infill, and some gaps resulted.  We tried printing it with the “spiralize outer contour” feature and in   essence created a “vase” with a 1 mm-wide opening at the top. Figure 8-3  shows this print, in translucent PLA.  197   CHApter 8    Art AnD tHeAter  Figure 8-3.  Gravitational waves, printed as vases  The print bed holds two different waves, each of which is a vase open   at the top.  This particular print was pushing the envelope of vase printing.  Printing two items at once like this may or may not work.    Printing Hollow It is a short step from printing a vase to considering printing something  hollow. Normally you would not want to do that, but if for some reason you  do, just set infill to 0%. You may want to increase the number of perimeters  for stability of the model. Figure 8-4 shows a hollow model with modest  enough overhangs that it could be printed just as a shell.  198   CHApter 8    Art AnD tHeAter  Figure 8-4.  A hollow print   Printing Transparent  Solid  Pieces There are now some filaments available that offer high degrees of  transparency, but a typical print has too many air bubbles for you to see  through it. If you print on a smooth surface, you may be able to see into the  bottom of the print very clearly, but the top surface, where the print had to  bridge over the infill, will be irregular enough that it will not be very clear.  If you try to look through the side of the print, you will be able to see where  the infill lines meet the wall, but the rounded edges of the layers will distort  your view.  199   CHApter 8    Art AnD tHeAter  Even if you sand the sides smooth or use special transparent coatings   to fill in the gaps and smooth the surface, the layer lines on the interior will  still create this distortion. Only a print created completely solid can be as  transparent as the ones shown in Figure 8-5.  Figure 8-5.  Transparent prints  Therefore, the only way to print transparent objects is usually to print  them solid. A 3D print generally consists of solid surfaces that are around  1 mm thick, with the interior filled with sparser infill structures. Your  slicing software probably has a setting for how many solid top and bottom  layers you want. To make a print solid, just increase this number until all  layers are solid layers.  Printing solid can be finicky, though, because it makes the printer   much more sensitive to small errors in the amount of plastic being  extruded. If you are extruding slightly too much, melted plastic can build  up around the nozzle. In a regular print, this buildup would even out  once you got to the sparse infill, but that does not happen when you are  printing solid.  200   CHApter 8    Art AnD tHeAter  It is also challenging to print a clear piece on blue tape or other   textured surfaces, because the pattern from the surface will keep the print  from being smooth. For best results, you may need a printer that has a  heated platform and a surface that is not noticeably rough.  You can lower the fudge factor called the extrusion multiplier in some  slicers   flow in Cura 3  to a slightly lower number, like 95 to 98% from its  default of 100%. On the other hand, if your extrusion multiplier is a bit  too low, you will end up with a print that has most of the strength of a  solid print but is full of tiny bubbles and air channels where there was not  quite enough plastic to fill the space, and these will prevent the print from  being transparent. It is also important to print slowly, to allow all the air to  escape. If you want to do a lot of transparent prints, you may be better off  using a resin printer with transparent resin.   Tall Pointy Prints Prints that come to a narrow point  like the rocket in Figure 8-4  can be  difficult to print because there is so little plastic being laid down that one  layer does not cool before the next one starts. The Cura parameter Cooling  ➤ Minimum Layer Time can help with this  make it a bigger number   but only so much, because the plastic will not cool very quickly when it  is constantly in contact with the hot nozzle. A way to solve this problem  is to also print a disposable object called a cooling tower to slow down  the process. This gives the printer something to do while your plastic is  cooling, rather than either simply slowing down but continuing to conduct  heat from the hot nozzle or moving the nozzle into open air and letting it  ooze. Figure 8-6 shows a print that comes to a point along with a cooling  tower. Another option is to print more than one of an object at a time  to give the nozzle more to do per layer. This print is the orbit of Halley’s  Comet, from our 3D Printed Science Projects book  Apress, 2016 .  201   CHApter 8    Art AnD tHeAter  Figure 8-6.  A print with a cooling tower   Printing on Fabric It is possible to print on fabric to get some interesting effects. David Shorey  has been experimenting with printing a few layers on a platform, then  layering fabric, then continuing the print. The result is in Figure 8-7, and  the file is available at www.thingiverse.com ShoreyDesigns designs.  Some printers may be challenging to use this way, because you need to be  able to pause the print at a specified height and also clip down the fabric to  the print bed in a way that does not interfere with the print.  202   CHApter 8    Art AnD tHeAter  Figure 8-7.  Cosplay dragon scales on fabric by David Shorey   Printing Interlocking Pieces You also may want to print chainmail or other interlocking parts. There are  a lot of different chainmail designs out there on the various download sites  if you want to experiment. Figure 8-8 shows an example designed by Rich  in OpenSCAD. With care, these can be printed on a filament printer; fine-  linked materials will need to be printed on a resin or powder  SLS  printer.  There are service bureaus, like Shapeways, that will powder-print for you,  but it is pricey.  203   CHApter 8    Art AnD tHeAter  Figure 8-8.  “Chainmail” printed in PETG  If you create a design like this yourself on a filament printer, pay careful   attention to maintaining clearances between pieces and avoid having  features that fall below 1 mm or so, because they may not survive the  printing process.   Printing Physically Big Objects Consumer-level 3D printer build areas are, for the most part, relatively  small, because it is a lot harder to manage temperature control and  precision of the build platform and the rest of the machine’s structure  for a larger printer. As a result, most consumer printer build areas range  somewhere between 100 and 300 mm in each dimension. This means that  if you want to build something bigger than that, you are going to have to  cut the object into pieces in software, print the parts, and then somehow  construct the final object out of those pieces.  If you want to print an object that will not fit within the build volume,  you can cut it into multiple pieces. For example, if the object is long and  skinny, you can cut it into a few objects that you can then arrange on the   204   CHApter 8    Art AnD tHeAter  build platform and print all at the same time. Otherwise, you will have to  print the object using multiple runs. In either case, you will need to glue or  assemble the piece afterwards.   Long Objects If you have a long, skinny object that will not fit within the longest build  dimension of your printer, first check to see whether it will fit diagonally on  the platform. You will also want to keep the orientation that will minimize  support, so there may be some tradeoffs there. If you are considering  printing diagonally in all three dimensions, it may be easier to cut the  object in half and later glue two pieces that would both lay flat rather than  pick off a lot of support.  If you do need to print a thin but long object  for example, something   shaped like a chopstick , you probably will be able to arrange the pieces  on the platform next to each other and print them simultaneously. If, for  instance, you were trying to print a tall, skinny tower, you could cut it into  several pieces, lay out the pieces on the build platform in one or more  groups, and then glue the pieces together. By selecting the right location to  cut a model  for example, by cutting a model of a building between floors,  or just below the edge of its roof , you may also be able to avoid supports  that might otherwise be required.   Big Objects If the object you are trying to print is too big in more than one dimension,  you will need to split it along two axes—that is, into four or more pieces.  If any parts require particular precision  if there will be critical joints,  for instance , consider where your printer has the highest precision and  arrange cuts so that those pieces will fall there.  205   CHApter 8    Art AnD tHeAter  It is tempting to use the surface that will be in contact with the print  bed as your mating surface, because it needs to be flat anyway and will  likely be much smoother than other surfaces. However, the first layer is  often slightly over-compressed, which can result in excess plastic squeezed  out around the edges and prints being slightly shorter than intended. The  bottom also often comes out slightly warped, which may leave you with  gaps between two parts when you try to glue them back together. This is  particularly true of ABS prints, but even PLA can have this issue, especially  when printed on a cold platform.  To avoid these issues, consider printing on a raft  see Chapter 3 .   This will protect against warping and allow any inconsistencies from the  platform to even out before the printer begins on your model. Once the  raft has been fully removed, this will likely leave you with a rougher surface  than if you had printed without a raft. That surface texture, though, can  actually give your glue more to hold on to, resulting in a stronger bond   though you may want to use a thicker glue than you would otherwise . Even when the full part is too large in two or even three dimensions,  it may be possible to divide it into just two or three pieces by judiciously  cutting and then orienting the pieces. For example, a letter H that needs  to be printed slightly larger than the build platform  in both x and y   can be cut into two halves, each of which may fit diagonally. A pyramid-  shaped object that is too tall for the print volume and too wide only in  one dimension may be cut into three pieces  the top and two halves of the  base . An L-shaped object may be cut into four quadrants, one of which  will be empty.  Be careful if your printer does not have consistent resolution   throughout its build area. In most cases where resolution is variable, the  best resolution is at the center of the print bed. A Cartesian printer should  have consistent resolution across its build area, but deltas and machines  with polar mechanisms usually do not. For resin printers, those using  DLP projection or an LCD mask usually have consistent resolution, but   206   CHApter 8    Art AnD tHeAter  may have differences in their light intensity near the edges. Those that use  lasers typically direct them with galvanometers, which are a type of polar  mechanism and thus can be variable.  Caution  the techniques discussed in the rest of this chapter are  more similar to a “shop” environment  or a chemistry lab  than  a computer lab environment. If you are not used to this type of  environment, work with someone experienced first to learn safety  procedures. Use eye protection and gloves, be sure your space is well  ventilated, and follow the chemical manufacturer’s instructions.   Gluing Pieces Together Once you have printed the pieces, use glue that works on plastics.  Cyanoacrylate adhesives  “superglues”  work pretty well on PLA and ABS,  though you will likely want to use the thicker gel style varieties to fill the  gaps between layers if you want to glue to the side of a print  and especially  if you want to glue to a surface that was slanted in the printing orientation .  Nylon is difficult to glue with any adhesive appropriate for home use.  Caution  Before using any glue, read the manufacturer’s  instructions. Always use glues in well-ventilated areas. You may want  to try out a particular glue on a few scrap pieces first to be sure that  it does not discolor your material. Some glues may dissolve pieces  a bit, which allows the “welding” process described later in this  chapter.  207    Art AnD tHeAter  CHApter 8   Using an Acetone Slurry If you are printing in ABS, there is another alternative for adhering pieces  to one another  but see the Caution that follows . Acetone will melt ABS, so  it can be used to weld one piece of ABS to another. Some people put a little  bit of acetone in the type of bottle used for nail polish  ones with a small  brush  and add the skirt, support material, or other scrap from the print.  The acetone will dissolve the scrap into a slurry that will weld the  pieces together and fill the gaps created by layer lines without melting  the edges of the print too much. Or, if precision edges are not important  and your mating surfaces are sufficiently smooth, you can use a drop of  acetone to bond the parts together. We talk about using acetone to smooth  a print later in this chapter.  Caution  Acetone is flammable and volatile. Its vapor is invisible  and heavier than air. the vapor can pool if you are in an unventilated  area and cause a fire or explosion. Follow the cautions on the  manufacturer’s label.  Acetone welding only works for acetone-soluble plastics, such as ABS,   MABS, or HIPS.  Caution  When you paint acetone on a part, the acetone evaporates,  and you will get a bit of condensation from the air. this can make the  surface of the object a bit cloudy.  Most other 3D-printing filament materials  such as PLA, nylon, and   PET PETG  are not acetone-soluble. Some PLA formulations  depending  on additives  may partially melt, whereas others have been known to warp  and crack when exposed to acetone.  208   CHApter 8    Art AnD tHeAter   Welding with a 3D Pen One alternative to using chemicals and glues to weld parts together is to  use a 3D pen  see Chapter 2  with the same filament as your print and  weld prints together that way. It may not look very smooth but should be  serviceable. Many people buy those pens just for this purpose.   Sanding, Painting, and Dyeing All types of 3D printers will produce fine layer lines in printed objects, but  the physics of filament-based printing tends to accentuate these lines more  than other methods. You can think of them in one of two ways: as inherent  in the medium  like brush marks on an oil painting  or as a problem that  needs to be resolved.  If your application falls into the latter category, this section suggests   some ways to get rid of those lines and to color your printed part other  than by choosing colored filament. We talk about issues with chemical  smoothing and then discuss sanding, painting, and dyeing finished prints.   Chemical Smoothing There are various smoothing techniques described online that use  acetone vapor to smooth ABS, along with do-it-yourself devices to create  and handle the vapor. Many of these are unwise and or too hazardous  for the intended general audience of this book; therefore, none of these  is described in this chapter. As of this writing, available solvents that can  smooth most plastics other than ABS are too toxic to be used in a home or  school environment.  209   CHApter 8    Art AnD tHeAter  Although we have not personally tried it, if you want to do a lot of   vapor smoothing, you may want to look into Polysmooth’s line of PLA- like  filaments that are formulated to be smoothed with isopropyl alcohol vapor   using the Polysher vapor smoothing device, which it also sells . As always,  be sure you are set up for the chemical handling the manufacturer suggests.   Sanding A bit of sandpaper applied gently to PLA prints can significantly smooth  the surface. Just use a piece of sandpaper and sand it by hand. Mechanical  sanding, especially with a rotating drum like you would typically use with a  rotary tool, is likely to melt the plastic.  Back at the beginning of the chapter  in Figure 8-1  we show PLA  pieces that were hand-sanded with many grades of progressively finer  sandpaper. A sanding block may also be useful, depending on the  geometry of the part. Note that nylon just comes out worse than you  started if you try sanding it.  Some plastics, particularly ABS, tend to whiten a bit when sanded,  particularly those that bruise when bent. Wet sanding and continuing  sanding with progressively finer grits may reduce this effect. For plastics  that can be vapor smoothed, this chemical smoothing may reverse  the discoloration, so sanding can be used in conjunction with vapor  smoothing to reduce layer lines while maintaining sharper features that  would be rounded off using vapor smoothing alone to remove the layer  lines  though see the Caution above about acetone .   Painting and Clear Coats You can paint ABS and PLA parts with acrylic paint, like that available in a  typical hobby store. If you need a multi-color print and you have a one-  extruder printer, painting the object after the fact is a good workaround to  produce the colors you need.  210   CHApter 8    Art AnD tHeAter  There are clear coat products like XTC-3D that can be used to smooth  a model by coating the surface  thereby filling in the layer lines  and that  you may see suggested on user forums. Like other chemical methods,  the manufacturers of these recommend personal protection that might  not be available in a school or home environment; for example, see the  recommendations at XTC’s website, www.smooth-on.com product-line  xtc-3d . If you are planning to paint your model, using a high-build  primer and or a textured paint can also help to conceal layer lines.  Post-processing like this can lead to some spectacular results. The   Butterfrog  Figure 8-9  by Vermont artist Rodney Batschelet was printed  in three pieces. The wings were printed on their edges vertically and then  glued to the body.  Figure 8-9.

Rodney  tells us that the piece took about two hours of hands-on work: 5 minutes  to coat all parts except the rock base with XTC-3D epoxy coating, an hour  to prime all parts for final painting, 30 minutes to hand-paint basic colors  with a brush, and about 10 minutes to add shading and rock color to the  base with an airbrush.  The drying times during the process were also significant:     XTC-3D: 2 hours     Primer: 30 minutes     Hand-painted acrylic: 30 minutes     Airbrush painting: Dries immediately on contact     Goop glue: About 30 minutes for each wing  Batschelet teaches at Benson Village School in Vermont and feels   strongly that his students’ 3D printed work needs to be finished  sanded,  painted, and so on . He says that raw, unfinished prints look like toys, and  he does not want his students to think of them that way in an art class.  Figure 8-10 shows one of his students starting to paint an action figure she  created.  212   CHApter 8    Art AnD tHeAter  Figure 8-10.  Student painting an action figure  courtesy of Rodney  Batschelet    Dyeing Nylon Although 3D printed nylon may not look the same as it does in fabric form,  it will take up dye in a similar way. Nylon filament typically is white, which  makes it easy to dye. People have had good luck with household cloth dyes  when dyeing a printed nylon object; check the label on the dye package to  be sure it works on nylon.  213   CHApter 8    Art AnD tHeAter   Resin Prints Resin prints have extremely fine detail. “Resin” is a broad category of  materials with a wide variety of chemical properties. As such, it is not  really possible to talk broadly about what post-processing materials  will work with a particular resin. Your printer manufacturer may have  documentation on finishing on its website; you should see what is  available to help you when you are looking into which printer to buy.  Resins vary a lot in their properties, and some may be brittle and thus  difficult to sand. You may need to experiment with your particular  materials a little.   Casting and Jewelry-making The casting process is very old, its origins lost in antiquity. It is still  used today in many applications, from one-off casts through mass  manufacturing. In brief, one creates a pattern in some material such as  wood, clay, or wax  and in this chapter, PLA or resin . The pattern is a  positive mold of what you want to cast in metal. Various techniques are  used to pack sand or ceramic around the pattern. The pattern is then  removed  sand casting  or melted away  investment casting , and metal fills  the void where the pattern was.  Caution  the material in this chapter is intended to give you an idea  about how an experienced artisan can create a metal piece based on  your 3D print. It should give you enough information to create a part  that will cast well. It is not a do-it-yourself guide to casting, though.  You need to know more about safety procedures and equipment,  which you should learn directly from an experienced artisan. We  appreciate the insights of foundry artisan peter Dippell.  214   CHApter 8    Art AnD tHeAter   Designing Models for Casting This section gives some design rules for castable patterns, 3D printed or  otherwise, in case you want to have someone cast a metal part from a print   pattern  that you make.   Sand Casting The sand casting process is very old, as we mentioned, but it is still  used today in many applications. A pattern is created  for example, by  3D printing  and then sand infused with a binder is packed around the  pattern. Channels for pouring molten metal are carved into the mold, and  the pattern is extracted. Molten metal is then poured into the empty space  where the pattern was, and the final metal piece is extracted from the sand  when it is cool enough.  Sand-cast patterns traditionally have been carved out of wood or   another material that would survive the required number of uses. Because  traditional patterns are used multiple times, being able to re-print them  is not as much of an advantage as it is in investment casting. There, the  pattern is lost each time  more on that in the next section . However, the  channels needed to spread around the molten metal  called sprues and  runners  need to be re-created each time in sand casting.  With careful thought  to avoid lots of support and other additional   work , it may be possible to print these sprues and runners as well.  Depending on your comfort with your chosen CAD program and its  capabilities, it may or may not be easier for you to figure out how to make  an STL file with the appropriate plumbing in addition to your main model.  Bear in mind, too, that whoever casts your model will need to extract what  you build from the sand, which could get tricky if you also want to avoid  support.  215   CHApter 8    Art AnD tHeAter  For 3D prints that will be used for sand-casting, always use a bit  of draft. That means that instead of having vertical surfaces intersect  horizontal ones at right angles, surfaces that would have been vertical  instead are tapered a bit to facilitate removal from the sand. In the case of  the heart pendants in Figure 8-11, it would have helped to have a little bit  of draft  just a few degrees  rather than the crisp verticals everywhere.  Figure 8-11.  Heart patterns and finished aluminum cast pieces  Right angles can be printed by well-made 3D printers, but in sand   casting the sand tends to get stuck in corners and edges and result in some  imperfections. As you can see, the place where the vertical half-heart  pokes upward is a little rough at its base because of the sharp edge there in  the 3D printed version.  216   CHApter 8    Art AnD tHeAter  Tip  engineering-style CAD programs  like Solidworks  have the  ability to add draft to an object. It is difficult to do with beginner  programs, however. If you are doing serious work that you want to be  able to cast, you may need to step up to one of these more industrial- strength programs.  An undercut in the mold-making world is the equivalent of an   overhang in 3D printing. It is a part of the model that  in this case  would  pull out sand when the pattern is pulled out. Just as it is difficult for the  printer to create an object that does not build up smoothly from the  platform, it is hard to sand cast an object that cannot be pulled out of the  mold smoothly. If a mold is made up of two pieces, those pieces also have  to fit perfectly, with appropriate tolerances. As mentioned in the previous  section, higher-end, engineering-oriented CAD programs have tools to  separate parts for 3D printing and subsequent casting with the types of  considerations noted here.  For the most part, it will be natural to print an object in the   same orientation that you would cast it because many of the same  considerations apply. However, objects tend to be strongest in the  direction perpendicular to the layers, so an object may pull out of a mold  best and be strongest if it is printed at 90 degrees from the orientation in  which it would be cast. This may require more support and thus more  scarring of the original 3D print, though, which would require cleanup  before or after the casting. This 90-degree layer orientation may also be  preferable because the x-y resolution of a print is typically much higher  than the layer resolution  smoother detail can be produced on side  surfaces than on top surfaces , and because the rounding of the edges of  the layers creates a very tiny undercut between each layer and the previous  one. Chapter 9 talks about functional prints.  217   CHApter 8    Art AnD tHeAter  Because metal contracts when it cools, your finished cast part will be   smaller than your 3D printed part was. Be sure to account for this. You can  look up the shrinkage  usually stated as a percentage  for your material  and plan your 3D printed part to be a little bigger if your cast part needs to  fit into something else precisely.  Think through how precisely parts need to fit together; do not make   holes exactly the same size as the objects that need to fit into them. A little  experimentation may be required to engineer your process end to end.  Tip  A manufacturing engineering textbook may be helpful to get a  structured overview if metal casting and working with metal is new  to you. One of the classics of the genre is DeGarmo’s Materials and  Processes in Manufacturing  Wiley, 2011  by DeGarmo, Black, and  Khoser, with new editions appearing regularly.   Investment Casting Sand casting is very versatile, but it is not good for capturing fine   detail or for pieces that have complex geometries, such as a sculpture of a  person. For that type of work, investment casting, sometimes called   lost- wax casting, can be a good fit. With those advantages comes additional  complexity. Investment casting has more steps and for high precision  can take a lot longer than sand casting. Professional sculptors producing  bronze statues typically use investment casting.  The process is pretty laborious, particularly if many copies are being  made, because nothing survives the melt-out. First, a piece is carved in  wax. Typically, sprues are also carved in advance and attached to the piece  so that there are strategic paths to flow in metal and to allow air  and wax  or, in our case, PLA  to escape. This wax piece is then coated with several  layers of ceramic or plaster, or alternatively a plaster cast is made around it.    218   CHApter 8    Art AnD tHeAter  The plaster or ceramic is allowed to harden. The wax is “burned out”   melted away, hence the name lost-wax, since the pattern is lost each  time , leaving the plaster cast. The hollow empty mold then is filled with  metal. After it hardens and cools somewhat, the ceramic mold is broken  open, and the piece is removed and cleaned up. 3D printing gives the  option of printing the investment over and over, which might be a huge  time-saver.  Wax has been used for the investment casting process for centuries  because it burns out at a relatively low temperature and leaves a clean  mold. As it happens, PLA has similar properties. Although the term has not  yet entirely caught on, some people in the 3D-printing community have  referred to using PLA in place of wax in lost-wax as a “lost-PLA” process.  You cannot carve PLA, but you can definitely print multiple patterns to  melt out. If you are seriously into this, you are probably better off using a  resin printer that has a resin designed for the purpose. See the next section  about the considerations there.  The sculpture in Figure 8-13 was created by Peter Dippell using a   “lost-PLA” process starting with a 3D print very like the one in Figure 3-2.  The subject was scanned with a 3D scanner  Chapter 3 , which created an  STL file  Chapters 3 and 6 . The STL file was then converted into G-code   Chapter 3  and printed in PLA on a consumer-level printer. After that, it  was pretty much the standard lost-wax process just described.  In Figure 8-12 you can still see the 3D printed layer lines. Whether this   is a big problem or a charming reminder of where the piece was “born”  is in the eye of the beholder. One can look at it as the “brush strokes” of  a new medium. Alternatively, the piece could be sanded lightly before  casting, or the piece could be polished at this point. However, sanding or  polishing risks losing some of the very detail that investment casting seeks  to preserve.  219   CHApter 8    Art AnD tHeAter  220  Figure 8-12.  An aluminum, investment-cast statue of Rich  For those with a resin printer, there are resins specifically designed for   lost-resin casting. Figure 8-13 shows a sample of castable resin and the  resulting jewelry piece, courtesy of Formlabs. Resin prints are probably  more suitable for jewelry, because of the better resolution achievable with  resin. Curing the resin requires care, though. For example, Formlabs has  detailed casting preparation instructions on its website  www.formlabs.com ;   browse the “Learn” section on the site for entries on jewelry.   CHApter 8    Art AnD tHeAter  Figure 8-13.  Castable resin and cast  model and photo courtesy of  Formlabs    Low-Temperature Metals Some metals and alloys have particularly low melting temperatures,  allowing them to be cast in other types of molds. Some room-temperature-  vulcanizing silicones can handle temperatures high enough to be used as  a mold for casting pewter. Silicone is a popular material for mold making  because its flexibility allows it to handle some geometries that would be a  problem for sand casting, making it possible to create reusable molds for  some shapes that would otherwise require investment casting.  221    Art AnD tHeAter  CHApter 8   Casting vs. Printing in Metal Why not just print in metal in the first place? Printing in metal is  expensive, although some research work is underway to make it less  so. The commonest technique is to fuse a fine powder of metal, either  using a binder or by selectively heating the particles enough to fuse them  together. If a binder is used, it is typically removed in a post-processing  step by heating the entire part. There is research going on at the moment  to characterize how strong these materials are, predict when they are likely  to fail, and so on. But these techniques are new, and it will take time to  understand them fully.  Printing metal can also be dangerous. The fine metal particles used in  these processes can be abrasive, extremely flammable, and explosive when  dispersed in air; traditional casting has its own issues, but they are perhaps  more obvious.  The advantages of taking a 3D print from a desktop filament printer   and casting it traditionally are, first, the cost, and second, that it is a  smaller step from existing processes. The second point is also a minus—it  is a smaller step, and less of a dramatic breakthrough than pure metal  printing will be once the issues are worked out. But in the meantime, it is a  potentially cost-saving parallel option. You also need to take into account  the surface finish smoothness you require and what the minimum-cost  method is to achieve that.   Finding Casting Services If you want to cast a part in metal, search for “metal casting” or  “investment casting” and your city name in your favorite search engine.  You can also see whether your local community college or high school  has a jewelry design program; if it does, the program likely knows of a  small-batch casting service or may offer the service for a fee itself. You   222   CHApter 8    Art AnD tHeAter  can also talk to a shop teacher at your local high school or the people at a  makerspace to find an artisan. Visiting a Maker Faire  www.makerfaire.com   is probably a good way to network, too.  Professional foundries may or may not be comfortable using PLA or   resin in their investment casting workflow because it is not a medium they  have used before and they may have evolved proprietary formulations  they do not want to change. They may want to do the intermediary step of  taking a mold from the 3D print and then burning out their wax as usual.  If you want to create an StL file and print in metal in the   Note  first place, there are service bureaus that will create metal- printed  parts for you. You can find a service bureau for printing in metal by  searching for “3d printing metal services.” Service bureaus that can  print metal usually publish design rules that explain what they can  and cannot do  including material properties, feature size, maximum  part size, and so on . Some service bureaus also let you publish your  design so others can print it.   Summary This chapter reviewed some case studies of a variety of materials and  geometries that might be particularly likely to arise in art and theater  applications. We also went over ways to post-process prints and talked  about some of the limitations. Finally, we discussed the best way to create  3D prints that are intended to be used as an intermediary product to  ultimately create a metal cast part.  223   CHAPTER 9  Engineering, Math,  and Science  It might seem that technology-focused teachers would be early adopters  of 3D printing. However, particularly in high school, teachers in these  subjects often feel they have too much to cover to add anything new. We  think this is unfortunate, and that 3D printing has real power to offer  alternative ways of learning beyond writing down notes from a whiteboard.  Typically, one of the bigger barriers to using a 3D printer is learning a  CAD program. Schools with robotics or engineering programs often teach  CAD already, so the students in those programs have a head start. Schools  who are considering teaching coding could use OpenSCAD  Chapter 6  as a  first language. OpenSCAD’s language is similar to C, Python, Java, and other  languages in the “C family,” and is useful for scientific and math models.  No matter the CAD program used, though, creating good math or   science models requires deep domain knowledge. Having students who  need an extra challenge create models for their fellow students may be  an option. We find we learn a lot whenever we dig into creating a model,  because typically we have to go beyond textbooks and the 2D projections  found in them. In this chapter, we share what we have learned about  developing 3D printed math and science models. We also describe  applications in robotics, and the issues that arise when you are creating  functional parts.    Joan Horvath, Rich Cameron 2018  J. Horvath and R. Cameron, Mastering 3D Printing in the Classroom, Library, and Lab,   https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-3501-0_9  225   ChApTer 9    engineering, MATh, AnD SCienCe  Tip  We have written two books of science and math projects: 3D  Printed Science Projects  Apress, 2016  and 3D Printed Science  Projects Volume 2  Apress, 2017 . The models are in OpenSCAD and  are designed to be a middle ground between designing objects from  zero and just downloading something prefabricated. Most of the  models have parameters that can be changed to allow the student  to explore what happens when the model changes, based on the  science involved. The molecule, flower, and wing models we show as  examples in this chapter  Figures 9-1 through 9-4  are described in  the 2016 book.   Visualization The most straightforward way to use a 3D print is to create a model  of something that is inherently 3D, but perhaps not easy to handle  normally—a molecule, for instance. Figure 9-1 shows a 3D model of an ice  molecule. In Chapter 6 we discuss how to make models of molecules  in  the “Specialized Databases” section .  226   ChApTer 9    engineering, MATh, AnD SCienCe  Figure 9-1.  Ice crystal model  model from 3D Printed Science  Projects   A first question to ask is whether the model you are considering   creating really is inherently three-dimensional. We have seen people make  flat 3D printed versions of diagrams. You can do that, but why? Other than  the particular case of the visually impaired  described in Chapter 12 ,  there is not a clear rationale, and the print will likely be harder to read  than a traditional paper print. Even for the visually-impaired community,  there are solutions for that sort of thing, like swell paper. For example, 3D  printing a periodic table without adding any insights does not make a lot  of sense, but there are a lot of periodic table models out there. On the other  hand, adding another feature to the table for the third dimension might  be interesting, like ones on www.thingiverse.com that use the third axis to  show how properties of the elements like reactivity and density vary.  227   ChApTer 9    engineering, MATh, AnD SCienCe  If a concept is abstract and naturally three-dimensional, as long as  the relationships among the axes are correct and line up with the math,  or physics, or what-have-you being described, a model can bring a lot of  insight. Figuring out how to create the model is a learning experience, too,  as you  or your students  wrestle with how to have the model’s geometry  show the concept you have in mind.   Experiments Another good reason to make a model is to explore what happens if you  start with a known system and vary some parameters. For example, we  created a very simplistic model of plant growth in our 2016 3D Printed  Science Projects book. Essentially, we assumed that plants lay out petals  or leaves to minimize how much a leaf or a petal overlaps another. Then  we made a few other assumptions about how many petals leaves a plant  would have and added some parameters that affected the shape of each  leaf or petal. Figures 9-2 and 9-3 show models generated by the same  design with different parameter values. The “aloe” generated by the  program is shown next to its real equivalent in Figure 9-3.  228   ChApTer 9    engineering, MATh, AnD SCienCe  Figure 9-2.  Flower growth model  photo and model from 3D Printed  Science Projects   Figure 9-3.  Plant growth model and the real plant  photo and model  from 3D Printed Science Projects   229   ChApTer 9    engineering, MATh, AnD SCienCe  Another way to use 3D printing is to create an experimental setup.   Figure 9-4 shows an airfoil model, also from our 2016 3D Printed Science  Projects book. The model allows you to pick different wing cross-sections   airfoils  and to control how much the wing sweeps back and how much it  tapers. Then the wing and a support are weighted down on a postal scale.  When a fan is used to create a strong airflow over it, the wing will produce  lift, and the reading on the scale will go down. If you have a 3D printer, this  is a pretty cheap way to learn about wings and what the effects on lift are if  the wing geometry changes.  Figure 9-4.  Airfoil model  photo and model from 3D Printed Science  Projects   230   ChApTer 9    engineering, MATh, AnD SCienCe  3D printing is also being used to create low-cost lab equipment.   Scientists often are big consumers of duct tape, and 3D printing can create  more opportunities to create one-off objects to hold things somehow. Of  course, if there are chemicals involved, it becomes necessary to investigate  whether or not the 3D printed materials involved are compatible with  the chemicals in question. There are various open source science groups  out there documenting their solutions, notably Joshua Pierce’s group at  Michigan Tech University. They maintain Appropedia  www.appropedia. org Open-source_Lab , which has links to a variety of equipment,  particularly for optics. Chapter 13 has more discussion on these topics.   Robotics The international organization FIRST Robotics  For Inspiration and  Recognition of Science and Technology, www.firstinspires.org  is which  is making robotics a school sport, like basketball, with several leagues  aimed at different age brackets. At the high school level, teams build robots  that might weigh as much as 150 pounds. Many of them use 3D printing  for a few components. Common applications are camera mounts and  protective  and or decorative  mounts or cases for small electronics. Will Kalman coaches a FIRST high school team at Granada Hills   Charter High School, the Robodox  Team 599, in FIRST parlance , which  has been around for quite some time. When we asked him for an example  of a good use of 3D printing, he told us about the part shown in Figures 9-5  and 9-6.  FIRST teams have to build a robot in six weeks and are eligible   for awards if during the rest of the year they do community projects,  demonstrate their robot at community events, and so on. Thus many  teams have an “outreach bot” that may have been an earlier competition  robot or could be a cannibalized Frankenstein of several earlier ones.  231   ChApTer 9    engineering, MATh, AnD SCienCe  Currently, the Robodox use a previous year’s robot as their outreach   bot. This particular robot needed compressed air for some of its functions.  They noticed when doing an outreach event that their air compressor  was overheating because they were using it so heavily. It actually got hot  enough that it softened a plastic air hose, which subsequently blew out.  The team decided to add a fan to cool the air compressor to avoid   having that happen again. Team member Omeed Shahhosseini designed  and implemented the fix shown in Figures 9-5 and 9-6. The new part takes  air from a fan and turns the air so that it blows on the compressor to keep  it cool. The part also had to fit onto a chassis rail to keep this ductwork  oriented correctly and had to be sturdy enough to support the forces  involved.  The resulting overall design  Figure 9-5  supports a fan  Figure 9- 6  and   turns the air from the fan  in the foreground of Figure 9-5  back around to  cool the compressor connector, under the domed part in Figure 9-5. It has  solved the problem nicely.  Figure 9-5.  Fan and ducting  model by Omeed Shahhosseini, photo  by Will Kalman   232   ChApTer 9    engineering, MATh, AnD SCienCe  Figure 9-6.  Closeup of fan housing  model by Omeed Shahhosseini,  photo by Will Kalman    Functional Parts As with the robotics applications we just saw, sometimes a functional part  is required—that is, a part that is not just a decorative, standalone piece  but one that is part of a bigger project or that is doing something that  requires at least some mechanical strength. We know that once students  learn a CAD program that can also model forces, they tend to rely on it and  believe that if it says a part is strong enough, it is.  However, for 3D printing that can be tricky. For printing with filament,  the strength of parts varies a lot based on the manufacturer and variability  in the qualities of the filament itself. Some manufacturers now quote  strength parameters, but this tends to be based on expensive, specialty  filament, typically tested after a tightly controlled printing process of a  standard simple part.  People are beginning to attempt to define standards, and there are   papers being written on the strength of 3D prints. Appropedia and open-  access journal articles it references are a good free source of information to  get started, at www.appropedia.org Tensile_Strength_of_Commercial_ Polymer_Materials_for_Fused_Filament_Fabrication_3- D_Printing.  233   ChApTer 9    engineering, MATh, AnD SCienCe  But even if you do have nominal numbers for the strength of a filament   and data from other people’s tests, the temperatures used for printing,  specifics of the printer, the settings you are using, and the geometry and  orientation of the print itself all matter too. As we saw in the “Shells”  section of Chapter 3, your slicer will allow you to specify the thickness of  the horizontal shell, either as a number of perimeters or in millimeters   which will be rounded to a multiple of your perimeter extrusion width .  Two is typically a good number.  The width  in the x-y plane  of this perimeter is the extrusion width,   which must be no smaller than your nozzle diameter, and might be larger.  For a given extrusion width, if you are using thick layers the interlayer  adhesion might not be as good as it would be if you used thin layers,  which will be more compressed and have more contact area. If the nozzle  temperature is too low, that can lead to worse interlayer adhesion.  The bottom line is that prints will be stronger within a layer than across   layers, in a way that is not entirely predictable. This is called anisotropy,  meaning that the material has different properties in different directions.  You can think of it as the grain in wood, which makes it break more easily  in some directions than others. A specific example may help show why  this is true. Figure 9-7 shows a motor mount printed in three orientations.  It would be used to hold a motor in the round hole with four screws, and  then attach the motor to a wall or other surface with the part at right angles  that has two holes in it. In what follows, we call the part with the two holes  the “base.”  234   ChApTer 9    engineering, MATh, AnD SCienCe  Figure 9-7.  Motor mount printed in three orientations  Look carefully at Figure 9-7. Which one of these three parts would you   expect to be the strongest and least likely to fail during its intended use?  Where are the inter-layer lines?  Caution  This part has been created to be too flimsy for its intended  purpose so that we could make a point. it was printed in pLA, with  the temperature deliberately a little too low to make this a more  spectacular demo.  First consider the part on the upper left in Figure 9-7, printed upright   with the base down. We might be concerned that this print might snap  along the line between the base and the rest of the mount, since a layer line  runs along the top of the base. It also has some unsupported overhangs,  although all of them are small or climb at less than 45 degrees, so do not   235   ChApTer 9    engineering, MATh, AnD SCienCe  need support. When the print is flexed to destruction  by holding it in two  hands and flexing it , it snaps easily at that point, as shown in Figure 9-8.  Indeed, when we create a set of these motor mounts for demonstrations,  we have to be careful not to break it just getting it off the platform.  Figure 9-8.  Motor mount printed vertically, base down  Next, consider the print flat on the platform in Figure 9-7, with the base  poking up. In earlier chapters we advised printing exactly like that—a nice,  big base area, and minor acceptable overhangs. But Figure 9-9 shows that  this, too, had one layer line between the base and the rest of the mount.  This makes it very vulnerable to a critical failure, even if it is pretty strong  within the part that was flat on the platform  which took much more force  to break .  236   ChApTer 9    engineering, MATh, AnD SCienCe  Figure 9-9.  Motor mount printed flat on the plaform, base  sticking up  Finally, consider the print on the upper right of Figure 9-7, printed   vertically with an L-shaped layer all the way up. This one is very strong— sometimes it is almost impossible to break it. It tends to also break in a way  that might allow it to function for a while even after it broke  Figure 9-10 .  237   ChApTer 9    engineering, MATh, AnD SCienCe  Figure 9-10.  Motor mount printed on its side, layer lines  perpendicular to base  These parts were all printed in PLA, so if the motor they were holding  got hot  or if we left them on a hot car dashboard in summer , they would  warp. UV radiation degrades many plastics, too.  So, what to do? The simplest thing, particularly in a K-12 environment,   is to thoroughly test the part before using it for something load-bearing.  Consider how hot it will get, whether it will be outside for a long period of  time, and so on. Constructing the tests and interpreting the results can be  a good project in and of itself, and lends itself to an age-appropriate level.   Of course, if you are going to break things, use eye protection and protect  the hands of the person breaking the part.   238   ChApTer 9    engineering, MATh, AnD SCienCe  Note  resin prints are more homogeneous than filament-based  ones but have their own issues. resin part strength is critically  dependent on following the appropriate post-cure processes, and  even then standard resins can be very brittle.  If the exercise of making a functional part is embedded in an   engineering class, it is also an opportunity to discuss what to do when the  CAD software cannot be completely trusted. We have seen students get  upset when a part that “should have been strong enough”  according to  the CAD program  snapped instead. Thinking about why this happened  and the need to use judgment in addition to software tools might be a  memorable lesson. At least, it makes a different point than seeing a lot  of parts that did work, but maybe only because the designer got lucky.  Chapter 2 has more discussion of materials’ properties to help you think  about a good choice given your printer’s capabilities.   Conductive Parts If you have a printer that can lay down two materials at a time, you may be  tempted to use conductive filaments to lay down conductive paths in your  part. These filaments are made of PLA or another material with embedded  graphite; this makes the filament somewhat abrasive for your nozzle. The  graphite makes them mildly conductive, but the resistance can be pretty  high. So, if you are trying to carry current—say, to light an LED—its ability  to carry enough current might be a little marginal.  Filament manufacturer Proto-pasta, for instance, quotes a volume  resistivity for its conductive PLA of 3D printed parts along layers of 30  ohm-cm and across layers of 115 ohm-cm  www.proto-pasta.com  collections exotic-composite-pla products conductive-pla .  Note that the ohm-cm units indicate that the resistance will be lower if   239   ChApTer 9    engineering, MATh, AnD SCienCe  the cross-sectional area of the conductive part of the print is bigger, and  lower if the distance current has to travel through the print get smaller.  The resistance is proportional to the cross-sectional area divided by that  distance. However, if you have an application that does not require a lot of  current, such as creating capacitive touch sensors, printing a conductive  trace might allow you to create some interesting circuitry embedded in a  housing. You could be better off, though, just leaving room to run wire or  another conductive material through a gap in your print.  Tip  if you are developing Arduino electronics for a robot or similar  project, you can make housings in Tinkercad. Tinkercad now has the  ability to simulate a circuit and help you design enclosures around  certain electronic components  www.tinkercad.com circuits .   Learning More The key to using 3D printing effectively in a science or math context is  to solve a problem that needs solving. This means it is best to guide the  choice of problem for students  or for faculty wanting models  based on  math or science needs. This sounds obvious, but for some reason people  often start with the tool and try to find an application for it. Try asking  yourself, “What would I love to have my students make  or make for my  students  that just does not seem possible?” Then see if 3D printing  or  another maker technology  can get you partway there.  The recent boom in citizen science projects, where the public   participates in real scientific endeavors, may be the next frontier for 3D  printing. Currently, most of these projects, like those at www.zooniverse. org, are focused on having the public take or interpret images. But  we and others have been trying to help scientists think about having  people take data for them in other ways, perhaps involving creating DIY   240   ChApTer 9    engineering, MATh, AnD SCienCe  instrumentation plans that someone can download and print. There are  issues there to be sure  standardization, for one  that need to be worked  out, but in principle it might be an exciting new area for citizen science.  We are particularly interested in finding ways to teach math differently   using the types of model we talk about in this chapter. You can check out  our Hacker Calculus project, which is reimagining calculus teaching by  taking advantage of 3D prints, at https:  hackaday.io project 20621-  hacker- calculus.  We have also been inspired by Paul Lockhart’s book A Mathematician’s  Lament  Belleview Literary Press, 2009 . Written by a mathematician who  teaches at the high school level, the book discusses how to teach math  intuitively. He has several other books, too, about ways of teaching math  with less notation and more understanding.   Summary In this chapter, we discussed how to use 3D printing to create math and  science visualizations, and to enable experimentation. Robotics teams and  engineering classes can use the technology to solve real-world problems,  and to discover the limits of modeling and prediction for materials that  are not the same throughout a part. Specialty filaments, like conductive  ones, might open other experiment opportunities. Finally, we noted that  3D printing and other maker technologies can open up new opportunities  for teachers, students, and other members of the public to take part in real  scientific explorations.  241   CHAPTER 10  Language Arts  and Social Studies  People often ask us how to use 3D printers outside of obvious areas like  robotics and art. Some of the most creative applications we have seen,  actually, have been in disciplines that lend themselves to storytelling. We  all made dioramas with cardboard in middle school, but we can now go  beyond that.  One concern that we know teachers have is that they do not want to   spend a lot of class time in history, literature, and similar subjects teaching  students how to use a 3D printer  or learning how to do it themselves .  Schools have addressed this situation in several ways. Students who are  interested can learn how to prepare a file for 3D printing themselves  during lunch or after school time, or a small group of students may  become “designated users.” In other cases, a staff person is in charge of  actual printing, and students just create the computer model.  Regardless of the level of student  and teacher  training, creating a   model that tells a story is not as easy as it sounds. Thinking about the  model conceptually and then implementing will cause students to think  about what they are modeling differently than they would if they were  writing a paper about the topic. Tinkercad  particularly now with its  “Scribble” function that enables freehand drawing  is a perfectly adequate  tool for most of the explorations we describe in this chapter.    Joan Horvath, Rich Cameron 2018  J. Horvath and R. Cameron, Mastering 3D Printing in the Classroom, Library, and Lab,   https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-3501-0_10  243   ChapTEr 10    LanguagE arTs anD sOCIaL sTuDIEs   Models That Tell a Story Illustrating a key point from a story  whether in the context of teaching  history or literature  means you have to think about what is critical in  the story and visualize it yourself first. Picking out what story to tell  and  scoping it so that it is a plausible project  can make students think hard  about the story.  Obviously, if students have open-ended requests to develop a model   about key events of the French Revolution, some will make articulated  guillotines and some will try to make models of Versailles. Either way,  significant background research and iteration will be required.  One option that 3D printing opens up for historical discussions is the   possibility of being able to look at accurate 3D terrain of an area where  an event took place. The next section discusses how to print terrain  representing anyplace on the Earth or moon. Looking at migrations,  battles, or even just US westward expansion may be interesting options for  looking at terrain more realistically than is possible with just topographical  maps.  Tip  Every school and library 3D-printing facility needs to think  about whether or not to allow the printing of human-scale historical  or sci-fi fantasy weaponry. There are obvious safety issues with  allowing students or patrons to print functional weapons, or even  realistic replicas. On the other hand, most would allow printing a  4-inch high toy soldier. It gets a little blurrier for theatrical props or  history projects. Think through a clear policy and be sure faculty and  students know about it.  244   ChapTEr 10    LanguagE arTs anD sOCIaL sTuDIEs   Creating Terrain Creating 3D terrain is a powerful application of 3D printing for geography,  history, and other applications. At some level, you can accomplish the  same insight from a topographical map, but we have found that having an  actual 3D model of a mountain range or varied terrain like the Los Angeles  basin makes it much easier to see large-scale geology and also to imagine  the sweep of historical events taking place on the landscape.  A wonderful free program that lets you print anyplace on Earth   is Thatcher Chamberlain’s Terrain2STL, at http:  jthatch.com  Terrain2STL . An equivalent program for the moon can be found at  http:  jthatch.com Moon2STL . The program creates an STL file of an  arbitrary-sized area and allows you to exaggerate the vertical. Vertical  exaggeration is useful not only to accentuate terrain features, but also  because the print’s layering is less obvious on the steeper surfaces that it  creates, and subtler features may be lost entirely if they are less than one  layer high.  Without vertical exaggeration, you will likely find that the print quality  is better if you rotate the models to print vertically. Oriented this way, only  the most extreme terrain features will produce unprintable overhangs, and  the printer will be able to reproduce much finer variations in elevation. Figure 10-1 is a print of the area around Pasadena, California, with   a vertical exaggeration of around ten times, making the San Gabriel  Mountains and their floodplain clearly visible. If you want more vertical  exaggeration than the program offers, you can always do more in your  printer’s slicing software, which usually will let you scale in just one axis.  Figure 10-2 shows the area around Mt. Whitney in California with  no vertical exaggeration  the valley floor is at about 4000 feet, and the  mountain peak is 14,000  The Mt. Whitney print was printed vertically.  245   ChapTEr 10    LanguagE arTs anD sOCIaL sTuDIEs  Figure 10-1.  Pasadena terrain model created by Terrain2STL, high  vertical exaggertion, printed flat  as shown   Figure 10-2.  Mt. Whitney area, no vertical exaggeration, printed  vertically  246   ChapTEr 10    LanguagE arTs anD sOCIaL sTuDIEs  Terrain model files can get too large for slicing programs to handle   easily, and cleaning them up a little can be handy. Doing so might lose some  fine detail, but it makes them easier to use in other programs later. To fix  problems with STL files  called meshes in other software , we often use the  open source, free program Meshlab. Meshlab is not the friendliest program  on earth, but it does work well. You can download it from www.meshlab.net. To reduce the size of an STL file in Meshlab, first import the mesh  STL   file  into Meshlab. Then go to the menu and select Filters ➤ Remeshing,  Simplification and Construction ➤ Quadratic Edge Collapse Decimation.  Cut the number of triangles by 50%  enter 0.5 in the dialog box  as a first  approximation. If that’s too much, do not save your file  it will overwrite  the original as a default  but instead load it in again and try a less  aggressive adjustment.  If a model just looks funny in your slicing software, open it in Meshlab,   accept any suggestions the program makes, and export it to try again in  your slicing software.  If you want to model a large area, you can carefully make adjacent   sections in software and print them out in pieces. There are also software  tools that will let you cut an STL into parts, including Autodesk Meshmixer   www.meshmixer.com .  If you are interested in geologic features beyond just printing   Tip  terrain, see the geology models in our book 3D Printed Science  Projects Volume 2  apress, 2017 .   Examples of Student Projects Many have fond memories  or not  of making a shoebox diorama at some  point. It is not big step to imagine making 3D printed pieces to include  in a traditional diorama that is otherwise made with craft materials. If  part of the point of an assignment is to have students learn some digital   247   ChapTEr 10    LanguagE arTs anD sOCIaL sTuDIEs  manufacturing techniques across the curriculum, one option is always  to require that some part of a traditional diorama-type assignment be  constructed that way.  A discussion of Tinkercad or a similar program and design rules for   3D printing  both in Chapter 6  is probably enough to get students started  for something like this. In our experience, most schools and libraries have  a staff person slice and print the file, although some high schools have  programs that train self-selecting students to own that process.   3D Vermont The 3D Vermont competition  http:  3dvermont.org  has been  organized for several years by a high school teacher, who has since  received support from backers including Preservation Trust of Vermont,  Vermont’s Agency of Education, the Vermont Department of Housing and  Community Development, Division of Historic Preservation, and others  listed on the site.  Students create a model of a building of historical interest with   supporting information and then gather together to present their model  and discuss its importance, and to place it in the appropriate spot on a  giant model of the state of Vermont. Rules are written up on the site, and  prizes are involved.  If you want to see some examples of the competition, look on Twitter   twitter.com  for posts with the hashtag 3dVermont. Clearly this works  best in a region  like Vermont  where it is plausible for students to travel to  get together and compete, but one could imagine more local variations. As an aside, if you are thinking about starting a modest competition  of your own, we would at this point suggest standardizing on Tinkercad  rather than Sketchup. Sketchup is intended as an architectural tool and so  makes sense from that perspective, but it is notorious for making models  that have printing issues because it was not primarily designed for the  purpose. There is more on this in Chapter 6.  248   ChapTEr 10    LanguagE arTs anD sOCIaL sTuDIEs   The Silk Road Crossroads School in Santa Monica, California, is a creative user of maker  technologies. We visited with Dori Friedman, middle school EdTech and  MakerEd coordinator, to see what sorts of projects were working well. We  appreciate the time Friedman spent with us and Crossroads’ permission to  use photos of student projects in this book.  One that caught our eye was a project in which students were asked   to come up with a game that would teach them about trade along the Silk  Road, the ancient trade route between Europe and Asia. 3D printing was  used to make game pieces and parts of the boards  Figures 10-3 and 10-4 .  Games were displayed in a glass case in the hallway after they had served  their purpose.  Figure 10-3.  Silk Road game designed by Crossroads School  students  249   ChapTEr 10    LanguagE arTs anD sOCIaL sTuDIEs  Figure 10-4.  Detail of Silk Road game in Figure 10-3  game by  Crossroads School students   Vikings and 3D Pens Crossroads students were learning about Vikings in their Core courses,  which are a combination of English and History. Friedman decided to have  them make Viking ships with 3D pens as a big group.  Note  3D pens are discussed in Chapter 8 in the context of welding  a broken print; this is an interesting application of using them to  create novel designs.  First Friedman designed and created 3D prototype versions of the   ships, shown hanging on the wall Figure 10-5. The lowest model in  Figure 10-5 is a 3D version of the school logo.  Next she laid out a pattern for the ship, shown in Figure 10-6, which is   one of a few ships, each several feet long. Students worked with 3D pens  to fill in the diagram. Finally, she  carefully!  lifted the fragile ships up and  hung them high on the wall around their makerspace.  250   ChapTEr 10    LanguagE arTs anD sOCIaL sTuDIEs  Figure 10-5.

However, Crossroads Middle School Latin  teachers had students create 3D printed signet rings  Figure 10-7 . The  students wrote letters of gratitude, in Latin, to the staff and sealed them  with their 3D printed signet rings  Figure 10-8 .  Figure 10-7.  Crossroads School signet rings  Figure 10-7 .

Signet rings  Figure 10-7 . The students historically were used as   signatures, to enclose a document with a tamper-evident seal. Thus this  project involved a bit of history, Latin, and perhaps the opportunity for a  sidebar on document security, all in one relatively simple print.   Summary 3D printing can be a curriculum enhancer in a variety of subjects,  sometimes in ways that are not very complex to design. This chapter  touched on projects in language arts, social studies, and similar fields to  show how some innovative educators are using 3D printing and related  technologies to make these subjects come alive for students. We also  discussed how to create 3D terrain models of any place on earth  or the  moon!  relatively easily to enable teaching of history, geography, and other  subjects.  253   CHAPTER 11  Elementary Students  We are frequently asked what a makerspace in an elementary school  should do and what equipment it can include. Elementary students  have always made things, and just as the ability to make a typed report  has migrated younger, so too can professional-looking art pieces. What  makes sense will largely depend on the school style, budget, and similar  factors that are not universal. In this chapter, we give you some anecdotal  information and resources developed by early adopters.  Chapters 8 and 10 give you some ideas that might work for younger   students. What we will focus on in this brief chapter are some special  considerations for younger students and makerspaces that serve them,  and their use of 3D printing in particular.   What Is Realistic? There are four hurdles to a successful 3D print. You need to figure out what  you are trying to make. Then you need to create the CAD file and figure  out the slicing settings and print orientation. Finally, you will manage the  actual printing process and any post-processing. Typically, elementary  students will only go to the point of creating a CAD file, although in  Chapter 8 you can read about examples of students painting prints.    Joan Horvath, Rich Cameron 2018  J. Horvath and R. Cameron, Mastering 3D Printing in the Classroom, Library, and Lab,   https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-3501-0_11  255   ChapteR 11    eLementaRy StUdentS  Most 3D printers are designed primarily for the adult market, or at least  are recommended for age 13 and over. Generally speaking, this feels about  right to us. Most schools designate a staff person, a teacher, or  if they  have one  a makerspace manager to deal with the equipment. In some  cases this falls to the school librarian. If the school is K-12, though, older  students may be able to undergo some extra training and earn a defined  role in a makerspace—perhaps managing the queue of jobs to 3D printers,  doing quality control on CAD files, or slicing the files.  Another thing to consider is whether 3D prints can be part of a larger  fabrication project. Maybe a project is mostly cardboard, but a decorative  or functional part is made with a 3D printer. Having students think about  what tool to use for what job is a key part of the real-life design process, but  too often we see teachers trying to find a reason to use a 3D printer and  constructing an artificial project. It is better, if possible, to let an organic  design need create a use case for a 3D printer  or any tool .  The right project prompt is important, too. It should be neither too  specific nor so broad that students do not know where to start. This is a  natural way to fit design into other subjects  for example, illustrating part  of a story, or solving a problem a character encounters in a story . Chapter 7  looks at these issues for teachers generally, and you may find some further  insights there.  Tip  If you are interested in reading blogs with real stories of life  in educational making, particularly for the younger set, you might  enjoy Lucie deLaBruere’s journal, at http:  createmakelearn. blogspot.com. Lucie often collaborates with Rodney Batschelet,  whose work you can read about and see in Chapter 8  we appreciate  their suggestions . John Umekubo’s eponymous website, https:   johnumekubo.com, is another elementary-focused source of  maker-educator news and practical ideas.  256   ChapteR 11    eLementaRy StUdentS   Design The maker movement has resulted in the democratization of CAD tools,  discussed in depth in Chapter 6. Tinkercad  www.tinkercad.com  and  Morphi  www.morphiapp.com  are common choices for the younger set.  Tinkercad has the virtue and problem that it is entirely web based, but it  is free and always adding new features. Morphi is a downloadable app,  available at a modest price per student.  Younger students, though, tend to make unprintable designs in   Tinkercad. Often, they will have pieces of “one part” hovering over one  another or poking below the level of the platform. A discussion of basic  design constraints, at an age-appropriate level, can help.  Have a large,  flat base, avoid overhangs, be sure features are not too small, and so on.   We have found that pictures of “the right way” to design something for 3D  printing  or any fabrication technology , along with what happens when  things are created “the wrong way,” to be valuable to learners of all ages. Tinkercad used to operate purely by dragging, dropping, and adding  and subtracting prefabricated shapes, but it has now added a “Scribble”  function. This allows you to do a limited amount of freehand drawing,  such as Joan’s name on the side of the roof in Figure 11-1, and add these  freehand parts to other shapes.  Even if young students do not have access to a 3D printer, learning  CAD programs early will give them a head start later on if they do have  access to digital fabrication tools when they are older.  257   ChapteR 11    eLementaRy StUdentS  Figure 11-1.  Demonstration of the Scribble functionality in Tinkercad  If you are running the makerspace, you will want to come up   Tip  with a policy about what acceptable use of school 3d printers is.  Classwork only? If not, do teachers give permission? are they only  allowed to print their own designs, or can they pull down things from  thingiverse and print them  or have them printed ? Who pays for  filament? We talk about these issues more in Chapter 7. In an ideal  world, teachers will want to make prints to demonstrate concepts,  and priorities will need to be set up.   Teaching Coding Teaching CAD can be part of teaching coding. Tinkercad has recently  added Codeblocks, which are based on Scratch blocks. This feature, in beta  as of this writing, is a way to tie in coding and design.  258   ChapteR 11    eLementaRy StUdentS  At a more sophisticated level, OpenSCAD  also discussed in Chapter 6    enables you to develop models based on code rather than drag-and- drop  objects. It may not be appropriate for the average elementary student,  however; it is a C-like language  a family of languages that also includes  Java and Python  and requires being able to handle coding at that level.   Summary Elementary-level students will most likely be involved in the front end  of the 3D printing process  design and CAD  and possibly in the post-  processing  painting . In-between there will likely be a need for some  support for slicing and running the prints, and for other steps that may  need more grown-up equipment. Using the design process as training for  later hands-on work might be a realistic way to go, too.  259   CHAPTER 12  The Special-Needs  Student  Special-needs teachers always have to be creative and often must invent  props to get their points across. 3D printing can have a particular role to  play for learners who benefit from tactile interactions.  However, as we have seen in Chapter 6 and elsewhere, creating   effective models can be challenging. Models from free databases can be  hard to print, or may represent the concept they claim to show incorrectly  or incompletely. Models for math and science, in particular, often need  some background materials with the model so that the assumptions and  constraints are clear.  In this chapter, we focus on educational models—models that a   teacher or parent might use to get across a concept. There are, of course,  professionals using 3D printing in a variety of medical applications. There  are also amateur groups attempting to create customized designs to assist  people with daily living. Some of these are created through contests and  hackathons, and others through organized, ongoing programs.  Traditional nonprofit disabled advocacy groups are also getting   involved. The Neil Squire Society in Canada  www.neilsquire.ca , for  example, has a Makers Making Change initiative that brings together  hobbyist inventors and people who need a problem solved.

Making Tactile Models A model that is an accurate representation of a fundamentally 3D shape can  avoid the type of problem shown in Figures 12-1 and 12-2. In these figures,  we printed an actual cube and a classic perspective drawing of a cube.  Figure 12-1.  An actual cube and a perspective drawing print of one  Making a raised-line drawing of existing book figures is a common way  of making a textbook accessible. As you can see in Figure 12-2, though, for  a geometrical object such as a cube, a 3D representation is far more useful.  This is the same pair of objects as in Figure 12-1, but as you can see, the  perspective print is pretty counterintuitive viewed from the wrong angle.  A blind student  who does not routinely see the world as a 2D projection   262   Chapter 12    the SpeCial-NeedS StudeNt  with perspective the way a sighted person does  may find it misleading at  best. As a blind friend of ours noted, though, it might be useful if you are  specifically teaching a blind person about perspective.  Figure 12-2.  Showing the reality of the perspective “cube” from  another angle  A lot of subtle issues are involved in developing good tactile models.   Do you want Braille labels, and if so how do you make it clear that  something is a label and not a feature? What is a comfortable scale for  a model, and how much detail should you keep? What is the minimum  feature size someone can feel, and how does that relate to the best your  particular printer can produce? If you are collecting a database of validated  models, what are good criteria for selection? Can models really stand  alone, or do they need extensive background materials to be “classroom  worthy”?  We and others are involved in trying to create some guidelines.   Standards get unwieldy if they are too detailed, but can leave too much to  the imagination if they are not detailed enough. Various groups around the  world are attacking these challenging issues.  263   Chapter 12    the SpeCial-NeedS StudeNt  Note  Your authors became interested in the issues of making  3d printed models for educators some time ago and have found  ourselves involved in helping to come up with standards for tactile  models. We are both members of the 3d tactile Standards Working  Group, currently chaired by Jim allan of the texas School for the Blind  and Visually impaired  tSVBi . this is a working group of the diaGraM   digital image and Graphic resources for accessible Materials  Center.  diaGraM is an initiative of Benetech, a California nonprofit, and  several partners and sponsors. if you are interested, see the resources  collected at http:  diagramcenter.org 3d-printing.html.  One thing we have discovered in the course of thinking about blind   student users is that models that are useful for them tend to be useful for  students generally. For example, learning about the relative volumes of  different simple geometrical shapes is challenging for blind students, but  really, that is true for everyone. In architecture, this philosophy is known as  universal design, and the general principles apply here.   Case Study: Constant-Volume Models Rich designed a set of hollow geometrical shape models  Figure 12-3  that  all have the same internal volume. The intent is that you can pour water  from one to another and prove to yourself that these geometries indeed  hold the same amount of water. He put them out on Youmagine as an  open source, freely available set of models  available at www.youmagine. com designs fixed-volume-objects . The little balls on top of the taller  models, added at the request of a teacher, make the models less pointy for  blind children’s use. This modification also has the side effect of making  them easier to print, because a point is difficult to print reliably.  This is a  good example of how easy it is in 3D printing to modify designs on the fly.   264   Chapter 12    the SpeCial-NeedS StudeNt  We have been surprised by how popular these models have been.   We have found that almost no adults remember that a cone has the same  volume as a cylinder one-third as tall with the same-diameter base; this  also applies pyramids and prisms with any number of sides, so long as  the base area remains constant. The models are very good for impromptu  geometry refreshers—and for letting kids who just learned about that to  feel very superior to Mom or Dad. Our takeaways from this experience  included the following:     Simple is good.     We decided Braille labels would be fussy and   distracting and did not use any.     Attention to detail and use cases are important.  As   mentioned, students may hurt themselves on a pointy  model, especially blind students, who cannot see  where the point is before they touch it and may reach  for it too quickly .     The “storytelling” of the model is critical and may   evolve as you use it in teaching. For example, it works a  lot better if you have three of the short models to show  that the cone is three times the height of the cylinder.     Models should be conducive to “experiments”—in this  case, stacking the models, comparing their bases  the  base areas are the same , filling them with water or  sand to test out the volume relationships, and so on.     Models need to be technically correct. In this case, the   internal volume had to be the same, which required  some care and knowledge of how the 3D printer was  going to lay up material. CAD programs design outer   265   Chapter 12    the SpeCial-NeedS StudeNt  surfaces more easily than internal ones. In other words,  it helps to have intimate knowledge of how a 3D printer  will produce the model.     Models should print easily on the poorly tuned and  somewhat abused 3D printers found in schools, and  not require too much teacher fiddling with settings.  Figure 12-3.  Constant-volume models   3D Printed Braille One final challenge is deciding whether and how to add Braille to a print.  Braille has a standard size and dot shape. Unfortunately, these dots are  small enough to be dicey to print. Figure 12-4 shows Braille printed in  three orientations.  Caution  Braille has very specific size constraints, so you need to  scale your print correctly before adding Braille to it. Otherwise you  may end up with labels that are at best hard to read.  266   Chapter 12    the SpeCial-NeedS StudeNt  One might naturally try to print Braille on the top surface of a print,  but as you can see in Figure 12-4, the print layering will result in rough  dots that are uncomfortable to read, and that likely have stringing between  them. Also, as we discuss in Chapter 9, prints are stronger within a layer  than between them. Braille printed on a top surface of a print is prone  to being rubbed off. Our conclusion after some experimentation is that  it is best to print Braille on the vertical sides of a print, to get maximum  resolution and strength.  Figure 12-4.  3D printed Braille in three orientations  Tip  rich developed an OpenSCad program to print standard  individual Braille letters  it we used it to create the letters  in Figure 12-4 . it is available at https:  github.com  whosawhatsis braille-openscad.  267    the SpeCial-NeedS StudeNt  Chapter 12   TVI Challenges In the end, the biggest challenge for extensive use of 3D printing for  teaching these students has been that teachers of the visually impaired   TVIs  are often itinerant, travelling from school to school to meet with  their students. They have very little time to learn to use a printer, and are  hampered in printing things themselves because they are often at different  schools on subsequent days.  Designing models is harder than it looks, too; there is more on this  in Chapter 6. We created a Google Group, called 3D Printed Education  Models where TVIs can post requests for models they would like to have,  at https:  groups.google.com forum !forum 3dp_edu_models. The  idea is that teachers at schools with makerspaces who could not think of  projects could fulfill these requests and put the results up as open source,  as we did with the constant-volume models. As of this writing, we have  many more requests than attempts to fulfill them, but we hope this will be  a future inspiration for students looking for a good project.  There have been various other attempts at similar matchups, including   a hackathon by Benetech and community calls by others, but progress  remains slow. We hope that our books of 3D printed science and math  projects are making a dent in this void. We would like to acknowledge TVIs  Lori Schindler, Yue-Ting Siu, Michael Cheverie, Jim Allan, and Sue O’Brien  for technical suggestions and inspiration, and Lindsay Yazzolino for model  design feedback.  Tip  a 3d pen  described in a sidebar in Chapter 2 and in the  “Vikings and 3d pens” example in Chapter 10  might be useful for  quick-and-dirty models of simple objects. But models tend to be  fragile, and we are not sure how practical a 3d pen may be for any  multi-use model.  268   Chapter 12    the SpeCial-NeedS StudeNt   Learning Differently What about using 3D prints for other students who need to learn  differently? For students who learn best by assembling or making things, a  3D printed model can be a game changer. The two of us, for example, learn  and think very differently, and we have found that the process of creating  models and talking about how to use them makes us both learn a lot more  than we might otherwise. Joan learns reasonably well by reading books or  going to traditional lectures, but Rich does much better if he can create a  3D model and manipulate it, even if only on a screen.  To this point, we have largely talked about teachers creating or finding   models. For visually impaired students, the CAD options are limited   OpenSCAD has a command-line interface that is somewhat accessible .  But for students with other learning differences who can use CAD, perhaps  there are creative ways to use model design to engage students and get  across content.  Tip  although not a 3d printing or special ed book per se, Joan  found Jo Boler’s book Mathematical Mindsets  Jossey-Bass, 2016   helpful in thinking about how to teach math unconventionally. paul  lockhart’s books  cited in Chapter 9  might inspire you, too.   Summary In this chapter, we looked at how 3D printing is being used for special  needs students, with visually impaired students as a primary focus. The  key challenges are model design and teacher access to and ability to use  3D printers. We covered various efforts underway to create standards for  models and to encourage more community creation of models that are  accessible to all students.  269   PART IV  Building Lifelong  Skills  In Part IV  Chapters 13 and 14  we discuss university and community uses  of 3D printing, and how to think about careers in 3D printing in the near  and long term. Chapter 13 focuses on research into both applications of 3D  printing and technology development for 3D printers. Chapter 14 winds up  the book with a discussion of the opportunities and challenges for teaching  entrepreneurship, and tries to predict where the manufacturing and other  applications of the technology are likely to be in the near and longer term.   CHAPTER 13  University Research  Applications  Many aspects of the 3D-printing ecosystem are still very much   wide- open research areas. Novel applications and technologies to improve  3D printing will likely be coming thick and fast for a long time. There is a  classic cycle of technology adoption called the Gartner Hype Cycle    www.gartner.com en research methodologies gartner-hype-cycle .  In this cycle, when a technology such as low-cost 3D printing comes  along, lots of people get excited. There is much over-promising and under- delivering as people rush into what they think might be a multibillion- dollar market. Early adopters buy one because it is cool, not necessarily  because they have a use for it. In the case of consumer 3D printing, that  peak probably came in 2012 or 2013.  Then there is usually a fall-off and some consolidation. In the case of  3D printers, low-cost producers, many from China, made machines that  did not meet unrealistic expectations for ease of use and typically did not  provide any tech support that might have eased this. Gartner calls this the  trough of disillusionment, and many 3D printer companies have indeed  gone out of business in the last couple of years. The days are gone when  everyone and their brother were putting up 3D printer ideas on Kickstarter.    Joan Horvath, Rich Cameron 2018  J. Horvath and R. Cameron, Mastering 3D Printing in the Classroom, Library, and Lab,   https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-3501-0_13  273   Chapter 13    University researCh appliCations  Finally, we now seem to be in the more realistic growth period for 3D  printing. Users understand that they need to know a bit about the process  to get good results, and more sophisticated users are trying to push the  boundaries. Some brave souls continue to start 3D printer companies. In  this chapter, we look at research areas and advanced applications at the  university and corporate research level. In Chapter 14, we speculate about  where current students may find future careers in additive manufacturing.   Materials Chapter 2 covers different materials that are available for 3D printing.  As noted there, research in 3D printing is increasingly being driven by  materials science research. There are vast arrays of filaments, resins, and  powders  for industrial machines  available now, but that does not mean  people are no longer doing research.  At the MIT Media Lab, Neri Oxman’s group  www.media.mit.edu   people neri projects  works with many novel materials, including glass.  They have developed a process to 3D print large, notably transparent glass  pieces.  Other groups at MIT  like the Tangible Media group,    http:  tangible.media.mit.edu projects   have also been working  with 3D-printing materials that change shape after printing by being  heated, for instance, so that they print flat and spring into interesting  shapes after being heated, or perhaps inflated.  Printing in concrete is an active research area, too. The Center for  Rapid Automated Fabrication Technologies  CRAFT, www.craft-usc. com  at USC has been looking into 3D printing with concrete for quite a  while. They have developed a technique called contour crafting, which  lays up a thick, clay-like concrete followed by a blade that smooths  away the layer lines. Here, too, developing concrete formulations that   274   Chapter 13    University researCh appliCations  can be used this way has been a large part of the research effort. These  printers make it possible to create concrete structures without using  forms  with a pretty large external gantry . One application that has  been proposed for the technology is to build many shelters quickly in  the wake of natural disasters. Concrete is a good building material, but  it needs reinforcement to make up for its low tensile strength. A number  of companies and research groups have been developing ways to create  buildings by extruding layers of concrete. They use different methods to  add reinforcement to the structures.  These examples, of course, are only a few of the many programs  at universities around the world. If you are interested in a particular  application or material, searching the peer-reviewed literature will likely  yield some results.   Printing Metal Printing directly in metal is a difficult industrial process and not likely to  occur in homes or offices anytime soon. Some companies we talk about in  Chapter 2’s “Advanced Filaments” section have come out with metal-filled  filament that embeds metal in plastic. The mixture is used to print, and  then the plastic is baked out. However, if you are moving to an industrial  scale, 3D printed metal parts are really coming into their own.  Direct printing of metal usually involves metal powder that is fused   by a laser or with some sort of binder  which also needs to be baked out .  The challenge is that metal powder is dangerous and difficult to work with,  and is even prone to explosions. For that reason, most metal 3D printers  operate in an inert gas atmosphere, like argon. The materials handling  procedures of powder-based metal 3D printers require significant facilities  investments.  275   Chapter 13    University researCh appliCations  With that said, for the right application, metal 3D printing can be a  game-changer. One of the bigger producers of direct-metal printers, 3D  Systems  www.3dsystems.com , has many case studies on its website. Some  particularly interesting ones include the following:     Titanium bone replacements are printed in a fine  lattice pattern so that bone will grow into them, a  process called osseointegration.      “Lightweighted” aerospace structures are made very  strong but light by creating complex parts which have  lattice-like structures only where they need to be to  carry a load, and open space where they do not.     Complex parts can be made that combine dozens  or even hundreds of previous components, saving  assembly time and improving reliability.  More and more alloys are available for 3D printing, too, from steel to   aluminum alloys and titanium.   Analyzing Parts As we have said repeatedly in this book, 3D printers are robots that are  really not all that sophisticated, and that may be using materials that  have very poorly characterized engineering properties. At this level of  sophistication, modeling the stresses experienced by a 3D printed part is  challenging, other than by destructively testing an exact replica. This may  change over time, but it is one of the factors limiting applications of small  printers for tasks that require analyzing stresses on the part in software first.  Industrial printers are in another category entirely. Systems like the  large metal printers need sophisticated process control. To complicate  matters, if one is designing a part for a critical use, software is needed  to model the loads on that part. At the moment, many of the standard   276   Chapter 13    University researCh appliCations  engineering software packages that engineers use to design parts cannot  handle 3D printed parts well or at all. As discussed in Chapter 9, 3D prints  can be stronger in some directions than others, particularly ones that use  filament. Printer manufacturer 3D Systems, which has many printers in  this market, handles this by selling integrated design and printer control  software, with tight specifications for materials.  Generative design software, which creates possible designs for parts   based on requirements for them, is evolving as a way to help humans  design complex parts optimized for 3D printing—for example, parts  with lots of load-bearing latticework. Autodesk is exploring this idea, as  described at www.autodesk.com solutions generative-design.   Printing Food 3D printed food was a hyped application a few years ago, but this  enthusiasm has since been tempered. The reality is that 3D printing is slow   compared to industrial throughput , and managing finicky temperature  ranges while making printers food-safe is a challenge. To be food-safe,  printers need to have everything that touches food be sterilizable and be  made of food-safe materials. To solve these issues, most food printers use  some sort of syringe-like device to extrude a paste.  Variety is limited though, because most food printing does not   involve the actual programmatic creation or mixing of ingredients, but  simply involves extruding these mixtures into predetermined locations   something that is already commonplace in the creation of packaged  food . However, printing pieces that can be used to make molds is a  promising area of development for customizing the shapes of food  products, rather than their compositions.  There are niche printers for chocolate  for example, http:  chocedge.com .    There are also “3D printers” that make pancakes  www.pancakebot.com ,  but they are really just drawing in 2D.  277   Chapter 13    University researCh appliCations   Bioprinting Specialized biological printers  to make human organs, for example   are called bioprinters, and we touched on these in Chapter 2. They have  similar design constraints to food printers and are also often syringe-  based systems. Bioprinters lay down a medium  usually some kind of gel,  like alginate  that contains live cells. Cellink  https:  cellink.com  has  been developing “bioinks” to facilitate other types of structures, and has a  multi-head printer that also includes capabilities such as UV sterilization.  Different heads can be used to lay down different types of materials that  require cooling, say, or heating.  Bioprinters have garnered a lot of press lately, and here the 3D printer   part is relatively easy. Learning how to grow tissues that can be accepted  by the human body will be the hard part going forward.   Custom Equipment and Prototypes The next chapter discusses short-run manufacturing and prototyping  more generally. In the university environment, 3D printing can be a very  cost-effective way to create lab equipment. This is particularly true when  no good existing equipment will serve the desired purpose.  We were part of an effort a few years ago to help University of   California, Riverside, entomology researchers in Richard Stouthamer’s  lab design a 3D-printable “emergence trap” for the polyphagous shothole  borer  PSHB .  PSHB beetles bore into a tree and deposit a fungus and ultimately eggs  for the next generation. The researchers wanted to create a trap that would  attach to a tree and catch some of the beetles and the fungus for study, and  see how many beetles and their offspring were emerging from the holes  they had bored into the trees. 3D printing allowed the scientists to iterate  designs as they learned more about what would work, and to have exactly  what they wanted.  278   Chapter 13    University researCh appliCations  Note  if you want to read the details of the bug trap case study,  it has been published in this scientific journal article: Daniel Berry,  roger D. selby, Joan C. horvath, rich h. Cameron, Diego porqueras,  richard stouthamer  February, 2016 , “a Modular system of 3D  printed emergence traps for studying the Biology of shot hole Borers  and other Scolytinae.” Journal of Economic Entomology,   Doi: 10.1093 jee tov407.  Another area where 3D printing has made a difference is in   experiments that require managing small amounts of fluid, sometimes  called millifluidics, to distinguish it from the even-smaller microfluidics.  These applications require custom tiny flow paths to study various fluid  properties. For examples, try searching on “millifluidics 3D printing”   in the Public Library of Science  PLOS  open-access journals,   http:  collections.plos.org, for recent work in this space.   Standards One of the challenges in using 3D printed parts is that filament’s  mechanical properties can vary widely, even with the colors of a  manufacturer’s PLA, for instance. For filament-printed parts especially,  the part geometry and the relative direction of forces to layer lines matters  a lot. Resin print properties can depend both on the resin’s mechanical  properties and on how well the curing process followed specifications.  Parts that require finishing or baking out have uncertainties introduced in  those steps.  279   Chapter 13    University researCh appliCations  Various groups have been wrestling with testing common 3D-printing   materials for qualities like strength and chemical interactions, but it is  challenging. Some groups working in this space include the following:      Joshua Pearce’s group at Michigan Technological  University has been publishing about their attempts to  get realistic numbers for some of these key mechanical  and chemical properties. Many papers are linked in  their Appropedia wiki at www.appropedia.org Pearce_ publications_in_materials_science_and_engineering.     The American National Standards Institute  ANSI  and   various collaborators are working on a standard: www. ansi.org standards_activities standards_boards_ panels amsc .     ASTM has standards, including those for specific  metals, at www.astm.org Standards additive-  manufacturing- technology-standards.html.  There is a lot of work to do here, and thorough characterizations of   materials and geometries will be a research effort for some time to come.   Summary Researchers at the university level have many options to improve the  3D-printing process: by creating new materials, finding novel ways to  use existing ones, and finding new applications. There is still much work  to be done to make 3D printing easier to use, and to make the physical  and chemical properties of 3D prints more consistent and reliable for  demanding applications. Meanwhile, scientists can take advantage of the  technology to create custom equipment that can let them explore frontiers  more cheaply and creatively than might have seemed possible before the  ubiquity of low-cost printers.  280   CHAPTER 14  Community  and Careers  We are often asked what types of 3D printing–related jobs will be available  in the future. Since it is pretty challenging to predict where the industry  will go in the next couple of years, much less in a decade or two, any  attempt to answer should be taken with a large grain of salt. Any 3D printer  that a student uses now will have very little resemblance to an industrial  printer used for metal parts. However, the skill of being able to envision  something, create a computer model of it, and then transform that into a  physical object will always be a valuable one.  Note  We have found that many people coming into this space are  comfortable with either the computer design part of it or the physical  fabrication. People comfortable with both are less common. This is  one reason that we encourage having students run their own print  jobs, once they are old enough. There is no substitute for actual  experience making things—it is like the difference between watching  someone play a sport and trying it yourself.  What, then, is the best way to approach preparing students for the  economy they are likely to work in? First, training in technical subjects  is always a basic requirement, and figuring out how to make a physical     Joan Horvath, Rich Cameron 2018  J. Horvath and R. Cameron, Mastering 3D Printing in the Classroom, Library, and Lab,   https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-3501-0_14  281   ChaPTer 14    CommuniTy and Careers  part that will hold together and do whatever it is supposed to do is a great  way to teach many engineering basics. The physicality of the product   instead of something on a screen  can also help students think about  making a product useful and attractive  or even fun  instead of just  creating something that can support a load. For students thinking about a  career in the arts, digital manufacturing can increase their reach in a new  medium. Finally, physically creating something often requires teamwork  to bring together the many strengths needed for successful maker projects.  Sometimes student team projects can seem contrived, but to make  something, teams will often form organically, because so many skills are  typically needed.   Student Entrepreneurship If students have reasonably free access to a makerspace, sooner or later  some of them will invent a product that their peers want. Whether it is a toy  or something with the school logo for sporting events, what happens if you  suddenly have an inventor on your hands with a market? It is best to think  about this ahead of time and, if you are at a public school, to find out if  your district has policies about students using equipment for profit. Some  things to consider:     Who owns the designs invented at school, whether for a   school project or something else?     Can students use school materials to make ten of   something for their friends, if they do not charge for it?     Can students bring materials in and use school   printers  or other equipment  to make things they then  subsequently sell?     Are there tax and liability implications for the student   and or the school?  282   ChaPTer 14    CommuniTy and Careers  We cover some of the practicalities of running a 3D printer and its   facilities needs in Chapter 5. Take a look particularly at the “Where Should  We Put It?” Section.  Tip  schools need to decide whether they can encourage and  support entrepreneurship, and how far they can go in that support.  universities have wrestled with this for a long time  the department  that handles these things is usually called the “technology transfer”  or “licensing” group , and if you want to encourage this in a big way,  you might talk to a local university tech transfer office that knows  your school system and community.  Students might learn about these technologies at school and want   to start a business at home. If the student’s parents are able to provide a  printer and supplies and give them access to legal and tax advice, then there  are a variety of marketplaces  like www.tindie.com and www.etsy.com    that might serve as outlets. A crowdfunding site  like Kickstarter,   www.kickstarter.com  can be an option for more ambitious ideas.  it is important to stay realistic. making, marketing, and   Caution  selling a product are not easy, and standard business advice of  keeping overhead low applies. if a product is successful, keeping  up with demand and doing the printing, packing, and shipping can  become substantial endeavors. many Kickstarter campaigns fail to  deliver after being funded because their creator did not properly  budget for their time and all the other expenses, beyond raw  materials, that would be required to deliver on their promises. and  of course, there is always the risk that the idea will be copied by  someone bigger if it is very successful.  283   ChaPTer 14    CommuniTy and Careers  This all sounds very exciting and like the classic company-in-a-garage   dream. What happens, though, if the student’s parents cannot afford to  capitalize equipment or pay for a bit of legal or accounting advice? Age  limits on various business activities such as selling on a site can be an  issue, too, if there is no parent support of the young entrepreneur, and this  is likely to vary in different states and countries, too. Such students may be  creating jobs for themselves in an area where jobs are few and far between,  but they will need some help to get going.  There are charter schools like Prime School in Los Angeles    www.primeschool.org, planned for launch in 2019  that have  entrepreneurship in high-poverty areas as a core focus. The availability of  both maker tools and Internet selling platforms has dramatically lowered  the cost of entry for product entrepreneurs and 3D-printing service  providers. Schools are starting to look to leverage these tools for student  and community benefit. We hope that the business and maker community  will help these entrepreneurs use maker tech and Internet tools to create  enterprises where there were none before.  Note  The business of using consumer 3d printers to print jobs  for the general public has become rather low-margin, at least in  California where competition has driven down prices. sites like  www.3dhubs.com let printer owners bid on printing jobs that people  post, and anecdotally bids seem to be quite reasonable now for  straightforward prints in PLa. This is good for the consumer wanting  something printed and for someone doing it in their garage for  extra money. it is a low-margin business, particularly because print  files submitted often need some substantial rework before printing.  We suspect that many of these are teens doing print jobs as an  alternative to mowing lawns, and we have dubbed this phenomenon  the “digital lemonade stand.” Professional service bureaus seem   284   ChaPTer 14    CommuniTy and Careers  to be migrating more to specialized prints that require expensive  equipment, or to combining scanning, 3d design, and printing  services under one roof.   Public Library Makerspaces Numerous public libraries have been putting in makerspaces for their  communities. In many cases, the presumption is that the majority of users  will be children and teens, and the “teen librarian” often seems to be  the one who winds up managing it. Obviously, adults wanting to retrain  themselves can be beneficiaries, too  learning either the computer or  hands-on skills or both . For some reason, 3D printers are often seen by  libraries as a kid thing, which we think is too limiting.  The issues we mention earlier in the chapter for schools also apply  to a library. The situation is a little different, though, in that a library is  intended to be a public resource. The question becomes how much any  one person can monopolize the resource, and how the makerspace can  sustain itself if it does not have long-term funding.  Libraries have to decide whether they want to be at-cost or no-cost 3D  printing and perhaps laser-cutting service bureaus for the community, for  example, and whether that puts them in competition with for-profit local  businesses. Setting priorities for printer access and policies about what  can be printed are important, too. Finally, there will need to be a process  to be sure that the right materials are used with any maker machinery. See  Chapter 1 for laser cutter concerns and Chapter 2 for 3D-printer materials  compatibility.  Some libraries are older civic buildings, and finding a place that   has power, that can keep the equipment secure, and that has adequate  ventilation can be a challenge. Often there is money donated to buy  equipment, but not to renovate any space or train staff. This can require a  bit of creativity.  285   ChaPTer 14    CommuniTy and Careers  Caution  unfortunately, sometimes schools or libraries have  equipment donated that does not work or that is more expensive  to run than a newer machine might be. if you are in charge of a  nonprofit makerspace, ask gentle questions if your donors are giving  you used equipment. otherwise, a lot of staff time and frustration can  be spent trying to get something broken to work when you assume  it is you or your staff, not the equipment, that is the problem. or you  might have trouble finding proprietary materials if the machine is no  longer made.  Libraries can play a key role in letting the public know what it is   possible to do with low-cost 3D printers and other maker technologies,  such as small electronics. Figure 14-1 shows Joan running a demonstration  table with a lot of 3D prints and some fashion tech electronics  demonstration. This event was at the Pasadena Public Library’s official  grand opening of its makerspace. Often people need some inspiration  to understand the possibilities, so if you are a librarian opening a space,  reach out to local groups to display what they are doing to inspire  everyone. Competitions and displays of finished projects are a great way to  invite community involvement, too.  Projects that serve the community, ranging from designing citizen   science equipment to helping community theater, can be developed over  time.  286   ChaPTer 14    CommuniTy and Careers  Figure 14-1.  Joan demonstrating various types of maker tech at a  library  Digital Fabrication Career Opportunities What a student learns on a small consumer 3D printer may not transfer  directly to more sophisticated industrial machines, but the intuition helps.  Today, 3D printing is being used in a few applications where it adds a lot  of value. In this section, we list some typical applications, both to survey  the state of the art and perhaps suggest areas for student projects or  research to prepare for entering the industry someday. As experience and  appropriate automation grow, this list is likely to grow as well.  287    CommuniTy and Careers  ChaPTer 14   Prototyping 3D printing has been used for prototyping for decades, and that remains  a major application. Now that there are many materials that can be 3D  printed  Chapter 2 , it is a lot easier to create a model that mimics the form  and fit of a product to see how it feels or works with other parts.  Architects and others who need to visualize and discuss complex   structures with clients can also benefit from 3D printed models, or  incorporate 3D printed pieces into more traditional models of structures.  Figure 14-2, for example, is a typical industrial part, prototyped by 3D  printer manufacturer MAKEiT, Inc.  http:  makeit-3d.com   in carbon  fiber-infused filament.  Figure 14-2.  Carbon fiber filament part  part courtesy of MAKEiT, Inc.    Bridge Manufacturing Manufacturers often use “just in time” methods to keep parts in stock. This  means that they do not keep a lot of inventory on hand, and sometimes a  whole line will have to stop to wait for a part. To get through that and keep  the line running, manufacturers turn to bridge parts, made in some other  way than the regular process.  288   ChaPTer 14    CommuniTy and Careers  Since there are so many materials now, the bridge parts can often be   3D printed in the same material as the production part. This means, in  turn, that the finished product can be shipped with the bridge part, and it  might not need to be replaced  if quality control requirements allow use of  a 3D printed part .   Short-Run Manufacturing The next step up from bridge manufacturing is to plan to 3D print your  manufacturing run of parts in the first place. Some of the early adopters  of this were, not surprisingly, the 3D-printer manufacturers themselves.  Figure 14-3 shows 3D-printer manufacturer MAKEiT’s in-house product  facility doing a short run of custom speaker housings designed by Russell  Singer, one of the staff.  Printing the same parts over and over can be pretty efficient, since  it is worth it to really optimize the printer settings and then just launch  the same job over and over. However, 3D printing can be slow for some  applications, and the issues with being able to model a part’s mechanical  properties to a high enough fidelity might be problematic in some  applications.  Tip  Because it is possible to 3d print shapes that would be difficult  or impossible to manufacture by more conventional methods,  you may be able to print what would otherwise be a complicated  assembly in far fewer pieces, saving worker time.  289   ChaPTer 14    CommuniTy and Careers  Figure 14-3.  Short-run manufacturing  courtesy of Russell Singer   MAKEiT, Inc.    Mass Customization It is not a big step to go from manufacturing a small number of identical  parts one at a time to asking whether one can make a standard part  customizable instead. A CAD model might have just a few parameters  that can be tweaked depending on what the user needs, or the individual  product might be made from a scan.  Dentists have been early adopters of this approach, since almost all   of what they do is custom to every patient. Most of the current dental  applications use resin printers to create devices that do not go in the  mouth themselves but are used as molds for casting, vacuum forming, or  other technologies.  Moving to metal printing, orthopedists have been printing artificial  hips and other implants. They are printed, typically in a titanium alloy,  with surface texture that allows the bone to grow into and fuse with the  implant, a process known as osseointegration  Figure 14-4 . Moving beyond  orthopedics, mentioned in the preceding chapter, printing entire organs is  an evolving field that has great promise for many medical conditions.  290   ChaPTer 14    CommuniTy and Careers  Figure 14-4.  3D Systems ProX ® DMP 320 printers and K2M’s  advanced methodologies called Lamellar 3D Titanium Technology™  enable K2M to produce structures in its CASCADIA™ Interbody  Systems that provide both porosity and surface roughness to allow for  bone growth  image courtesy of 3D Systems   3D printed fashion  notably shoes and high fashion at this point  is in  its early days, and is mostly used for prototyping or high-visibility pieces  for celebrity clients or athletes. A 3D printed dress created by designer  Michael Schmidt  www.michaelschmidtstudios.com  and technologist  Francisco Bitoni for Dita von Teese was an early  rather revealing  printed  lacework-like dress.  Designers Nervous System  https:  n-e-r-v-o-u-s.com     created the “Kinematic Dress,” which, like chain armor, folds up for  printing  on an SLS machine  and then flows nicely for the wearer. Other  novel, 3D printed high fashion has been created by Anouk Wipprecht   www.anoukwipprecht.nl —famously, her “Spider Dress,” which attacked  anyone who got too close with animatronic legs. In the next section, we  will look at creating jewelry by using 3D prints as a mold.  291   ChaPTer 14    CommuniTy and Careers  Note  We can think of these applications as “hardware as a  service,” in which a digital file can be tweaked and manufactured  anyplace an appropriate fabrication machine exists.   Industrial Moldmaking A somewhat more conventional application of 3D prints is as forms or  molds. Either a 3D printed part can be used as the positive to create a  negative mold, or a negative mold can be created with 3D printing directly.  PLA or specially formulated resins are commonly used to make jewelry  from 3D prints via investment  or lost-wax  casting. In this process, a  positive mold called a pattern is created, and then ceramic is laid up around  it. The ceramic is fired, and the wax, resin, or PLA melts out. Then metal  is poured in to make the jewelry piece. Finally, the ceramic mold must be  broken to remove the metal piece, so each one can only be used once.  Beginning the process again would traditionally involve carving a new   wax pattern that will inevitably end up slightly different from the first.  However, a 3D printed pattern can be reproduced precisely just by running  the print again. You can change some numbers in the CAD file if it was not  quite right and try again, or customize the design for another client.  There is some early work by Formlabs to create a resin that can be  used for injection molds. As this evolves, it might enable lower-volume  injection molding runs, since this drastically lowers tooling costs and  turnaround time.  Tip  Trying out 3d printed tooling or other in-house parts is a good  way to test out 3d printing with something that is not going to a  customer.  292   ChaPTer 14    CommuniTy and Careers   Direct Metal 3D Printing At the moment, printing directly in metal is a challenging process,  requiring sophisticated facilities management. However, ways around that  are being explored, as we mention in Chapter 2. Metal 3D printing has  incredible promise for making complex, multi-element parts that will be  light and very reliable.  We expect that technology development for and applications of the   various types of metal printing will continue to grow rapidly. Manufacturer  3D Systems  www.3dsystems.com  has many good case studies on its  website.   Summary In this chapter, we started out by framing the issues for student  entrepreneurship in school or in enterprises that might be spun out from a  school project. Next, we thought about libraries and how these community  centers might foster local entrepreneurs. Finally, we surveyed the state of  the practice of the use of 3D printing in industry to provide some ideas to  guide preparation of the future stars of the design studio and factory floor.  293   APPENDIX   Links and Resources   Front Matter Nonscriptum LLC: www.nonscriptum.com   Chapter 1 Reprap Project on Wikipedia: http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki RepRap_ Project  Reprap Family Tree: http:  reprap.org wiki RepRap_Family_Tree Kickstarter: www.kickstarter.com Arc Gimbal on Youmagine: www.youmagine.com designs arc-gimbal   Chapter 2 Buildtak: www.buildtak.com  Markforged: www.markforged.com Formlabs: www.formlabs.com Pancakebot: www.pancakebot.com Organovo: www.organovo.com SE3D: www.se3d.com    Joan Horvath, Rich Cameron 2018  J.
