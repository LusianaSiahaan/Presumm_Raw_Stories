JavaScript Goodies  by Joe Burns, Ph.D.  Second Edition  Pearson Technology Group  201 West 103rd Street Indianapolis, Indiana 46290    Praise for Joe’s most recent book, Web Site Design Goodies Those looking for design templates and HTML “how-to” will be disappointed. And a good thing, too. Instead, Joe Burns provides refreshing honesty and opinion, with intelligent advice on the key elements of Web site design, and advice which will still stand you in good stead long after HTML is a distant memory—a Web design guide for life.  Give a man a design template or code list, and you’ve fed him for one Web site. Give him this book, and you’ve set him on his way to building as many different Web sites as he needs. Instead of a paint-by-numbers approach, Joe uses his personable, conversational style to encourage self-development and design confidence.  At the same time, he provides in-depth comment on important Web site design issues, such as colors, technical wizardry, link placement, fonts, focus, and so on, and uses numerous examples, surveys, and site reviews to back up his points. Anyone who thinks they’ve done a good job with their Web site would do well to read this book and then reassess their work.  —Mark Brownlow; VP Content, Internet Business Forum, Inc.; http:  www.ibizhome.com   This is the kind of book an aspiring Web designer should read before learning HTML. For it is not just another HTML book, in fact it contains no HTML at all. The author presents pages followed by his opinion regarding the design. As Burns is the first to say, his opinions are not infallible; there can be circumstances where you may not want to follow his advice. However, he does know what he is talking about, so do not be hasty toward the contrary position.  I found the book easy to read, and the choices for sample sites were well made. Rather than making it easy for himself by picking sites that are awful, in general he chose pages that are quite good. If a site had been atrocious, the problems would have been obvious, even for a beginner. By choosing good ones, he could then point out the “flaws” that are easily over- looked.  This is a book that should be read either before or concurrently with a book that teaches the construction of pages. It is not necessary to know HTML to understand the material, and Web pages are like houses: You should first learn to read the blueprints before you start to build the walls.  —Charles Ashbacher; author of Sams Teach Yourself XML in 24 Hours  ii   Another Superb Job by Joe Burns! I have been working with Web pages for over four years, and I have taught Web design classes. I thought I had a good idea of what is involved with the design, setup, and market- ing of a Web site. Now I find this book, and there are so many things I had never thought of before.  As with other Joe Burns books, this book is an excellent representation of what you can do if you have a little guidance to help you along. Burns is truly remarkable in the ways he is able to present ideas clearly yet make them understandable at the same time.  The book begins with an overview of what things to look for and what ideas to consider when planning and designing a Web site. Then Burns has you consider five questions before you begin the actual design layout—an approach that will help in making a better Web site.  There are other topics, like the 10 things you shouldn’t put in the Web site, choosing a server and an ISP, text, and color; there is something for beginners and experts alike. Burns also spends time explaining links, images, and visual effects before moving on to counters and Web site promotion.  Overall, there is about everything you need to have to make sure you have a successful Web site right from the start and for years to come. A first-rate book from a first-rate author.  —Michael Woznicki  Praise for Author Joe Burns’s HTML Goodies Web Site  From the Web Site Visitors “I’d like to thank you for your HTML site. Instead of wasting time scouring the Internet, the code and examples on your site have made it so much easier to see my mistakes and to finally create a working Web site.”  “… your tutorial, page by page, word by word, told me every other thing I needed to know about Web design. It was like finding a gold mine. Your language was so impressive and so much direct to the heart that I always thought you [were] there talking to me, instead of me reading from your site. I saved all the pages of [HTMLGoodies.com] and [it] became the bible of my Web design.”  —Anthony Moore  —Barun Sen  iii   “Thank you so much! Trying to learn how to use tables was causing my brain to pick up smoking. I understand now; thanks for explaining it in English.”  “Thanks thanks thanks for the wonderful  easy  primer! I am going day by day, and my page, boring though it is … is really coming along!”  “… HTMLgoodies is an excellent Web site with plenty of GOLD content about HTML …. Well done on a superbly successful site!”  —Elizabeth Rotondi  —Jean Van Minnen  —Carl Blythe  “Thanks for the beautiful pieces of work. I salute you.”  —John J. Lacombe II; jlacombe@cpcug.org; Capital PC Users Group  “This is not only a first-rate page but is also a huge help to me, and, my guess is, many, MANY people like me. These tutorials have helped me create my own page. Once again, thank you. You’re terrific.”  —Rose Dewitt Bukater  “You probably get dozens of thank-you notes each day, but I just wanted to add my own to the lot. Since I’m a just starting out in the HTML world, I’ve been visiting your tutorials a lot. Just wanted you to know I’ve learned more from your site than from any of the books I’ve bought!”  “Dear Mr. Really Smart Cool-Happening Dude, I would like to thank you because I have made the transition from FrontPage 98 to HTML all because of you. I spent months trying to learn HTML before I learned of your site, and at age 14 I fully understand the ins and outs of HTML 4. My page is in the works, and I owe it all to you.”  —Dawn C. Lindley  —Taylor Ackley  “I just wanted to let you know that you are doing an amazing service to all of us weekend Webmasters. Thanks a million! P.S. My Web page looks and feels a thousand times better since I have been following your tutorials.”  —Aaron Joel Chettle; Seneca College Engineering  iv   “WOW!!!! … I was always interested in setting up a Web page but was afraid that it would be too difficult for me to comprehend…. So my first introduction to HTML was actually YOUR primers … and WOW!!!!!!! I went through ALL of them this very morning with my mouth hanging wide open …. I am still so surprised that I cannot gather any words to describe to you how I feel at this moment.”  —Ludwin L. Statie  “I’m an old dog learning new tricks. I will be taking a Web publishing college course come August. I used your primer as a jump start. I really enjoyed your primer and thought it would … help me. I now feel prepared for the college course and not so afraid to ‘run with the big dogs.’”  —Patricia Cuthbertson  From the Media “If you are just learning, or already know HTML, this site is the only place you’ll need. Expert tutorials make learning Web design quick and easy. Definitely check this site out.”  —HTML Design Association  “Dr. Joe Burns offers help at all levels—from novice to the expert.”  —Signal Magazine; January 26, 1998  “Great stuff. Probably the best overall site reviewed here.”  —NetUser Magazine  “If you’re looking for information on HTML, you’ll find it here.”  —USA Today Hot Site; March 23, 1998  “His is a technical site that appeals to an exploding piece of the Internet pie—people build- ing their own Web site.”  —PCNovice Guide to Building Web Sites; 1997  “We would like permission to use your Web pages [HTML Goodies] to help teach [building] Web sites.”  —San Antonio Electronic Commerce Resource Center; February 10, 1998  v   From Teachers “If everyone wrote ‘how-to’ pages and books as well as you, boy life would be simpler.”  —Deb Spearing Ph.D.; University Registrar, Ohio State University  “I am going to use your Goodies [to teach with] this summer! Awesome!”  —Cynthia Lanius; Rice University  “I hope your own students and colleagues appreciate the importance and magnitude of the service you provide to the discipline of communication technology via the Internet. In just a short time, Joe Burns has become a legend on the Internet among those who teach in this field.”  —Raymond E. Schroeder; Professor of Communication, Springfield University  “The English classes at Union Alternative High School [are] using Dr. Joe Burns’s Web site HTML Goodies as an online text book. Students now have Web pages they are proud of. They have learned to teach themselves unfamiliar subject matter. There is new excitement in the class; self-esteem is up. In a nutshell: We have succeeded. Thank you for helping, Dr. Burns.”  —Aaron Wills; English teacher, Union School District, Union, MO  vi    Associate Publisher  Dean Miller  Acquisitions Editor  Todd Green  Development Editor  Victoria Elzey  Technical Editor  Jim O’Donnell  Managing Editor  Thomas F.

Acknowledgments  Acknowledgments by Joe Burns First and foremost, many, many thanks to Andree Growney who went into this project with me knowing full well that it might never become anything more than a series of Web pages. Hey, Andree! We got a book!  Thanks to Tiffany Taylor for content editing the first edition of this book. Compared to the HTML Goodies book, this was painless. Ditto the painless comments from Michelle Wyner at Netscape. Your tech editing was great. You pointed out concerns in a helpful manner, and I probably used your words more times than I should have.  As for this second edition of JavaScript Goodies: Big thanks to Todd Green for the go-ahead to get the project underway and not getting upset when I said I wanted to bulk the book  up … way up. Thanks to Victoria Elzey for the DE work. Finally, thanks to Jim O’Donnell for tech editing this second edition. It’s a much better, and more up-to-date, book now because of Jim’s work.  Larry Augustine deserves thanks for allowing me to sit in my office at work and write when I should have been taking care of a radio station. I know you knew. Thanks for giving me the time.  xxiv   Thanks to Ken Kopf for being there when I was at the end of my JavaScript rope. You helped more than you know.  Thanks to Mom and Dad for playing cheerleader after the last book and now for this one. Every person in Cleveland who came into contact with them was forced to listen to stories of their son, the author.  A big thank-you to Charles Spiro, a professor at Lord Fairfax Community College, who used this book for one of this Internet programming classes. He found, and helped repair, many of the concerns and problems in the first edition. Thanks Charles, you’re a gentle- man.  Dave … I’m a teacher because I wanted to be just like you.

I never thought I’d write a book, let alone a second edition. How about that?  The purpose of this book’s lessons is to get you started writing your own JavaScript events.  If you’ve tried to learn JavaScript through a textbook or from the Internet, my guess is that you found it quite difficult. Me, too. After a while, the text melds into a large block of strange hieroglyphics equal to the Rosetta stone. I always feel like I’m deciphering the text rather than reading it.  Learning JavaScript is literally learning a new language. The text might look like English, but the construction of the sentences is quite different. This book teaches you JavaScript by coming at the language from an entirely new perspective. Instead of getting all the com- mands and then building a script, we’ll start with the script and tear it down to its individ- ual commands. In the process, you’ll learn JavaScript programming.  Why Now? In 1999, when HTML Goodies  http:  www.htmlgoodies.com  was dedicated solely to HTML, I would get e-mail asking, “When are you going to put together a series of lessons for    JavaScript Goodies ➤  writing JavaScript?” Most readers of my sites know that I already have primers for HTML and for creating advertising banners, so why not JavaScript? Good question!  In an effort to put lessons together, I bought the books, read them, read them again, and gave up. JavaScript books, at least the four I’ve bulled through, are dry and hard to follow. They’re textbooks, and we all know how fun those are to read. So, in an effort to not have to write JavaScript lessons at all, I created the Java Goodies Web site at http:  www.java- goodies.com. There’s no need to look for it—it has since been combined into JavaScripts.com. Ah, it’s the way of the Web.  My purpose for starting JavaGoodies.com was to create the largest possible download source for JavaScript. I figured that instead of teaching you to make your own JavaScripts, I would supply you with as many ready-to-go scripts as I could. Well, it seemed like a smart idea at the time. JavaGoodies.com once had more than 1,000 scripts, and readers still want- ed JavaScript lessons. I should have seen it coming.  My Coauthor Andree Growney used to be the Director of Instructional Technology Support Services and Webmaster at the university where I worked and is a bit of a wizard at this JavaScript stuff. One day I asked if she would be interested in putting a book together on how to write JavaScript and posting it to the HTML Goodies Web site to test it out. To my great joy, Andree said yes. So, we got started.  We sat in her office and brainstormed until we came up with 30 JavaScript topics. Our thinking was, “If you’ve grasped these 30 lessons, you’re well on your way to writing your own scripts.” We then set to work creating scripts for each topic idea. I wrote the tutorials for my scripts; Andree wrote for hers. Then, we edited each other’s work.  I finally set it all to hypertext, and it hit the Net in August 1998, as the HTML Goodies 30- Step JavaScript Primer series at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com primers jsp .  Wow! What a response. The bulk of the e-mail from the site didn’t concern the content or the teaching method as much as the format for teaching JavaScript. E-mail after e-mail  stated, “I understand this.”  Mission accomplished.  How You Will Learn My own method of learning the JavaScript language is the method these lessons—and hopefully you—will follow. I didn’t set out to learn JavaScript following this book’s method. It just happened that way. Let me explain.  2   Introduction  Every script submitted to the Java Goodies site arrived via e-mail. Usually, the e-mail trans- mission did quite a number on it. Scripts always arrived bent, folded, and mutilated, and it was my job to put them back together so they would work again. After doing that a couple hundred times, I found I was using my reference books less and less. I could look at a script and see what the problem was. Error messages stopped sending me into a rage. Commands were becoming familiar. Formats and structure started to become friendly.  I was learning JavaScript. But I was learning it backward from the approach described in the books I had read. Everything I had seen to that point gave the commands and then built the script. So I thought, let’s go the other way. Let’s start with the script fully finished and then tear it apart. If we keep doing that over and over with new scripts, readers are bound to see patterns and common structures.  Forget trying to write from scratch right off. Let’s get the readers altering finished scripts. There’s a phenomenal sense of accomplishment if you can look at a script and alter where its output appears, or change the color of the text, or make numbers add up in different fashions.  With that sense of accomplishment comes the desire to learn more, to write a brand new script. The next thing you know, you’re writing JavaScript.  More and more research shows that teaching by lecturing doesn’t work. When you read a textbook, you are essentially being lectured. These primers are going to come at the subject from a different angle.  A professor of mine liked to say, “Tell me and I forget. Show me and I remember. Involve me and I learn.” The purpose here is to involve you.  After the go-ahead was given to turn the JavaScript Primers into a book, I knew 30 lessons wouldn’t be enough to satisfy the reader. The online users are right now screaming for the lessons to be expanded. So, I almost doubled the number of lessons. This book has 55 dif- ferent scripts that we’ll break down for your entertainment.  Furthermore, in this second edition, I’ve added 10 of the Script Tips from the HTML Goodies site. These are big, involved scripts broken down so you can understand how they work.  Each of the now 65 lessons display one JavaScript and tear it apart so you can see how it works. You see, you have to be taught why something works, not just be shown that it works. Case in point: David Copperfield doesn’t close the door on his assistant, open it, and exclaim, “Son of a gun! She’s gone again!” He knows why she disappeared. All you know is that he shut the door and she went away. You both know that the box works, but only he knows why it works. He will be in a better position to create another trick, whereas you’ll just keep closing the door, hoping it’ll work.  3   JavaScript Goodies ➤  The Format of the Lessons As I said before, this book contains 55 lessons in nine chapters. Each of those first 55 lessons follows the same format:  1. First, you get a brief concept statement regarding what the script is supposed to do  and what the example is supposed to teach you.  2. Next, you see the script in text form. 3. Then, you see the script’s effect. This book is fully supported online. I’ll tell you how  you can get all the scripts in the book into your own computer in a moment.  4. Next, we tear the script apart, looking closely at the building blocks used to create the whole. The purpose is for you to be able to read a JavaScript as you would a sentence.  5. Finally, each lesson has an assignment. You’re asked to alter the script you’ve just  worked on so that it will be a little different, or a lot different. Either way, you will be asked to create 55 new scripts from the 55 we give you.  Then, at the end of each chapter, you’ll find a review lesson. We’ll stop, quickly review the JavaScript commands you’ve learned up to that point, and then use them to create an entirely new script. This is where this book will hopefully start to come to life for you.  The Script Tips at the end of the book walk you through more scripts and further you along in your quest to understand this language.  I’ve been a college professor for a number of years now, and the hardest thing to teach stu- dents is that there comes a point where they have to look at the building blocks I’ve shown them and use those blocks to build something that is fully their own. Just mimick- ing what I show you here is not enough; you need to build something new.  Examples and Assignments This is a book. You knew that. But we want this book to have an interactive feel to it. You should be able to see the JavaScripts in action. When you finish an assignment, you should be able to see a possible answer and be able to look at the source code to see how it could be done.  In an effort to help you do that, the wonderful staff at HTML Goodies and Java Goodies— me—has put together a packet that contains all this book’s examples and assignment answers. How often do you get the answers up front? Just don’t cheat and look before you try to do the assignment yourself, okay?  You can use the examples and assignments packet in one of two ways.  4   Introduction  First, it’s all available online at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com JSBook . Please make a point  of entering the address just as you see it. Note that the “J,” “S,” and “B” are capital letters. Log on to the Internet, and use your browser to look at the pages as you need to. You’ll find an easy-to-follow chart of the examples and assignments by lesson. I also offer a  direct URL to the required page right here in the book. Keep in mind that these pages  were created for your use. Feel free to download one or all of them by clicking File and selecting Save As.  Second, you can download the entire packet of examples and assignments and install them right on to your own computer. It’s very easy to grab and install. The packet contains all 55 scripts found in the book, along with all 55 assignments. It’s available in Zip-file format. Follow these steps:  1. Log on to the Internet, and point your browser to http:  www.htmlgoodies.com   JSBook JavaScriptGoodies.zip. Again, make a point of following the capitalization pattern.  2. After you have the packet, unzip its contents into an empty folder on your hard  3. Use a browser to open the file index.html, and you’ll see links to all the examples and  drive.  assignments.  Let’s Get Started with JavaScript Be careful going through these lessons. Often, a student will want to roll through the earli- er lessons as quickly as possible. Most of the time that leads to commands being jumbled up in the mind. Your brain needs time to digest all of this. If I may make a suggestion: Don’t do more than two or three lessons a day.  Students tell me they read the entire chapter, but they can’t remember what they read. That’s because getting to the end was the goal, not getting the most out of the reading. Speed kills. Give your brain time. Here’s an example. You read all of this, right? Well, with- out looking back up the page, tell me the name of my coauthor. I’ve written it three times now.  You rolled before you crawled, before you walked, before you ran. Give your brain time to roll around the easy scripts.  Andree and I wish you the best of luck with your future JavaScripts.  5    Chapter 1  The Basics  This chapter contains the following lessons and scripts:  What Is JavaScript? Lesson 1: Writing Text to a Web Page Lesson 2: Error Messages Lesson 3: Object Properties Lesson 4: Chapter Wrap-Up and Review  The purpose of this chapter is to get you started on the right JavaScript foot. In this chapter you’ll learn how to work with JavaScript and how to create JavaScripts that print text to your HTML page, fix error messages, and tell the world what time it is.  What Is JavaScript? First off, JavaScript is not Java. It’s easy to get confused and think that Java and JavaScript are one and the same. Not so. Java is a programming language developed at Sun Microsystems. On the other hand, JavaScript is a programming language created by the good people at Netscape.   JavaScript Goodies  With Java, you create fully standalone programs that must go through a somewhat complex process of writing, compiling, and being referenced in your Web page. JavaScript, on the other hand, is simply text you type into your Web page much as you type in HTML tags and text. For JavaScript to work, the Web page it is in must be viewed with a browser that understands the JavaScript language, such as all Netscape browsers 2.0 and above. Some earlier versions of the Internet Explorer browsers have trouble with advanced JavaScript commands found in JavaScript version 1.1 and 1.2. The scripts in the book, however, stay mainly at the JavaScript 1.0 level and will run on both browsers. When writing JavaScript, remember that JavaScript is not HTML! I am often asked whether one is simply a different version of the other. Nope. The following sections outline the differences.  JavaScript Is Case Sensitive In HTML, the tag   works the same as the tag  . That’s because HTML doesn’t differen- tiate between upper- and lowercase characters. Not so in JavaScript. You must pay very close attention to the capitalization of commands. Placing an uppercase character where a lower- case one should be causes an error.  Beware of Line Breaks and Spaces HTML is very forgiving in terms of spaces and line breaks. It doesn’t matter how many spaces you leave between words or paragraphs. In fact, there’s no reason why you couldn’t write an HTML document as one long line or skip 20 lines between every word. It doesn’t matter.  The opposite is true in JavaScript. It makes a big difference where each line ends. Some- times you can break  or truncate  a line of JavaScript, but not very often. Following is a sin- gle line of JavaScript:  document.write “ This Is Red Text ”   Those commands must all stay on one line. If you change this line to look something like this  document.write “ This Is Red Text  “   the code will not work properly and will cause an error.  We’ll get into errors and fixing them in Lesson 2.  Also, an extra space between two commands, or anywhere else a space doesn’t belong, will cause an error.  8   Chapter 1 ➤ The Basics  Don’t Set Margins Whether you’re writing or editing a script, you cannot allow margins to get in the way. Always edit your work in a text editor that has no margins. I don’t mean margins set to their widest point. I mean no margins. You should be able to write off of the right side of the text screen for miles. Doing it any other way is going to cause you problems.  And now with some of the basics out of the way, let’s get right to your first JavaScript!  Lesson 1: Writing Text to a Web Page This first script is meant to introduce you to the very basics of creating and placing a JavaScript on your page. Simply type the following JavaScript into any existing HTML page of your Web site:    document.write “ This Is Red Text ”     The concept of this script is to use JavaScript to place text on a Web page, as illustrated in Figure 1.1. In this case, the text will be red.  Figure 1.1 Putting red text on your HTML page.  9   JavaScript Goodies  To see the script working on your own computer, open Lesson One’s Script Effect or point your browser to http:  www.htmlgoodies.com JSBook lesson1effect.html.  Deconstructing the Script Let’s start at the top. The first line of the script looks like this:     That’s HTML code to alert the browser that what immediately follows is going to be a JavaScript script. That seems simple enough. All JavaScripts start with this same command. We’re writing this script in JavaScript version 1.0. Because no number follows the word javascript, the browser assumes by default that the following code is in JavaScript 1.0.  At the time of the writing of this second edition, the Internet Explorer browser 5.5 was out, as was Netscape Navigator 6.0. Both understand versions of JavaScript well above 1.0 and default to the latest version the browser understands. That means you can simply write LANGUAGE=”javascript” and if the browser understands version 1.2, that will be the default. There’s no real need to add the version number, but if you find yourself going beyond this book and getting into higher versions of JavaScript, adding the number at the end of the “javascript” is not a bad habit to get into.  That said … what about that LANGUAGE=”javascript” deal? Won’t the browser simply default to the highest JavaScript version? Do you really need that anymore?  Yes, you need it. It’s because there are other types of scripts: VBScript, for example. Using that LANGUAGE attribute keeps it straight in the browser’s mind.  Because we’re dealing with only three lines of text here, allow me to jump right to the end. The flag     ends every JavaScript. No exceptions. Now, put that on a brain cell. That’s the last time those two commands will be discussed. Remember, start with <SCRIPT LANGUAGE=”javascript”> and end with  .  Now we hit the meat of the script:  document.write “ This Is Red Text ”   This script is simple enough that you can just about guess what each little bit does, but let’s go over it anyway so that we’re all speaking with the same common terms.  10   Chapter 1 ➤ The Basics  The document holds the contents of the page within the browser window, including all the HTML code and JavaScript commands. If it helps you to simply think of document as the HTML document, that’s fine.  That document will be altered by write-ing something to it. What will be written to the document is inside the parentheses.  Now we’ll cover some terms. In JavaScript, the document is what’s known as an object. The write that follows, separated by a period, is what is known as the object’s method, an action to be performed on the object. So, the script is basically saying, take the object, something that already exists, and write something to it.  The open and close parentheses are called the instance. The text inside the parentheses is called the method’s parameters. Are you with me so far?  Notice that what is inside the parentheses is encased in double quotation marks. In HTML, quotation marks are not always required. In JavaScript, they are. You must use them. And not only that, there’s an exact way of using them.  The text inside the double quotation marks is simple text: It is written to the screen exactly as shown. Note the HTML flags within the double quotes. That’s fine. The script is just going to write it all to the page.  But there are a couple of things to be concerned about when using a document.write   JavaScript command:  You should recognize the text as a FONT flag that will turn text red. Notice that single quotation marks appear around the HTML attribute code  . If you use double quotes, the JavaScript thinks it’s at the end of the line and you get only part of your text written to the object. You know you didn’t intend that double quote to mean the end of the line, but the script doesn’t. You’ll most likely get an error message telling you something is wrong. Some people get around this concern by not using any quotes around HTML attri- butes. They write the previous command this way:  . Either way works, but if you decide to write using quotes around HTML attributes, remember this: Inside double quotes … use single quotes. When writing text within double quotes, be careful not to use any words that are contractions. For example  document.write “Don’t go there!”   That line of code produces a JavaScript error. You know that the single quote doesn’t denote an attribute, but JavaScript doesn’t know that. It thinks you’ve started an attribute, and when it doesn’t find the ending single quote, an error results.  11   JavaScript Goodies  Note  If what you want is simply to have a single quote, such as in a contraction, place a back- ward slash in front of the quote mark. That slash is called an escape character. The format for the previous line of text would look like this:  document.write “Don\’t go there!”   What happens is the backslash escapes the script just long enough so the computer understands the single quote is meant to be text rather than part of the JavaScript code. Keep this concept in mind for later. I’ll discuss it in much deeper detail in Chapter 2, “Popping Up Text with Mouse Events,” when we begin popping up alert boxes. If you simply must have more right now, I have an entire tutorial on escape characters at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com beyond escapecharacter.html.  How Did the Text Become Red? So, did the JavaScript actually turn the text red? No. The HTML did that for you. What the JavaScript did was write the code to the page. There it displayed and was shown as red thanks to the FONT FACE flag and attribute. The JavaScript was simply the delivery device. Neat, huh?  One More Thing Look at this code and its result, shown in Figure 1.2:    document.write “This is the text that will be written to the page.” ; document.write “But even though these lines of text are on different lines” ; document.write “in this script, they will not reproduce the same way on the” ; document.write “HTML document.” ;    Notice how all the lines run together when written to the page even though the text is written in four lines. The reason is that the document.write statement just writes text to the page. It does not add any breaks when its lines stop.  How about that? The first lesson is over, and you’ve already got two very useful commands under your belt. Better yet, you know how to use them.  12   Chapter 1 ➤ The Basics  Figure 1.2 Multiple document.write statements run together.  Your Assignment  Each time you do an assignment, you’ll need to copy the script described in the lesson so you can paste it into an HTML document and play with it. You probably already noticed this, but you can always copy and paste the script right from the sample Web page. If you’re going online to see the examples, go to http:  www.htmlgoodies.com JSBook  lesson1example.html.  Alter the previous script so that it will produce two lines of text, one red and one blue. But you must do this by writing more JavaScript commands, not by simply adding more HTML to the instance. Make the two bits of text write to two different lines rather than simply following each other on the same line.  You’ll find one possible answer by clicking Lesson One Assignment or pointing your browser to http:  www.htmlgoodies.com JSBook assignment1.html.  Lesson 2: Error Messages You know what I’ve found missing from the myriad of JavaScript books I’ve read? They’re missing a description of how to deal with error messages. I guess the assumption is that you’ll get all your code right the first time and never see one. Welcome to reality.  If you’ve ever attempted to write or install a JavaScript on your Web pages, you know these little jewels are part of the fun. Just when you think you’ve got it right, boom, something like Figure 1.3 pops up.  13   JavaScript Goodies  Figure 1.3 A JavaScript error in ver- sion 3.x of Netscape Navigator.  This lesson is intended to tell you what to do when you encounter error messages. I’ve worked through thousands of them. Now you’re starting to write JavaScript, and you’ll get your share of them, too. But first, let’s look at the new face of error messages.  How Browsers Display the Error Messages Figure 1.3 is a view of how error messages looked in Netscape Navigator before version 4.x browsers were released. After the version 4.x browsers came out, JavaScript version 1.3 was in vogue. Version 1.3 offered something new called the JavaScript Console. It looks similar to Figure 1.4.  The benefit of the JavaScript Console is that the errors are displayed in a single package. In contrast, the JavaScript errors in Navigator 3.x and below version browsers simply piled up one on top of another, resulting in a mess. The JavaScript Console displays all the errors on a scroll, showing the first error on top and following down the errors from there.  I actually enjoyed the way the errors displayed in Navigator version 3.x and below browsers because the errors were right there as soon as they occurred. You couldn’t ignore them. The console is less intrusive, though. When you get an error in a 4.x browser, you’re alerted to the error in the browser’s status bar and asked to write “javascript:” in the Location  now Netsite  bar. That command brings up the JavaScript Console, where you see your errors.  14   Chapter 1 ➤ The Basics  Figure 1.4 JavaScript errors in the Netscape Navigator JavaScript Console.  In some ways I like the old gray JavaScript error boxes popping up and in others I like the JavaScript Console. You can make your choice. If you do not find the JavaScript Console to your liking, try changing your browser to the older, gray-box method. It’s an easy change; the instructions are on the Netscape Developer site at http:  developer.netscape.com  docs technote javascript jsconsole.html.  Note whom the author of that Netscape developer page is. It’s Michelle Wyner. She tech edited the first edition of this book! Woo hoo!  You Internet Explorer fans get your errors as is shown in Figure 1.5.  JavaScript errors in Internet Explorer either pop up or they do not, depending on how you’ve set up your system. Again, I like my error messages to pop right up. You’ll note in Figure 1.5 that the error box that pops up offers the ability to uncheck a box so that the gray dialog box won’t pop up.  If you select that option, you’ll still get a warning, but it won’t be as blatant. A small, yel- low triangle with an exclamation point will appear in the lower-left portion of the browser. Text will also proclaim that you have an error. You then click the yellow triangle and up will pop the error dialog box.  Gray box or no gray box? That is the question.  OK, now that you can actually understand your browsers and how they are trying to tell you that you have JavaScript errors, let’s move along to how you can fix those errors.  15   JavaScript Goodies  Figure 1.5 An error being displayed in Internet Explorer.  It is said that the best way to fix errors is to avoid creating them. That’s a great deal easier said than done. However, you can up your chances of getting fewer error messages by writ- ing in a text editor that does not have margins. Also, allow each line of JavaScript to remain on its own line. There’s no need to break longer lines in two. In fact, doing that will probably throw errors. That said, I’ll bet you get errors just about every time you start to play with this new language, so let’s get into how to repair them.  The Two Types of Error Messages There are basically two types of errors you can produce:  Syntax error—This means that you’ve misspelled something, or the JavaScript is not configured correctly. Runtime error—This means that you have used an incorrect command and the JavaScript doesn’t understand what you’re trying to do.  Either way, they both mean the same thing: Somewhere, something’s messed up.  Some programs do exist that will help you fix your errors—a process called debugging—but I still prefer to do it by hand. I wrote it, and I want to fix it, and it’s actually easier than you think.  16   Chapter 1 ➤ The Basics  Fixing the Errors The wonderful thing about a JavaScript error message box is that the little window that pops up tells you where and what the problem is. Look at the error message box previously shown in Figure 1.3. It’s a syntax error, meaning I have not configured the script correctly, and the error is on line 9. What’s more, the error message is pointing at the problem area. See the long line of dots and then the little caret pointing up? It’s like the browser is say- ing, “Here’s what I don’t get.”  When an error message denotes the line number in which the error occurred, you locate that line by counting down from the top of the HTML document, not the top of the JavaScript. You must also count blank lines. You might have a text editor program that offers to find a specific line for you, which is really helpful.  For instance, the following document has an error in line 9. It is a syntax error because the instance was not allowed to close on the same line on which it started. See how the last word and parenthesis were jumped to the next line?       My JavaScript Page       document.write “text for the page”               After you’ve counted down and you’re actually at the line that has an error, you need to decide what to do. More times than not, if it’s a syntax error, one of the following is true:  The line has been truncated. That means it has been chopped off early, such as in the previous example. Something is misspelled. You have used a double quotation mark where a single quotation mark should be. That’s called using unbalanced quotes. You’re missing a parenthesis.  17   JavaScript Goodies  If the error is runtime, the error message is pointing at a command that doesn’t logically follow in the sequence. For instance, you might have used the code document.wrote instead of document.write.  Dealing with Multiple Errors Nothing gives me heartburn faster than running a script and getting multiple errors. I used to think multiple boxes meant there were actually that many errors. But it’s not always so.  JavaScript is an extremely logical language that likes to work in a linear fashion. Let’s say you have 10 errors throughout a long script. When the error messages pile up, don’t go after that last error first. It probably doesn’t exist.  You see … the first error in the script might very well be creating all the other errors. If you forgot to put a command in the third line of code, every subsequent line that needs that command to work will claim it has an error. So, fix the errors in sequence from bottom to top. I have found many times that a script threw 20 errors, but fixing only the first error solved all the subsequent errors.  The “Something’s Not Defined” Error You’ll see this written on a few JavaScript error boxes before too long. This is a runtime error that means something in the script doesn’t jibe quite right. The text that is throwing the error has come out of the clear blue sky—to the computer anyway. When I get a “not defined” error, I always make sure the text wasn’t created by a longer line being truncated. If that’s not the case, I try erasing the problem line. It can always be put back at another time. Typos do occur, so see whether this isn’t one of those typos. It happens more times than you would believe.  There’s not much more that can be said about error messages at this point. You now have enough knowledge to fix 99% of the problems that pop up. Just remember that getting error messages is actually a plus. If you didn’t get them, all you would have is a blank page with no suggestion about what the problem might be.  Error messages are quite helpful if you think about them in the right light.  Your Assignment  Go to your packet download and click the link that reads Lesson Two Assignment. You can also go right to it online at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com JSBook assignment2.html.  When you click the link on that page, the script throws an error or two. You Netscape Navigator users might have to write “javascript:” into the Location bar to pop up the JavaScript Console and grab the error.  18   Chapter 1 ➤ The Basics  Your assignment is to fix the errors so that the script runs. Now, you probably won’t recog- nize some of the commands in this script, but that doesn’t matter. The error boxes that appear will give you enough information to make this script run.  HINT!!! You might get only one error when you first run it. The second error might come after you fix the first.  If the JavaScript runs correctly, the current date will display on the page.  After you get the script to run, or give up trying, you can look at the corrected script by going to http:  www.htmlgoodies.com JSBook assignment2_answer.html.  You’ll find a short explanation of what had to be fixed right on the page.  Lesson 3: Object Properties You should be starting to get an understanding of the hierarchy of JavaScript. In fact, hier- archy is quite important in this language, so much so that I devote an entire lesson, Lesson 13, to it.  You know there are objects, such as document, and methods, such as write. You know that methods act upon objects. And you know how to write the document and method format in JavaScript:  document.write “This writes to the page”;   In this lesson, you’re introduced to a new part of the JavaScript hierarchy: object proper- ties. A property is like a subsection of an object. It holds specific characteristics about the object. The object you’re already familiar with—document—has a few properties, such as its background color, text color, and location. The four scripts in the next section each cover one of the following objects and a great many of their properties:  document navigator—This object represents the browser. history—This object represents the list the browser keeps of all the pages the user vis- ited during the current online session. location—This represents the current URL of the page that is being displayed.  Figure 1.6 shows the results of running the four scripts we’ll examine.  19   JavaScript Goodies  Figure 1.6 The property scripts.  You can see the effects of all the scripts by going to http:  www.htmlgoodies.com JSBook  lesson3effect.html.  The Property Scripts There are actually four scripts in the following—but they all follow the same format: an object.property statement placed into a document.write   statement to be written to the page.  Writing document Object Properties    document.write “The background color of this page is  ” ➥+document.bgColor+ “ .”  document.write “ The foreground  or text  color ➥ of this page is  ” +document.fgColor+ “ .”  document.write “ The link color of this page is  ” ➥ +document.linkColor+ “ .”  document.write “ The active link color of this page is  ” ➥ +document.alinkColor+ “ .”  document.write “ The visited link color of this page is  ” ➥ +document.vlinkColor+ “ .”  document.write “ The URL of this page is  ” ➥ +document.location+ “ .”   20   Chapter 1 ➤ The Basics  document.write “ The page you were at before this page was  ” ➥ +document.referrer+ “ .”  document.write “ Here’s what’s written in the TITLE ➥ of this page is  ” +document.title+ “ .”  document.write “ The document was last modified:  ” ➥ +document.lastModified+ “ .”      Writing navigator Object Properties    document.write “You are using  ” +navigator.appName+ “.  ”  document.write “It is version “ +navigator.appVersion+ “. ”  document.write “Its code name is “ +navigator.appCodeName+ “. ”  document.write “It sends the header “ +navigator.userAgent+ “.”  ;    Writing history Object Properties    document.write “You have visited “ +history.length+ “ ➥ pages before this one.”     Writing location Object Properties    document.write “The name of this location is  ” ➥ + location.host + “ .”        document.write “The name of this location is  ” ➥ + location.hostname + “ .”       Deconstructing the Scripts Please notice that the format of calling a property is the same as attaching an object and a method. You write the object name, a dot, and then the property. The biggest difference in the appearance is there are no parentheses after the property. A method affects an object; a property already exists. You just want that property and nothing else, so there is no need  21   JavaScript Goodies  for the parentheses instance. Plus, later in the book, you see that those parentheses are used to pass data around. The property already exists and thus has nothing that can be passed to it. Therefore, there’s no need for the parentheses.  What Do Those Plus Signs Do? Ah, you noticed that! You’re very observant. Here’s the first line of code from the first script:  document.write “The background color of this page is  ” ➥ +document.bgColor+ “ .”   See the plus signs on either side of the code document.bgColor? Those plus signs are central to getting the results of the script.  You already know that whatever is within double quotation marks is written to the page. This is a document.write statement, after all.  Those plus signs are used in JavaScript to set aside the object.property code as something that should be returned. You don’t want the text document.bgColor to appear on the page; you want the property that line of text represents. In this case, it’s the document’s back- ground color.  By enclosing the document.bgColor statement in plus signs, connect what is returned as part of the entire line. It puts the three elements together on one line. The plus signs are used to concatenate the three elements.  Notice that document.bgColor is not surrounded by quotes, so it will not print as text. The value it represents, what is returned from the browser, will print. By using the plus signs, the first run of text, the return, and the last bit of text all run together on one line. The plus sign adds the three pieces together. Get it?  Hey! The Text Is Bold in Some Places! Yes. That’s another extra little trick thrown in for fun. Look at the code for any of the items that appear in bold. All I did was add the   and   statements on either side of the object.property code—inside the double quotation marks. Because this is a document.write statement, the bold commands are written to the page and then act upon the property that was returned. I wanted you to see that you could also affect what is returned from the script, rather than just the text you write within the document.write statement.  Just make sure the HTML commands are inside the double quotation marks so they are seen as text rather than part of the script commands. If you don’t, you’ll get an error.  Now let’s find out what all these properties mean.  22   Chapter 1 ➤ The Basics  Properties of the document Object The HTML document object properties are very popular in JavaScript. The script displays nine.  Pay close attention to the capitalization pattern of each property. Every time you write these properties, you must use that pattern. Why? Because that’s the way JavaScript likes it:  bgColor—Returns the background color in hexadecimal code. fgColor—Returns the foreground color in hexadecimal code. linkColor—Returns the link color in hexadecimal code. alinkColor—Returns the active link color in hexadecimal code. vlinkColor—Returns the visited link color in hexadecimal code. location—Returns the URL, or Web address, of the page. If you are not online, mean- ing no server is involved, this property returns the filename. referrer—Returns the page the user came from before the current page. If no page is available, this property returns a blank space. The one drawback to this command is that for a page to be recognized as a referring page, a click must have been made to get to the page containing the document.referrer code. If the page containing the document.referrer code was not arrived at by clicking, the property is returned as blank space. There are a few of these fun little bugs throughout JavaScript. title—Returns the text between the HTML document’s TITLE commands. lastModified—Returns the date the page was last modified. The return is actually the date the page was uploaded to the server, or last saved on hard disk.  These document properties are not shown in the script:  cookie—Returns the user’s cookie text file anchors—Returns the number of HREF anchors on the page forms—Returns an array  listing  of the form items on a page links—Returns a number for each individual link  Properties of the navigator Object People love these properties. The HTML Goodies e-mail box always gets questions about how to display browser characteristics. This is it. The object is navigator. After all, Netscape came up with JavaScript, so why not use its own browser’s name to denote the browser object, right? Four properties are available. Once again, be careful of your capitalization:  appName—Returns the name of the browser, such as Netscape or Microsoft Internet Explorer. appVersion—Returns the version number of the browser and the platform for which it is created.  23   JavaScript Goodies  appCodeName—Returns the code name given to the browser. Netscape calls its browser Mozilla; Microsoft calls its browser Internet Explorer. userAgent—Returns the hypertext transfer protocol  HTTP  header used by the brows- er when working with servers so the server knows what it is dealing with. Web pages use HTTP protocol, so you write that at the beginning of each Web page address.  Knowing all this information about the browser is important. Later, we’ll get into IF state- ments. Knowing the user’s browser and version numbers allows you to say IF the browser is this, do this.  Properties of the history Object This is a very popular object. Many readers want to be able to make links that take people back one or more pages, or forward one or more pages with one click. The purpose is to re- create the Back and Forward buttons at the top of the browser window.  Properties of the location Object Location is JavaScript for URL, or the address of the page. The location object has eight properties, and you’ll meet a few more later. However, these two properties are by far the most popular: host and hostname. The properties are equal in that they both do the same thing—return the URL in either IP number or text format depending on what format the server is using:  location.host—Returns the URL plus the port the user is attached to location.hostname—Returns only the URL  If you are getting the same result with both commands, that means your server has not routed you to a specific port. In technical terms, the port property is “null”.  By the way, these two commands will not work if you are running the page from your hard drive. You must be running this from a server for there to be an address for the script to return.  Your Assignment Okay, smart person—do this: Using one of the previous object.property statements, write a JavaScript that creates a link to a page on your server on the HTML document. An exam- ple is if you’re on www.you.com, the JavaScript would create a link to the page www.you.com  joe.html.  24   Chapter 1 ➤ The Basics  You can see a possible answer on your computer by opening Lesson Three Assignment in the download packet. But do yourself a favor. See it online at http:   www.htmlgoodies.com  JSBook assignment3.html. The answer requires that the page be on a server to get the effect—that should be a pretty good hint right there.  Lesson 4: Chapter Wrap-Up and Review We’ve reached the end of Chapter 1. The concept of this lesson is to stop, review the JavaScript commands you’ve learned to this point, and build something new.  The chapters are progressively longer, and you’ll be presented with this type of lesson at the end of each. Through years of teaching, Andree and I have learned that one of the hardest things for a student to do is to take what he or she has learned and apply it toward something outside the realm of the class. In short—make something new. We’re going to try to force you to think past just what we’re showing you in this book.  Table 1.1 shows the JavaScript commands you’ve seen up to now.  Table 1.1 Object document  history location navigator  JavaScript Commands Demonstrated in Chapter 1  Methods write    Properties alinkColor, bgColor, fgColor, linkColor, lastModified, location, referrer, title, vlinkColor length host, hostname appCodeName, appName, appVersion, userAgent  You know what each of these commands does. Now let’s use the commands to create something functional that’s different from what you have seen so far. Enter the following JavaScript:    document.write “Go   ➥back  one page.”     Figure 1.7 shows the script’s effect.  25   JavaScript Goodies  Figure 1.7 The script creates a link to the previous Web page.  To see the script’s effect on your own computer, open Lesson Four’s Script Effect in the down- load packet or see it online at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com JSBook lesson4effect. html.  Notice that this script uses the document.referrer object property. It’s best to see that online. The previous page address provides a link to click to get to the page with the  document.referrer code, so you’ll see the code’s effect correctly.  Deconstructing the Script The purpose of the script is to create a link back one page. Here’s the line of code that does the trick:  document.write “Go   ➥back  one page.”   It’s a basic document.write   formula that posts the code of a hypertext link to the page. Note there are no spaces before or next to the double quotation marks. That means the text returned from the document.referrer command will butt right up against the hyper- text link text.  The movement back one page through the user’s history list is created by returning the document’s referrer property to the browser to act as a hypertext link. It’s simple, and it’s useful.  26   Chapter 1 ➤ The Basics  Your Assignment Your final assignment in this chapter is to create something new and useful.  Take a moment and look back over the commands you’ve learned. What can you do with them? Remember that functionality does not always mean there has to be a flashy effect. You could use the commands to simply communicate with the user.  Here are a couple of suggestions:  Create a page containing Internet Explorer–only commands and another containing Netscape Navigator–only commands. You could have the page read: You’re using a ***** browser. Please click the ***** link below to go to a page made just for you. The ***** would be filled in using some of the commands we’ve discussed. Use the commands to talk to the viewer about the page. The text could read Thank you for coming in from **** to *****. I see you’re using the ***** browser. Good choice.  The code for both these examples is available for you to look at. Click Lesson Four Assignment on your download packet, or see it online at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com  JSBook assignment4.html.  I got the second suggested effect by using multiple document.write codes. Think about how you would get the effect, and then go to the assignment page to see how I did it.  27    Chapter 2  Popping Up Text with Mouse Events  This chapter contains the following lessons and scripts:  Lesson 5: JavaScript’s onMouseOver Event Handler Lesson 6: More Event Handlers Lesson 7: onUnload and onMouseOut, the After-Effect Commands Lesson 8: HTML 4.0, the   Flag, and Some New Event Handlers Lesson 9: Let’s Go! Lesson 10: The Second End-of-Chapter Review Using Escape Characters  Lesson 5: JavaScript’s onMouseOver Event Handler We’ve discussed objects, methods, and properties. Now let’s start playing with events. Think of events as things that happen. They add life and interest to your Web site; they’re things that make your viewers say, “Ooooooo,” without your having to create large JavaScripts. Event handlers are the commands that detect the user’s input and trigger an event.  Now allow me to throw a curve into the process. Events, created using event handlers, are JavaScript, but unlike what you’ve seen so far, they are “built in” to HTML code rather than standing alone. Event handlers are meant to be embedded, so they don’t require the   and   flags. They themselves are not scripts but are small interfaces allow- ing for interaction between your page and your reader.   JavaScript Goodies  Several events exist, and we’ll get to them, but let’s start with one of the most popular ones: onMouseOver. Consider the following JavaScript:  <A HREF=”http:  www.htmlgoodies.com” ➥onMouseOver=”window.status=’Go to the Goodies Home Page’; ➥ return true”>Click Here   The purpose of this script is to show text in the status bar, as shown in Figure 2.1, when your user rolls her mouse over the hypertext link.  Figure 2.1 The onMouseOver event in the script makes text appear in the status bar.  To see the script working on your computer, click Lesson Five Script Effect One in your down- load packet or see it online at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com JSBook lesson5effect1. html.  Deconstructing the Script Knowing what you already know, this one just about explains itself. So let’s look at it quickly and then start to play around with it.  First, onMouseOver  notice the capitalization pattern  is an event handler. In this case it is triggering when an event occurs in conjunction with the hypertext link. Does that make sense? We’re using it inside the hypertext link.  The HTML format for the hypertext link remains the same. You use the same commands and the same double quotation marks. The event handler is stuck in right after the URL  30   Chapter 2 ➤ Popping Up Text with Mouse Events  address, as you can see in the code. Now, just to be fair, the event handler doesn’t have to be after the URL. It could go before, right after the A, but I like it sitting after the URL. It seems to be written in order when it’s sitting after the URL. But, if you want it just after the A, go for it. To each their own.  The event is called for by writing onMouseOver= and then telling the browser to do some- thing when the mouse actually does pass over. In this case, it’s “window.status=’Go to the Goodies Home Page’.  The pattern should look somewhat familiar now: two items separated by a period. The  window is an object. It exists. status is a property of window and is the smaller section of the window where status messages go. You might be familiar with the traditional Document Done text that always appears in the status bar when an HTML page is finished loading. The window.status statement tells the browser where the following text should appear, which in this case is in the status bar.  Note  Is it getting confusing remembering which are properties and which are methods? I try to keep them straight by thinking that a method will usually be in the form of a verb, such as write or go. A property is a noun that exists as a smaller part of the item before the dot.  In the script, window.status is also followed by an equal sign  =  telling the browser that what follows is supposed to happen when the mouse actually does pass over. In this case, what follows is text in single quotation marks:  window.status=’Go to the Goodies Home Page’;  That text will show up in the status bar when the user rolls her mouse over the hypertext link.  Oh, Those Double and Single Quotation Marks Match them up. When you use double quotation marks at the start of something, use dou- ble quotation marks at the end. If you use single quotation marks, use single quotation marks at the end.  The best method to keep the quotation marks straight in your own mind is to think that there is a hierarchy to them. I keep it straight by thinking that double quotation marks always go on the outside. Single quotation marks sit inside double quotation marks. If there’s something inside single quotation marks, such as an HTML attribute, I don’t give it quotation marks. Here’s an example:  OnClick=”location.href=’page.html’”  31   JavaScript Goodies  See how the double quotation marks surround the single quotation marks? If you follow that hierarchy thinking, you’re more likely to be sure the quotation marks line up single with single and double with double.  But that is simply a suggestion. As long as you make the quotation marks equal, you’re good to go.  That said, make a point of keeping an eye on the quotation marks pattern in each of your scripts. They are, quote, important.  Get it? “Quote” important? Ha! I kill me.  The Semicolon In JavaScript, the semicolon acts as a statement terminator—it basically says this code statement is done.  In this script, the semicolon is used because the effect we wanted to achieve through the event handler is finished:  onMouseOver=”window.status=’Go to the Goodies Home Page’; ➥ return true”>Click Here   Now let’s do something new.  So why not write the code to a new line? You did just fine without a semicolon in Chapter 1, “The Basics,” when you wrote document.write statements. Well, that was a different story; each of those document.write statements sat on its own line and had only one func- tion. This is different. Now there are two code statements: First there’s onMouseOver and then that return true statement.  That’s why this code is all on the same line separated by a semicolon. The JavaScript knows the two items are related, and now it also understands where one stops and the other begins, thanks to the semicolon.  It should be said here that even though that semicolon is not necessary, it is good practice to use one every time you end a line of code. It will help you quickly see where the lines end and help you be a better JavaScript author. Really. I wouldn’t lie to you.  Now, what about that return true code?  return true Those extra two words have quite a bearing on what happens when the mouse rolls over the link. If the words are present, the return true statement allows the script to overwrite whatever’s there. Notice in the example that when the user rolls her mouse over the link,  32   Chapter 2 ➤ Popping Up Text with Mouse Events  the text in the status bar is locked in. It doesn’t change if she rolls over the link again and again. If you try this example yourself and refresh the page, you’ll be able to see the effect a little better.  But what if you lose those two words? Well, let’s think it out. If you do not have permis- sion to overwrite what’s in the status bar, then you can’t overwrite what is in the status bar. When the mouse moves away from the link, the event will occur only once.  If you remember your HTML, the default is to display the URL to which the link is point- ing. Then, after the mouse is off the link, the onMouseOver event takes place. The event occurs every time the mouse passes over the link. It’s actually a better effect, in my  opinion.  To see what the effect would look like losing the return true code, click Lesson Five Script Effect Two in your download packet or see it online at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com  JSBook lesson5effect2.html.  Other Properties, Other Uses You know other objects must have properties, too. How about a page’s background color? In HTML code, the attribute to change the background color is BGCOLOR. It’s the same here, except now we’re concerned again with capitalization. In JavaScript, it’s written bgColor  capital C . So, let’s think through creating a link that would change the window’s back- ground color using an onMouseOver event:  First off, this will be a link, so it’s a pretty good bet that the format is the same as the format in the earlier script. So, you should keep it. Are you changing the window, or are you changing your old standby, the document? Well, where does the BGCOLOR command go when you write a Web page? It’ll be in the document, so that must be the object you’re concerned with. Therefore, change window in the earlier code to document. You want to change the document object’s background, so change status to bgColor. You no longer want text to appear, so change that text to a color. Let’s use pink for this example. When the mouse moves over the link you probably want the color to stay whether the mouse runs over the links again or not, so you’ll need to reenter the return true after the semicolon.  Here’s the resulting JavaScript:  <A HREF=”http:  www.htmlgoodies.com” ➥onMouseOver=”document.bgColor=’pink’; return true”>Click Here   33   JavaScript Goodies  To see the background color effect, click Lesson Five Script Effect Three in your download packet or see it online at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com JSBook lesson5effect3.html.  But what if you want both effects—the background color change and the text in the status bar? Okay, let’s think it through: Common sense would suggest you write two onMouseOver commands. Let’s try that.  The two commands are not separate from each other. You want them to occur at the same time, so you can’t separate them using a semicolon because you know a semicolon is a statement terminator. Here’s a new rule: Use a comma when setting multiple JavaScript events.  And what about all those pesky quotation marks? Remember that the double quotation marks go around the entire event handler statement, and single quotation marks go around the effects, such as text to be printed or in the color to be used:  You want these two onMouseOver commands to happen as one, so you need double quotation marks only at the very beginning of the first event handler statement and at the very end of the second one. That way, the quotation marks surround it all, showing it to the browser as if it were one event. The single quotation marks surround the color and the text.  Here’s the resulting JavaScript:  <A HREF=”http:  www.htmlgoodies.com” onMouseOver=”document.bgColor=’pink’, ➥onMouseOver=window.status=’Go to the Goodies Home Page’; ➥return true”>Click Here   You can see this double effect by clicking Lesson Five Script Effect Four in your download packet, or see it online at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com JSBook lesson5effect4.html.  These event handlers are great, and there are a slew of them. The next lesson discusses a whole handful.  Note You might have noticed that the lessons are starting to “think things through” a bit. Remember that the JavaScript language is very logical. Later in this book is a lesson just on the hierarchy of items because the language is so logical. Just for now, though, try taking a few minutes before you write and thinking out what must happen for your idea to come to life in script.  34   Chapter 2 ➤ Popping Up Text with Mouse Events  Your Assignment Let’s see whether I can’t trip you up on this one. I’m going to give you a new method for this assignment: alert  . What it does is pop up a small dialog box with text written above an OK button. See whether you can get the alert box to pop up when your mouse rolls across a hypertext link. Here’s the format:  alert ‘text that appears on the alert box’   Think it through: What must happen first, second, and so on? It’s actually quite simple  not that that’s a hint or anything .

Lesson 6: More Event Handlers Well, now you’ve got the basic hang of event handlers. So let’s look at another lesson and see a few more in action. Event handlers all work basically the same way. As long as you know the format of the event, and then think through the logic of getting it to run, you’ll be able to place these all over your pages.  The onClick Command Think about onMouseOver. You already know onMouseOver causes an event when the mouse is passed over a link. It can be used other places, too, but to this point you’ve only seen it used in a link. If passing over the link causes the event, clicking the link should be just as successful when you use the onClick event handler. That seems logical, yes?  I’ll use the alert   method to show this one off. If you did the assignment from the last lesson, you know how it is used. But just for memory’s sake, the alert   format goes like this:  alert ‘Text that appears on the alert box’   So, following the same pattern as the onMouseOver, you get this JavaScript:  <A HREF=”http:  www.htmlgoodies.com” ➥onClick=”alert ‘You are off!’ ;”>Click Here   The result appears in Figure 2.2.  35   JavaScript Goodies  Figure 2.2 Using onClick to display an alert box.  See the effect on your computer by clicking Lesson Six Script’s Effect in your download pack- et, or see it online at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com JSBook lesson6effect.html.  The onFocus Event Handler This is a great event handler that enables you to create action when your reader uses the mouse, tabs, or arrow keys to focus on one item on the page. This works for FORM object drop-down boxes, text boxes, and text area boxes.  Here’s an example using a text box:    <INPUT TYPE=”text” SIZE=”30” ➥onFocus=”window.status=’Write your name in the box’;”>    Figure 2.3 shows the result of this JavaScript; as you can see, I followed the directions onscreen and entered my name.  36   Chapter 2 ➤ Popping Up Text with Mouse Events  Figure 2.3 When the text box has focus, the status bar text appears.  Tip  Never make an alert box the event of an onFocus event handler. Here’s why: Let’s say you had the onFocus set up on a text box, just the same way I do in the preceding code. You click the text box and the alert pops up. That causes focus to be lost from the text box. When you close the alert box, focus returns to the text box and the alert pops back up. It’s a pretty nasty loop to get caught in.

The onBlur Event Handler If you can focus on an item, you can blur, or lose focus, on an item. The onBlur event han- dler allows you to take focus off an item.  You can pretty much guess at the code, but here it is anyway:    <INPUT TYPE=”text” SIZE=”40” onBlur=”alert You changed your answer - ➥ Is it still correct?’ ;”>    The resulting effect appears in Figure 2.4.  37   JavaScript Goodies  Figure 2.4 This alert box appears after clicking off the text box.  See the effect on your computer by clicking Lesson Six Script’s Effect Three in your download packet, or see it online at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com JSBook lesson6effect3.html.  The onChange Event Handler Its main function is to work as a check mechanism. If something changes, this event han- dler is enabled. Think of this as an event that ensures the user fills in what you are asking for:    <INPUT TYPE=”text” SIZE=”40” ➥onChange=”alert ‘The text box has been changed’ ”>    The result of this JavaScript appears in Figure 2.5.

The onSubmit Command This is the command everyone seems to want to lay his hands on. This command enables you to make the page change when the Submit button is clicked. People want this because they seem to require that wonderful effect when the user clicks a form’s Submit button, and the page changes to another page that says Thanks for writing!  Here’s the format:         This event handler is difficult to show you as a figure, so see the effect on your computer by clicking Lesson Six Script’s Effect Five in your download packet. Or see it online at http:   www.htmlgoodies.com JSBook lesson6effect5.html.  location.href You’ve probably noticed a few new commands in the previous script that respond to the Submit button, so let’s look at one. location.href is the basic format for setting up a link to another page. The href property might be new to you, but if you’ve programmed in HTML at all, you can guess what it means. HREF stands for Hypertext REFerence, and it cre- ates a link to another page. I use this format a great deal.  39   JavaScript Goodies  Just make a point of remembering the single and double quotation mark configuration. Double quotation marks surround location through the end of the command. The page the link sends the user to is surrounded in single quotation marks.  Remember, you have to surround the page location in quotation marks, but double quota- tion marks suggest to the browser that the command is over. So, use single quotation marks instead.  The onLoad Event Handler The onLoad event handler is a great, and extremely useful, command. Unlike the other event handlers examined, onLoad sits within the HTML document’s BODY flag. It’s enacted when the page finishes loading into the browser window. The following example pops up a simple alert box to welcome the user to the page:     Later in the book, you’ll use the onLoad command to trigger larger scripts to start working. It will become a real tool in your JavaScript toolbox.  Figure 2.6 shows the result of the onLoad JavaScript.  Figure 2.6 An alert box pops up when the page loads.  40   Chapter 2 ➤ Popping Up Text with Mouse Events  See the effect on your computer by clicking Lesson Six Script’s Effect Six in your download packet, or see it online at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com JSBook lesson6effect6.html.  Your Assignment For this assignment, I want you to create a form that has some interaction with the user. I’m assuming you know how to create forms here. If forms are a bit foreign to you, see this HTML Goodies tutorial: http:  www.htmlgoodies.com tutors forms.html.  The form should have four elements: a text box that asks for the person’s name, two check boxes that ask whether the person prefers chocolate or vanilla, and a Submit button. Now, here’s what I want to happen with each item:  The text box should print Put your name in here in the status bar when the user fills it in. The two check boxes should write You have chosen --- in the status bar, indicating the user’s choice. The Submit button should pop up an alert box thanking the user for filling out the form.

Lesson 7: onUnload and onMouseOut, the After-Effect Commands Two after-effect event handler commands you should have in your arsenal are onMouseOut and onUnload. Again, watch the capitalization pattern.  You already know that the onMouseOver command makes things happen when the mouse passes over something on the HTML page. The onMouseOut command acts after the mouse leaves the link. You also know the onLoad command makes something happen when the HTML page fully loads. Well, the onUnload command makes something happen when the user unloads or leaves the page.  Both are quite useful, but try to keep the events that occur from your onUnload short. You don’t want to slow the loading of the incoming page.  This script uses the onUnload event handler:     41   JavaScript Goodies  This script uses the onMouseOut event handler:  <A HREF=”thanksalot.html” ➥onMouseOver=”window.status=’Hey! Get off of me!’; return true ➥”onMouseOut=”window.status=’Much better - Thanks’; return true”> ➥Place your mouse on and off of this   The examples, shown in Figures 2.7a and 2.7b, actually use both scripts. In Figure 2.7a, a link on the HTML page produces text in the status bar both when the mouse passes over it and when the mouse leaves, thanks to the onMouseOver and onMouseOut event handlers. In Figure 2.7b, when you actually click the link, the onUnload event handler pops up the alert window with the text Leaving so soon?  Figure 2.7a onMouseOut text appears in the status bar when the mouse leaves the link.  See the effect on your computer by clicking Lesson Seven’s Script Effect in your download packet, or see it online at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com JSBook lesson7effect.html.  Deconstructing the Script There’s not a lot to tell that you probably haven’t figured out for yourself at this point. The mouse-over effects are created by the onMouseOver and onMouseOut commands.  Please notice that unlike the simultaneous onMouseOver and bgColor effects from Lesson 5, the two commands here are quite separate from each other. You do not want these occur- ring at the same time.  42   Chapter 2 ➤ Popping Up Text with Mouse Events  Figure 2.7b An alert box is produced when the link is clicked.  You want one thing to happen when the mouse passes over the link and another to hap- pen when the mouse moves off. So you write them as two totally separate commands, each containing its own return true statements, forcing the text to remain after the fact.  The effect when you’re leaving the page is created by adding the onUnload=”alert ‘Leaving so soon?’ ” command to the BODY flag of the HTML document.  Again, please notice the placements of the double and single quotation marks. You can’t use the double quotation marks surrounding the text because that would mean double quotation marks inside of double quotation marks. The browser would see it as the end of a line, and not understand what follows—resulting in an error.  You’ll get a lot of use out of these event handlers.  Your Assignment You’re going to use an onUnload, onMouseOver, and onMouseOut in this assignment. Here’s what I want to happen:  Create a page with a hypertext link. The link should place the text Hello browser name user - Click here! in the status bar when the mouse passes over. The text You should leave page URL right away should then appear when the mouse moves off the link.  43   JavaScript Goodies  When the link is actually clicked, an alert should pop up that reads Leaving so soon? Do not use an onClick command to get the alert box; use the onUnload command.  Think about it for a minute. You’ve been able to get document.property returns to appear on the page. Now, how do you get them to appear in the status bar? You must combine the two formats you have learned so far in this chapter with what you learned in Chapter 1. You can do it.  Tip  The problem you’ll run into involves the double and single quotation marks. Remember that in a document.write command, the double quotation marks mean text to be printed to the page. Well, now you have double quotation marks around the entire text for the window.status command, so those double quotation marks around the text are out the window. Use single quotation marks instead.  But in case you don’t hit it on the first try, read the error messages. They’ll tell you where the problem is.

Lesson 8: HTML 4.0, the   Flag, and Some  New Event Handlers In late 1998, the World Wide Web Consortium  http:  www.w3c.org  gave its thumbs-up to a new version of HTML, HTML 4.0. With the new version came new HTML flags, and with the new HTML flags came new JavaScript event handlers. As of the writing of this second edition, June 2001, a few of the new event handlers could be run using Internet Explorer 4.0, but Netscape Navigator couldn’t run any of them. But time marches on, and soon these new event handlers will be in widespread use.  This lesson’s example script shows three of those new event handlers in action. You’ll also be introduced to a new HTML 4.0 delivery device flag,  .  The   Flag First, let’s look at the template for the sample script. It looks like this:   Text on HTML Page   44   Chapter 2 ➤ Popping Up Text with Mouse Events  If you haven’t seen the   HTML flag before, be prepared to become very familiar with it. As HTML 4.0 comes more and more into the mainstream, this flag will become the dar- ling of Web artists everywhere.  “What does it do,” you ask? Nothing. Not a darn thing. The   flag has no properties at all to affect or manipulate text or images in any way. In fact, if you take a piece of text and surround it with the   and   flags, you won’t alter the text at all. The view- er wouldn’t know it is there unless he looked at the source code.  But there has to be a reason this book is devoting page space to the   flag. There is and with good reason.    is a delivery device. The flag itself has no effect. But that’s the point.  ’s whole purpose is to act as a platform to carry other HTML attributes and JavaScript commands to text, images, tables, or whatever else you can think of to surround with   and  .  Look at the format again:   Text on HTML Page   The text that is surrounded by the   flags can include any event handler you’ve seen to this point. Once inside the   flag, the event handler is enacted when the user inter- acts with the text in some way.  Here’s an example before we get into the specifics of this lesson’s script. Let’s say you want to create a piece of text that acts as a hypertext link but doesn’t carry the blue coloring or the underline. You want it to look like any other text. Believe it or not, this is actually a fairly popular request. HTML Goodies receives a fair amount of mail asking how it’s done.  Think it out. The link will occur when the text is clicked. That would suggest you use the onClick event handler. Then you must set it so that when the user clicks, the page changes. You already know location.href as the code that creates a link. So let’s build it.  The format would look like this:   Click to Go   Now you have text that retains its color but carries with it the properties of a link, thanks  to JavaScript. You can try the previous link by clicking Lesson Eight Script’s Effect Two in  your download packet, or see it online at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com JSBook   lesson8effect2.html. Remember that this works only in Internet Explorer 4.0 or better.  45   JavaScript Goodies  The Sample Script Now, let’s look at this lesson’s sample script:  <SPAN onMouseDown=”window.status=’Mouse Is Down’”; onMouseUp=”window.status=’Mouse Is Up’”; ➥onDblClick=”location.href=’thanksalot.html’”;> Click on this text    The script’s effect is shown in Figure 2.8. See the effect on your computer by clicking Lesson Eight’s Script Effect in your download packet, or see it online at http:  www.htmlgoodies. com JSBook lesson8effect.html.  Figure 2.8 Multiple event handlers are applied to this window.  Make a point of looking at the example in an Internet Explorer browser, version 4.0 or higher. Those browsers support the HTML flags and JavaScript commands. By the time you’re reading this, other browsers might support the code, too, but at the time of writing, Internet Explorer 4.0  and above  was the only available browser to display this script properly.  Deconstructing the Script The script starts with the   flag. Three new JavaScript event handlers are inside the flag.  46   Chapter 2 ➤ Popping Up Text with Mouse Events  The first event handler, onMouseDown, is enacted when the user has her pointer on the text and clicks down. Notice the event handler is set up to place text in the status bar.  Although the semicolon is not necessary, I still use it to help me quickly see where each piece of code ends. It’s my preference—you don’t have to have it in your code.  The second event handler, onMouseUp, posts text to the status bar when the user lets the mouse click back up.  The third event handler, onDblClick, is put into use when the user double-clicks the link. In this script, the double-click sends the user to a new page named thanksalot.html.  The text that will appear on the HTML document page is then written after the   flag.  Finally, the   flag ends the entire format.  The New Event Handlers You’ve seen three of them in this lesson’s script, onMouseDown, onMouseUp, and onDblClick. Note the capitalization pattern of each.  Now that I’ve whet your appetite, here are a few other new event handlers and what they do:  onKeyDown—Reacts when the user presses a key onKeyUp—Reacts when the user lets the key back up onKeyPress—Reacts when the user clicks a key up and down onMouseMove—Reacts when the user moves the mouse  Just remember that the event handlers in this lesson are not supported across the board yet, so use them sparingly, if at all. If you do use them, test them in a few different browsers on your own computer before posting the pages to the Web. If you can’t run the command, your users probably can’t either.  Your Assignment Use the   flag and a couple of event handlers on the text Green to Red so that when the mouse passes over it, the background turns green and when the mouse leaves the text, the background turns red. You’ll get bonus points if you can get the page to change to pur- ple when the user double-clicks.  HINT: Use Internet Explorer 4.0 or better to view your work.

So far, this chapter has dealt with user interaction through JavaScript event handlers. This particular lesson deals with a new method, go  . Although including a method with a group of event handlers seems a bit odd, it isn’t. The go   method often acts along with event handlers to move your user through his history object.  This lesson’s JavaScript is as follows:           This is a very popular use of the go   method. The code produces two buttons that act the same way as the Back and Forward buttons at the top of your browser window. Figure 2.9 shows these buttons in a browser.  Figure 2.9 Buttons that move users through their history objects.  See the effect on your computer by clicking Lesson Nine’s Script Effect in your download packet, or see it online at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com JSBook lesson9effect.html.  48   Chapter 2 ➤ Popping Up Text with Mouse Events  Deconstructing the Script The code for the two buttons is both HTML and JavaScript. The buttons are both FORM items created using this HTML code:           Using this format alone, the buttons will display, but they’re little more than nice gray rec- tangles that don’t actually do anything. It’s the event handler and go   method that create the effect.  The Back Button The code for the Back button looks like this:     Let’s read it from left to right:  INPUT—HTML code for an input item. TYPE=”button”—Tells the browser that the input item will be a button. VALUE=”BACK”—Puts the text on the button. onClick=—The event handler that will trigger what follows it when the user clicks the button. history.go—An object.method format JavaScript statement you should be pretty familiar with by now. history is the object; it represents the record the browser keeps of the user’s current online session. Basically, it’s a record of every page the user has been to, in order. The go method  parentheses left off on purpose  acts to move the user through that history object.  -1 —The instance of the method go. The -1 is telling the method to move one page back through the user’s history object.  It would seem logical that if go -1  is acceptable, go -2  or go -34  is also acceptable. They are. Just remember that the higher the number you put in that instance, the more pages the user will have had to have visited before coming to the current page. If the user is visit- ing the page containing this code first, the button is basically dead because there is no such thing as -1 in the history object.  49   JavaScript Goodies  However, there is one small exception to this rule. In Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0, any negative value that is put into the go method parentheses sends the user back only one page. It’s a known bug. You might want to keep that in mind when thinking about sending the user back multiple pages. Maybe one is enough.  The Forward Button This code is similar to what you saw for the Back button:     The only two differences are as follows:  VALUE= has been changed so that the button text now reads Forward, rather than Back. go   has been changed to now read a positive number, rather than a negative one. It moves the user forward through the history object list.  The method is the same, except that now when the user clicks the button, the next page up in the history object is loaded.  The Forward button is often dead because users might not have gone to another page and then returned to the page containing the code. However, I would still offer the button. Those who have gone to another page and returned can use it, and those who have not probably won’t use it, knowing they didn’t go anywhere. And if they do click the button, nothing will happen because there isn’t a page to go to in the history object.  Your Assignment The HTML Goodies site gets a great deal of mail asking how to set up guestbook, or form, pages so that when the user clicks to submit the page, either a thank-you page loads or the user is taken back to the page where he came from before clicking to fill out the guestbook.  The second scenario is your assignment. Create a small guestbook—one text box will do— so that when the user clicks to submit the form, he is taken back to the page he came from to fill out the guestbook form.  You can see one possible answer by clicking Lesson Nine Assignment in your download  packet, or see it online at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com JSBook assignment9.html.  The page that loads following this link offers a link to the guestbook page. After the user fills in the text box and submits it, the original assignment page reloads.  50   Chapter 2 ➤ Popping Up Text with Mouse Events  Lesson 10: The Second End-of-Chapter Review Once again, we’re going to stop, look at the JavaScript commands you’ve learned up to this point, and build some new scripts. I’ll offer one new script in this lesson and then make a suggestion or two for some new scripts. But keep in mind the purpose of these reviews is for you to take what you’ve learned so far and create a new and functional script to use on your pages.  Table 2.1 contains the object-related JavaScript commands you’ve learned up to now. In addition, you’ve seen these other JavaScript elements:  The alert   method These event handlers: onBlur, onChange, onClick, onDblClick, onFocus, onKeyDown, onKeyPress, onKeyUp, onLoad, onMouseDown, onMouseMove, onMouseOut, onMouseOver, onMouseUp, and onSubmit The HTML 4.0 flag    Table 2.1 Object-Related JavaScript Commands Demonstrated in Chapters 1 and 2 Object document  Methods write    go    history location navigator  window  Properties alinkColor, bgColor, fgColor, linkColor, lastModified, location, referrer, title, vlinkColor length host, hostname, href appCodeName, appName, appVersion, userAgent status  That’s actually a pretty impressive list of commands. You can create some very nice JavaScripts out of just what I’ve listed, as you can see here:    ➥To get to the other side.   ➥  ’ ”> Why did the chicken cross the road?    Allow me to explain a bit before you start copying the script. I am getting the before-and- after effect shown in Figures 2.10 and 2.11 by using only one   flag. Remember that you can’t break document.write commands into multiple lines because the script will throw  51   an error. So, the entire preceding code should be kept on one long line. Also, because of the   flag, you should look at this script’s example in an Internet Explorer browser, version 4.0 or above.  JavaScript Goodies  Figure 2.10 The window before you click the text.  Figure 2.11 The window after you click the text.  52   Chapter 2 ➤ Popping Up Text with Mouse Events  See the effect on your computer by clicking Lesson Ten’s Script Effect in your download pack- et, or see it online at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com JSBook lesson10effect.html.  Deconstructing the Script When the script says document.write, it means document.write.  As you’ve been reading through this chapter, did you stop and wonder what would happen if you put a document.write statement after an event handler? Well, here’s what happens: An entirely new document is written over the one currently in the browser window.  Look at the title bar in Figure 2.10: It says Lesson Ten. The title bar of Figure 2.11 says JSBook\Web Pages\Lesson10effect.html. The reason is that by putting the document.write command with an onClick, the browser did what you told it to. It wrote a brand-new page.  This is the code that did the trick:    ➥To get to the other side.   ➥  ’ ”>    I’ll stress again that the code should all go on one line. The book page just isn’t long enough to show it that way.  Let’s take it piece by piece:   —The HTML 4.0 code that acts as a delivery device so you can apply the onClick to an item, which in this case is text. onClick=—The event handler that triggers what follows it when the user clicks. “document.write=—The object.method statement used to write the text to the page. Please take note that double quotation marks appear before document.write and again at the very end of the   flag, right before the >. Single quotation marks—These are around all the text within the document.write instance.  To get to the other side. —The basic HTML code that pro- duces text at a font size of plus three.    —The HTML and JavaScript code that creates a Back button. You just saw that in Lesson 9. The code creates a button that moves the user back one page on his history object. Notice no quotation marks are around button, BACK, or history.go -1 . You’ve already used  53   JavaScript Goodies  double quotation marks around the document.write statement, and single quotation marks are used around the text in the instance. There’s no quotation mark smaller than single quotation marks, so you don’t use any. Finally, the text that will appear on the page is written in, and the   flag ends the code.  As I said earlier in this chapter, JavaScript is very logical. When you’re creating a new script, stop and think about what you want to happen, think about what must come before what, and then write the code in a linear fashion. You should be able to break it down like I broke down the preceding lines of code.  Now take some time to think about what you can do with the commands you already know.  Your Assignment Make something of your own. May I suggest using the document.location statement to cre- ate a reload button?  Or how about a line of hypertext that takes the user to a new page without having to click? A simple mouse pass would create the change of the page.  I have both of those suggested scripts available for you to view if you click Lesson Ten Assignment in your download packet. Or see it online at http:  www.htmlgoodies. com JSBook assignment10.html.  But first, go make your own!  Using Escape Characters In this chapter’s lessons, I have you popping up alert boxes and writing text to HTML pages. I mentioned in Chapter 1 that you have to be careful of writing contractions such as “isn’t” or “you’re” because they contain a single quotation mark. You know that that single quotation mark doesn’t end the JavaScript line, but the JavaScript doesn’t. It sees a quote and acts on it, which usually causes a pretty big error.  But you can’t very well write only to alert boxes and document.write text and never use a single quotation mark. Furthermore, what if you want a line break or a tab setting in your statements?  The answer is the use of escape characters. Let’s talk a little about aesthetics.  54   Chapter 2 ➤ Popping Up Text with Mouse Events  The Alert Example Figure 2.12 is a quick example of using escape characters in an alert box.  Figure 2.12 An alert box using escape characters to format the text.  Here’s the code for the alert button:  alert “Please write your \’name\’ in the box\rWrite it with \”quotes\” like ➥this.”   The JavaScript code should be all on one line.  Look closely at Figure 2.12 and then at the code. You’ll notice the single quotes were creat- ed with this: \’.  The return, or line break, was created with this: \r.  The double quote was created with this: \”.  The backslash is the key. If you use that backslash in front of the quotation marks or the letter “r”, you escape the coding long enough for the script to understand you want the character to represent text rather than a command to be used in the coding. That’s why it’s called an escape character. Get it?  55   JavaScript Goodies  A Bigger Alert Box Example I used four different escape characters in this example—the three shown previously and \t to create a tab effect. Note I sometimes used two to get a double tab or a double return. Again, look at Figure 2.13 and then at the code and pick out what escape character did what.  Figure 2.13 An alert box using many escape characters to format the text.  Now here’s the code. This should all be written on one long line. Just make a point of going through it piece by piece, and you’ll see each of the escape characters at work:  alert “OK Then!\r\rYou want a neat box like \”this\” one?\r\rWell!\r\rYou\’ll need:\rBrains\tBeauty\t\tTalent\rMoney\tDog food\t\tLuck\rA Cat\tEye of Newt\tA ➥Shrubbery!\r\rAnd the ability to \’read\’ this tutorial.\r\rOK?”   The document.write Example You wouldn’t want to use the return character in a document.write because it’s better to lit- erally write a BR or P flag to the page. Hopefully, you remembered that from all the way back in Chapter 1. Where these escape characters come in handy is situations in which you need to use a double or single quotation mark, yet you do not want to end the line. For example, let’s say the following line has to be written with a document.write command:  We’re going to “need” to know where you’re going tonight, young man!  Get it?  56   Chapter 2 ➤ Popping Up Text with Mouse Events  Anybody else have parents that sounded like that? Mine did. It was the only sentence I could think of that had a single and double quote in it. Huh. I guess I have issues to work out. Here’s the code:    document.write ‘We\’re going to \”need\” to know where you\’re going tonight, ➥young man!’     Read slowly and pick out the escape characters.  I’ll bet those little blips of information just made someone’s life a little easier. At least now you’ll have fewer alert boxes that do not talk in contractions.  Okay, that’s the end of aesthetics. Let’s get back to JavaScript coding.  57    Chapter 3  Manipulating Data and the Hierarchy of JavaScript  This chapter contains the following lessons and scripts:  Lesson 11: Prompts and Variables Lesson 12: Dates and Times Lesson 13: Hierarchy of Objects Lesson 14: Creating a Function Lesson 15: An Introduction to Arrays Lesson 16: The Third End-of-Chapter Review—A   Flag Script  The JavaScript commands in this chapter are grouped together because they all deal with data in some way, shape, or form. That data can consist of dates, times, or input from the user. In addition, each of these lessons introduces you to one of the most important topics in JavaScript—the hierarchy of objects.  You have already been introduced to JavaScript hierarchy in the object.method and object.property statements in Lesson Nine  see Chapter 2, “Popping Up Text with Mouse Events” . But now you’ll learn about creating hierarchy with variables and other types of JavaScript data.  As Lesson 13 in this chapter states, “… after you understand the hierarchy of objects, you’ve conquered JavaScript.”   JavaScript Goodies  Lesson 11: Prompts and Variables This lesson has two concepts. First is the prompt box, which you use when you want to prompt the user for information. The second, creating variables, is one you’ll use through- out the remainder of your JavaScript life. Let’s begin by examining these concepts.  Creating a Variable The concept of variables is paramount in JavaScript, so you must know how to create them. When you create a variable, you are denoting a one-word  or one-letter  representation for the output of a JavaScript command line. Remember when you were posting the name of the browser to the page using the method appName? When you placed the name in the  document.write statement, you wrote out the entire navigator.appName. Because you did it only once, it wasn’t so hard. But what if you wanted to write it ten times across the same page? Writing those characters again and again would get boring.  So you assign a variable to represent the output of the method. Let’s say you choose the variable NA. That way, you would have to write navigator.appName only once and assign  NA to it. The rest of the way through, you would write only NA when you wanted the  navigator.appName.  Please keep in mind that the variable is “NA” with two capital letters. You’ll need to follow whatever capitalization pattern you choose every time you call for the variable you created because JavaScript is case sensitive. You could also have a variable “na” in the same script, and it would be seen as completely different from “NA”. Please understand I’m just making a point by showing “NA” and “na” together. You would never want to do that in a script simply because it would be confusing. The point I want to make is to be aware of your capi- talization when creating variable names.  Are you still with me? Let’s get back to this example.  This lesson’s script uses the following line to denote a variable:  var username = prompt  “Write your name in the box below”, “Write it here”   We created the variable following this format:  var proclaims that the word immediately following will be the variable name. username is the name of the variable. I made this up. It didn’t have to be this long; in fact, I could have made it N if I wanted. It’s always best to create the variable names in such a way that you can easily remember what the variables represent. The equal sign  =  denotes that the variable name will equal the output of the com- mands that follow. In this case, the variable will represent the output of the prompt box.  60   Chapter 3 ➤ Manipulating Data and the Hierarchy of JavaScript  One more thing: Variable names can be just about any word or combination of letters and numbers you want; however, some variable names are off limits.  For instance, you should not create a variable name that is the same word as a JavaScript command. You’ll know you didn’t mean for the word to be used as a command, but the computer won’t.  In addition to not using JavaScript commands as variable names, Appendix C, “JavaScript Reserved Variable Words,” has a list of other words you should avoid. Some of the words are already in use as JavaScript commands, and some are reserved words that will be used in upcoming JavaScript versions. You might want to take a quick look at the list before going further.  I’ve found that as long as you create a variable name that is representative of the data, you shouldn’t run into any trouble, but just to be sure, take a look at Appendix C.  Please notice that no quotation marks surround either var or the variable name. Just follow one word with the next as shown in the code. The JavaScript will understand what you’re saying.  The Prompt Command I used a new command for this example: prompt. This method pops up a box prompting the user for a response.  Here’s the basic format of the prompt:  var variable_name = prompt “Message on the gray box”,”Default Reply”   The default reply is the text that will appear in the user-entry field on the prompt box. You should include text in case the user doesn’t fill anything in. That way, you’ll have some- thing for the JavaScript to work with.  But if you like the look of an empty user-entry field on the prompt box, that’s fine. If the user doesn’t enter any text, the text null will be returned for you.  In case you’re wondering … to get a blank white box in the user-entry field, do not write any text between the second set of quotation marks. And yes, you need the quotation marks even if they’re empty. If you do not put the second set of quotation marks in, the white box will read undefined.  The var and the variable name you assigned are included in the format. They have to be; otherwise, you’ll get the prompt, but nothing will be done with the data the user enters.  61   JavaScript Goodies  The Sample Script Now you’re back to creating full JavaScripts rather than just adding events to HTML, so you’ll need to again start using the full   to   for- mat.  Here’s what you’re going to do. You’ll ask the user for his name and assign a variable to that name. After the variable is assigned, you can enter it in a document.write line that posts the user’s name to the page. The script is as follows:     *This script is intended to take information from the user and place it upon the page*  var username = prompt  “Write your name in the box below”, ➥”Write it here” ; document.write “Hello “ + username + “. Welcome to my page!” ;    This script brings up a prompt box asking for the user’s name, as shown in Figure 3.1. Figure 3.2 shows the result after the user enters his name and clicks OK.  Figure 3.1 The prompt box asks for the user’s name.  62   Chapter 3 ➤ Manipulating Data and the Hierarchy of JavaScript  Figure 3.2 The script responds appro- priately to the user’s input.

What Are Those  * and *  Things? Yeah, I stuck in two extra commands that comment out text in the script. When you com- ment out something, the text sits in the source code for you and anyone else who’s interest- ed to read it, but it won’t affect the script nor show up on the resulting page. It’s a great way to add copyrights, tell what the script does, and generally help yourself along by adding instruction text that’s not part of the script.  These comment commands allow for multiple lines. Just have  * at the beginning and *  at the end, and everything in between will comment out. You can write a whole paragraph of commented text as long as it is between the two comment commands—it won’t affect the script in any way.  Deconstructing the Script Now that you know all the parts of the prompt, let’s examine the meat of the script:  var user_name = prompt  “Write your name in the box below”, ➥”Write it here” ; document.write “Hello “ + username + “. Welcome to my page!” ;  63   JavaScript Goodies  The variable name username is assigned to the output of the prompt. The prompt asks the user to write his name in the box. The white box reads “Write it here”. A semicolon ends the line because I wanted it there. It is not necessary. The document.write statement calls for the text “Hello “  space for continuity . The plus sign  +  denotes that what follows will write right after the line of text. username is representative of the output of the prompt. No quotation marks are used—we don’t want it printed. Another plus sign is used. “. Welcome to my page!”, with a period and a space for continuity, completes the text. The semicolon is placed on purpose to show me that the line has ended.  That’s all.  Please make a point of truly understanding the concept of variables before you proceed. Variables are used extensively in this language. If you’re lost at this point, reread the  lesson.  Your Assignment … is a review.  Here’s what I want you to do:  Let’s combine a couple of the commands you’ve learned so far with the new variable and prompt commands you just learned.  Create two prompts. One will ask for the user’s first name, and one will ask for the user’s last name. Don’t let this throw you—just create two fully formed prompt lines in the preceding script and assign each one a different variable name. One will simply follow the other in the script. Using the prompts, create this line of text: Hello first-name last-name. I see you are using browser-name. Thanks for coming to document-title. BUT! Write the code so that the browser-name and document title items are called by the variables BN and PT, respectively. Think it through, and then write the script. There are bonus points if you comment out a couple of lines.  64   Chapter 3 ➤ Manipulating Data and the Hierarchy of JavaScript  You can see a possible answer to this assignment on your own computer by clicking Lesson Eleven Assignment in your download packet, or see it online at http:  www.htmlgoodies. com JSBook assignment11.html.  Lesson 12: Dates and Times What’s nice about writing JavaScript right to a Web page is all the stuff that already exists that you can grab and display.  This lesson talks about how you can display existing information using a new object, Date, and seven new methods: getDay  , getDate  , getMonth  , getYear  , getHours  , getMinutes  , and getSeconds  .  Date is an object that contains the current day of the week, month, day of the month, cur- rent hour, current minute, current second, and current year. All that and looks, too, huh?  So, if Date has all that, why use any of the methods? Because you might not want all that stuff every time. What if you want only the day of the week? Then you use getDay   to extract just that day of the week from the Date object.  The Date and Time Methods Even before beginning to delve into the sample script, let’s discuss each of the Date object methods. They are quirky to say the least.  First, all seven methods return numbers rather than text. It would be nice if getDay   would give you Monday, or Wednesday, or Saturday, but it doesn’t. It gives you a number between 0 and 6.  Between 0 and 6?  Yes. Allow me to introduce you to one of the more frustrating aspects of JavaScript.  JavaScript counts start at 0. The number 0 is equal to the first element of a list in JavaScript’s mind.  The common week starts on Sunday and ends on Saturday. You might see it differently, but JavaScript sees the seven-day week as Sunday through Saturday. Those seven days are in JavaScript’s mind as being numbered from 0  Sunday  through 6  Saturday .  So, if you call for getDay   and it’s Wednesday, you will actually get only the number 3 returned. Goofy, yes, but that’s what happens.  But so what? The previous script doesn’t call for the day of the week. True, but it does call for the month. JavaScript counts that up from 0, too. Thus, the number returned for the month is always one less than you would expect.  65   JavaScript Goodies  The Methods and What They Return Here’s a quick rundown of each method and what it returns. It’ll help you to understand what pops up on your page when using the variable, as I’ll show:  getDate  —Believe it or not, this one acts normally. It returns the day of the month as the correctly numbered day of the month. getDay  —Returns the numbers 0  Sunday  through 6  Saturday , depending on the day of the week. getHours  —Returns the hour of the day in a 24-hour format counting the hours up from 0 through 23. getMinutes  —Returns the minute of the hours counting up from 0 up through 59, but this one isn’t bad. There actually is a 0 at the top of the hour, so we’re good to go with getMinutes. getMonth  —Returns the month of the year counting up from 0. The month of February therefore returns the number 1. getSeconds  —Returns the second of the minute counting up from 0 to 59. This method, like getMinutes, is okay in that there is actually a 0 at the top of the hour. getFullYear  —Returns the 4-digit year. JavaScript ran into a little trouble when the Y2K bug hit. The original year command, getYear  , returned only a two-digit year. When it was 1999, that was okay. But when 2000 began, instead of returning 00, the command returned 100. Oops. Do yourself a favor and start using getFullYear   exclusively. It’s a quick fix that works pretty well.  The Sample Script Take a look at this lesson’s script:      This script posts the exact day and time you arrived RightNow = new Date  ; document.write “Today’s date is “ + RightNow.getMonth  + “-”  document.write “+ RightNow.getDate   + “-” + RightNow.getFullYear   + “.”  document.write “You entered this Web Page at exactly: “ ➥ + RightNow.getHours   + “hours”  document.write “+ RightNow.getMinutes   + “ minutes and “ ➥ + RightNow.getSeconds   + “ seconds”     The script displays the date and time the page was loaded with this script, as shown in Figure 3.3.  66   Chapter 3 ➤ Manipulating Data and the Hierarchy of JavaScript  Figure 3.3 The date and time methods display a variety of useful information.

What’s That    Thing? You are an observant one, aren’t you? That double slash denotes a single comment line inside the script. It means that the text that follows will not be used in the process, but rather will just be reprinted as is. It works just like the multiline comment you saw in Lesson 11, earlier in this chapter. You can add as many of them as you want, as long as each line starts with the double slash.  You also can use the double slashes at the end of a line of JavaScript to remind yourself, or tell your users, what the line of JavaScript will do. Here’s an example:  document.write “text”     This writes text to the page  Deconstructing the Script If you look at the sample script, you’ll see that the effect is created by asking the script to write the month, date, year, hour, minute, and second to the page. The extra verbiage stuck in there just makes it obvious what you’re looking at.  67   JavaScript Goodies  Let’s start with the first one called for in the preceding script—the month—and then we can start to break down how this works. As stated before, getMonth   is a method. That said, we now must concern ourselves with what object getMonth   is a method of.  It might appear from the script that getSomething   is a method of document. Not so—the method of document is write. getMonth   is actually a method of the object Date. Look up at the script and you’ll see that Date is set aside in the command:  RightNow = new Date  ;  What is happening here is we are setting aside the object for the method getMonth   to work on. Actually, we’re creating a new Date object to work with in the script.  Date, remember, contains all the date and time information you’ll need. In fact, when you use one of the getSomething   methods, you’re simply extracting one section of what Date possesses.  I’ll prove that to you. Here’s code that uses only the Date object without any method:    document.write “Here’s some information: “ +Date  + “.”     With just that, look at Figure 3.4 to see all the good stuff you get.  Figure 3.4 Using the Date object yields a lot of information.  68   Chapter 3 ➤ Manipulating Data and the Hierarchy of JavaScript  Defining a Variable for the Date Object The variable name given to the Date object in the sample script is RightNow. Now, I could have called it Zork or Fred, for all the browser cares. It doesn’t matter as long as the object is given an original name that isn’t found in JavaScript. See Appendix C for a list of unus- able words.  If that seems backwards to you, it does to me, too. It seems like it should be  new Date = RightNow, but it isn’t. You’re learning a new language, and you have to play  by its rules.  The earlier command is saying this: RightNow is the variable that represents a new Date  ;.  But why “new” Date? The date has to be new so that you get a new date every time the page is entered or reloaded. Without the new command, the date would remain static. You reinforce the fact that the date has to be new by giving it a variable name, too.  Hooray! You have your object variable name set so that your getMonth   method can act on it. You want this month to be printed on the page, so you need to have a document.write   statement in there somewhere. You also know that what appears in the parentheses is printed on the page, so put together a smaller version of the big script in this lesson by fol- lowing a logical process:  1. You need to place the   first. 2. Then, insert a comment line that tells what this thing does. 3. You’ll need to create a new Date object before you can call on the getMonth   portion,  so insert that. Make sure the call ends with a semicolon.  4. Now you can place the document.write   statement. 5. Inside the document.write’s incidence, follow the same format as in Lesson 1 in  Chapter 1, “The Basics.”  6. Text that is to be printed must be inside double quotation marks. 7. Finish up with  .  Here’s what you get:      This script will post the name of the month RightNow = new Date  ; document.write “This is the month “ + RightNow.getMonth “.”     Look at the full script again. That long line of text doesn’t look so tough now. It’s simply the RightNow object variable name followed by the next getSomething   method. I separated each with a hyphen; remember the hyphen is to be printed so it must be in quotation marks.  69   JavaScript Goodies  Building the Lines of document.write Code I won’t go through it all because you probably have the swing of it by now, so I’ll discuss just the date portion of the script. It looks like this:  document.write “Today’s date is “ + RightNow.getMonth  + “-”  document.write + RightNow.getDate   + “-” + RightNow.getYear   + “.”   It starts with “Today’s date is “, with a space at the end for continuity. The plus sign is next. RightNow.getMonth   is added without quotation marks because we do not want that printed—we want the number returned. Another plus sign follows. Now, a hyphen appears in quotation marks to separate it from the next number. No space is used because we want the next number to butt right up against it. Next comes a plus sign. Then comes the next document.write statement. It starts with a plus sign because the first item in this statement is a return. Now RightNow.getDate is added because we want the number of the day  no quota- tion marks . A plus sign is next. Another hyphen appears in quotation marks so it is printed right to the page. Another plus sign is next. Last is another new method, RightNow.getYear, which returns the number of the year.  Just continue to follow this same format, and the script will print out what you tell it to. So now you can tell everyone what time it is. But as Chicago sang, “Does anybody really know what time it is? Does anybody really care?”  Wait! What About Some of the Numbers Being One Off? It’s actually pretty easy to fix. So far, you’ve seen the plus sign used to surround text so that it acts as a return rather than printing to the page.  That plus sign can also act as a, well, as a plus sign intended to add things together. We’ll get more into the mathematics of JavaScript in Chapter 5, “Forms: A Great Way to Interact with Your Users,” but for now, let’s just do some simple addition.  To get the returns from getDay  , getMonth  , and getSeconds   to display correctly, you must add a couple of steps to the process.  70   Chapter 3 ➤ Manipulating Data and the Hierarchy of JavaScript  To return the correct number, you need to return each of the method.objects  listed earlier  and assign each a variable name.  Also, when you assign a variable name, you must add 1. Here’s an example of a script that returns the date in    format:    RightNow = new Date  ; var dy = RightNow.getDate   + 1 var mth = RightNow.getMonth   + 1 var yr = RightNow.getFullYear   document.write + dy + “ ” + mth + “ ” + yr + “.”     See the format? I assigned the variable name dy to the code that would return the number representing the day of the week and added 1. Then, in the document.write statement, I called only for the variable name dy. That returns the number returned by RightNow.getDay   plus 1.  I did the same for RightNow.getMonth  . The command getFullYear   returns the entire four-digit year.  Now it’s correct.  Your Assignment This one isn’t so tough:  Write a script that asks for the user’s name through a prompt. Use that name to write a piece of text that reads Welcome user-name. It is minutes past hour. Thanks for coming. Now, here’s the kicker: Make that text appear in an alert that pops up when the page loads. Bonus points are available if you call for the minutes and hours by using variable names.

Lesson 13: Hierarchy of Objects Whoa! Let’s pause and get familiar with the concept of hierarchy. What better time to stop than lucky Lesson 13?  71   JavaScript Goodies  You know that JavaScript has objects, which are similar to nouns. You also know that objects have properties that describe how objects look, just as adjectives describe nouns.  You also know that objects have methods, or actions, that can be performed to the object. Different objects have access to different properties and methods. But what follows what, and which of these is most important? How do you write the code to the page so that the JavaScript understands that this is a property of this, and this method is to act upon this object? You do it by writing objects, methods, and properties in a hierarchical fashion.  Now you’ll learn THE secret to understanding JavaScript—the hierarchy of objects, illustrat- ed in Figure 3.5. Don’t tell a soul, but after you understand the hierarchy of objects, you’ve conquered JavaScript!  Figure 3.5 The concept of an object hierarchy.  You can either see this diagram up close by clicking Lesson Thirteen Script’s Effect or see it online at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com JSBook lesson13effect.html.  Please understand that the image is not a complete representation of the hierarchy of JavaScript; it represents only what you’ve learned up to this point.  Terms, Terms, Terms: DOM The purpose of this book is to teach you JavaScript in the friendliest and most easy-to- understand method possible.  Figure 3.5 shows the hierarchy of JavaScript. That hierarchy actually has a term—it’s called a Document Object Model, or DOM for short.  72   Chapter 3 ➤ Manipulating Data and the Hierarchy of JavaScript  I don’t use the term because it really doesn’t tell you, the reader, anything. In fact, at the level you’re at, it might actually be confusing.  I use the term hierarchy statement because it is a better representation of the code.  Just keep in mind at your next party full of technical people that the true term is DOM, or Document Object Model.  The Hierarchy of Objects’ Effects All references begin with the top object, the window  the browser screen , and go down. window is the highest-level object in JavaScript. So much so that JavaScript doesn’t even require that you use it in your code. JavaScript just understands that, unless told otherwise, everything happens within the browser window.  That means that everything you’ve seen so far actually should be written with the object window at the beginning, like so:  window.document.write window.RightNow.getDay   window.default.status  If you want to write your code this way, great, but it’s not required, obviously, because the top-level object, window, is understood to be the overriding object.  Here are some examples. Notice they follow the hierarchy pattern from Figure 3.5, from top to bottom:  document.mypic.src = “pic1.gif”  Again, window is not needed at the very beginning because it is assumed that all this is inside the window. This references an image named mypic, changing its contents to pic1.gif. Did you follow that? document is the page the item is on, mypic is the item’s name, and SRC is the item’s source.  It is getting smaller going left to right, one inside the other. It’s similar to how a page con- tains a sentence, a sentence contains a word, and a word contains a letter. Look at this example:  document.write location.href   write   is a method of the document object, and location.href returns the full URL of the window. Notice that location and document are at the same level. They are written to the left of the only dot. However, one has a method following it  write , and the other has a property following it  href .  73   JavaScript Goodies  That means you get the location of that same-level document denoted by document.write, even though one hierarchy statement is sitting in the instance—the parentheses—of the other. Both document.write and location.href act within the same document window because they are at the same level. Still with me?  Deconstructing the Hierarchy of Objects What’s most confusing about this is that some objects are also properties. I’m referencing Figure 3.5 again here:  window is just an object. document is an object inside the window. form is a property of document, but it is also an object with its own properties. value and src are just properties.  Not all objects and properties are displayed here. However, this should be enough to help you understand this format. All references start at the top with window and go down, writ- ing them left to right, separated by dots.  You therefore can’t write document.mytext.myform or mypic.src.document because they are not in correct order. The order must go biggest to smallest from left to right.  A Very Important Concept Order is paramount in hierarchy. It will come into play when we start to talk about forms in Chapter 6, “Mathematics, Random Things, and Loops.”  Let’s say you have an HTML text box on your page, and the user writes something in the text box. To return the contents of that text box using JavaScript, you must use the proper- ty value; for example, document.myform.mytext.value. Just writing document.myform.mytext gives information about the form field but not its contents. The value command returns what is written inside the text box.  Just know that an HTML form field, like a text box or a radio button, is given a name. In the preceding example, it’s myform. If you call for that alone, you’ll get information about the form item itself, just like getDay   returns the day number. But if you want what is written in the form element itself, you must add value to the end of the hierarchy state- ment. Now you’re one level below the form field itself. You’re at the level of what the user wrote—what is contained within the form.  Think of value as a reading of what something is or is not at a specific time. A check box can have a value of on or off depending on whether it has been clicked. A text box field can have a value of “hidden” if you don’t want the user to see it. And, as noted previously, a TEXT field can have input written to it, which is that field’s value. Get it?  74   Chapter 3 ➤ Manipulating Data and the Hierarchy of JavaScript  Maybe not yet, but you will. Hierarchy is at the very heart of JavaScript. We will talk about hierarchy a great deal throughout the rest of the book.  Your Assignment Here’s a little bit of code for you to look at:    <INPUT TYPE=”button” Value=”Click Here” onClick=”parent.frames[1].location=’zippy5.html’; parent.frames[2].location=’zippy6.html’; parent.frames[3].location=’zippy7.html’;”    You can see the basic format as a FORM button, but what does all that stuff after the onClick stand for?  Follow the thought process from the preceding lesson and without looking at the answer, make a point of writing down what you think this script does.  Also—think about how it does it.  You can see a full tutorial on what that link does by clicking Lesson Thirteen Assignment in your download packet, or see it online at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com JSBook   assignment13.html.  Lesson 14: Creating a Function In the creation of a variable, you assign a one-word title to the output of a JavaScript com- mand or event. Creating a function is doing the same thing, except you are assigning a title to an entire series of commands. You are combining many JavaScript commands into one.  Here’s an example. Let’s say you have some JavaScript code that grabs the hour, minute, and second. Then you have some code that writes that code to the page. You want the return from that code to appear on the page four times. There’s no reason why you  couldn’t write the code again and again. It will work just fine, but wouldn’t assigning a one-word title to both pieces of code be easier? Then you could call for the two pieces of code by just calling on that one word.  It’s good programming, too, because you must call on only one name to get an effect. Your page isn’t full of extra, and probably confusing, code.  To illustrate, let’s use a script that’s actually in two parts: the script itself, which contains the function; and the onLoad event handler, which triggers the function to work.  75   JavaScript Goodies  Here are both parts:    <!-- Hide from browsers that do not understand JavaScript function dateinbar   { var d = new Date  ; var y = d.getFullYear  ; var m = d.getMonth   + 1; var d = d.getDate  ; var t = m + ‘ ’ + d + ‘ ’ + y + ‘ ‘; defaultStatus = “You arrived at the page on “ + t + “.”; }    end hiding -->    And here’s the onLoad command in the  :     The script’s effect displays in the status bar, as shown in Figure 3.6.  We kept basically the same type of date script we’ve been using in past lessons so it would all look somewhat familiar to you. See how we assigned the getSomething   method’s vari- able names and added 1?  Figure 3.6 The function displays the date in the status bar.  76   Chapter 3 ➤ Manipulating Data and the Hierarchy of JavaScript  You can see this effect on your computer by clicking Lesson Fourteen Script’s Effect, or see it online at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com JSBook lesson14effect.html.  Hey! What Are Those   Things? They’re yet another couple of extra commands stuck in for good measure. Those probably look familiar to you because they’re the two comment flags you use to comment out text in an HTML document. It looks like this:     I am using them here because, believe it or not, there are still browsers out there that do not read JavaScript. I wrote this section on June 28, 2001, and yes, even today there are browsers that will not read JavaScript. By using these comment commands, the text of the JavaScript is commented out so that it isn’t printed on the page. You see, if the browser doesn’t understand JavaScript, it sees that text as something to be printed on the page, and it looks bad. But if you use the comment flags, the browser that can’t read JavaScript happi- ly ignores the text and displays the page.  If you use these comment flags, there are a few very important rules to follow.  The commands go inside the   and   flags. If you put them outside those commands, you would comment out the entire JavaScript on all browsers and nothing would run. The <!-- flag can be followed by a line of text as long as the text is all on the same line. The --> flag must be commented out using the double slashes; otherwise, the JavaScript thinks the command is part of the script, causing an error.  Notice you can also put some text before it because it is commented out. No, you do not have to use text along with these commands. I put the text in because it made explaining the purpose of the flags easier. Follow the format and placement style discussed earlier, and you’ll have no trouble.  Deconstructing the Script Two things are happening here. The first is the script section that creates the function. The second is the command found in the HTML   flag that triggers the function to work. Let’s look at the concept of the function first:  function dateinbar   { var d = new Date  ; var y = d.getFullYear   + 1900; var m = d.getMonth   + 1; var d = d.getDate  ;  77   JavaScript Goodies  var t = m + ‘ ’ + d + ‘ ’ + y + ‘ ‘; defaultStatus = “You arrived at the page on “ + t + “.”; }  The format is straightforward:  The function is given a name by writing function and then the name you want to assign to the function. It’s very similar to the way you create a variable name. But please note that the function name has the parentheses following it the same way that method commands do. I always keep it straight by thinking that in creating a function, I am actually creating a new method for performing a task. A variable is made for the year. Another variable is assigned to the month, and anoth- er for the day. A fourth variable, t, is created to represent the entire date format. It should look familiar. It was created to enable you to call for the full date anywhere in the HTML document by just calling for t. The last command is new to you:  defaultStatus = “You arrived at the page on “ + t + “.”;  defaultStatus is a property of the object window. Its purpose is to place text into the status bar at the bottom of the browser window.  There’s only one status bar, so that has to be the default.  The onLoad= Command The command onLoad tells the browser that upon loading the page, do what follows. In this case, what follows is the function dateinbar  .  This onLoad=functionname   command format is almost always found in the BODY portion of the HTML document.  Placement of These Items Where you put the two sections—the function and the onLoad command—is important. You know the onLoad command goes in the BODY portion. The script that contains the func- tion should be placed between the   and   commands in the HTML document. You can actually stick it anywhere on the page and it’ll run, but placing it after the onLoad command causes it to start after the entire page has been loaded. Putting it before the onLoad command places it in the computer’s memory first, so it’s there ready to go when the onLoad calls for it.  78   Chapter 3 ➤ Manipulating Data and the Hierarchy of JavaScript  A Word About Global and Local Variables Okay, now you understand how to assign a variable name and how to create a function. What you might not know is that variables are seen differently by JavaScript, depending on whether they are inside the function or outside the function.  JavaScript allows for two levels of variables, local and global.  Local variables are variables that are viable only within a function. JavaScript understands that whenever a variable is encased within a function, that variable name is viable only inside that function. That way, if you copy and paste a script onto a page that already has a script on it, any existing variables that are equally named will not clash as long as that variable name is found within a function.  Global variables are variables that are not found within functions, and thus can clash with the existing variables on the same page.  Here’s an example:    var joe = 12 function writeit   { var joe = “Joe Burns” document.write joe  }    The variable joe is used twice, but because one is found outside the function  the global variable  and one is found inside the function  the local variable , the two will not clash.  Now, with all that said it is not a good idea to follow the preceding format and use like variable names within your scripts. The purpose of the local variables being hidden is far more for protection against clashes with other scripts on the same page than clashes with variable names within the same script.  Name all your variables descriptively and differently, and you’ll run into very few, if any, problems.  Your Assignment Just about any group of JavaScript commands that produce an effect can be set into a func- tion format. In fact, your assignment today is to try to prove that theory.  79   JavaScript Goodies  This one’s a little involved:  1. Create a function that calls for two prompts. The first asks for the person’s first name,  whereas the second prompt asks for the person’s last name.  2. Then, in the same function, have an alert box pop up with the text Hello first name  last name. Welcome to page address, My Great Page!  3. Make sure you make a variable for the page address. 4. If you want to make this assignment a little more fun, present My Great Page to the viewer some other way than simply writing it in text in the alert command. Make a variable for that, too.

Lesson 15: An Introduction to Arrays Let’s return to Lesson 12. When you used any one of the getSomething   date or time methods, a number representing the Date object property was returned. In some cases, such as the hour and day of the month, that’s fine, but for other Date returns it isn’t so good. Take getDay  , for example. As you probably thought, it’s not very helpful to have the days of the week returned as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.  The best approach is to take the number that’s returned and change it into text. That makes more sense and is easier to read.  Here’s how:    var dayName=new Array “Sunday”,”Monday”,”Tuesday”, ➥”Wednesday”,”Thursday”,”Friday”,”Saturday”  var y=new Date  ; document.write “Today is “+dayName[y.getDay  ] + “.” ;    Figure 3.7 shows the result of this script. You can also see this effect on your computer by clicking Lesson Fifteen Script’s Effect, or see it online at http:  www.htmlgoodies. com JSBook lesson15effect.html.  80   Chapter 3 ➤ Manipulating Data and the Hierarchy of JavaScript  Figure 3.7 The function displays the day of the week.  Deconstructing the Script Let’s start with the same rule that started Lesson 12:  JavaScript starts counting at 0.  That’s why the month number is always returned one less than what the month actually is. JavaScript starts counting January at 0.  For this lesson, we’ll add to the preceding rule:  JavaScript counts everything you give it and always starts counting at 0.  If you offer JavaScript a list of simple text items, such as a number of names or words  known in JavaScript as literals , the script will assign numbers to the items in that list. Guess what number it assigns to the first item? That’s right: 0.  So let’s give JavaScript a long list of things—the days of the week. But like everything else, you can’t just throw a bunch of words in a script and hope the browser picks up what you mean. There is a method to offering a long list of items, such as the days of the week.  It’s called creating an array.  81   JavaScript Goodies  Setting Up the Array Here’s the array line from the sample script:  var dayName=new Array “Sunday”,”Monday”,”Tuesday”, ➥”Wednesday”,”Thursday”,”Friday”,”Saturday”   The format for creating an array is pretty simple:  1. You assign the array of literals a variable name. In this case, I called the array dayName. 2. You tell the browser that this is a new array by writing new Array. That makes sense.  Note the capitalization pattern.  3. The array of literals is placed within parentheses. 4. Each new array item is surrounded with double quotation marks. Remember that  each array item is text, and that requires double quotation marks.  5. Each array item is separated from the next by a comma, no spaces. You can have  spaces if you want, but I feel this format looks a little cleaner.  6. The big question is in what order to put the array items. Here the answer is easy: You know that the days of the week are represented Sunday through to Saturday, 0–6. So, you list Sunday first because you know it will receive the 0 both from the getDay   method and from the JavaScript assigning numbers to the array. That makes it a pret- ty sure bet that a 0 will return Sunday to the page.  Later in the book, we’ll discuss arrays that do not come with a 0 through whatever pattern is already set. That gets a little more complicated. For now, we’ll stay with the rather easy- to-create arrays because JavaScript has set the order for us already.  Grabbing a Piece of the Array Now that you’ve set up the seven-day text array, you need to create a method to return the numeric day of the week through the getDay   method, and then turn that number into the correct day from the array.  Here’s the code that does it:  var y=new Date  ; document.write “Today is “+dayName[y.getDay  ] + “.” ;  The first line should be familiar by now. A variable, y, is set up that represents the new Date  .  The document.write statement should also look familiar. The text within the double quota- tion marks writes to the page, whereas the text within the plus signs returns something to the page in its place.  82   Chapter 3 ➤ Manipulating Data and the Hierarchy of JavaScript  Here’s the magic in the script:  dayName[y.getDay  ]  The code turns the attention of the return to the array, dayName.  The code in the brackets is the same format used to return the numeric day of the week number: variablename.getDay  .  The y.getDay   is replaced by a number representing the day of the week, like it always is.  So what the command is actually saying is Go to this array[find this number].  If you were running this script on a Monday, the y.getDay   would return the number 1. The browser would see the command dayName[y.getDay  ] as dayName[1] and would return the text in the array associated with the number 1. The number 1 is Monday because JavaScript counts up from 0.  Get it? Good.  Your Assignment Use the previous instructions and array to create a script that prints this line to the page: Today is Day-Of-The-Week in the month of Month-Name.  You already know the format for the day of the week. Now create an array that returns the name of the month. Just follow the pattern shown earlier to create the array, and remem- ber to give the new array a new variable name. You can’t have two variables in the same script with the same name.  Remember, even in months, JavaScript starts counting at 0.

Lesson 16: The Third End-of-Chapter Review—A   Flag Script If you stopped at this point, you would do just fine. What you have is sufficient to create some wonderful scripts.  But why stop now? Let’s review!  Table 3.1 contains the object-related JavaScript commands you’ve learned up to now. In addition, you’ve been introduced to these JavaScript concepts:  83   JavaScript Goodies  The alert   method and the prompt   method These event handlers: onBlur, onChange, onClick, onDblClick, onFocus, onKeyDown, onKeyPress, onKeyUp, onLoad, onMouseDown, onMouseMove, onMouseOut, onMouseOver, onMouseUp, onSubmit The HTML 4.0 flag   Creating variable names Creating a function  Table 3.1 Object-Related JavaScript Commands Demonstrated in Chapters 1–3 Object date  Properties  Methods getDate  , getDay  , getHours  , getMinutes  , getMonth  , getSeconds  , getYear   write    go    document  history location navigator  window  alinkColor, bgColor, fgColor, linkColor, lastModified, location, referrer, title, vlinkColor length host, hostname, href appCodeName, appName, appVersion, userAgent defaultstatus, status  Next, let’s use some of these commands to create a script that helps the viewer create the page. The script will ask the viewer what background and text colors she would like. Then, the page will display with those colors. Finally, the viewer will be told, in the status bar, Here’s your color background and color text.  The script is as follows:    var color = prompt “What color would you like the page’s background to be”,””  var txtcolor = prompt “What color would you like the text to be?”,””  document.write “ ”  defaultStatus=”Here’s your “ +color+ “ background and “ +txtcolor+ “ text”    Figure 3.8 shows the script’s effect.  84   Chapter 3 ➤ Manipulating Data and the Hierarchy of JavaScript  Figure 3.8 The script creates a page with the user’s desired background color and text color.  You can see this effect on your computer by clicking Lesson Sixteen Script’s Effect, or see it online at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com JSBook lesson16effect.html.  Deconstructing the Script The script starts by setting a couple of variables using prompts. You need to get the user’s input on what background and text color she wants, so this seems as good a way as any.  The variables are color and txtcolor, respectively. The code looks like this:  var color = prompt “What color would you like the page’s background to be”,””  var txtcolor = prompt “What color would you like the text to be?”,””   Now that you have the input from the user, you’ll need to use that data to alter the page. The real beauty of this script is its placement on the page.  Up until now, each of the scripts in this book had no real placement concerns. The script could pretty much sit anywhere in an HTML document, and the results would display. Now, though, you are concerned with where this script will place its output.  The script must write its line of text so that that line of text becomes the HTML docu- ment’s   flag.  The quickest way to implement the user’s background and text color requests is to write them to the   flag. So that’s what you did. This script’s main purpose is to write the HTML document’s   flag to the page, so you must ensure that the entire script sits  85   JavaScript Goodies  right where the body command needs to sit on the HTML page. And, of course, you need to ensure that you don’t write a   into the HTML document yourself. You need to let the script do that for you.  Here’s the code that writes the   flag:  document.write “ ”   The colors are entered as return variables inside the two plus signs. That way, what the user writes in the prompt is what is returned.  Status Bar, Too? But the script goes a little further than just writing a   flag. It also places the viewer’s data to the status bar, almost as if the page were served to her.  Here’s the line of code that does it:  defaultStatus=”Here’s your “ +color+ “ background and “ +txtcolor+ “ text”  It follows the same format as the document.write statement, with text surrounded by dou- ble quotation marks and return variables surrounded by plus signs, except in this case the text is sent to the status bar.  Your Assignment Okay, your turn. Make a new script—something that adds to your page. I stuck with prompts and variables for my example.  If you want to, may I suggest creating a Mad-Lib party game? It’s that game where you’re asked for a noun, a verb, a state, and things like that. Then, you read the sentence you cre- ated using those words. And you know from playing it that the sentence never makes any sense.  It would be your first JavaScript game.  For my brand-new script, I created a button that, when clicked, displays the current date and time. It’s rather simple.  You should try the Mad-Lib game or something even more helpful.   You can see a possible answer to making the button that shows the date and time by click- ing Lesson Sixteen Assignment in your download packet, or see it online at http:  www. htmlgoodies.com JSBook assignment16.html.  86   Chapter 4  Flipping Images and Opening Windows with Mouse Events  This chapter contains the following lessons and scripts:  Lesson 17: An Image Flip Using onMouseOver and Preloading Images Lesson 18: An Image Flip with a Function Lesson 19: Opening New Windows Lesson 20: Opening a Window with a Function Lesson 21: The confirm Method, with an Introduction to if and else Lesson 22: The Fourth End-of-Chapter Review—Some Jumping Jacks  Up to this point, each of the JavaScripts you’ve built has dealt with altering, changing, or writing text to the page. Sure, there’s been some color, but there has to be more than text manipulation in JavaScript. In this chapter, you’ll start to look at manipulating images, opening new windows, and offering users a choice, rather than simply taking information from them.  Lesson 17: An Image Flip Using onMouseOver and Preloading Images An image flip is a great effect. Some people call it a mouse rollover or an image rollover. The user rolls her mouse pointer over an image, and it changes to a new image. When the mouse leaves the image, the image changes back. It’s a very popular event on the Web.   JavaScript Goodies  This example goes back to the use of the onMouseOver and onMouseOut event handlers. You use the event handler to affect not only text, but also the space the image is sitting in. Here’s the script:  <A HREF=”http:  www.cnn.com” onMouseOver=”document.pic1.src=’menu1on.gif’” onMouseOut=”document.pic1.src=’menu1off.gif’”>     It’ll take two figures to show you this one. Take a look at Figures 4.1 and 4.2.  Figure 4.1 The page looks like this when the mouse is off  the image.  You can see the effect on your own computer by clicking Lesson Seventeen Example in  your download packet, or see it online at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com JSBook  lesson17example.html.  In this example—and the ones that follow, for that matter—the images are all the same size. You don’t need to use same-size images for your image flips, but it’s a good idea. It really heightens the look.  Notice again that there is no need for the   and   tags. You’re using event handlers again. The JavaScript onMouseOver and onMouseOut events are built into an    HTML flag, so not only is this an image flip, it’s also a hypertext link.  Also notice that by including BORDER=”0” in the   tag, no link box appears around the image.  88   Chapter 4 ➤ Flipping Images and Opening Windows with Mouse Events  Figure 4.2 When the mouse is on  the image, the message changes.  Deconstructing the Script From what you already know about event handlers, you should be able to go a long way toward picking this one apart by yourself. When the mouse is off the image space, the image menu1off.gif is displayed. That’s the image displayed when the page first loads; it’s also the image called for in the   flag. When the mouse is on the image, the menu1on.gif image is shown.  The NAME Attribute Notice the   flag has been given a NAME= attribute. In this example, the name given to the image—or more correctly, the space the image is occupying—is pic1.  That NAME= attribute becomes quite important if you want to put multiple image flips on the same page. For every new image flip you put on the page, you must choose a different name for the new image space. Here’s an example of three image flips in a row:  <A HREF=”http:  www.htmlgoodies.com” onMouseOver=”document.pic1.src=’menu1on.gif’” onMouseOut=”document.pic1.src=’menu1off.gif’”>      <A HREF=”http:  www.developer.com” onMouseOver=”document.pic2.src=’menu1on.gif’” onMouseOut=”document.pic2.src=’menu1off.gif’”>      89   JavaScript Goodies  <A HREF=”http:  www.javagoodies.com” onMouseOver=”document.pic3.src=’menu1on.gif’” onMouseOut=”document.pic3.src=’menu1off.gif’”>      Not only were the links changed to new locations, but notice also that all the names were changed, both in the   and in the hierarchy statements.  The Hierarchy Statement The name of the space the image is sitting in, pic1 in this case, is referenced in the hier- archy statement referenced by the onMouseOver and onMouseOut statements. The hierarchy statement, document.pic1.src, reads this way:  window is implied. You could have written this with the object window at the begin- ning, but as you read in Lesson 13 in Chapter 3, “Manipulating Data and the Hierarchy of JavaScript,” it is not necessary. JavaScript simply assumes all that is going on is going on inside a browser window. document refers to the current HTML document object. pic1 is the name of the space the image will occupy. You swap out images within a space occupied by an image, and you make up that NAME and stick it in the   flag. src is a property of the image object that enables you to load a new image into the current image’s space.  When the mouse passes over the space occupied by the image, the onMouseOver event han- dler springs into action, replacing the menu1off.gif image with the menu1on.gif image.  The process might take a second or two to allow the image that will display to be loaded into the browser. But you can cut down on that time by preloading the image.  Preloading Images Through JavaScript, you can set up code that downloads images into the user’s browser cache for later use. Using the previous image flip code, the menu1off.gif image loads to the cache because it is being called for by the HTML document in the  .  If the term cache is new to you, here’s what’s so great about it: The cache is a section of your hard drive, set aside by your browser, so it can store files after it has displayed them for you. Have you noticed how much faster a page loads after you’ve first seen it? That’s because the browser is not reading the images and text from the server anymore. It is read- ing them from your hard drive.  90   Chapter 4 ➤ Flipping Images and Opening Windows with Mouse Events  By pre-caching, or preloading, images for your user, when she starts to use the image flip, the browser works quickly the first time without having to contact the server again for the image it wants to display. It’s a very clever way of doing things.  Here, you need to call for the menu1on.gif to load into the cache with the rest of the page. Then, when the image flip is called for, the menu1on.gif is there ready and waiting to be posted. The flips will go much faster the first time around because the browser isn’t waiting for the server to be contacted and the new image to be loaded.  Here’s the code that performs the preload:     Image1= new Image 200,200   Image1.src = “menu1on.gif”     The preload occurs thanks to a completely different script from the image flip. The format follows this pattern:  Image1 = new Image 200,200  assigns a variable name to a new image that is 200 pix- els wide by 200 tall. The script doesn’t know what the image is yet; it just knows that now the image will be brought into the cache under that variable name. Image1.src = “menu1on.gif” tells the JavaScript the source, or path, to find the image.  The preceding JavaScript loads the image into the browser cache under the variable name Image1. But the name used to pull the image into the cache becomes immaterial because you never call for the image by that variable name. You call for it only by its true, or literal, name: menu1on.gif.  The purpose of the preceding JavaScript is to load the image to the browser cache, period. The variable names assigned mean nothing past a format you must use to get that behind- the-scenes download to occur.  Let’s say you had multiple images to download. Again, the variable names don’t matter, so you might as well just keeping adding one to the variable name Image1. Preloading three images might look like this:     Image1= new Image 200,200  Image1.src = “menu1on.gif”  91   JavaScript Goodies  Image2= new Image 125,15  Image2.src = “line.gif”  Image3= new Image 20,10  Image3.src = “button.gif”    Notice each new two-line command group is given a new variable name and a new image to preload. The height and width parameters have also changed to fit the image.  Put this script between the   flags in your script, and the preloaded images should be waiting in the cache when your user tries the image flips for the first time.  Your Assignment Take this sample code and add a few comments so that when the mouse is on the image, the status bar reads, Oh, Click it! Then, when the mouse is off the image, the status bar should read, Click to go!  Here’s a hint: return true.

Lesson 18: An Image Flip with a Function Here is another example of onMouseOver and onMouseOut event handlers being used to create an image flip effect. But this time, instead of including the JavaScript statements to swap pictures in the   tag, the event is called for in a function.  To show you where each of the parts should be placed on your page, this display includes the entire HTML document format:       Javascript Example 18    function up   { document.mypic.src=”up.gif” } function down   { document.mypic.src=”down.gif”  92   Chapter 4 ➤ Flipping Images and Opening Windows with Mouse Events  }          Sample Animation  <A HREF=http:  www.htmlgoodies.com onMouseOver=”up  ” ➥ onMouseOut=”down  ”; return true>         It’s a simple image flip animation with onMouseOver and onMouseOut event handlers in a function. In the example, if you mouse over and out quickly, this looks like an animation of a stick figure doing jumping jacks.  Andree did the artwork shown in Figures 4.3 and 4.4. I take no responsibility for that.  Figure 4.3 The stick figure stands up straight when the mouse is off the image.  You can see the man  I think it’s a man  doing jumping jacks on your own computer by clicking Lesson Eighteen Example in your download packet, or see it online at http:   www.htmlgoodies.com JSBook lesson18example.html.  There aren’t a whole lot of external words on the page. I just took the preceding code and pasted it into an HTML document.  93   JavaScript Goodies  Figure 4.4 The figure does a jumping jack when the mouse is on the image.  Deconstructing the Script In this example you are calling for two different images, so you need two separate func- tions. Here’s what they look like:    function up   { document.mypic.src=”up.gif” } function down   { document.mypic.src=”down.gif” }    Look again at the format for creating a function.  The command function is followed immediately by the name of the function followed by the two parentheses. In this case, the parentheses are empty because you are passing noth- ing to the function. Later in the book, we’ll discuss putting parameters into the parenthe- ses so that information can be passed to the function. The commands that make up the function are housed within left and right braces  {} .  94   Chapter 4 ➤ Flipping Images and Opening Windows with Mouse Events  The functions are equal to the statements used in the previous JavaScript lesson on image flips. Remember the hierarchy statements? Here the function contains the statements, rather than adding them into the   flag.  The format for the hierarchy statement is document, and then comes the NAME assigned to the image space, and finally the SRC path to the image.  The two functions were named up   and down  . The names could have been just about anything, but we used these two because of the actual position of the man doing jumping jacks.  Calling for the Function Now let’s look at the call for the function:  <A HREF=”http:  www.htmlgoodies.com” onMouseOver=”up  ” ➥ onMouseOut=”down  ”; return true>     The format is close to that used in Lesson 15  see Chapter 3 , but a function is called on here, rather than the hierarchy statement being included in the HREF command itself.  By calling for the function name following onMouseOver and onMouseOff, in effect, what is included in the function statements is replaced with the function name.  The code onMouseOver=”up  ” basically means this:  onMouseOver=”document.mypic.src=’up.gif’”  More Than One Image Flip Remember from Lesson 17, earlier in this chapter, that if you want to create multiple image flips on a page, you must continue using new NAME= attributes to separate each image space in the browser’s mind? It’s the same thing here, except now you must create whole new function names in addition to new NAME= attributes.  For example, suppose you want to place on the page another JavaScript image flip, similar to the first example. You would create two new functions by copying and pasting the same functions shown earlier and altering the function name. The easiest and quickest method is to add the number 2.  Then, you also have to change the NAME=. So, you change the name to mypic2. But be sure you change the name of the image space every time it appears.  95   JavaScript Goodies  Now you get code that looks like this in the HEAD commands:    function up   { document.mypic.src=”up.gif” } function down   { document.mypic.src=”down.gif” } function up2   { document.mypic2.src=”upagain.gif” } function down2   { document.mypic2.src=”downagain.gif” }    You also get code like the following to call for the two different images:  <A HREF=”http:  www.htmlgoodies.com” onMouseOver=”up  ” ➥ onMouseOut=”down  ”; return true>     <a href=”http:  www.htmlgoodies.com” onMouseOver=”up2  ” ➥ onMouseOut=”down2  ”; return true>     See how the new functions are linked to a specific image space through the NAME=, and all the image space names were changed? Follow that process every time you add a new image flip, and you can put hundreds on the same page. Well, maybe not hundreds—just about 100 will probably do the trick.  Preloading Those Images Keep in mind that you can help your viewer along by preloading the images that will be called for in the flip.  Here again is the format:     Image1= new Image 200,200   96   Chapter 4 ➤ Flipping Images and Opening Windows with Mouse Events  Image1.src = “menu1on.gif”     It’ll help your user greatly because she won’t be sitting around waiting.  Your Assignment First, you need to get four images. If you can supply them, that’s great. If not, I have four for you at  http:  www.htmlgoodies.com JSBook img1.gif  http:  www.htmlgoodies.com JSBook img2.gif  http:  www.htmlgoodies.com JSBook img3.gif  http:  www.htmlgoodies.com JSBook img4.gif  Download them into your computer. Use the function and code shown earlier to make img1.gif and img2.gif to create an image flip, and then get img3.gif and img4.gif to do an image flip. You will create two image flips from the preceding code.  TIP Watch the order in which you put the images in the function. You’ll know you have it right when you roll your pointer over the image and it flips correctly. If it stays flipped, you’re out of order.

Lesson 19: Opening New Windows This is the first of two lessons about opening a new window through JavaScript. This first new-window lesson deals with the JavaScript commands you would use to open a new window that displays a second HTML document.  Let’s get started with a basic script:    window.open ‘opened.html’,’joe’,config=’height=300,width=300’     The script’s effect appears in Figure 4.5.  97   JavaScript Goodies  Figure 4.5 The script opens a new window.  You can try the script yourself by clicking Lesson Nineteen Script’s Effect in your download packet, or see it online at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com JSBook lesson19example.html.  NOTE This script only opens the window. The links that appear in the new window were written on the HTML page that filled the new window, but what about those links in the new window? They’re functional, too.  If you look at this example in your download packet or online, you’ll see that a link in the little window loads a new page in the big window, and then you’ll see a link closes the lit- tle window. It’s like fireworks at a fairground. You can even say “Oooo” and “Ahhh,” if the mood strikes you.  I’ll get to those links in the little window and how they are written to control the main window, as well as how to close the window itself, later in this chapter.  Deconstructing the Script Let’s start by talking about the placement of this script in your HTML document. Until now, I have always said it’s good to place scripts up high in the document so they can run early in the page load. When you’re dealing with a function, the script goes up in the head commands. Here, I would like to make a different suggestion.  98   Chapter 4 ➤ Flipping Images and Opening Windows with Mouse Events  If you’re going to open a second window, put the commands that do it down pretty low in the HTML document. In fact, make them last. The reasoning is simple: The page loads— then the new window pops up. If you have the commands first, the new window pops up before the viewer gets to see what’s there in the big window. There’s also a greater chance that the user will close the little window before it can be used.  That’s just my opinion, of course. You can actually place this script anywhere in the docu- ment you want. It’ll run from wherever it sits. I just think the order of the window pop- ping last is more beneficial to your viewers.  Let’s look at the basic window-opening code again:    window.open ‘opened.html’,’joe’,config=’height=300,width=300’     The code window.open couldn’t be more blatant. window is the object, and open is the method that acts on it. That’s the easy part. Now you get to configure the window.  Configuring the Window This is all that good stuff in the instance of the command  that’s the parentheses, remem- ber? . Here’s the format you need to follow:   ‘URL of document in window’, ‘New Window Name’, config=’New Window Parameters’   Here’s the command from the script with the current elements:   ‘opened.html’, ‘joe’, config=’height=300,width=300’   opened.html is the URL of the page that will appear in the new window. If the page is from your server, or in a different directory, you’ll need to add the http:   stuff or a directory path so the browser can find it. joe is the name of the new window. This will be important in a moment. config= means that what follows will configure the window. Currently, there are only a couple of configuration settings—the height and the width of the window—but there are many more window parameters you can set.  The Config Commands The config commands in this script open a new window that is 300 pixels wide by 300 pixels tall.  Numerous features work under the config= command. height and width are two you already know. They work by adding the number wide by number tall in pixels. The remainder of  99   JavaScript Goodies  these commands all work using yes or no, depending on whether or not you want to include the element in your page. Remember that even if you use every one of these attrib- utes, you should be sure to run them all together just as you did the height and width in the sample script. A space equals an error. Here are the Config commands and what they do:  toolbar=—The toolbar is the line of buttons at the top of the browser window that contains Back, Forward, Stop, Reload, and other buttons. menubar=—The menu bar is the line of items labeled File, Edit, View, Go, and so on, which gives the user access to menus of options. scrollbars=—I wouldn’t make a new window that would need scrollbars. I think it kills the effect. resizable=—Denotes whether the user can change the size of the window by drag- ging the window’s resize area. location=—The location bar is the space at the top of the browser window where the page URL is displayed. directories=—This is the bar at the top of the Netscape browser window that has the bookmarks and such. status=—Denotes whether the window will contain a status bar.  Here’s an example of what code would look like using some of these commands:   ‘opened.html’, ‘joe’, config=’height=300,width=300, ➥toolbar=no,menubar=0,status=1’   You should notice that for the toolbar, no is used because we didn’t want one. For the menu bar and status bars, we used 0 and 1. Which is right?  Well, you can use either. Remember that JavaScript counts everything … and … it starts counting from 0. To JavaScript, 0 means no, and 1 means yes.  Of course, you can always use the words yes and no. I just wanted to make you aware that, once again, JavaScript was counting and it was counting up from 0.  What About the Title Bar? In case you’re wondering whether you can lose the title bar, and apparently you are, the answer is no. That’s a given. You get it, like it or not.  Tags in the New Window The new window that pops up can be more than a frame for the HTML document that is posted inside. As you can see from the new window in this lesson’s example, I made the background a nice greenish-blue. Also, there were two links.  100   Chapter 4 ➤ Flipping Images and Opening Windows with Mouse Events  The first link opens the HTML Goodies site in the main window. This is the code that makes it happen:      Whether you know it or not, the big window has a name, main. There’s no need for you to name it main—that’s already done from the start for you. It’s the default name of the big window. In fact, it has two names: parent and opener. If you use either one of them as the target, the output of the hypertext link in the new window will display in the big window. It’s another little extra from the friendly folks at JavaScript, Inc.  Netscape, actually. It invented JavaScript.   All I did was add the command TARGET=”--” to the   flag and enter parent to indi- cate where the page should load.  But what if you wanted the page to load in the small window? In that case, you would add nothing. You should know from basic HTML that any hypertext link, by default, loads into its own window. Just make a link to appear in the little window and when your user clicks, the page will display in the little window.  Multiple Windows You can actually have multiple windows by adding multiple window.open commands. Just be sure to give each window a different name. Then, you can have links from window to window, as long as you continue to target the links correctly.  Suppose you have this code on your main window page:    window.open ‘opened.html’,’joe’,config=’height=300,width=300’      window.open ‘nextopened.html’,’andree’, config=’height=300,width=300’     Two windows will pop up. Then, as long as you set the links correctly, you could target links from one window to the next. This HTML code, which shows up in the small window named joe, would target a link to open in the second small window named andree:   Click   As long as you keep the names straight, you can target your links to the main window or any one of the smaller windows that have opened.  101   JavaScript Goodies  Closing the Window In the original example for this lesson, the second link on the new window closed it. Here’s the format to do that:   Click To Close   It’s a basic   link that points to nothing. See the empty quotation marks following the HREF=? Setting the link to point to nothing disallows another page to load. The com- mand that actually closes the window is onClick=”self.close  ”.  self is a property of window, whereas the command close is a method that does the dirty work.  Some people would rather their windows not be closed by a simple link. They believe a button looks much more official, and there’s some merit in that. If you would rather use a button to close your window, here’s the code:         One More Thing—Opening the Window on Call Let’s say you wanted to open a window on command rather than just having it simply happen when the person logs in. Try this:     function openIt   { window.open ‘000.html’, ‘joe’, config=’height=300,width=300’ ; }     Click to open New window   It’s a small function that contains the commands to open a new window. I only have the height and width in there, but any of the config commands will fit.  Then, a basic hypertext link is set to enact “javascript”. That JavaScript command is an onClick that triggers the function. I know I say that usually functions sit up in the HEAD for the document, whereas the HTML that calls for them sits in the BODY. If you want to set this code up that way, fine; the browser won’t care. I, however, simply drop the whole block of code—function and all—right where I want the link to go.  102   Chapter 4 ➤ Flipping Images and Opening Windows with Mouse Events  You just need to be sure that the function sits above the link in the code. If you keep the format shown previously, you’ll have no troubles.  Your Assignment I didn’t get a chance to show you all the extra little functions that are available in action. So, your assignment is to write a script that opens a new window incorporating every one of these features:  Make the window 300 pixels tall by 500 pixels wide. Include a location bar and a status bar. Don’t include a toolbar, menu bar, scrollbar, or directories. Make the new window resizable.  There should be two links:  One opens a new page in the main window. The second page opens a new page in the same window. The second page that opens in the small window should have the links to close the window.  Oh, and make the background yellow  ffff00 .

Lesson 20: Opening a Window with a Function In Lesson 19, earlier in this chapter, you opened a new window using the window.open com- mand. That window was then filled with a different HTML document you named in the instance.  Here, you’ll create a new window function where the new window, and all its contents, will be carried along in the same HTML document. It is literally the equivalent of two pages in one.  Lessons 17 and 18 discussed preloading images for your image flips. Think of this as pre- loading a second page. Here’s the sample script:    function openindex   {  103   JavaScript Goodies  var OpenWindow=window.open “”, “newwin”, “height=300,width=300” ; OpenWindow.document.write “ ”  OpenWindow.document.write “ New Window ”  OpenWindow.document.write “ ”  OpenWindow.document.write “ ”  OpenWindow.document.write “  New Window  ”  OpenWindow.document.write “ ”  OpenWindow.document.write “This will open  in the main window  ”  OpenWindow.document.write “   ”  OpenWindow.document.write “  ➥ This closes the window  ”  OpenWindow.document.write “ ”  OpenWindow.document.write “ ”  }    And in the BODY command is this code:  onLoad=”openindex  ”  The script’s effect is exactly the same as in Lesson 19, as you can see in Figure 4.6. The same size window opens and contains the same two links. The difference is that it was all done with one page.  Figure 4.6 This script opens a new window.  104   Chapter 4 ➤ Flipping Images and Opening Windows with Mouse Events  You can try the script yourself by clicking Lesson Twenty Script’s Effect in your download packet, or see it online at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com JSBook lesson20example.html.  Deconstructing the Script The main script, the code between the   and   that contains the function, is placed between the   and  , as are most functions.  The function is named openindex  , in the normal fashion.  Then, the braces surround what the function will do when called on.  Now we get to the meat of the script. The variable OpenWindow is created to represent the window.open “instance”  command. It looks like this:  var OpenWindow=window.open “”, “newwin”, “height=300,width=300’ ;  The format is familiar. The only real difference is that there is no URL writing the first set of quotation marks. See the empty double quotation marks? They tell the browser to look to the script to find the new window information, rather than looking for another page somewhere on the server.  It’s very similar to not placing a URL in the command that closed the window. It wouldn’t close if it had something to load. Same here—it wouldn’t look to the script if it had some- thing else to load.  Now you start to build the HTML page that will go inside the new window. Here’s the first line of text:  OpenWindow.document.write “ ”   This format should also look somewhat familiar. The command is saying that this line of text should be written on the variable OpenWindow  the new window .  Look back at the full script. That format is followed again and again, writing line after line of text. There’s no reason there can’t be hundreds of lines of text creating a fully function- ing HTML document.  I would suggest again that you pay close attention to the double and single quotation mark patterns.  Finally, the function is triggered in the BODY command through an onLoad event handler.  105   JavaScript Goodies  Getting the Window on Call Maybe you don’t want this window to open when the page loads. The effect might be bet- ter if the page opened when the user clicked a link or a button.  You would follow the same patterns outlined in Lesson 19, except here the user’s click would activate the function rather than call for a new window.  Here’s the format for a hypertext link that opens the window:   Click To Open ‘joe’   And here’s the code for the button:         Your Assignment For this assignment, you’ll create a window that opens using a function. Please make the document that appears in the window have a green background.  In addition, make the TITLE command read Hello user name - Here is your window! You can gather the user’s name through a prompt. Of course, make a link that closes the win- dow.  The big concern now is where to put the prompt. Think about when you want it to appear. If you want the prompt to appear when the user first enters the page, put it in the docu- ment outside the function. If you want the prompt to appear when the new window is called for, put it in the function. Put it first in the function.

Lesson 21: The confirm   Method, with an Introduction to if and else The confirm   method acts very much like the alert   method, except confirm   adds a Cancel button to the dialog box. You should use alert   to simply pass along information to the user. confirm   is best for when you want some feedback.  If you use the confirm   method by itself, it doesn’t do much except post the OK and Cancel buttons. No matter which button you choose, you go in.  106   Chapter 4 ➤ Flipping Images and Opening Windows with Mouse Events  Add the if and else commands, and you start to get some neat effects.  First, let’s look at the basic format. This script doesn’t do much:    confirm “Are you sure you want to enter?”     Look familiar? It should. It’s the same format as an alert  , except the word confirm is used instead of alert. Figure 4.7 shows an example of what this little script does.  Figure 4.7 The script displays a  confirm box.  You can try the confirm box yourself by clicking Lesson Twenty-One Script’s Effect One in your download packet, or see it online at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com JSBook  lesson21example.html.  As you saw, if you looked, no matter which button you click, you got to see the page load.  Now here’s the same script with some new additions:    if  confirm “Are you sure you want to enter Effect Two?”    { location.href=’lesson21effect2c.html’ alert “Good choice”  } else {  107   JavaScript Goodies  alert “Then you’ll stay right here”  }    Figure 4.8 The confirm box after clicking OK.  You can see what you get in Figure 4.8. The effect works best if you are coming from another page to see it. When you open the page listed previously, you’ll get a link. Click the link, and then you’ll see the effect.  You can try the second confirm box yourself by clicking Lesson Twenty-One Script’s Effect Two in your download packet, or see it online at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com  JSBook lesson21effect2.html.  Now we’re getting somewhere. Here’s a link that asks you whether you want to enter. Except this time, if you click OK, you’ll enter the site. If you click Cancel, you won’t.  Three pages are actually involved in the effect:  The page with the Click To Go! link. The page that contains the confirm script. This page displays if the user clicks Cancel. In the preceding example, if this page loads, the text “Chicken!” shows up. The page that displays if the user clicks OK. This is the page URL in the confirm script.  Try the script again. See whether you can pick out the three pages.  108   Chapter 4 ➤ Flipping Images and Opening Windows with Mouse Events  Deconstructing the Script The process of the script is quite logical, as is all JavaScript. First, the script makes the state- ment:  if  confirm “Are you sure you want to enter HTML Goodies?”     The if means, “Here is your chance to make a choice.”  Before going on, look at the multiple uses of parentheses. The if statement always has an instance, and that means parentheses. But you also know that confirm  , too, has paren- theses. That’s fine. Just use the parentheses like you normally would, and you’ll get the pre- vious look. Notice how the parentheses from the if command simply surround the entire confirm   method, including its parentheses. Let’s get back to the script.  Because this is a choice, options are available. In this case, a confirm   method is used to offer two choices—OK and Cancel. I think of them as yes and no.  Immediately following the if statement are the commands to be carried out for each choice. Please notice the commands are encased inside those lovely little braces  {} . Because curly brackets are involved, you might think that what is encased is a function. I guess if you want to think of it that way, that’s fine, but technically it isn’t. That’s just the format of an if statement. The commands in the first set of braces are what should happen if the user clicks OK:  { location.href=’lesson21effect2c.html’ alert “Good choice”  }  The line location.href creates a link. If that’s the choice the user makes, you have a basic alert proclaiming Good Choice.  But what if the user clicks Cancel? You already know that the commands that immediately follow the if statement are what occur if the user clicks OK.  Notice that right after the first set of braces ends, the word else pops up.  Think of the command else as meaning if not. So, the code  else { alert “Then you’ll stay right here”  }  means if not, post the alert message and do not change the page.  109   JavaScript Goodies  Put it all together, and you get the effect of giving the user a choice—enter or don’t enter. And you’ve also set up an event to occur either way.  Your Assignment Don’t get nervous! You can do this. Your assignment is to turn the commands discussed here into a function. Oh, and make it so that when the user chooses not to go in, not only does the alert pop up, but the status bar of the window reads Chicken!  If you really want to be fancy, when the person clicks OK, make the page open up on a new window.  To see a possible answer on your own computer, click Lesson Twenty-One Assignment in your download packet, or see it online at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com JSBook  assignment21.html.  By the way, to see the answer, you actually have to click the Cancel button. Sorry about the “Chicken!” in the status bar. I mean it in the nicest way.  Lesson 22: The Fourth End-of-Chapter Review—Some Jumping Jacks The scripts and commands in this chapter are real crowd pleasers, so this should be a pret- ty good end-of-chapter wrap-up.  The following lists the commands you’ve learned so far. Read them over and start thinking about how you could use them to create something new and functional to use on your pages.  Table 4.1 contains the object-related JavaScript commands we’ve discussed. In addition, you’ve been introduced to these other JavaScript concepts:  The alert  , confirm  , and prompt   methods The if else conditional statement These event handlers: onBlur, onChange, onClick, onDblClick, onFocus, onKeyDown, onKeyPress, onKeyUp, onLoad, onMouseDown, onMouseMove, onMouseOut, onMouseOver, onMouseUp, and onSubmit The HTML 4.0 flag   Creating variable names Creating a function  110   Chapter 4 ➤ Flipping Images and Opening Windows with Mouse Events  Table 4.1 Object-Related JavaScript Commands Demonstrated in Chapters 1–4 Object date  Properties  Methods getDate  , getDay  , getHours  , getMinutes  , getMonth  , getSeconds  , getYear   write    go    document  history location navigator  window  close    alinkColor, bgColor, fgColor, linkColor, lastModified, location, referrer, title, vlinkColor length host, hostname, href appCodeName, appName, appVersion, userAgent defaultstatus, directories, location, menubar, resizable, self, scrollbars, status, toolbar  Here’s a script that puts some of the JavaScript commands to work:    <INPUT TYPE=”button” VALUE=”Jump!” onClick=”document.jj.src=’up.gif’, window.status=’Put me down!’; return true”> <INPUT TYPE=”button” VALUE=”Stop” ➥ onClick=”document.jj.src=’down.gif’, window.status=’Thank you!’”>?      We’re using Andree’s wonderful artwork again for this one. You already know how to make the jumping jack images work as an image flip. This script enables your user to decide when the person jumps by clicking form buttons, as you can see in Figure 4.9. Better yet, the little image yells at the person clicking the buttons in the status bar.  You can try the manual jumping jacks yourself by clicking Lesson Twenty-Two Script’s Effect One in your download packet, or see it online at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com JSBook  lesson22effect.html.  111   JavaScript Goodies  Figure 4.9 Manual jumping jacks.  Deconstructing the Script What you’ve got here is basically something that’s fun. Stop and think about the uses of changing an image when a click occurs. You could make one of the images a solid color— for example, the same color as the background so that when the user clicks, it appears as if the image comes up out of nowhere.  You could use one of the buttons as a link and have the image change when the user clicks. It would be great for clicks where the user stays at the same page. A link to a file to be downloaded is a good example.  The concept I want to get across here is that images and the items that control them do not have to be in the same HTML flag like the image flips.  As long as you keep the names equal in the hierarchy statements, you can separate the but- tons and the images completely, as has been done here.  Let’s break it down.  The Form Buttons The code for the form buttons looks like this:    <INPUT TYPE=”button” VALUE=”Jump!” onClick=”document.jj.src=’up.gif’, window.status=’Put me down!’; return true”>  112   Chapter 4 ➤ Flipping Images and Opening Windows with Mouse Events  <INPUT TYPE=”button” VALUE=”Stop” ➥onClick=”document.jj.src=’down.gif’; window.status=’Thank you!’”>?    The only reason one   and one   flag are used to make the two buttons is because that allows the buttons to sit on the same line. If separate   and   flags were used for each button, they would have stacked on top of each other.  Changing the Image Here’s the code that creates the image flip:  onClick=”document.jj.src=’up.gif’  You should recognize the onClick event handler by now, but the hierarchy statement might still be a little new. Let’s take it piece by piece, biggest to smallest, left to right:  document is the HTML document the buttons and images sit on. jj is the name you have assigned to the image command. src stands for the source of the image. After an equal sign, the image name—or URL if necessary—is written in.  The Text in the Status Bar The text in the status bar is produced at the same time as the click, so you get that  window.status command right next to the onClick event handler, separated by a comma.  It looks like this:  , window.status=’Put me down!’; return true”  The return true statement ensures the text will act only when the click occurs.  The second button is put together the same way, but is calling for the original image. Thus, it appears you are putting the jumping jacks man down.  The Image The image code should look pretty familiar:     The NAME attribute is used to connect this image with the buttons that sit just above it. In the hierarchy statement in the buttons, the name jj was used. Here you can see how jj was connected to the image.  113   JavaScript Goodies  Now, see whether you can think of a few more interesting ways to use the button to image link. There have to be a hundred good things that can come out of my giggling at the little stick figure screaming for me to stop.  Your Assignment As always, your assignment is to look over the commands you’ve learned and create some- thing new, interesting, and functional to put on your Web page. But as always, I make a suggestion.  Can you alter the confirm   script in Lesson 21 so that when the user clicks Cancel, he is taken back one page?  That way, the user would go back to where he came from, rather than to the page that con- tains the script loading. Try it.

Lesson 24: Passing Information to the Function Lesson 25: Calling Functions with Forms Lesson 26: Form Fields and the Value Property Lesson 27: Pull-Down Menu of Links Lesson 28: A Guestbook with All the Bells and Whistles Lesson 29: The Fifth End-of-Chapter Review—Posting Link Descriptions While Users Pass Over  Until this point, you have gathered information from the user mostly through a prompt. This chapter looks at using JavaScript commands along with HTML form flags. Users will be able to enter their data into form fields and send the results along to you or use the form elements as new methods of choosing links.  I should state here that the following forms are all simply mailto: format scripts. We have not gone as far as attaching the output of the script to a CGI, as is commonplace today.  I mention that because Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator handle mailto: forms dif- ferently. Netscape browsers enable you to submit a mailto: form and have the information   JavaScript Goodies  sent to an e-mail address as a packet. Internet Explorer, on the other hand, most likely opens a new mail message in whatever mail program you’re using.  Supposedly, IE 4.0 and better act on forms as Netscape does, but the user must have filled out all the mail preferences for it to work. You can’t always be sure of that.  The possibilities of what you can do with JavaScript and HTML forms are endless. Just remember that when using a form to submit information, IE users might have some trouble.  Lesson 23: What Is Written in the Text Box? When you are dealing with form elements, there are three basic JavaScript events you want to be able to perform:  Extract the information from the fields so you can use it for other purposes. Display information in a form element. Send the information to yourself via e-mail.  This lesson deals with the first event. Someone has written something into a form field on your HTML document, and now you want to extract and display back to that person what she wrote in the field.  In this lesson, pay close attention to how the form elements are named and the format of the JavaScript hierarchy statement. Those two elements are, by far, the most important con- cepts in this lesson—and possibly this chapter.  The sample script is being displayed in full HTML format to show the placement of the ele- ments:       Lesson 23    function readit   { alert “You wrote “ + document.myform.thebox.value + “ in the box.”  }         Write something in the box.         116   Chapter 5 ➤ Forms: A Great Way to Interact with Your Users       In Figure 5.1, I’ve entered my name into the box and clicked the button.  Figure 5.1 Displaying text box data.  To see the effect on your own computer click Lesson Twenty-Three Script’s Effect in your download packet, or see it online at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com JSBook  lesson23effect.html.  Deconstructing the Script When you start working with forms, the uses of the hierarchy statement and NAME attri- butes become very important. We will move through this script from top to bottom, often referencing from the function to the form elements.  The Function The function’s purpose in this script is to take the information written to the text box and display it as part of an alert   box. It looks like this:    function readit   { alert “You wrote “ + document.myform.thebox.value + “ in the box.”   117   JavaScript Goodies  }    The alert   format should be familiar. The new coding is the longer, more specific hierar- chy statement representing what is written in the box. The hierarchy statement reads like this:  document.myform.thebox.value  Without a more in-depth explanation, now let’s stop and look at the HTML form elements. You need to become familiar with them to understand the hierarchy statement when we discuss it again. The FORM code is as follows:    Write something in the box.         Here is each line of the form and what it means:    is the overriding form command that starts the entire form process. The NAME= attribute gives the entire form a name. You must do this even if only one form is on the page—every form must have an overriding name.   is the name of the form element you are most concerned with. This is the element where I typed in my name. The NAME= attribute in this case gives a name to the form element. Now the form itself has a name, and the form element has a name. It is important that you make that separation in your mind. The form is now named myform, and the specific form element is named thebox.   is the button the user clicked to get the alert. The JavaScript in this button is an event handler that calls on the previous function, onClick=”readit  ”.   ends the HTML form section of the script.  Back to the Hierarchy Statement Here is the hierarchy statement from the function, one more time:  document.myform.thebox.value  Remember that in hierarchy statements, things go from biggest to smallest, left to right. In this case, the hierarchy statement is narrowing down the items on the page until we get to the specific text I typed in the box:  118   Chapter 5 ➤ Forms: A Great Way to Interact with Your Users  document refers to the HTML document sitting inside the browser window. myform is the name of the form on the page. Again, because only one form is on the page, this seems unnecessary, but this is JavaScript. You have to follow the syntax. thebox is the name of the text box form element where I typed in my name. value is the JavaScript representation of what I typed in the box.  Now here’s the entire alert   command from the previous function:  alert “You wrote “ + document.myform.thebox.value + “ in the box.”   The format is very similar to what you did in earlier lessons. You gathered information from the user—usually in the form of a prompt—and then returned that value to the page through an alert   or a document.write.  This is exactly the same method, except you are gathering the text written into a text box through a hierarchy statement pointed right at the value.  The more things change, the more they stay the same.  The Entire Process So, what is happening in this JavaScript?  The function is loaded into the browser’s memory, but nothing is actually done with it. It isn’t needed until the form button is clicked.  After something is typed into the form box, the user then clicks the button.  The button click triggers the function, which starts to post an alert box. However, if the button isn’t clicked, nothing happens. But let’s assume the user clicks the button. The text of the alert box calls for the value of a form element, thebox, inside a form, myform, on the current document.  After that data is retrieved, the alert box is posted—end of JavaScript.  Your Assignment Your assignment should take a little bit of brainpower. Take the preceding script, and add a second text box to it. You’ll have to assign it a NAME, of course.  Then, get the alert button to pop up and read Hello firstname lastname!  You’ll get extra points if you can turn the long hierarchy statements into variable names.

This lesson’s script posts a series of alert boxes that tell you the values in the boxes, change the text to all uppercase, and then change it to all lowercase.  After all the alert boxes have finished, text will show up in a third text box thanking the user for watching the show.  The concept is this: If you can take information out of a form element, you can certainly put it back. Here’s the code:    function readitagain   { var greeting=”Hello “  alert greeting + document.myform.fname.value + “ “ + document.myform.lname.value   alert “length of first name “ + document.myform.fname.value.length   alert “First name in ALL CAPS: “ + document.myform.fname.value.toUpperCase     alert “Full name in all lowercase letters: “ ➥ + document.myform.fname.value.toLowerCase   + “ “ ➥ + document.myform.lname.value.toLowerCase     document.myform.receiver.value=  “Thanks “ + document.myform.fname.value + “.”   }     What is your First Name?    What is your Last Name?       Look Here after Alert Boxes:       Figure 5.2 shows the script’s effect.  You can try the script for yourself by clicking Lesson Twenty-Four Script’s Effect in your down- load packet, or see it online at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com JSBook lesson24effect. html.  120   Chapter 5 ➤ Forms: A Great Way to Interact with Your Users  Figure 5.2 This alert box changes a name to lowercase letters.  Deconstructing the Script Let’s start at the bottom and work our way back up the scale of the script. Here are the four form elements first:    What is your First Name?    What is your Last Name?       Look Here after Alert Boxes:       The entire form has been named myform. That goes first, immediately following  document in the hierarchy statement. The first text box is named fname. It contains the first name, which makes sense. The second text box is named lname. It contains the last name. Again, that’s logical. The input button is the familiar format. It is used to trigger the earlier function you called readitagain  . The third text box is named receiver because it receives something from the func- tion.  Okay, now you know the players, so let’s get to the plays found in the function.  121   JavaScript Goodies  The Alert Boxes Probably the easiest way to break down this script is to look at each element in the func- tion. You might have already noticed that the function is a long list of alerts that run one right after the other.  Finally, there’s a hierarchy statement pointing at something. We’ll look at that last. But first, here are the alerts:  var greeting=”Hello “  alert greeting + document.myform.fname.value + “ “ + document.myform.lname.value   The first alert shown in the preceding code uses a variable greeting to place the word Hello. Do you find it funny that the variable name is longer than the actual word and space it’s representing? Me, too, but all this is to teach, so that’s how we did it.  Then, the first and last name are called for from the text boxes using the full hierarchy statements.  No surprises here:  alert “length of first name “ + document.myform.fname.value.length   Here’s something new. The alert posts the length, in letters, or whatever is entered in the first text box.  You might have taken it from the earlier lesson that value was at the end of the hierarchy food chain when it came to forms. That was true for that lesson, but not for all of JavaScript. value has a couple of properties, actually; its length is just one of them. The JavaScript counts the letters, spaces, and any symbols in the value and posts the number it comes up with.  Luckily, in this case, JavaScript does not start counting at 0.  Once again, you see a familiar hierarchy statement with something stuck on the end of it:  alert “First name in ALL CAPS: “ + document.myform.fname.value.toUpperCase     This statement takes the information from the first name box and changes all the letters to uppercase.  It’s done by attaching the toUpperCase   method on the very end. Please note that toUpperCase   is a method, and you need those parentheses at the end.  If you can change letters to uppercase, it follows logically that you can change them to lowercase:  122   Chapter 5 ➤ Forms: A Great Way to Interact with Your Users  alert “Full name in all lowercase letters: “ ➥ + document.myform.fname.value.toLowerCase   + “ “ ➥ + document.myform.lname.value.toLowerCase     It’s done by following the same formula shown earlier, but you change the method at the end to toLowerCase  . Again, note the parentheses because toLowerCase   is a method.  Writing to the Text Box Now you get to the most interesting part of this script. How did we get that text to show up in the text box? Here’s the line of code that did it:  document.myform.receiver.value=  “Thanks “ + document.myform.fname.value + “.”   The concept is fairly straightforward. When you use the hierarchy statement document.myform.receiver.value as a return, you get the value of the text box returned.  But if you turn the process around and use the hierarchy statement as a target, as is being done in the previous code, the statement places the value rather than returning it.  That’s why the text in the instance pops into the box.  Your Assignment Okay, smart person! Try to do this one:  Create a script that has two prompts. The first prompt asks for a name, whereas the second one asks for a home state. After the two prompts have been filled in, two text boxes and a button should appear. When the user clicks the button, the first text box should read Your name is name. The second box should read You are from state. Both effects should occur with one click of the button.

Lesson 25: Calling Functions with Forms At face value, this lesson’s script might seem rather simple, but its workings are quite new and rather important. Up until now, the functions you created have been stable—they couldn’t be altered by the user.  This script allows your users to pass information from form elements to the function itself before the function runs.  123   JavaScript Goodies  The following script again shows the full HTML document.  Forms always begin with   and end with  . No surprises here yet, just good old HTML!  Here’s the code:        function newcolor color  { alert “You Chose “ + color  document.bgColor=color }        Select a Background Color               As you can see in Figure 5.3, this script uses form buttons to enable users to choose a back- ground color, either blue or pink.  Figure 5.3 Describing the change in color in a message box.  124   Chapter 5 ➤ Forms: A Great Way to Interact with Your Users  You can try the script for yourself by clicking Lesson Twenty-Five Script’s Effect in your down- load packet, or see it online at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com JSBook lesson25effect. html.  Literals We mentioned this term in passing before, but now you can add it to your JavaScript vocabulary. A literal is a data value that appears directly in a program and can be a string in double or single quotation marks, a value, or numbers. Even NULL is considered to be a lit- eral. Just remember that a literal is solid; it can’t be altered.  String A string is any run of letters or numbers within single or double quotation marks. Therefore, the following section from the sample script defines the literal string lightblue:  onClick=”newcolor ‘lightblue’   You might now ask, so what? Well, the so what is this: When you place text into a format like this, it becomes a literal, and you can’t then use the text for something else.  Let’s say you set up this script with literals such as document.title and Date  . You know that you want the page title and the full date returned, but JavaScript doesn’t see it like that. It sees those commands only as text, just as they’re written and not what they would normally represent. Therefore, it displays them as such, and you get Date   written to the page rather than what Date   would normally return.  Go ahead—try it. Drive yourself nuts.  Deconstructing the Script Here are the script’s input items again:  function newcolor color  { alert “You chose “ + color  document.bgColor=color }          125   JavaScript Goodies  Here’s the basic concept: You are passing a literal string, ‘lightblue’ or ‘pink’, to the func- tion newcolor color .  Basically, the function is waiting until it is called on and given the information it needs to perform.  Remember that in all functions up until this point, the parentheses were empty. The func- tion had all the parts it needed. Here, however, it does not have the required parts, and it won’t until someone clicks a button.  Look again at the form button code. The buttons contain the function format in their onClick=, but this time the function has the data it needs: a color command.  Think of it this way: The function line at the top of the script is sitting there with a vari- able name inside the function instance. Here, it’s color. When a user triggers the onClick in the button, the same function name is used. But this time, there is a real color name in the instance, and it is assigned the variable name it replaced—color.  So, how does the JavaScript know that the word color in the original function is only a vari- able name? It doesn’t. In fact, the JavaScript never even looked at it. The function text was loaded into memory, but until it’s triggered by the button, the function never runs.  That’s good to know because we’ve set up a basic template, function  . Every time the user clicks, the function is given a new function   header, but the function   is run with the new value in the parentheses, lightblue or pink.  If you set up your onClicks to include the same text as the function, when the click is made, the onClick function   statement replaces the old function line and assigns the vari- able name to the new string brought up from the button.  Until now, functions were static. They did what they were written to do. Now you can write functions with a function   header and let the user pass along what she wants to happen.  This is a fairly difficult concept to grasp, but look over the script again, and follow its path from the button back up to the top of the function.  Your Assignment Alter the script in this lesson so that you now have three buttons: blue, yellow, and green. Make the same background effect occur, but lose the alert button and post a text box.  When you click one of the color buttons, the background color should change right away and the text box should read You Chose color.  You’ll get bonus points if you change all the variable names to new words.  126   Chapter 5 ➤ Forms: A Great Way to Interact with Your Users  You can see a possible answer to this assignment on your own computer by clicking Lesson Twenty-Five Assignment in your download packet, or see it online at http:  www. htmlgoodies.com JSBook assignment25.html.  Lesson 26: Form Fields and the Value Property This lesson takes the last one a little further. You’ll transfer information into the function again, but this time you’ll transfer a string the user enters into a field. The string will then be used to create a hypertext link and send a search to Yahoo!:    function Gofindit   { var searchfor = document.formsearch.findthis.value; var FullSearchUrl =  “http:  av.yahoo.com bin query?p=” + searchfor ; location.href = FullSearchUrl; }     Search Yahoo for:        Figure 5.4 shows the script in action.  Figure 5.4 The form is ready to search Yahoo!  127   JavaScript Goodies  You can try the script for yourself by clicking Lesson Twenty-Six Script’s Effect in your down- load packet, or see it online at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com JSBook lesson26effect. html.  Deconstructing the Script Do you remember that at the very beginning of this chapter I said there were two main reasons for using forms?  The first reason is to accept and manipulate input from your users. The second is to allow information to be sent back to you or around the Internet.  We have arrived at reason number two.  The Function The function Gofindit   is created in the normal fashion:  function Gofindit   { var searchfor = document.formsearch.findthis.value; var FullSearchUrl =  “http:  av.yahoo.com bin query?p=” + searchfor ; location.href = FullSearchUrl; }  That’s a good title for this one, don’t you think?  Three variables are set up. This is a wonderful example of one variable building from the one before it.  The first assigns searchfor to a hierarchy statement representing the text box where the user will enter his keyword. At this point, assuming everything is correct, you should be able to pick out that the name of the form must be formsearch and the name of the text box must be findthis.  Another variable is created: FullSearchUrl. FullSearchUrl is the address to Yahoo’s search engine, plus the variable you just created representing the value of the text box.  Finally, location.href is assigned FullSearchUrl, which represents the entire URL and input, a string literal, from the user.  By going to all this trouble, you get the entire URL, plus the text input, down to one word that you could easily put with location.href. It’s a very clean form of coding.  The HTML Form Code Let’s move on to the FORM flags. There are two flags this time around. One is a text box that receives a string from the user, and the other is a button that enacts the function.  128   Chapter 5 ➤ Forms: A Great Way to Interact with Your Users  It looks like this:    Search Yahoo for:        The entire form is named formsearch. The TEXT box has been named findthis. But you knew that without looking.  The form button has the onClick=”Gofindit  ” command that triggers the function. Finally, be sure you have a   command to kill the form. Mission accomplished.  What Happens The user enters a literal string to the box and clicks the button to begin the search. The function is triggered, and the value is taken from the text box. The value is attached to the Yahoo! URL, which connects and performs a search. The full URL is assigned a variable name and given to a location.href command. The information is then sent on its way.  Your Assignment Alter the script so that it uses a search engine other than Yahoo! Also, change the script so that when the user clicks, an alert pops up that reads Going to Search....  You might have to go to a different search engine and look at its code to be able to do this assignment.

Lesson 27: Pull-Down Menu of Links Ever since the HTML Goodies Web site first started putting up JavaScript examples, this has been one of the most requested scripts. People just seem to love the look of it. It is nice.  This is a simple drop-down box made with form commands. You select the link you want and click the button to complete the link, as you can see in Figure 5.5:    function LinkUp   { var number = document.DropDown.DDlinks.selectedIndex; location.href = document.DropDown.DDlinks.options[number].value; }  129   JavaScript Goodies          Choose a Link   Page One   Page Two   Page Three         Figure 5.5 Selecting a link from a drop-down list.  You can try the script for yourself by clicking Lesson Twenty-Seven Script’s Effect in your download packet, or see it online at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com JSBook  lesson27effect.html.  Deconstructing the Script Keep two concepts in mind as we go through this deconstruction:  JavaScript counts everything starting at 0. If the HTML form element can’t accept a value, you assign it one.  130   Chapter 5 ➤ Forms: A Great Way to Interact with Your Users  The HTML Form Code We’ll start this from the ground up. Here is the HTML form code:       Choose a Link   Page One   Page Two   Page Three         Let’s get the vitals out of the way first:  The name of the entire form is DropDown. It is a name I assigned it. The name of this SELECT form element is DDlinks. It stands for drop-down links and is a name I assigned. The first OPTION flag is not part of the Links menu simply because I chose to not make it part of the Links menu. The code  Choose a Link displays the text Choose a Link on the drop-down box before it has been clicked. The next three OPTION statements are links. They have been given VALUEs of page.html, page2.html, and page3.html, respectively. Those are the three links the user can choose from. It is important that you see the VALUE is the actual link, and not the text that follows. Because the drop-down link format is not something that accepts data from a viewer, it can’t accept a literal string. But it can have one assigned to it, so that’s what we did.   ends the SELECT drop-down menu box. The button code should be familiar by now. It is set with an onClick trigger to acti- vate the function, which we’ll get to next.   ends the code.  The Function This is where the magic happens. It might look complicated at first, but if you’ve read up to this point, you should have no trouble understanding what’s here. Except for two com- mands, you’ve actually seen it all before. The function is enacted after a choice is made and the user clicks the button triggering it to start. Here’s the function:  function LinkUp   {  131   JavaScript Goodies  var number = document.DropDown.DDlinks.selectedIndex; location.href = document.DropDown.DDlinks.options[number].value; }  The function is called LinkUp  —a name we made up.  First, a variable, number, is created that represents the number of a link in the drop-down menu.  If you follow along in the hierarchy statement from left to right, document is first. Then comes the name of the form itself, DropDown, followed by the name of the form element, DDlinks. Last in the statement is that new thing, selectedIndex.  selectedIndex This is the command that makes it possible to turn this drop-down menu into a series of links.  Remember that JavaScript counts everything and starts at 0. That means the four items in this list have all been assigned a number, 0–3, starting with the first OPTION SELECTED item, even though it will never come into play.  The selectedIndex command enables you to choose one of the items on the list and grab its number. We make it a selected Index. Get it?  Setting Up Link Properties Now that you have a variable set up that represents the number of the item in the drop- down box, you can start setting up the link properties of the JavaScript.  Here’s the code that does that:  location.href = document.DropDown.DDlinks.options[number].value;  You know that location.href means a link, but a link to what? It’s a link to a specific value from the drop-down menu. You know the values are all URLs, so the purpose of this line is to grab a specific value chosen by the user.  It’s done with another hierarchy statement. document leads it off, and it is followed by the name of the form itself, the name of the form element, and then the option.  In this case, think of the user’s option as a property of an array of strings. This drop-down box is as good an array as any other, so you want an option. But which one? The one the user chooses. You know which one he selects because the option is given the number of the choice through the number variable in brackets.  132   Chapter 5 ➤ Forms: A Great Way to Interact with Your Users  So, if the user selects the last option in the drop-down menu, the user gets the number 3 returned to the options property. JavaScript counts everything, starting at 0.  Then the hierarchy gets going and asks for the value of the number returned.  The value is a URL, and the process is complete. The hierarchy link returns a specific value, and the link is performed.  It’s a very clever method of drawing a link out of the drop-down menu and using it to make a connection.  Wait! I’m Getting an Error We missed something, didn’t we? One of the biggest problems you’ll run into when writ- ing a JavaScript that interacts with a user is setting up a contingent for every choice the user makes.  We would love it if all our users would simply select one of the three links and then click. Well, some won’t. Some will simply click without selecting a link. They will click while the text Choose a Link is still showing. If a user clicks while that text is showing, he’ll get an error. Try it yourself.  So, what do you do about it? You set up a plan that will so something if the user clicks that link. The easiest fix is to set a VALUE for the first line and make that value the same page. That way, if the person clicks, the page simply reloads.  The code will look like this:       Choose a Link   Page One   Page Two   Page Three    Later in this book, you’ll write code that’s a little fancier and does more than simply  reload the page.  Your Assignment This is mostly an assignment to see whether you have the ability to keep everything straight.  Using the previous script, copy and paste it a second time on the page. When your page displays, there should be two drop-down boxes: one of them going to links on your site, and one of them going to links off your site.  133   JavaScript Goodies  You know you’re obviously going to need to change the values to change the links, but be careful. You’ll need to change a few other things as well.  Remember to put in a VALUE for each of the elements so that no matter what the user selects, he will not get an error.

Lesson 28: A Guestbook with All the Bells and Whistles Whenever you hear someone talking about forms, it’s a good bet he wants to use the forms to act as a Guestbook for his site.  Most people can get the mail just fine through basic HTML form code, but then they want more, and the Guestbook in this lesson carries every one of the bells and whistles. After you understand it, you can apply only the parts you like to your own site’s Guestbook, or use the whole thing.  This Guestbook is a JavaScript-driven event that opens with two prompts. One asks for the person’s name, and the second asks for the person’s e-mail address.  The Guestbook page then displays. After the user types in the text box and clicks Submit, a second window pops up thanking him for his e-mail, which is written there for him to see.  When the e-mail arrives in your mailbox, the subject line will read Mail from user’s name at user’s e-mail address.  You’ll be the envy of Web designers everywhere.  It actually takes three different scripts and then some HTML form code to make this tech- nique work:    var name = prompt “What is your name?”,”Write It Here”  var email = prompt “What is your email address”, “Write It Here”       function verify   { var OpenWindow=window.open “”, “newwin”, “height=300,width=300” ; OpenWindow.document.write “ ”  OpenWindow.document.write “ Thanks for Writing ”   134   Chapter 5 ➤ Forms: A Great Way to Interact with Your Users  OpenWindow.document.write “ ”  OpenWindow.document.write “ ”  OpenWindow.document.write “Thank you  ” + name + ➥ “  from  ” +email+ “  ”  OpenWindow.document.write “Your message   ” ➥ + document.gbookForm.maintext.value + “  ”  OpenWindow.document.write “from “ + name + “   “ +email+ “ ”  OpenWindow.document.write “will be sent along when you close this window. ”  OpenWindow.document.write “ ”  OpenWindow.document.write “ <INPUT TYPE=’button’ ➥ VALUE=’Close Window’  onClick=’self.close  ’> ”  OpenWindow.document.write “ ”  OpenWindow.document.write “ ”  }      document.write “<FORM METHOD=’post’ ➥ ACTION=’mailto:jburns@sunlink.net?Subject=Mail from “ ➥ +name+ “ at “ +email+ “‘ ENCTYPE=’text plain’ NAME=’gbookForm’>”      What would you like to tell me?            As you can see in Figure 5.6, the Guestbook is set up to send the output to Joe Burns. So, if you want to write me, this is the place to do it. It’s coming to a mailbox set up just for this Guestbook.  You can try the script for yourself by clicking Lesson Twenty-Eight Script’s Effect in your download packet, or see it online at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com JSBook  lesson28effect.html.  Deconstructing the Script There is a lot to this script, so let’s talk about it script by script; then at the end, we’ll put it all together into one working Guestbook package.  135   JavaScript Goodies  Figure 5.6 Results of clicking the Send It button.  The Prompt Script We’ll start where the Guestbook event starts. The first thing that occurs when the page loads is that a couple of prompts pop up asking for your name and e-mail address:    var name = prompt “What is your name?”,”Write It Here”  var email = prompt “What is your email address”, “Write It Here”     There shouldn’t be any surprises here. The prompts are in the traditional format. Just remember that the prompt that asks for the name is assigned the variable name, and the prompt that asks for the e-mail is given the variable email.  Those variable names will become quite important later.  The Verification Window Script This is the script that creates the smaller window that pops up when the user clicks to sub- mit the Guestbook data:    function verify   { var OpenWindow=window.open “”, “newwin”, “height=300,width=300” ; OpenWindow.document.write “ ”   136   Chapter 5 ➤ Forms: A Great Way to Interact with Your Users  OpenWindow.document.write “ Thanks for Writing ”  OpenWindow.document.write “ ”  OpenWindow.document.write “ ”  OpenWindow.document.write “Thank you  ” + name + “  from  ” ➥ +email+ “  ”  OpenWindow.document.write “Your message   ” ➥ + document.gbookForm.maintext.value + “  ”  OpenWindow.document.write “from “ + name + “   “ +email+ “ ”  OpenWindow.document.write “will be sent along when you close this window. ”  OpenWindow.document.write “ ”  OpenWindow.document.write “ <INPUT TYPE=’button’ ➥ VALUE=’Close Window’ onClick=’self.close  ’> ”  OpenWindow.document.write “ ”  OpenWindow.document.write “ ”  }    We used the format from Lesson 20, opening a new window with a function and named the function verify  .  The window opens 300 pixels wide and 300 pixels tall. The background is an off-yellow represented by the hex code ffffcc, and the text in the new window is centered.  Now, we get into how all the relevant text was entered into the window. Remember that you assigned the variables name and email to the information from the two prompts in the first script. Here those returned literal strings come into play. The line  OpenWindow.document.write “Thank you  ” + name + “  from  ” ➥ +email+ “  ”   writes the text Thank you name from e-mail@address.com to the news window. It’s a nice personal touch. Pay close attention to where the double quotation marks fall as well as where the   and   flags come into play.  In the next line, you make the connection with the HTML form items that are yet to come in this deconstruction:  OpenWindow.document.write “Your message   ” ➥ + document.gbookForm.maintext.value + “  ”   Notice first the hierarchy statement that takes the information from the   box.  It starts with a document; then, it calls for a form named gbookForm, a form element named maintext, and finally that form element’s value.  137   JavaScript Goodies  When the HTML in the instance is written to the page, you get the text Your Message fol- lowed by what the user typed in the   box. It’s a very clean effect.  The next lines of code again list the user’s name and e-mail address using the name and email returns from the prompts. That might look like overkill because those two pieces of information were already posted; we put them in, though, because it gave the appearance that the information was posted as a signature.  The next code creates a traditional button that closes the window, and the last two  document.write lines close the HTML document being written to the new window’s page.  The   Flag Script In Chapter 3, “Manipulating Data and the Hierarchy of JavaScript,” Lesson 16 talked about using the input from a user to build a line of HTML. The big concern was that the script must be sitting right where the line of HTML code itself will sit.  That’s what the following code does. A simple document.write line is used to create the main HTML   flag:    document.write “<FORM METHOD=’post’ ➥ ACTION=’mailto:jburns@sunlink.net?Subject=Mail from “ ➥ +name+ “ at “ +email+ “‘ ENCTYPE=’text plain’ NAME=’gbookForm’>”     By doing this, you can use the literal returns from prompts to make the ACTION text actually write the user’s name and e-mail address.  NOTE  Please note that the previous line is truncated into a couple of lines. That’s bad, but the book page just isn’t long enough. When you get this to your page, make sure it all goes on one line.  This was the line in the code that took the longest time to build. Look at all the double and single quotation marks. It gets rather hairy, but we stuck to it, error after error, and got the effect.  As you might have guessed from the previous hierarchy statement, the name of this entire form is gbookForm.  138   Chapter 5 ➤ Forms: A Great Way to Interact with Your Users  The Rest of the FORM Items It’s not written here because the main   flag is in a script by itself, but this is the remainder of the FORM gbookForm:   What would you like to tell me?            The   element is named maintext. This is an HTML tip, but remember that when you use a   box, it requires an end flag.  Look at the button code. This is quite important. Notice the TYPE is set to submit. You are submitting this form; therefore, if you just wrote in that the type was equal to button, the format would not work. This button not only activates the function verify  —note the onClick=—but it also sends the form.  Wait! The little window says the button on it sends the mail. I know, but it’s part of the illusion of the Guestbook. It was done on purpose. The actual mail-sending dirty work was accom- plished by the TYPE=”submit” button.  It’s done so that the user stops for a moment to read the window. That way the browser is given a spot of downtime during which to send the mail.  Clever, no?  What Is Happening? The process of the Guestbook is pretty straightforward:  The user enters the page and is asked for her name and e-mail address. Those two literal strings are assigned the variables name and email, respectively. The rest of the page loads. The new   flag, with the user’s name and e-mail address, is written to the page. The user types in the   box and clicks the Submit button. The function is triggered, and a new page is displayed showing the user what she wrote.  139   JavaScript Goodies  In the background, the mail is being sent while the user reads the mail and thinks what a fantastic Guestbook you have. The mail arrives in your box with a subject line which tells you that you have mail from a specific person with a specific e-mail address.  Your Assignment This was quite a large, multiscript event, but can you add one more touch to it?  When the user clicks the Send It button, can you make a page that reads Thanks A Lot load into the mail window and still get that new little window?

Lesson 29: The Fifth End-of-Chapter Review—Posting Link Descriptions While Users Pass Over I’m going to list the commands you’ve learned so far again. Read them over, and start think- ing how you could use them to create something new and functional to use on your pages.  Table 5.1 contains the object-related JavaScript commands we’ve discussed. In addition, you’ve been introduced to these other JavaScript concepts:  The alert  , confirm  , and prompt   methods The if else conditional statement These event handlers: onBlur, onChange, onClick, onDblClick, onFocus, onKeyDown, onKeyPress, onKeyUp, onLoad, onMouseDown, onMouseMove, onMouseOut, onMouseOver, onMouseUp, and onSubmit The HTML 4.0 flag   Creating variable names Creating a function HTML form items The form item attribute NAME= These form item properties: length, value, and selectedIndex These form item methods: toLowerCase and toUpperCase    140   Chapter 5 ➤ Forms: A Great Way to Interact with Your Users  Table 5.1  Object-Related JavaScript Commands Demonstrated in Chapters 1–5 Object date  Properties  Methods getDate  , getDay  , getHours  , getMinutes  , getMonth  , getSeconds  , getYear   write    go    document  history location navigator  window  close    alinkColor, bgColor, fgColor, linkColor, lastModified, location, referrer, title, vlinkColor length host, hostname, href appCodeName, appName, appVersion, userAgent defaultstatus, directories, location, menubar, resizable, self, scrollbars, status, toolbar  Here’s a script that puts some of the JavaScript commands to work:      <A HREF=”http:  www.htmlgoodes.com” onMouseOver=”document.pic1.src=’flip1b.gif’, document.PostText.Receive.value=’This link points toward the ➥ HTML Goodies Home Page’” onMouseOut=”document.pic1.src=’flip1.gif’”><img src=”flip1.gif” ➥ NAME=”pic1” border=”0”>   <A HREF=”http:  www.JavaGoodies.com” onMouseOver=”document.pic2.src=’flip1b.gif’, document.PostText.Receive.value=’Click here to go to JavaGoodies’” onMouseOut=”document.pic2.src=’flip1.gif’”><img src=”flip1.gif” ➥ NAME=”pic2” border=”0”>   <A HREF=”http:  www.internet.com” onMouseOver=”document.pic3.src=’flip1b.gif’, document.PostText.Receive.value=’This is HTML Goodies parent company. ➥ ➥ onMouseOut=”document.pic3.src=’flip1.gif’”>  Go see what they are all about.’”  141   JavaScript Goodies                  <TEXTAREA COLS=”20” ROWS=”20” they go.” ➥ NAME=”Receive” wrap=”virtual”>     We’re going to combine some image flips with form items in this example. There will be three image flip mystery links sitting to the left of a   box. When you pass your mouse over the top of each link, a description of where that link points will pop up in the   box, as shown in Figure 5.7.  Think about how you would do it, and then read how we did it.  Figure 5.7 Image flips posting text to a form item.  You can try the script for yourself by clicking Lesson Twenty-Nine Script’s Effect in your download packet, or see it online at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com JSBook  lesson29effect.html.  142   Chapter 5 ➤ Forms: A Great Way to Interact with Your Users  Deconstructing the Script Let’s take this script apart piece by piece. We’ll start with its layout and design. Until now, the layout of the scripts didn’t much matter. The output was posted somewhere, and the look didn’t come into play.  Well, now the layout does matter. The layout is set so that the buttons are all on the left of the   box. We got that look through a simple two-celled TABLE layout:      The image flips went in here    The   box went in here      However, let me offer a word of caution. When you use tables and JavaScript, you can run into trouble. It’s not enough trouble for me to say never use tables and JavaScript together. But be aware that placing HTML elements and JavaScript into table formats, especially if you put different code sections into different table cells, can cause trouble and throw errors.  If you are trying to combine tables and JavaScript and are getting errors, try eliminating the tables. If the script runs, that was your problem. Find a different layout and design  format.  The Form Let’s go a little backwards. We’re going to start with the form and the   box first. It looks like this:          The form itself is named PostText, and the   box is named Receive.  What I wanted to show was a new HTML attribute that will help with script:  WRAP=”virtual”. The code makes the text that will fall into this box wrap at the end, rather than just running off the right. It’s really necessary to get the effect we’re shooting for.  Now that you know the elements required to create a hierarchy statement, let’s get to the image flips.  143   JavaScript Goodies  The Image Flips This is where all the magic occurs. Here’s the first image flip:  <A HREF=”http:  www.htmlgoodes.com” onMouseOver=”document.pic1.src=’flip1b.gif’, document.PostText.Receive.value=’This link points toward the ➥ HTML Goodies Home Page’” onMouseOut=”document.pic1.src=’flip1.gif’”><img src=”flip1.gif” ➥ NAME=”pic1” border=”0”>   If you learn this one, the others will fall right into place. They follow the same pattern.  This is a lot of text, but the script will work best if everything shown in the previous code snippet is allowed to stay on one line, one very long line.  The format for the image flips is pretty basic. The onMouseOver points to the document, and then the name of the image space  pic1 , and finally the src  flip1b.gif .  But notice that immediately following that, we’ve placed a comma and then a hierarchy statement pointing at the   box. It reads as follows:  ,document.PostText.Receive.value=’This link points toward the ➥ HTML Goodies Home Page’”  That is what places the text into the box. The hierarchy statement refers to the document, the form we named PostText, and the form element we named Receive; then it sets its value to ‘This link points toward the HTML Goodies Home Page’.  Because the two hierarchy statements were separated by a comma, the onMouseOver triggers them both. The image flips, and the text pops up in the box.  A neat effect indeed.  Image Flips Just remember that when you are doing multiple image flips on the same page, you must always give each image space a new name and change that name out in each image flip’s hierarchy statements.  Your Assignment At the end of the chapters, your assignment is always to create a new and functional script from what you know to this point, but I always make a suggestion.  144   Chapter 5 ➤ Forms: A Great Way to Interact with Your Users  Can you create a drop-down box that will answer people’s questions? For example, create a drop-down box that people can use to find out what HTML code they should use to get an effect. Make the box read, What is the code for? When the user opens the box, she can choose from bold, italic, and underline.  After the user has made her choice, she will click a button and a text box will show her the code.  Remember that the user could very well click the button even though she has not selected anything. Make the text Pick One Please pop into the text box if that happens.

The actual example was to figure a 15% tip. I thought that was the greatest thing I had ever seen. In fact, I wrote a script that does the same thing in Lesson 31, later in this chapter.  The purpose of this chapter is to take you back to math class, teach you how to make ran- dom events occur, and teach you how to use math to create JavaScript loops. All these events are seldom standalone items. Math typically is used to create a greater event. Case in point: Generating random numbers is nice, but what good is it unless the numbers help you to win the lottery?   JavaScript Goodies  Hey! That’s a great idea for a script.  But you have to walk before you can run, so let’s start with the basics of JavaScript mathe- matics.  Lesson 30: Math Operators This page will not only show you how to use numeric values to perform computation with JavaScript, but it will also test your basic math skills. There might be a test later. Its purpose is to introduce you to mathematical operators, something you’ll use often. If you have done any type of computer programming before, you should be experiencing déjà vu! If not, don’t panic. Using this script, I’ll give you an easy introduction:     var result = 10 * 2 + 1   3 - 7 alert  “the answer to 10 * 2 + 1   3 - 7  is “ +result + “.”   var numsums = 10 + 2 alert “10 + 2 is “ + numsums   var x = 10 alert “ten is “ + x   var y = x * 2 alert “10 * 2 = “ + y   var z = “Hello “ + “Good Bye” alert z      The script’s effect appears in Figure 6.1.  To see the effect on your own computer, click Lesson Thirty Script’s Effect in your download packet, or see it online at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com JSBook  lesson30effect.html.  The Arithmetic Operators I think it would be hard to get to this point in the book and not be able to figure this one out pretty quickly. But it’s not the makeup of the script that’s important. The purpose here is to show you the JavaScript binary operators.  148   Chapter 6 ➤ Mathematics, Random Things, and Loops  Figure 6.1 Alert box displaying math answers.  That’s a fancy way to refer to the addition  + , subtraction  - , multiplication  * , and divi- sion     symbols.  Percent  %  is also a binary operator. Its technical name is a modulus operator. However, it doesn’t create percentages. You actually have to create the percentages by hand, dividing one number into the other. The percent sign only returns any number left over, a remainder, in a division equation.  For example, the code 10 % 2 would return 0 because 2 divides into 10 evenly. But 10 % 3 would return the number 1. That’s what’s left over.  Deconstructing the Super Math Script Well, maybe it’s not super, but it makes its point.  Each two-line piece of code sets up a mathematical equation or number usage and then uses an alert method to display the answers. Here’s the quick rundown:  var result = 10 * 2 + 1   3 - 7 alert  “the answer to 10 * 2 + 1   3 - 7  is “ +result + “.”   149   JavaScript Goodies  We tried to create an equation that would use all the traditional binary operators. This is what came out. The answer is 13.333333333.  When you look at the equation, it might seem that the JavaScript is doing the wrong calcu- lation. If you pull out a calculator and follow the format, you might come up with this:  10*2+1  that equals 21    3-7  that equals -4   Right? Well, JavaScript doesn’t see it that way. Remember, we’re dealing with a computer here. That computer just bulls through left to right without stopping to see this as a divi- sion problem. If you simply read the equation straight through, you’ll get the answer the computer did:  10*2  equals 20  + 1 3  a third  -7 = 13.333333  So how do you get around the computer bulling through? Parentheses, my friend. Remember that from high school algebra? In math, the stuff in the parentheses is evaluat- ed first. Same here. If I wanted to turn this into a division problem with an equation on either side of the slash, it would look like this:  var result =  10 * 2 + 1     3 - 7   Be careful when you put together mathematical equations in your JavaScript. Make sure the computer is figuring out what you want it to figure out. Always check the math against a calculator before offering your work to the public.  var numsums = 10 + 2 alert “10 + 2 is “ + numsums   The script sets a numsums variable. Can you see that it’s equal to 12  10+2 ? The script trans- fers that variable to an alert box and displays that 10 + 2 = the variable, or 12:  Another variable, x, is set to equal 10. The alert box then displays that value:  Another variable, y, is set to equal the x variable multiplied by 2. That should be 20, right? It is. The answer is displayed in the alert method:  var x = 10 alert “ten is “ + x   var y = x * 2 alert “10 X 2 = “ + y   var z = “Hello “ + “Good Bye” alert z   150   Chapter 6 ➤ Mathematics, Random Things, and Loops  Finally, the variable z is created, showing you can connect text using the computation symbols. That variable is then displayed using the alert boxes.  That will become very important later.   The nice thing about the binary operator  +  is that it fulfils two duties. If it is placed between two numbers, it adds them. On the other hand, if it is placed between two strings, it puts them together into a single string, a process known as concatenation.  In Terms of Numbers and Binary Operators Never put quotation marks around numbers. If you do put quotation marks around a num- ber, it becomes a string. That’s bad. For example, if you run the equation “3”+4, you will get 34 because the quotation marks made the “3” a string and set the 4 to a string, “4”; the plus sign simply put the two items together rather than adding them. If you want 7 to be the result, don’t use any quotation marks so the plus sign sees both the 3 and the 4 as numbers.  Your Assignment Write a script in which a prompt is used to ask the user for a number between 2 and 10. Then, have that number’s square display on the page.  You do know what a square is, right? The number times itself.

Lesson 31: Mathematics and Forms After Chapter 5, “Forms: A Great Way to Interact with Your Users,” you should be pretty familiar with entering data into form fields and then getting values to show up.  Let’s take a look at that tip script that impressed Joe so much. It’s basic, but it does the trick:    function figureItOut   { var dinCost = document.meal.dinner.value var tipCost = dinCost * .15 var bigtipCost = dinCost * .25 document.meal.tip.value = tipCost document.meal.bigtip.value = bigtipCost  151   JavaScript Goodies  }          Figure 6.2 How much should you tip?  How much was dinner? $        You should tip: $    A big tipper would leave 25% $    This script accepts input from the user, manipulates the data, and then posts an answer. Very clever. You can see the script’s effect in Figure 6.2.  To see the effect on your own computer, click Lesson Thirty-One Script’s Effect in your down- load packet, or see it online at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com JSBook lesson31effect. html.  152   Chapter 6 ➤ Mathematics, Random Things, and Loops  Deconstructing the Script We’ll start with the form elements this time around because they are probably still some- what fresh in your mind:    How much was dinner? $      You should tip: $   A big tipper would leave 25% $      First, note the formal names. The entire form is called meal, and the first input text box is called dinner. The button is set up to trigger a function called, smartly enough, figureItOut  .  The results of the normal 15% tip shows up in a text box called tip, and the larger 25% tip result displays in a text box called bigtip.  Okay, now you know the players, so let’s get to the plays of the script:  function figureItOut   { var dinCost = document.meal.dinner.value var tipCost = dinCost * .15 var bigtipCost = dinCost * .25 document.meal.tip.value = tipCost document.meal.bigtip.value = bigtipCost }    We could have written out the hierarchy statement for the text box that accepted the user’s data, but because it was going to be used at least twice, we decided to assign a variable to it. document.meal.dinner.value was assigned the variable dinCost.  Now that we have that variable, we can start to create some mathematical equations  with it.  The variable tipCost was assigned to the cost of dinner multiplied by the traditional 15%, or .15, tip. Remember that the % sign does not mean percentage—it means the remainder of a multiplication. That’s why we use the .15 and .25 rather than 15% and 25%.  The variable bigtipCost was assigned to the cost of dinner and multiplied by the better tip amount 25%, or .25.  153   JavaScript Goodies  Now you need to get those values into the correct form items when you click the button. This is done by these lines of code:  document.meal.tip.value = tipCost document.meal.bigtip.value = bigtipCost  Notice the hierarchy statement points at the two form elements set up to receive the data. The values assigned to each box are the variable names that represent the equations set up a moment ago.  When you put the whole process together, the function figures the tip amounts, assigns variable names to them, and writes them to the form element.  Nothing to it.  Your Assignment Until now, you have had it easy with the math. Now let’s try something a little harder. Can you create a two–text box form with a button in the middle that changes Celsius degrees to Fahrenheit degrees?  In case you want to get clever, Fahrenheit to Celsius is done using this formula:  Here’s the equation:  Fahrenheit =  Celsius X 9 5 +32   Fahrenheit - 32  X 5 9  TIP  You’ll do best by taking each section of the equation and making it its own variable. You can then do the equation with text, and you’ll be sure the numbers within the parentheses are being fig- ured by themselves.

Lesson 32: Creating Random Numbers with a Date This example introduces you to random numbers. People love random numbers for some reason. Here’s our example:    function rand   {  154   Chapter 6 ➤ Mathematics, Random Things, and Loops  var now=new Date   var num= now.getSeconds   %9 var numEnd=num+1 alert numEnd  }          You can see the script’s effect in Figure 6.3.  Figure 6.3 Generating a random  number.  To see the effect on your own computer, click Lesson Thirty-Two Script’s Effect in your  download packet, or see it online at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com JSBook  lesson32effect.html.  Notice this in the script: The number after the % is the ending number. The following example picks a random number between 1 and 10.  But wait! The number after the % is 9! And there’s that % sign we keep mentioning for some reason. Keep reading to find out why.  155   JavaScript Goodies  Deconstructing the Script We’ll start with the function this time:  function rand   { var now=new Date   var num= now.getSeconds   %9 var numEnd=num+1 alert numEnd  }  It takes a few steps to get the random number.  First, you must set aside a function. We called ours rand  .  Next, we set aside a variable that will act as a method called new Date  .  Another variable, called num, is set aside. It contains the method getSeconds   to grab a number between 0 and 59.  JavaScript counts everything and starts counting from 0. The number returned from getSeconds   is divided by 9, and a remainder is returned. Remember that the % sign returns only the remainder of a division.  The remainder has one number added to it. That number is assigned the variable name numEnd.  The alert   method then displays the number.  How Does That Give a Random Number? Here’s the concept. 9 divides into 0 through 60 approximately 6.7 times. So, every six and a half seconds or so, a new number can be returned.  Let’s say the second returned is 54. 9 divides into 54 with a result of 6. That’s a perfect number. There is no remainder. Therefore, the remainder is 0. Remember that the % sign returns only the remainder of a division. 1 is added, and the random number is 1.  Here’s another example. The second return is 22. 9 divides into it 2.4 times. 4 is the remainder. 1 is added to it, and you get a random number of 5.  You’ll never get a 0 returned as the random number because 1 is always added to the mix.  It’s hard to believe it works, but it does.  156   Chapter 6 ➤ Mathematics, Random Things, and Loops  The Form Items         There’s no real need to name the form or the form items in this case. None of the elements comes into play. The button is simply there to act as a trigger to produce the number through the rand   function.  It’s a neat trick.  Your Assignment Do you play the lottery? Let’s create a JavaScript that picks the three-digit daily lotto draw- ing numbers. You have to return three random numbers, 0–9.  Make the numbers appear on an alert box. For good measure, put the text Good Luck! in the status bar.  TIP  If you use getSeconds   for all three number generators, you’ll always get all three numbers the same.

Lesson 33: Creating Random Numbers Through Mathematics This script enables you to create a random number using JavaScript mathematics state- ments rather than relying on a date return:    var num = Math.round 35 * Math.random   ; document.write “Random number between 0 and 35:  ” + num + “ .”     The script’s effect appears in Figure 6.4.  157   JavaScript Goodies  Figure 6.4 Generating a random  number through math.  To see the effect on your own computer, click Lesson Thirty-Three Script’s Effect in your download packet, or see it online at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com JSBook  lesson33effect.html.  Deconstructing the Script It might not seem at first that there is a lot to this script, but it is quite useful. First, it’s compact, and it always returns a positive integer starting at 0.  In addition, the fact that it runs without a function is also helpful.  Here’s the line of code that does the trick:  var num = Math.round 35 * Math.random   ;  The line is set up as a variable assigned the name num. That enables you to post the result anywhere on the page.  The mathematics are done through two object.method statements.  Math is an object that alerts the browser that the methods which follow are to be used specifically to produce mathematical results. The Math object itself carries no value; it sim- ply sets the course of the methods that follow to do math.  Math.round   is an object.method statement that takes whatever is in its argument and rounds it to the nearest integer.  158   Chapter 6 ➤ Mathematics, Random Things, and Loops  Math.random   is an object method that returns a number between 0 and 1. Now, that might sound silly at first, but here’s another thing about how JavaScript counts. It starts at 0 and goes up. Better than that, JavaScript has the capability to count in milliseconds.  There are actually 999 different responses this Math.random can return, from .001 up to .999.  The number 35 is in there because we put it there. It is known as the upper limit. The answer returns between 0 and 35 because it is mathematically impossible to go higher than what you’re multiplying.  For example, Math.random   returns .234. 35 times .234 is 8.19. That rounds down because it’s closer to 8 than it is to 9. Therefore, the random number produced is 8.  The line  document.write “Random number between 0 and 35:  ” + num + “ .”   writes the random number to the document surrounded by text that explains to the user what the number represents.  But what if you do not want 0 as one of the random numbers? Well, you’ll have to do two things:  Add 1 to the output of the random number equation. Remember how we did that in the last lesson? Make the upper limit 34. If you leave it at 35, there’s every chance that 35 will be the number returned and adding would make the number 36. That’s bad.  Isn’t this math stuff fun?  The Math Object The Math object is amazing. Table 6.1 shows all the methods that can be attached to it.

Lesson 34: Producing Random Statements and Images As referenced in Lessons 32 and 33, producing random numbers is good, but by itself, the technique doesn’t do much besides post a number. Here we start to take that concept of randomness and apply it to other items. In this case, one of three statements will pop up on the screen—which statement depends on which random number the computer comes up with.  In Lesson 21 in Chapter 4, “Flipping Images and Opening Windows with Mouse Events,” you learned the concept of if and else. Here we use that concept once again to get the desired effect:    var0=”An Apple A Day” var1=”A Stitch in Time” var2=”Bird in the Hand” now=new Date   num= now.getSeconds    %3 document.write “Random Number: “      + num + “ ”  if  num == 0  {cliche=var0} if  num == 1  {cliche=var1} if  num == 2  {cliche=var2} document.write cliche     ....as I always say.  You can see the script’s effect in Figure 6.5.  To see the effect on your own computer, click Lesson Thirty-Four Script’s Effect in your down- load packet, or see it online at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com JSBook lesson34effect. html.  161   JavaScript Goodies  Figure 6.5 Random statement.  Deconstructing the Script This one reads very nicely from the top down. Here we start by giving three lines of text three variable names var0 through var2:  var0=”Apple a Day”; var1=”A Stitch in Time”; var2=”Bird in the Hand”;  now=new Date   num= now.getSeconds    %3  We could have started with 1, but that would have required setting the random number generator code to add 1. It’s not worth the concern, so we’re just starting with 0. Moving along:  Next, the script uses the two-line date code to draw a random number between 0 and 2. Note the number 3 after the % sign. Remember that means the numbers 0, 1, and 2 could come up.  The code has assigned the variable name now to the new date object and the variable num the result of the random number code.  Finally, this line writes the random number to the page through a document.write statement:  document.write “Random Number: “+ num + “ ”   162   Chapter 6 ➤ Mathematics, Random Things, and Loops  Getting the Random Statement Now, let’s look at the second section of the JavaScript:  if  num == 0   {cliche=var0}  if  num == 1   {cliche=var1}  if  num == 2   {cliche=var2}  document.write cliche   if  num == 0   {cliche=var0}  The code that assigned the variable and chose a random number is now used to choose one of these three statements. Let’s take a look at just the first two lines of code:  This is a statement using the if method. Remember from Lesson 21 that any statement that follows if must be sitting inside parentheses.  Those two lines mean this: “If the number, num, created by the random number code is 0, set cliche equal to variable var0.”  Notice the cliche= statement is within braces  {} . The reason is that it’s actually a func- tion of the if method.  But you remembered that from Lesson 21.  Double and Single Equal Signs You might have caught this already, but it’s very important, so we’ll drive the point home. In JavaScript, a double equal sign actually means is equal to.  A single equal sign simply acts as the verb is. Remember that you use a single equal sign in assigning variable names. Think of that as meaning is. But, if you want to make the state- ment that something is equal to in JavaScript, you use the double equal signs.  Yes, we know it sounds backward, but that’s the way it is.  We keep it straight by thinking that a double  ==  means is equal to, and a single  =  means is.  Back to the Deconstruction The code then sets two more cliché numbers to var1 and var2, depending on whether 1 or 2 is chosen:  if  num == 1   {cliche=var1}  163   JavaScript Goodies  if  num == 2   {cliche=var2}  document.write cliche   Finally, a document.write statement is used to write the cliché to the page. Because there is no text surrounding cliche, no plus signs are necessary.  What’s Happening? The process is quite linear. First, three variable names are set, attaching three text strings to the variables var0 through var2.  Next, a random number is chosen and written to the page.  Then, that number is looked at through a series of if statements. If the first statement isn’t true, num does not equal 0, and the next if statement is looked at. If that statement isn’t true, the script goes on to the next.  One of those statements will be true because only 0, 1, or 2 will be returned from the ran- dom number code.  Why Don’t You Use an else with Your if? It isn’t necessary. One of those if statements will be true. You could just as easily have written this so that the last if statement was an else. It would have worked just the same way, but again, it’s not necessary. Three ifs will do just fine.

Lesson 35: Introduction to for Loops All programming languages have a branching method. The branching method in JavaScript is if, which we just looked at. It allows you to say, “If this is that, execute these statements.”  164   Chapter 6 ➤ Mathematics, Random Things, and Loops  In addition, all programming languages also have looping techniques. Looping is a fancy way of saying, “Run the script again and again, rather than just once.”  JavaScript has two looping methods: for loops and while loops.  In general, you use for loops when you know how many times you want to perform a loop. In contrast, you use while loops when you are not sure how many times you want to perform a loop.  That probably didn’t make a whole lot of sense, so let’s get right to an example. We’ll start with a for loop because we know how many times we want this script to loop  the next lesson discusses while loops :  We’ll now count from one to five:   for  i=1; i<=5; i=i+1  { document.write i + “ ” ; }   ...and we’re done  The script’s effect appears in Figure 6.6.  Figure 6.6 Results of a for loop.

It’s a nice break, don’t you think?  If you haven’t noticed, the for statement is seen as a function. See the braces?  Let’s look at the syntax of a for statement:  for i=1; i<=5; i=i+1   There are three parts separated by semicolons. We’ll take each part in order:  This sets the starting value of the variable used to control the loop. In this case it’s set to 1, but it could be set to 10 or 100. Think of it simply as a starting point for the loop. That starting point has now been assigned the variable i:  This is the condition controlling the number of times the loop will be repeated. In this example, the loop will be repeated while i is less than or equal to 5.  TIP You’re probably familiar with that less than sign from middle-school math. I was always able to keep the greater than and less than signs apart by thinking of it as an alligator’s mouth. The alligator always wants to bite the biggest number. It’s a good tip, compli- ments of Miss Scovern, my sixth-grade math teacher:  This defines the increment value. Every time the loop is run, the program adds 1 to i. The program can add any number you want; we just want it to add 1.  Finally, a document.write statement prints the number. Notice the  . That makes each of the numbers break to the next line. You could just as easily have the numbers all in a row separated by commas, by just altering that section of text that appears after each number.  This JavaScript is triggered, or looped, five times. Therefore, it produces the numbers 1–5. We could have it count to 1,000,000 just as easily as 5, but that would take up too much Web page space.  i=1  i <= 5  i=i+1  166   Chapter 6 ➤ Mathematics, Random Things, and Loops  Your Assignment This is a great, and not so difficult, effect. You’re going to use this for loop as a delay.  Write an HTML document that displays Counting Now with a white background. Then, use JavaScript to count to 10,000. Yes, that is 10,000. Do not use commas in for statements; otherwise, you’ll get errors!  At the point the script is done counting, the background color should change to yellow, and an alert box should pop up that reads done.  Do not have the numbers print to the page. You do not want them to be seen because they are only there to count.  TIP  You might want to try writing the script setting the number to 10 rather than 10,000 to start with. You don’t want to get stuck in a 10,000-number loop.

Lesson 36: Introduction to while Loops This example looks at the while loop. You usually use for loops when you know how many times you want to perform a loop; you use while loops when you are not sure how many times you want to perform a loop.  Look at this code to see how to use variables to count iterations in a loop and to help you get ready for your assignment:    var usernum = prompt “How many times should I write Happy?”,”0”  loops=usernum num=1 while  num <= loops  { document.write “Happy “  num=num+1 } document.write “Birthday”     You can see the script’s effect in Figures 6.7 and 6.8.  167   JavaScript Goodies  Figure 6.7 Getting information for the while loop.  Figure 6.8 Results of a while loop.  To see the effect on your own computer, click Lesson Thirty-Six Script’s Effect in your down- load packet, or see it online at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com JSBook lesson36example. html.  168   Chapter 6 ➤ Mathematics, Random Things, and Loops  The while Condition The while loop is similar to the for statement in syntax. The difference is that in the for loop, you set the beginning index number and increment in the for statement.  The while statement just contains a condition, and you wait for input from the user to get the loop underway.  The script in this example uses the statement while num <=loops .  The condition is actually just the <=. It stands for less than or equal to. Table 6.2 shows the other conditions JavaScript recognizes.  Table 6.2 Conditions JavaScript Recognizes Condition == != < > <= >= ?:  What It Means Equal to Not equal to Less than Greater than Less than or equal to Greater than or equal to Conditional statement  The conditional statement is a pretty fancy item. It assigns a variable name depending on the outcome of one of the other conditions in the table. Here’s an example:  YearsWithCompany =  ywc >=45  ? “retire” : “notretire”  If the person has been with the company equal to or more years than 45, the value retire is attached to it. Conversely, if the years value is less than 45, the notretire variable is attached.  Deconstructing the Script Here’s another short script. We’ll whip right through it.  It starts with a basic prompt asking the user for a number. Notice that a 0 appears in the second set of quotation marks. That’s done so that if the user simply clicks OK without entering a number, the script will still run without errors. You always need to be conscious of any move the user can make and code for it in the script.  That number is assigned the variable name usernum. The variable loops is set to represent the number the user enters.  169   JavaScript Goodies  The while num<=loops  statement tells the program to do the loop over and over while the variable num is less than or equal to loops entered by the user. See the use of the <= condi- tion?  It might seem that the variable num just came out of nowhere—basically, it did. We needed a number equal to 0. We could have set num to 0 but didn’t need to. JavaScript counts every- thing and starts counting at 0. num is a new variable, so by default, it gets the value of 0.  If the user enters the number 7, the loop will roll seven times.  Each time the program goes through the loop, it writes Happy plus a space and adds 1 to num. The following code in the function does that:  document.write “Happy “  num=num+1  Let’s say the user enters the number 7. The loop rolls, and 1 is added to num. The script then rolls again and checks to see whether the new number meets the criteria. This looping continues until the number 7—the number the user entered—is met. After that’s done, the looping stops.  The finishing touch is the addition of Birthday at the end through a document.write state- ment.  So Happy, Happy, Happy, Happy, Happy, Happy, Happy Birthday to you.  Your Assignment Here’s another challenge. Set up this lesson’s script so that the prompt asks how long a ran- dom number the user wants. Then, take the number the user enters and create a random number that long.  TIP  You can’t create the number as a whole; you must create it one number at a time.

Look over the commands you have learned so far, shown in Table 6.3, and think about how you can use them to create useful and functional JavaScripts for your site. You’ve also been introduced to these JavaScript concepts:  The alert  , confirm  , and prompt   methods The if else conditional statement These event handlers: onBlur, onChange, onClick, onDblClick, onFocus, onKeyDown, onKeyPress, onKeyUp, onLoad, onMouseDown, onMouseMove, onMouseOut, onMouseOver, onMouseUp, and onSubmit These arithmetic operators: +, -, *,  , and % These conditions: ==, !=,  , = , and ?: The HTML 4.0 flag   Creating variable names Creating a function for loops HTML form items The form item attribute NAME= These form item properties: length, value, and selectedIndex These form item methods: toLowerCase and toUpperCase   while loops  Table 6.3 Object-Related JavaScript Commands Demonstrated in Chapters 1–6 Object date  Properties  Methods getDate  , getDay  , getHours  , getMinutes  , getMonth  , getSeconds  , getYear   write    document  alinkColor, bgColor, fgColor, linkColor, lastModified, location, referrer, title, vlinkColor  171   JavaScript Goodies  Table 6.3 Object history location Math navigator  continued Methods go    random  , round    window  close    Event Handlers Here’s the sample script:     Properties length host, hostname, href  appCodeName, appName, appVersion, userAgent defaultstatus, directories, location, menubar, resizable, self, scrollbars, status, toolbar  if  navigator.appName == “Netscape”  { location.href=”nspage.html” } else if  navigator.appName == “Microsoft Internet Explorer”  { location.href=”iepage.html” } else if  navigator.appName != “Netscape”  { location.href=”textpage.html” }    The effect is difficult to show. Take a look, though, and if you don’t get what’s happening immediately, stop back and we’ll describe it to you.  To see the effect on your own computer, click Lesson Thirty-Six Script’s Effect in your  download packet, or see it online at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com JSBook  lesson37effect.html.  This JavaScript is what is known as a browser-detect script. The purpose of the script is to view the user’s browser and load a page made specifically for that browser. It’s a script that is widely requested from the HTML Goodies site.  172   Chapter 6 ➤ Mathematics, Random Things, and Loops  The script is set up to load nspage.html if the user’s browser is Netscape Navigator, and to load iepage.html if the user’s browser is Internet Explorer.  Finally, a statement acts as a catchall for users who are not running either browser. Those users are sent to textpage.html, a text-based version of the other two pages.  Deconstructing the Script The script is made up of three if statements, but they really only check for two things.  The format of the script is set up to test for Netscape Navigator browsers first:  if  navigator.appName == “Netscape”  { location.href=”nspage.html” }  The check is performed by asking whether the browser’s appName is Netscape. If it is, that’s the end of the script. The nspage.html is loaded, and all’s well.  If the user is not running Navigator, however, the second if statement comes into play and checks to see whether the browser’s appName is Internet Explorer. You’ll notice an extra else in there between the two if statements. That’s a good habit to get into because it breaks the script into multiple blocks of if statements. Moving along with the script ….  If the browser is MSIE, that’s the end of the script. The iepage.html loads:  else if  navigator.appName == “Microsoft Internet Explorer”  { location.href=”iepage.html” }  NOTE  By the way, we found the return from the navigator.appName to use in the script by sim- ply writing a very small script that returned the value to the page. Then, we ran the script in Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer and wrote the values down.  If the browser is neither of those, the third if statement is checked:  else if  navigator.appName != “Netscape”  { location.href=”textpage.html” }  173   JavaScript Goodies  Notice again that an else is used before the third if statement.  The third statement might seem a bit silly. We already know that the browser is not Netscape. If it were, the script would have sent us to the Netscape page.  But that’s the beauty of it all. We know the browser is not Netscape because the script would have never gotten this far if the browser were one of the other two.  By writing the code to check whether it is not Netscape, we are guaranteeing that this if statement is true; therefore, the browser goes to the textpage.html.  Pretty clever, huh?  Placement of the Script Where you place this script is quite important. It should be on a page all by itself. External text will not display anyway and will probably slow the page’s completion.  The user will never see this script. The reaction is usually so fast that all he sees is a fast blank page load, and then up comes the page for his browser.  So, make this a page unto itself and put the bells and whistles on the pages you write for the browsers.  Your Assignment Your assignment, as it always is at the end of a chapter, is to create something you’re proud to put on your Web pages. But we always make a suggestion.  Let’s play the lottery, but not that silly three-number lottery; let’s play the big six.  Set up a page with 12 small text boxes. Six of the boxes will be for the user to enter her six numbers between 1 and 47.  Then, there should be a button that randomly generates six numbers between 1 and 47.  Finally, a button should be created that pops up an alert box to tell the user whether she wins.  The win button is a bit of a ploy.

It’s nice to be able to post the time the user arrived, but that’s a static num- ber. Here, you’ll learn to create a digital clock that runs right in the browser window.  You’ll also learn to post text depending on what time of day it is. It’s a nice way to wish someone a good morning at the right time.  You’ll also learn to create counts and countdowns to dates and events.  Finally, you’ll learn one of the most popular events available through JavaScript—scrolling text.   JavaScript Goodies  Lesson 38: A Running Clock In this lesson you’ll set up a script that returns the hour, minute, and second the user arrives at the page. It’s a format you should be quite familiar with at this point.  This lesson takes one more step by setting the script so that it runs again and again, giving the appearance that the clock is advancing on its own.  The script is displayed in full HTML document format to show the placement of each of the parts of code:         function RunningTime   {  var RightNow = new Date   var hr = RightNow.getHours   + 1 var min = RightNow.getMinutes   var sec = RightNow.getSeconds    var printIt = “Time: “ +hr+ “:” +min+ “:” +sec  document.clock.clockface.value = printIt  var KeepItGoing=setTimeout “RunningTime  ”,”1000”   }               You can see the script’s effect in Figure 7.1.  To see the effect on your own computer, click Lesson Thirty-Eight Script’s Effect in your down- load packet, or see it online at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com JSBook lesson38example. html.       176   Chapter 7 ➤ Clocks, Counts, and Scroll Text  Figure 7.1 The digital clock.  Deconstructing the Script We’ll start from the bottom and then go over the JavaScript:         You’ve seen this before. It’s a basic HTML form text box meant to receive and display what is returned from the JavaScript.  The form itself is named clock, and the text box is named clockface.  Next up from the bottom is the onLoad= trigger that starts the script rolling when the page loads into the browser window. You’ll find that in the BODY flag.  It would be best to explain what happens before going into each smaller section of the script.  The script is set up to return a basic hour:minute:second time format. The returns from the getSomething   methods display in a text box—you could probably figure that much out just by looking at the script.  The magic of this script is in the fact that it appears to be running, but it’s not. Here’s the deal: The script loads and posts the time to the text box. Then, the script waits one second and runs again. Then, it waits one second and runs again. Then, it waits one second   177   JavaScript Goodies  and … you know the rest. The effect of the script updating every second is that the seconds are counting up and the clock is running.  No Loop! Let me point out that this is not done with a for or a while loop. If we were to achieve the effect through a loop—and you can get the same effect—we would tie up the page to the point where you couldn’t even click any links. The method used in this lesson is con- trolled; it runs one time every second.  If this were done with a loop, the loop might run 500 times per second or more. It would be all the browser could do to keep updating the page. It wouldn’t have time for your users.  If you want a running clock, this is the way to go. Keep reading for the method.  Getting the Time Now we move on to the script’s parts. We’ll work from the middle out. This is the code that returns the hour:minute:second time format:  var RightNow = new Date   var hr = RightNow.getHours   var min = RightNow.getMinutes   var sec = RightNow.getSeconds    The format is quite typical. The Date object is assigned the variable name RightNow. Then, the hour, minute, and second are assigned the variable names hr, min, and sec, respectively.  The Function The entire script to this point is set up as a function. The format looks like this:  function RunningTime   { Everything mentioned so far is in here  setTimeout “RunningTime  ”,”1000”  }  The function is titled RunningTime  . Each time RunningTime   is triggered, a new value from the Date object is returned and posted to the text box.  178   Chapter 7 ➤ Clocks, Counts, and Scroll Text  So, as mentioned earlier, we need to find a method of getting the function to run, wait a second, and then run again. As you might have already guessed, this is what does the trick:  setTimeout “RunningTime  ”,”1000”   If you start to really get into writing JavaScript, this format will become very familiar. We’re setting up a rest period. The setTimeout   method does just what its name implies: It sets a certain amount of time out. In this case, 1000 1000ths of a second, or one second.  The format to implement the setTimeout   method is the traditional format you would use to set up a variable.  The method setTimeout   is given two parameters: the name of the function, RunningTime  , and the number of milliseconds that the timeout should be.  Remember, JavaScript counts everything; it starts counting at 0, and it counts time in mil- liseconds. Thus, 1000 is equal to one second. If you want the script to count up in five- second intervals, set the number to 5000.  The effect is that the script runs, waits a second, and then runs the function RunningTime  . Then, it waits a second and runs the function RunningTime  , and then waits a second … you know the rest.  Just remember: The setTimeout   method command line is inside the function. In fact, it is the last line of code before the second curly brace that finishes off the function.  Placement is important—make sure setTimeout   is last.

Lesson 39: A Fancy Digital Clock Chapter 6, “Mathematics, Random Things, and Loops,” discussed the if conditional state- ment. Here we’re going to use those if conditions to redesign the clock in Lesson 38 so that it reads like a normal digital clock. It will read in normal time using only the hours 1–12 for the hour, rather than 1–24. In addition, we’ll get the seconds to read 00 rather than 60 when the clock turns over to the new minute.  We’ll even get an AM or PM to pop up at the end.  179   JavaScript Goodies  Here’s the script:         function RunningTime   {  var RightNow = new Date    var ampm = RightNow.getHours   if  ampm > 12   {nampm = “PM”}  else  {nampm = “AM”}  var hr = RightNow.getHours   if hr >= 12   {nhr = hr -12}  else  {nhr = hr}  if  hr == 0  {nhr = “12”} else {nhr = nhr} var min = RightNow.getMinutes   if  min < 10   {nmin = “0” +min}  else  {nmin = min}  var sec = RightNow.getSeconds   if  sec < 10   {nsec = “0” +sec}  else  {nsec = sec}  if  nsec >= 60  {nnsec = “00”}  else  {nnsec = nsec}  180   Chapter 7 ➤ Clocks, Counts, and Scroll Text  var printIt = “Time: “ +nhr+ “:” +nmin+ “:” +nnsec+ “:” +nampm  document.clock.clockface.value = printIt  setTimeout “RunningTime  ”,”1000”   }                      The script’s effect appears in Figure 7.2.

Deconstructing the Script By now, we’re going to assume you understand the concept of returning the hour:minute: second time format by assigning the Date object a variable name and then assigning vari- ables to the getHours  , getMinutes  , and getSeconds   methods to get the correct time.  In this script, that same format is followed; however, after each of the getSomething   methods, a series of if statements is set up to alter the number that is returned.  In addition, a series of if conditional statements is set up to assign text a variable name, depending on what number is being returned.  If this is all getting a little confusing, read on. We’re going to take each new section in order.  The Hours This is the code that returns the hour number and the if statements that alter it:  var ampm = RightNow.getHours   if  ampm >= 12  {nampm = “PM”}  else  {nampm = “AM”}  var hr = RightNow.getHours   if hr > 12   {nhr = hr -12}  else  {nhr = hr}  if  hr == 0  {nhr = “12”} else {nhr = nhr}  You might notice that the hour is called for twice. But also take note that the variable name in each call for the hour number is different. The reason is because the first small block of code is using the hour to assign a variable name to the text AM and PM. The sec- ond block of code ensures that the hour number returned is in the traditional 12-number format, rather than the 24-hour military time.  182   Chapter 7 ➤ Clocks, Counts, and Scroll Text  We’ll look at the first small block of code first:  var ampm = RightNow.getHours   if  ampm >= 12  {nampm = “PM”}  else  {nampm = “AM”}  The number returned from the RightNow.getHours   object.method is assigned the variable ampm.  A basic if else statement is set up that means, “If ampm is greater than 12, assign the vari- able nampm the text value of PM. If not, assign nampm the text value of AM.” We chose the variable nampm to represent the new ampm. Get it?  Do you see what happened? The concept is that if the hour returned is after noon, the vari- able nampm is assigned “PM”; otherwise, it gets “AM”.  Now we have this variable in our hip pocket. Later, in a document.write statement, we can call for this text value and it will show up on the page. Got it? Good. You have to love this math stuff. Now the second small block of code:  var hr = RightNow.getHours   if hr > 12   {nhr = hr -12}  else  {nhr = hr}  This works like the first block, except it actually alters the number that is returned from the RightNow.getHours   method.  The if else reads, “If the variable hr is greater than 12, nhr  new hr, just like previously  is hr minus 12. If not, nhr equals hr.”  The reason for subtracting 12 in the first instance is to lose the 24-hour format. If the script runs at 10 p.m., the number returned is 22. By subtracting 12, we get the more familiar 10.  But what if it’s 0 o’clock? That can happen. If you remember, the getHours   method returns the numbers 0  midnight  through 23  11:00 p.m. . Thus, we run the risk of 0 being returned from midnight through 1:00 a.m. That’s not good. So, let’s set up yet anoth- er if else statement that looks like this:  if  hr == 0  {nhr = “12”} else {nhr = nhr}  183   JavaScript Goodies  The block of code tests the hour return. If the return is 0, the variable nhr is changed to 12 to represent the time between midnight and 1:00 a.m. Otherwise, we let nhr’s value display as returned.  Yes, we could have created a new variable, but why bother? It’s only going to come into play one twenty-fourth of the time anyway. We just kept the variable name the same. Besides, we liked nhr.  Now remember, this is set up so that nhr is the correct number—the number we want to post to the page. That’s the variable you need to call for in the document.write statements, not hr. That hr variable was just used as a means to an end.  If this seems like a lot of worry over the hour number, it is. In Chapter 5, “Forms: A Great Way to Interact with Your Users,” I talked about coding to cover every event that can take place. This is doing just that. We stopped and thought about how many different returns the hour can deliver and then how we could alter the hour return so that it would display correctly.  I think it’s one of the more enjoyable parts of programming. Hopefully, you do, too, because we have to do it again for the minute and second returns. Here we go.  The Minutes This code should be pretty easy for you to figure out after rolling through the hour code. Here it is:  var min = RightNow.getMinutes   if  min < 10   {nmin = “0” +min}  else  {nmin = min}  The minute is assigned the variable name min and is called for in the normal fashion. At this point, the number is correct, so there’s no need to manipulate it more, right? Well, sharp-eyed readers have probably noticed that when the minute is less than 10, the return is just the single number. The display would look better if we could get a 0 in front when there is just that single digit. So that’s what we’re going to do.  The if else statement reads, “If the variable min is less than 10, nmin  new min, remember?  will read 0 followed by the number. If not, make nmin equal to min.”  Now we have that variable nmin in the correct form to be used in the clock.  184   Chapter 7 ➤ Clocks, Counts, and Scroll Text  The Seconds Here’s the code that creates the correct second return:  var sec = RightNow.getSeconds   if  sec < 10   {nsec = “0” +sec}  else  {nsec = sec}  if  nsec >= 60  {nnsec = “00”}  else  {nnsec = nsec}  The first block of code is identical to what we just did with the minutes. If the second returned is less than 10, it makes the display two digits by writing a 0 in front of the single digit. If not, it lets nsec be equal to sec.  The second block of code comes into play only once a minute, but it’s a great look. You know by adding 1 to the end of the RightNow.getSeconds   that the numbers 1–60 will be returned. But 60 is not a normal number to see on a digital clock. Usually, when the num- ber gets to 59, the next number in line is 00. That’s what the second block of code is doing. It reads, “If the number returned by nsec is greater than or equal to 60, make nnsec  new, new sec  equal to 00. If not, let nnsec equal nsec.”  See how one variable is built off the value assigned to another? That’s one of the corner- stones of JavaScript programming. You get a value returned and then manipulate it before displaying it for the viewer.  The Rest of the Script The rest of the script is identical to the script in Lesson 38. The script gives the impression it is running through the use of the setTimeout   command:  setTimeout “RunningTime  ”,”1000”   Finally, the output of the script is sent to an HTML form text box for display. It looks like this:         185   JavaScript Goodies  It seems like a lot is going on again, and again, and again, and it is. But your computer’s pretty smart—it can handle it.  Your Assignment Rewrite a section of the script so that not only will the output of the script read AM and PM, but it should also read Good Morning between midnight and noon, Good Afternoon between noon and 6 p.m., and Good Evening after 6 p.m.  Tip  Set up the if statements with Good Evening as the result if the first if statement is true.

Lesson 40: An Image-Driven Clock This is a very popular effect. We’ll use the template digital clock from Lesson 38 and set up a series of if statements so that the returns are images rather than text:     var RightNow = new Date    var hr = RightNow.getHours    {hrn = “  ”}if  hr == 01  {hrn = “  ”}  if  hr == 0   if  hr == 02   if  hr == 03   if  hr == 04   if  hr == 05   if  hr == 06   if  hr == 07   {hrn = “  ”}  {hrn = “  ”}  {hrn = “  ”}  {hrn = “  ”}  {hrn = “  ”}  {hrn = “  ”}  186   Chapter 7 ➤ Clocks, Counts, and Scroll Text  {hrn = “  ”}  {hrn = “  ”}  {hrn = “  ”}  if  hr == 08   if  hr == 09   if  hr == 10   if  hr == 11   if  hr == 12   if  hr == 13   if  hr == 14   if  hr == 15   if  hr == 16   if  hr == 17   if  hr == 18   if  hr == 19   if  hr == 20   if  hr == 21   if  hr == 22   if  hr == 23   {hrn = “  ”}  {hrn = “  ”}  {hrn = “  ”}  {hrn = “  ”}  {hrn = “  ”}  {hrn = “  ”}  {hrn = “  ”}  {hrn = “  ”}  {hrn = “  ”}  {hrn = “  ”}  {hrn = “  ”}  {hrn = “  ”}  {hrn = “  ”}  var min = RightNow.getMinutes   + 1  if  min == 01   if  min == 02   if  min == 03   if  min == 04   {nmin = “  ”}  {nmin = “  ”}  {nmin = “  ”}  187   JavaScript Goodies  if  min == 05   if  min == 06   if  min == 07   if  min == 08   if  min == 09   if  min == 10   {nmin = “  ”}  {nmin = “  ”}  {nmin = “  ”}  {nmin = “  ”}  {nmin = “  ”}  {nmin = “  ”}  {nmin = “  ”}  {nmin = “  ”}  {nmin = “  ”}  {nmin = “  ”}  {nmin = “  ”}  {nmin = “  ”}  {nmin = “  ”}  {nmin = “  ”}  {nmin = “  ”}  {nmin = “  ”}  {nmin = “  ”}  if  min == 11   if  min == 12   if  min == 13   if  min == 14   if  min == 15   if  min == 16   if  min == 17   if  min == 18   if  min == 19   if  min == 20   if  min == 21   if  min == 22   if  min == 23   {nmin = “  ”}  {nmin = “  ”}  {nmin = “  ”}  188   Chapter 7 ➤ Clocks, Counts, and Scroll Text  if  min == 24   if  min == 25   if  min == 26   if  min == 27   if  min == 28   if  min == 29   if  min == 30   if  min == 31   if  min == 32   if  min == 33   if  min == 34   if  min == 35   if  min == 36   if  min == 37   if  min == 38   if  min == 39   if  min == 40   if  min == 41   if  min == 42   if  min == 43   {nmin = “  ”}  {nmin = “  ”}  {nmin = “  ”}  {nmin = “  ”}  {nmin = “  ”}  {nmin = “  ”}  {nmin = “  ”}  {nmin = “  ”}  {nmin = “  ”}  {nmin = “  ”}  {nmin = “  ”}  {nmin = “  ”}  {nmin = “  ”}  {nmin = “  ”}  {nmin = “  ”}  {nmin = “  ”}  {nmin = “  ”}  {nmin = “  ”}  {nmin = “  ”}  {nmin = “  ”}  189   JavaScript Goodies  if  min == 44   if  min == 45   if  min == 46   if  min == 47   if  min == 48   if  min == 49   if  min == 50   if  min == 51   if  min == 52   if  min == 53   if  min == 54   if  min == 55   if  min == 56   if  min == 57   if  min == 58   if  min == 59   {nmin = “  ”}  {nmin = “  ”}  {nmin = “  ”}  {nmin = “  ”}  {nmin = “  ”}  {nmin = “  ”}  {nmin = “  ”}  {nmin = “  ”}  {nmin = “  ”}  {nmin = “  ”}  {nmin = “  ”}  {nmin = “  ”}  {nmin = “  ”}  {nmin = “  ”}  {nmin = “  ”}  {nmin = “  ”}  document.write hrn+ “ ” +nmin     You can see the script’s effect in Figure 7.3.  190  To see the effect on your own computer, click Lesson Forty Script’s Effect in your download packet, or see it online at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com JSBook lesson40example.html.   Chapter 7 ➤ Clocks, Counts, and Scroll Text  Figure 7.3 Clock displaying images.  Deconstructing the Script To start with, let’s create 11 images. They are the numbers 0–9 and a colon. The 11 images are shown in Figure 7.4.  Figure 7.4 The clock images.  191   JavaScript Goodies  If you have grabbed the download packet from the HTML Goodies Web site, you already have the images on your computer. They are named 0.gif through 9.gif and sc.gif for the colon.  If you need to get them online, point your browser to http:  www.htmlgoodies.com JSBook 0.gif through http:  www.htmlgoodies.com JSBook 9.gif, as well as to http:  www.htmlgoodies.com JSBook sc.gif for the colon.  The script is very long compared to the size of the scripts we’ve been working with up to this point. But if you take another look, you’ll notice that the script is little more than the same hour:minute return format used in the previous two lessons with a whole lot of if statements underneath.  The Hour The hour is returned using the basic RightNow.getHours   object.method statement and is assigned the variable name hr. We are dealing with the military time format here; 0–23 will be returned, so there’s no need to add 1 to the getHours return. We’ll just allow an if state- ment for a return of 0.  Then, the if statements start to roll. Here’s the first one:  if  hr == 0   {hrn = “  ”}  The first if statement deals with a getHours return of 0. That would be midnight. It reads, “If the hr variable, the number returned, is equal to 0, hrn  hour new is what we meant  is equal to these two images:   .” That represents midnight.  Now we have the variable hrn set to return the 1 image and the 2 image.  Here’s the second if statement that is enacted if the getHours return is equal to 01:  if  hr == 01   {hrn = “  ”}  In this if statement, we’re dealing with 1:00 a.m. The return will be 01, so we set the two numbers to display as 0 and 1.  We didn’t have to use 0 and 1; we could have just returned the 1 image. It would have worked just as well, but we think it looks better to have all numbers in the time set to dis- play double images. It’s just personal preference.  192   Chapter 7 ➤ Clocks, Counts, and Scroll Text  The if statements roll on until all numbers, 0–23, are represented. Notice we have the 0 and the 1 image set to return for the number 13 so that the clock will display the tradition- al 1–12 hours.  An else statement isn’t necessary at the end because we know that the number returned has to be 0–23. One of those if statements will come true every time.  The Minutes Now this was a lot of coding. The concept is exactly the same as the earlier example, except we set 60 different if statements, one each for the numbers 1–59.  The code is the same except for one small difference. For the number 60, we set the images 0 and 0 to be returned. Clock readouts usually don’t display 60, but rather 00, so we want- ed to equal that.  The Display This might be the shortest display since Lesson 1. The hour variable hrn is returned, the colon is placed, and then the minute variable nmin is returned. It looks like this:  document.write hrn+ “ ” +nmin   Because the variables are returning text representing four images—two for each—what you get is a series of five images across.  For example, if the time is 5:24, the document.write line will read as follows:      ➥    Get it?  But I Want an Image Clock That Runs And you shall have it. Contrary to what you might think, the format for getting a clock to run with images is a little more difficult than simply sticking a setTimeout   function at the end of this long script. The reason is that we’re dealing with image code being written to a page, so it’s quite involved.  That said, I do have an image-based clock for you in Script Tip 10, “A Digital Clock with Image Display.” It’s a bit involved and a little too much to put right here. After you finish the remainder of the lessons, take a look at the script. It’s a big one, let me tell you.  193   JavaScript Goodies  Your Assignment Add some code to the end of this script so that it also displays the seconds.

Lesson 41: Countdown to Date How many days is it to your birthday, Christmas, the new year? You can figure it out auto- matically as long as you know how to set a date in the future. After you have that future point, you can perform mathematics to find out the number of days until the date you set.  Of course, you can also get the minutes and seconds, too, but first things first:     RightNow = new Date    mil = new Date “January 1, 2005”  mil.setYear = RightNow.getFullYear; day =  1000*60*60*24  computeDay =  mil.getTime   - RightNow.getTime      day; DayResult = Math.round computeDay ;  document.write “  “+DayResult+” days until ➥ January 1 st , 2005 ” ;     The script’s effect appears in Figure 7.5.

Deconstructing the Script The concept of the script is pretty simple. We first set a date off in the distance. That’s our ending point. We then grab the current date. Now that we have these two points, we can— through mathematics—figure out the number of days, minutes, or seconds from this point to the one we set way off in the future.  194   Chapter 7 ➤ Clocks, Counts, and Scroll Text  Figure 7.5 Display of days until January 1, 2005.  Here’s script from the top down:  RightNow = new Date    mil = new Date “January 1, 2005”  mil.setYear = RightNow.getFullYear;  The first three lines of the script set up the Date object and assign it the variable name RightNow.  Next, a new date is assigned to the variable mil because this is a script to figure out the days to the millennium. But take a second look. See how the instances now have a date in the middle, “January 1, 2005”? That’s where we set a date off in the distance. Now we have our future point.  Set It! Next, we permanently set the current year. mil.setYear is a method used to set a year point and not allow it to move.  When you use getSomething  , the number returned is ever-changing, especially the sec- ond. By changing the text get to set, we make it permanent. That works for hours, min- utes, seconds, days, months, and as shown here, years.  195   JavaScript Goodies  JavaScript Counts by the Thousand As if you didn’t have enough to remember about how JavaScript counts, here’s one more fact. 1000 is equal to one second. JavaScript counts time in 1 1000ths of a second  millisec- onds .  Remember the Math.random   statement we used earlier to return a random number between 000 and 999? Well, that could be done because JavaScript counts in milliseconds.  So we move along.  What’s a Day? This is a day:  day =  1000*60*60*24   Because we have set our point in the future, now we need to create some mathematical statements so we can start figuring the days.  1000 equals a second, multiplied by 60 is a minute, multiplied by 60 equals an hour, and multiplied by 24 equals a day. See how that works? Now we have a variable, day, that repre- sents one 24-hour period.  Figuring the Days Now let’s do the math. We’ll set a variable name, computeDay, to figure the days between the point we set in the future and the current date. It looks like this:  computeDay =  mil.getTime   - RightNow.getTime      day; DayResult = Math.round computeDay ;  The variable mil.getTime   is new to this book. The method getTime   works under the object Date, just like any of the other getSomething   or setSomething   methods do.  Where getTime   differs is that it represents the current date. When this method is run, it grabs all the dates and times at once. This represents our second point in time—the pre- sent.  The math is performed by subtracting rightNow from our date in the future and dividing it by a day.  The number returned will most likely not be a round number, so we need to round it off using the Math.round   object.method statement.  The result is assigned the variable name DayResult.  196   Chapter 7 ➤ Clocks, Counts, and Scroll Text  Putting It on the Page The result is put to the page through a basic document.write statement and use some fancy HTML coding to create the superscript st:  document.write “  “+DayResult+” days until ➥ January 1 st , 2001 ” ;  The script looks complicated at first, but after you break it down to its smallest parts, you can see it’s a simple math problem where we display the results.  Your Assignment Add some code to our script so it also displays the number of minutes until a set date.   It’s not as simple as multiplying the number of days by 60.

Lesson 42: Scrolling Text Scrolling, scrolling, scrolling. Keep those letters scrolling.  Setting up scrolling text is a little tricky. It’s done by setting a line of text and then moving it a little to the left after a certain amount of time, again and again.  But after you get the scroll to roll, you can get it to scroll in the status bar, an HTML divi- sion, an HTML layer, or a text box, like we did here:         function ScrollAlong   {  var space = “                                                       “ var scr = space + “This text is scrolling along...”  temp = scr.substring 0,1 ; scr += temp scr = scr.substring 1,scr.length ; document.Scroll.ScrollBox.value = scr.substring 0,55 ; setTimeout “ScrollAlong  ”,50 ;  197   JavaScript Goodies  }             Figure 7.6 Scroll in text box.

The script that creates the scroll is contained in a function named ScrollAlong   that is trig- gered by an onLoad= event handler in the   flag.  The output of the script is displayed in a text box that looks like this:         The name of the entire form is Scroll, and the name of the text box that will receive the scrolling text is ScrollBox.  Now that you understand the setup and the names of all the external parts, let’s concen- trate on the script.  The Text That Scrolls The first two lines of the script, before the function, set the text that will scroll:  var space = “                                                       “ var scr = space + “This text is scrolling along...”  If the first line looks a little strange, there’s a good reason. It’s meant to produce space before the scroll. The variable name space is assigned to around 50 spaces. Then, the vari- able name scr is assigned to space and the text “This text is scrolling along...”.  Now we have a long set of spaces and then text. The reason is aesthetic. If we didn’t put a bunch of space before, or after, the scrolling text, one scroll would just bump right into another.  Yes, we could have put all this on one line, but showing it this way was better because it gave us a chance to write this little section telling you to add a bunch of spaces before and after your scrolling text.  The Scrolling Script This script, surrounded by the function ScrollingAlong  , actually creates the scroll. In reality, nothing is actually scrolling. The script is just taking all those spaces and text and moving them to the left a nudge, again and again. The effect is the appearance that the text is scrolling.  199   JavaScript Goodies  Let’s break it down. First, the variable temp is assigned to scr.substring 0,1 . scr, you’ll remember, represents the text that will scroll along:  temp = scr.substring 0,1 ;  The substring 0,1  command is new. It returns a portion, or sub, of a text string depend- ing on an index. The index is contained within the instance, 0 and 1. Basically, this com- mand returns part of the text to the scroll when called on. At this point, it is set to return only one character. This is what actually creates the scroll.  Next, scr is given a new value. Here’s the code:  scr += temp  The operator in the middle is what does the trick. That += operator means to add what is before the operator to what is beyond the operator. So, scr += temp could actually have been written as scr = scr + temp. The += is just a little shorthand we thought you’d like to know.  So what has happened? The substring scr is now the entire text string plus the entire text string one character in. If that happens again and again, the text builds, adding one more character from the string each time to the next letter or space in the string to create the next display. That gives the effect that the start point keeps moving one space to the left, eating away at the substring text. The text keeps displaying one letter to the right and gives the effect that it’s actually scrolling out from the right side of the text box.  The script continues to build up again using scr as the variable of choice.  scr = scr.substring 1,scr.length ;  Now, scr is assigned a value that’s a substring of itself, working with the two indexes and the text string’s length. This might seem a little confusing at this point, but what you are asking for here is a subset of the text string. If you enter a number, only that many letters will be returned. By setting the argument of the subset to the length of the substring, you can be assured the entire string will be returned, rather than just the string, each time miss- ing one letter.  At this point, the code that came before is making the return keep moving one to the left. And then the following line, posting the text in full, is starting at that one space to the left again and again. That’ll look like a scroll, right?  document.Scroll.ScrollBox.value = scr.substring 0,55 ;  The output of scr.substring is now being sent to the text box through the hierarchy state- ment document.Scroll.ScrollBox.value. The two numbers in the instance are, again, two  200   Chapter 7 ➤ Clocks, Counts, and Scroll Text  arguments. Yet this time, we’re not dealing with text, but rather that return space within the text box. This line is set up to provide 55 spaces of visible text in which the text will scroll.  You can prove that to yourself by setting the 55 to 25 and rerunning the script. The space in which the text scrolls will be cut almost in half.  Now you need to make the script keep repeating itself, because if it doesn’t, this will be a one-character space scroll. That would be too quick and pretty boring. Here’s what does it:  setTimeout “ScrollAlong  ”,50 ;  Here’s that setTimeout   statement you’ve come to know and love. This time around, the variable name is counts, and it runs the next substring every 50 1000ths of a second.  Set the number higher to go slower, and set it lower to go faster. Just remember that you’re not setting a speed here—you’re setting the 1 1000ths of a second before the script runs again. The result is that the scroll appears faster or slower.  Scrolls are rough, but after you have the very basics of them, you should be able to scroll with the best of them.  Your Assignment Alter the code in this lesson so that the text that scrolls is different, the scroll occurs in the status bar, and finally, it scrolls much faster than it is set to scroll now.

Lesson 43: End-of-Chapter Review—Counting to an Event Up until now, we have either had events that run consistently or figured out set times. Now let’s get a countdown to roll in much the same fashion as we got the scroll to roll.  The script in this lesson is set up to count five seconds and then perform an event.  Table 7.1 shows the object-related JavaScript commands you’ve learned up to now. You’ve also been introduced to these JavaScript concepts:  string and the substring   method The alert  , confirm  , and prompt   methods The if else conditional statement  201   JavaScript Goodies  These event handlers: onBlur, onChange, onClick, onDblClick, onFocus, onKeyDown, onKeyPress, onKeyUp, onLoad, onMouseDown, onMouseMove, onMouseOut, onMouseOver, onMouseUp, and onSubmit These arithmetic operators: +, -, *,  , and % These conditions: ==, !=,  , = , ?:, and += The HTML 4.0 flag   Creating variable names Creating a function for loops HTML form items The form item attribute NAME= These form item properties: length, value, and selectedIndex These form item methods: toLowerCase and toUpperCase   while loops  Table 7.1 Object-Related JavaScript Commands Demonstrated in Chapters 1–7 Object date  Properties  Methods getDate  , getDay  , getHours  , getMinutes  , getMonth  , getSeconds  , getTime  , setYear  , setDate  , setDay  , setHours  , setMinutes  , setMonth  , setSeconds   write    document  history  go    alinkColor, bgColor, fgColor, linkColor, lastModified, location, referrer, title, vlinkColor length  202   Table 7.1 Object location Math navigator  continued  Methods  random  , round    window  close  ,  Chapter 7 ➤ Clocks, Counts, and Scroll Text  Properties host, hostname, href  appCodeName, appName, appVersion, userAgent defaultstatus, setTimeout   directories, location, menubar, resizable, self, scrollbars, status, toolbar  Here’s a script that puts some of these concepts to work:       Lesson 43      RightNow = new Date  ; StartPoint = RightNow.getTime  ;  function StartTheCount   {  var RightNow2 = new Date  ;  var CurrentTime = RightNow2.getTime  ; var timeDifference = CurrentTime - StartPoint; this.DifferenceInSeconds = timeDifference 1000; return this.DifferenceInSeconds ;  function TheSeconds   {  var SecCounts = StartTheCount  ; var SecCounts1 = “ “+SecCounts;  if  DifferenceInSeconds >= 6   {alert “done” }  }  else {  document.FormCount.CountBox.value = SecCounts1  window.setTimeout ‘TheSeconds  ’,1000 ;}  SecCounts1= SecCounts1.substring 0,SecCounts1.indexOf “.”   + “ seconds”;  203      JavaScript Goodies  }                 The script’s effect appears in Figure 7.7.

Deconstructing the Script For this chapter wrap-up, we’ll use a rather large effect. The script is made up of objects you already know, but it has a lot of them. It also has two functions.  204   Chapter 7 ➤ Clocks, Counts, and Scroll Text  We’ll start again from the bottom:         The preceding code creates an HTML form text box that receives the output of the script. The form itself is named FormCount, and the box that will receive the value is named CountBox. Now you know the names and can start tearing down the script.  The Script The script begins in a familiar fashion, by assigning the value RightNow to the Date object:  RightNow = new Date  ; StartPoint = RightNow.getTime  ;  Because we will be figuring out seconds until an event, we’ll need to set a point in time. So, we assigned the variable StartPoint to the second in time the script runs— RightNow.getTime  .  The First Function The first function is named StartTheCount  , appropriately enough. The code is similar to the code from Lesson 41 that figures the number of days until a set point:  function StartTheCount   {  var RightNow2 = new Date  ;  var CurrentTime = RightNow2.getTime  ; var timeDifference = CurrentTime - StartPoint; this.DifferenceInSeconds = timeDifference 1000; return this.DifferenceInSeconds ;  }  The variable RightNow2 is assigned to a brand-new Date object. Then, the variable CurrentTime is assigned to the exact point in time at which the script runs, as returned by RightNow2.getTime  .  The time difference in seconds between the CurrentTime and StartPoint is figured by sub- tracting one from the other. The answer is then divided by 1000—JavaScript’s representa- tion of a second. The result is assigned the variable name DifferenceInSeconds.  Now, we take our answer and run the second function.  205   JavaScript Goodies  The Second Function The second function, named TheSeconds  , is actually a couple of events put together. The first event creates the count; the second event watches the numbers roll by and enacts an alert box when the count reaches 6.  The first event looks like this:  var SecCounts = StartTheCount   var SecCounts1 = “ “+SecCounts;  SecCounts1= SecCounts1.substring 0,SecCounts1.indexOf “.”   + “ seconds”;  The variable name SetCount is assigned to the output of the first function DifferenceInSeconds. Obviously, we didn’t have to do this, but it seemed a good idea to assign a new name because we were in a whole new function.  The variable SecCounts1 is assigned to a space plus the results of the first function. This is similar to how the scrolling script was put together, adding space to a value.  SecCounts1 is then given a value, the substring of itself. A substring returns the greater of the two indexes in its instance. In the preceding code, the two indexes are 0 and the indexOf   SecCounts1.  Yes, that indexOf   is new. That command returns a count of what you point it toward. In this case, it points toward the results of the first script. That means the indexOf   starts to count from the point returned by the mathematics in the first function, probably 1 or less than 1.  However, now the substring will not return a letter as in the scroll script; instead it returns the number, and the indexOf   begins the count.  But how does it count up? Look at the last line of the second function:  window.setTimeout ‘TheSeconds  ’,1000 ;}  It’s a basic setTimeout   method that reruns the function TheSeconds   every second. That’s why the script counts; it is run again and again and again ….  Stopping the Count One of the selling points of this script is that it counts up to a certain point and then throws an alert box, or whatever you set it to do.  The count is watched, and then the alert box is enacted by the following code:  206   Chapter 7 ➤ Clocks, Counts, and Scroll Text  if  DifferenceInSeconds >= 6   {alert “done” }  else { document.FormCount.CountBox.value = SecCounts1 window.setTimeout ‘TheSeconds  ’,1000 ;} }  It is a simple if else statement that says, “If the output of the first script, DifferenceInSeconds, is greater than or equal to 6, post an alert. If not, continue to post the output of SecCounts1 to the text box CountBox in the form named FormCount.”  Why Count from the First Function? Ah, you noticed that. We’re not relying on the count from the second function to set off the alert. You see, the second function is just a display—the first function is the one that is really keeping count. That’s why we’re using the result, DifferenceInSeconds, to count for the if else statement.  It’s a true count using that number. The count that displays is for show only.  Your Assignment Set up a greeting for your users. This is a great effect. Get the text Good Morning, Good Afternoon, or Good Evening, to scroll in the status bar. The text should then be followed by the text Welcome to my page.

That indexed list is called an array.  JavaScript offers two basic formats for presenting an array. Each works equally well, although after we get into the scripts in this chapter, you’ll see how using one format or the other in particular cases is best, simply to keep it all straight in your own mind.  Setting up an array is a little tricky at first. You have to be concerned with the order of  the items, whether the items are data or literal strings, and how the data will be used.  Plus there’s the concern that JavaScript counts everything, and the fact that it starts count- ing at 0.   JavaScript Goodies  But after you grasp the concept of setting up arrays, the possibilities of what you can do with them are endless.  Lesson 44: Two Different Array Formats Sharp-minded readers might remember that way back in Lesson 15  see Chapter 3, “Manipulating Data and the Hierarchy of JavaScript”  we put together an array. The array was set up to present the day of the week. Here, we set up the exact same array and result— only this time we’ll follow a different method of presenting the array.  Both formats are included for explanation purposes. We’ll start with the format you haven’t seen yet:     var dayName=new Array 7  dayName[0]=”Sunday” dayName[1]=”Monday” dayName[2]=”Tuesday” dayName[3]=”Wednesday” dayName[4]=”Thursday” dayName[5]=”Friday” dayName[6]=”Saturday”  var y=new Date  ; var Today = y.getDay    document.write “Today is “+dayName[Today] + “.” ;     The script’s effect appears in Figure 8.1.  To see the effect on your own computer, click Lesson Forty-Four Script’s Effect in your down- load packet, or see it online at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com JSBook lesson44example. html.  Deconstructing the Script Immediately following the   flag is the array that presents the days of the week. It looks like this:  var dayName=new Array 7  dayName[0]=”Sunday” dayName[1]=”Monday”  210   dayName[2]=”Tuesday” dayName[3]=”Wednesday” dayName[4]=”Thursday” dayName[5]=”Friday” dayName[6]=”Saturday”  Chapter 8 ➤ Arrays  Figure 8.1 Day of the week posted through an array.  Notice the order. Remember that JavaScript counts everything and starts counting at 0. The order of the days in the previous code starts with 0 for Sunday. We chose to put Sunday first because, when you call for the dates of the week using the getDays   method, Sunday returns the number 0, Monday returns 1, and so on. So the order is not up for discussion.  The Format of a New Array Look at the format of the array. The browser sees the array as a variable name. That’s extremely handy because after the variable name is assigned, we can call on the array—and an index number—and just that piece of data or literal string is returned.  The array is assigned the variable name dayName. Notice the format used to set a new array. It is similar to the format used when setting a new Date object. You assign the variable name, specify that the assigned item is new, and then declare it as an array: new Array 7 .  The number that appears in the array’s instance  the parentheses  is the number of items in the array. Even though the array starts numbering items at 0, you still need to count the  211   JavaScript Goodies  first item as a member of the array. Too frequently the author doesn’t count the element because the first element in the array is listed as 0. JavaScript counts it, so you must count it, too.  Listing the Array Items This format of listing array items is good in that the number assigned to the array item is right there for all the world to see. The first item looks like this:  dayName[0]=”Sunday”  dayName is the variable name assigned to the entire array. To set apart an item as an element in the dayName array, you use the variable name and then the number that will be assigned by JavaScript, starting at 0 and simply counting up by 1. The number assigned to the indexed items in the array is referred to as the index number.  Notice the number is within square brackets. We always keep that usage straight because square brackets are all that’s left. We can’t use parentheses because they are used for param- eters, and we can’t use braces because they are used for enclosing functions. Okay, it’s not a good method of remembering, but it sure works for us.  Next, the single equal sign is used to assign a value to the variable[]. In this case, the value is a literal string, Sunday. It is text, nothing more. We do not want to manipulate this data or do anything with it other than display it if needed. Because it is only text, double quotation marks surround it.  Later in this chapter, we create arrays that consist of numbers and answers to a quiz. That numeric data is not to be returned. We want to manipulate it and return something else depending on the outcome; therefore, that numeric data does not appear within quotation marks. Here, though, we’re using literal strings. They sit within the double quotation marks. Have we driven that point home?  To complete the array, you work down the line, assigning the same variable name and adding 1 to the number until you reach the end of your list. When all items have been list- ed, you’ve finished your array.  More than One in a JavaScript It is more common to have multiple arrays in a JavaScript than it is to have only one. Your assignment today requires you to put more than one array in the script.  The format for each new script is the same as we’ve already described. However, each new array must be assigned a new variable name. Then, when you list the items in the array, you must assign them numbers using that new variable name.  212   However, every new array starts counting at 0.  Here’s an example of three small arrays that could all go on the same page:  Chapter 8 ➤ Arrays  var tree=new Array 3  tree[0]=”Elm” tree[1]=”Pine” tree[2]=”Maple”  var NumberData=new Array 3  NumberData[0]=15 NumberData[1]=30 NumberData[2]=45  var Cats=new Array 3  Cats[0]=”Fido” Cats[1]=”Chloe” Cats[2]=”Stimpy”  All three arrays have different variable names, and each list starts counting at 0. You can include 1,000 arrays on a page as long as you come up with 1,000 different variable names and number them all starting with 0.  Returning from the Array Now that we have gone over the concept of setting up the array, we need to discuss how to get one of the items returned—and not just any item. Let’s get the one we want. Here’s the code that calls for the day of the week:  var y=new Date  ; var Today = y.getDay    document.write “Today is “+dayName[Today] + “.” ;  The first two lines should look familiar. The new Date object is assigned the variable name y. Then, the object.method statement y.getDay   is assigned the variable name Today. When all is said and done, Today will return the number representing the day of the week.  The document.write statement is where the magic happens. It starts off posting the text Today is , leaving the space for appearance. Then, a return is called for. Notice the plus signs. The return is the variable name we assigned to the array. We know that the string to be returned will come from that array, but which one?  213   JavaScript Goodies  Notice that within the square brackets is the output of y.getDay  , Today. That value is a number. If the number returned is 0, today must be Sunday. If the number returned is 4, today must be Thursday.  Whatever the number, the value is placed within the square brackets. That value is then used to go to the array and return the string attached to that number.  And the day of the week appears on the page.  But what about adding 1 to the y.getDate   statement to get the number up to snuff? It’s not necessary. You added 1 when you were returning just a number. Because of the 0 being in the mix, you needed to add 1 because everything starts counting at 0. If you didn’t, the month, year, hour, and so on would all be off by 1.  Here, there’s no need to add 1. In fact, you’ll mess things up by doing it. The array allows for 0 to be a correct answer. If you add 1, 0 will never be returned, and it will never get to be Sunday. And we can’t have that.  A Different Type of Array Now, let’s look at the script we wrote in Lesson 15. It does the same thing as the script we’ve just discussed in this lesson, but the arrays are set up differently:    var dayName=new Array “Sunday”,”Monday”,”Tuesday”, ➥”Wednesday”,”Thursday”,”Friday”,”Saturday”  var y=new Date  ; var Today = y.getDay   document.write “Today is “+dayName[Today] + “.” ;    This is the line that creates the array:  var dayName=new Array “Sunday”,”Monday”,”Tuesday”, ➥”Wednesday”,”Thursday”,”Friday”,”Saturday”   The same rules described earlier still apply. The array is assigned a variable name, and the array is noted as being new, just like setting up a Date object.  The difference between the two arrays is that in this format, we’re allowing the JavaScript to assign the values for the array items, rather than doing it ourselves. Sunday is 0, Monday gets a 1, Tuesday gets 2, and so on.  The results will be the same, and both scripts will run just fine.  214   Chapter 8 ➤ Arrays  The main difference is that in this format, you can’t tell at a glance which number is assigned to each element. I found myself counting more times than I wanted to.  When Do I Use One or the Other? After writing the scripts in the chapter, we found that the format we use is as much person- al preference as anything else. However, the straight-line format worked best when we were comparing two lines of arrays. That way, the arrays were listed on two lines, and we could quickly see which data went with which in the arrays.  When simply returning data based on the user’s input, the vertical list is best.  But the choice is yours. Either one works, and both are useful. Just remember that strings are surrounded by double quotation marks, and when you use the all-in-a-row format— such as the script from Lesson 15—the items are separated by a comma and no spaces.  Your Assignment Add a second array to the script, following the same pattern, to complete the phrase It is day in the month of month.

Lesson 45: Combining User Input with Arrays Joe is a huge fan of the Rocky movies. He wrote this script. The concept is pretty basic: There are five Rocky movies, and the user is asked to enter a number  1–5  in a text box and then click a button.  When the button is clicked, the title of the movie and a very brief plot summary appears in two other text boxes.  This script has two arrays. Depending on which number the user enters, that number in both arrays is returned. So here again, both arrays are locked into an order: One number, two arrays, and two returns.  While you read through the list, keep in mind that no Rocky 0 exists. However, you have to make allowances for those users who try to be funny and enter a goose egg.  Here’s the script:     function Balboa    215   JavaScript Goodies  { var num = document.RockyForm.RockyUser.value  var Movie = new Array 6  Movie[0]=”There was no Rocky 0” Movie[1]=”Rocky” Movie[2]=”Rocky II” Movie[3]=”Rocky III” Movie[4]=”Rocky IV” Movie[5]=”Rocky V”  var Outcome = new Array 6  Outcome[0]=”No Outcome” Outcome[1]=”Rocky Loses” Outcome[2]=”Rocky Wins” Outcome[3]=”Rocky Loses, then Wins” Outcome[4]=”Apollo Dies, Rocky Wins” Outcome[5]=”Rocky Wins Street Brawl”  document.RockyForm.RockyTitle.value=Movie[num]  document.RockyForm.RockyOutcome.value=Outcome[num]  }      Enter a Rocky Movie Number  1-5 :        You chose:    The outcome was:      You can see the script’s effect in Figure 8.2.  To see the effect on your own computer, click Lesson Forty-Five Script’s Effect in your down- load packet, or see it online at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com JSBook lesson45example. html.  216   Chapter 8 ➤ Arrays  Figure 8.2 Output from user input.  Deconstructing the Script As is often the case when the script includes a form element, we will start from the bottom:   Enter a Rocky Movie Number  1-5 :    <INPUT TYPE=”button” Value=”Tell Me What Happens” ➥onClick=”Balboa  ”>   You chose:    The outcome was:      This HTML form code is constructed to provide a box to accept data, a button to start the process, and then two text boxes to receive the output of the script. Let’s take them in order.  The name of the entire form is RockyForm.  The box that receives the user’s number is named RockyUser. Now we know enough to start creating hierarchy statements to represent this box. This particular text box is referred to as document.RockyForm.RockyUser.value.  217   JavaScript Goodies  Next, a form button reads Tell Me What Happened. When clicked, the button triggers a function named Balboa  .  The final two boxes receive the output of the script. The first gets the title of the movie, whose name is RockyTitle. The second box receives the brief plot line, whose title is RockyOutcome.  Okay, now that we know the players on the field, let’s move on to the function.  The Function The first three lines of the script play a very important role:  function Balboa   { var num = document.RockyForm.RockyUser.value  The first line sets the entire script into a function called Balboa  . Remember that from the button?  The second line has the opening brace to start encasing the script. Then, we get to the line that takes the information from the user.  In the preceding code, while identifying the text boxes, we stopped and wrote out the hier- archy of the box that receives the user’s number. The line  var num = document.RockyForm.RockyUser.value  now assigns the variable num to whatever the user enters. That’s important because later we will use that num value to call on a specific array object from both arrays.  The Arrays Both arrays contain six elements. The titles of the films are assigned the variable name Movie, and the brief plot lines are assigned the variable name Outcome:  var Movie = new Array 6  Movie[0]=”There was no Rocky 0” Movie[1]=”Rocky” Movie[2]=”Rocky II” Movie[3]=”Rocky III” Movie[4]=”Rocky IV” Movie[5]=”Rocky V”  var Outcome = new Array 6  Outcome[0]=”No Outcome”  218   Chapter 8 ➤ Arrays  Outcome[1]=”Rocky Loses” Outcome[2]=”Rocky Wins” Outcome[3]=”Rocky Loses, then Wins” Outcome[4]=”Apollo Dies, Rocky Wins” Outcome[5]=”Rocky Wins Street Brawl”  Notice that the two arrays are set in the same order. If you look at array item number three in each, the title and outcome line up. We’ll use one number, represented by num, to pull from both arrays. If you don’t have the two arrays in the same order, either the title or the outcome will be wrong.  Only five Rocky movies exist, but six items are in the array. The reason is that you simply can’t ignore that 0 exists. JavaScript loves it; it has to have it. So, you make a point of offer- ing it an array value. In this case, we simply specified that there was no Rocky 0, and there was no outcome.  Pulling from the Arrays The following code enters information into the two text boxes when the button is clicked:  document.RockyForm.RockyTitle.value=Movie[num]  document.RockyForm.RockyOutcome.value=Outcome[num]  The first line returns the array item represented by the number the user entered from the Movie array.  The second line returns the array item represented by the number the user entered from the Outcome array.  Because both arrays are set up in the same order, the same number returns the same array item number, and the two results match up with each other. That means you won’t get the title of Rocky II and the outcome of Rocky IV.  This type of script can be used to create numerous returns as long as the items being returned are in a set order. This technique could be used to create a listing of presidents, Super Bowl winners, World Series winners, or any other numeric rundown of items. It also could be set up as a great teaching tool.  Your Assignment Add code to the sample script so that a third text box receives a rating. When the user clicks the button, he should see three things: the new rating, the name of the movie, and what happens.  219   JavaScript Goodies  You can see a possible answer to this assignment on your own computer by clicking  Lesson Forty-Five Assignment in your download packet, or see it online at http:  www. htmlgoodies.com JSBook assignment45.html.  Lesson 46: Random Quotes One of the biggest selling points of JavaScript is how easily you can set up a random event. Arrays lend themselves to randomization very well.  In this lesson, we’ll set up a script that returns one of ten quotes chosen at random.  Remember that even though we’re using quotes, anything that you list in the array can be returned in a random fashion: Links, images, or a greeting are some of the more popular items.  So read through this lesson, think about how you could apply this concept of grabbing a random array item, and apply it to your own pages.  Here’s the script:     var quote = new Array 10 ; quote[0] = “ Education is going to college to learn ➥to express your ignorance in scientific terms “; quote[1] = “Chance favors the prepared mind”; quote[2] = “A stitch in time, saves nine.”; quote[3] = “The only difference between bravery and stupidity is the outcome”; quote[4] = “One should never let a formal education get in the way of learning”; quote[5] = “Happiness is two kinds of ice cream.”; quote[6] = “If you choose not to make a choice, you still have made a  ➥decision.”; quote[7] = “Do, or do not. There is no try”; quote[8] = “Reality is merely an illusion, albeit a very persistent one.”; quote[9] = “No one ever said life would be easy.”;  var now=new Date   var num= now.getSeconds   %10  document.write quote[num]      220  The script’s effect appears in Figure 8.3. Note that we’ve added the text A Random Quote to the figure. The script does not post that text.   Chapter 8 ➤ Arrays  Figure 8.3 Random quote.

Deconstructing the Script Do you like the quotes? If not, change them, or add more. Either way, let’s get started tear- ing this script apart. Here’s the array:  var quote = new Array 10 ; quote[0] = “ Education is going to college to learn to ➥express your ignorance in scientific terms “; quote[1] = “Chance favors the prepared mind”; quote[2] = “A stitch in time, saves nine.”; quote[3] = “The only difference between bravery and stupidity is the outcome”; quote[4] = “One should never let a formal education get in the way of learning”; quote[5] = “Happiness is two kinds of ice cream.”; quote[6] = “If you choose not to make a choice, you still have made a deci- sion.”; quote[7] = “Do, or do not. There is no try”; quote[8] = “Reality is merely an illusion, albeit a very persistent one.”; quote[9] = “No one ever said life would be easy.”;  221   JavaScript Goodies  The format is the same as seen in the last lesson. But just to drive a point home, we could have used the array format in which all ten quotes were listed in a row, in quotation marks, and separated by commas  and no spaces . It would have worked just fine, but think of what it would have looked like. The line of code that contained the array items would have been a mile long and couldn’t have been easily understood at a glance. Using the preceding format, you can quickly see each of the array items and its number.  Let’s get back to the array. The array has been assigned the variable name quote. Ten items are in the array. Notice, though, that the array only goes up to 9. Again, that is because a 0 is in the count. We know we keep pointing it out, but it can be very confusing and very easy to overlook.  Tip  I have seen JavaScripts that use random arrays set up so that 0 never comes into play. The random number is set to return 1 as its lowest number. Still, the author had to make a point of putting a 0 array item in the run. It didn’t have a useful value because it was never going to come up, but there had to be some value so the JavaScript wouldn’t throw an error. Then, even though the author was working with only 10 items, he had to make a point of the array being listed as 11 items because even though the 0 item would never come into play, it still had to be counted. Ugh! What a pain. Follow the previous format and just remember that there has to be a 0 line. Your life and your math will be a whole lot easier.  The Random Number Code We’re using the same random number code found throughout the book. The Date object is assigned the variable name now:  var now=new Date   var num= now.getSeconds   %9  The variable num represents the random number produced by dividing the returned second by 10 and using the remainder. Did you remember that the % sign actually returns the remainder of the division? If not, now you will.  This code returns a number between 0 and 9. Of course, you know those are the same numbers we have set up in our array. See how all the pieces are coming together?  Putting It on the Page Because we’re dealing with only a returned value and no other text surrounding it, we don’t need to use plus signs or quotation marks. What we want returned is one of the  222   Chapter 8 ➤ Arrays  quote array items. Which item is returned is settled by entering the result of the random number code in the square brackets:  document.write quote[num]   Depending on the number, that quote is returned to the page.  Random Anything As long as the array is set up correctly and you set up the document.write statement in the correct fashion, just about anything can be returned randomly to the page. The HTML Goodies e-mail box receives a great deal of mail asking how to create random images, links, banners, and the like. This is how it’s done. You’ll have to play with the code a little to make it all display correctly, but we’ve shown you the base methodology and format.  So be random.  Your Assignment Add five more quotes to the scripts. That might seem easy, but look closely. You have to do more than just add the text.

Lesson 47: A Guessing Game Using Arrays Let’s play a game. In this example, the user is asked to guess the JavaScript’s favorite state from a list of states. The prompt statement is repeated until the user guesses the state cor- rectly. But it’s not as easy as it seems. The user can’t just keep guessing down the line until she gets it right by process of elimination. Each time the button is clicked, a new random state is selected.  This script uses the randomization you just read about and takes you in a new direction, testing user input against what is returned from the array:    var states=new Array   states[0]=”CT” states[1]=”PA” states[2]=”NJ” states[3]=”NY” states[4]=”RI”  223   JavaScript Goodies  function pickstate   { var now=new Date   var num= now.getSeconds   %5  var guess=prompt “What’s my favorite state: CT, PA, NJ, NY, or RI?”  if  states[num] == guess.toUpperCase    {alert “That’s my favorite state!” } else {alert “No, Try again” } }            You can see the script’s effect in Figure 8.4.

When the button is clicked, a function named pickstate   is triggered and run.  The Array  var states=new Array   states[0]=”CT” states[1]=”PA” states[2]=”NJ” states[3]=”NY” states[4]=”RI”  The Game Function pickstate   Now let’s look at the pickstate   function:  function pickstate   { var now=new Date   var num= now.getSeconds   %5  The array is the vertical format listing five possible favorite states. The state names are in double quotation marks, so they are simple literal strings that are returned later through a piece of random code.  var guess=prompt “What’s my favorite state: CT, PA, NJ, NY, or RI?”  if  states[num] == guess.toUpperCase    {alert “That’s my favorite state!” } else {alert “No, Try again” } }     225   JavaScript Goodies  The random number is returned as it was in the last lesson. The Date object is assigned the variable now. Then, the variable num is assigned the returned number created by dividing the current second by 5 and using the remainder of the equation.  That means there is a possibility of five numbers being returned, 0–4. Those are the same five numbers represented in the array.  The game is played by first asking the user to name a favorite state:  var guess=prompt “What’s my favorite state: CT, PA, NJ, NY, or RI?”   Notice that the prompt offers the choices the user can make. One of the five must be the choice. If the user does not enter one of those choices, the answer and the return from the array will simply match. The variable name guess is assigned to the user’s entry.  Then, an if statement asks whether the array item returned by the random number gener- ator is equal to the guess the user made:  if  states[num] == guess.toUpperCase     We’ve tried to compensate for the fact that JavaScript sees lowercase and uppercase letters differently by adding the method toUppercase   to the end of the guess variable.  You might remember the toUpperCase   method from Chapter 5, “Forms: A Great Way to Interact with Your Users.” It sets a literal string to all capital letters.  By using toUpperCase  , we ensure that the guess will always be uppercase and a user will not lose the game simply because he entered lowercase letters rather than the required uppercase letters.  Next, the if statement posts an alert box that reads That’s my favorite state! if the user’s state and the state returned from the random code are the same. If the two are not the same, an alert box pops up to say No, Try again:  {alert “That’s my favorite state!” } else {alert “No, Try again” }  The game might seem simple at first, a basic one-in-five chance. Not so. At the start of every game, a new state is generated. Therefore, from game to game, the chance of choos- ing the winner stays the same. That means you just can’t keep choosing the same state and winning by simple state elimination. That would be cheating.  226   Chapter 8 ➤ Arrays  Your Assignment This one can be done a few different ways. Alter the script so that it produces a form but- ton. When the user clicks the button, he will be sent to one of three randomly chosen links.

Lesson 48: A Password Script Password protection is very popular on the Web. Whether what is being protected really requires protection is a matter of personal opinion. The thinking might be that if you need a password to see what is behind the curtain, it must be more important than what is just sitting out there for the world to see.  An array offers a fantastic method for setting up a password-protected page or directory.  The password script in this lesson offers an array of seemingly random letters. The user is asked to enter three numbers. Those numbers are checked against the array, and a page URL is created. The many number combinations make guessing at the name of the page being protected quite difficult.  But because you, the JavaScript author, know the page name, you can set up the script to return the correct three letters to form the protected page’s address.  As you look down the script, I’ll tell you that the page name being protected is joe.html and the password is 145:     function GoIn   { var Password = new Array “p”,”j”,”l”,”t”,”o”,”e”,”o”,”b”,”x”,”z”   function getNumbers   { return document.userInput.u1.value return document.userInput.u2.value return document.userInput.u3.value }  227   JavaScript Goodies  var input1 = document.userInput.u1.value var input2 = document.userInput.u2.value var input3 = document.userInput.u3.value  var pw1 = Password[input1] var pw2 = Password[input2] var pw3 = Password[input3]  var pw = pw1 + pw2 + pw3 if  pw == pw1+pw2+pw3  {location.href = pw+ “.html”} }   Put in Your Three-Number Password to Enter:              The script’s effect appears in Figure 8.5.  Figure 8.5 Accepting the password.  228   Chapter 8 ➤ Arrays  To see the effect on your own computer, click Lesson Forty-Eight Script’s Effect in your down- load packet, or see it online at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com JSBook lesson48example. html.  Deconstructing the Script What’s that? You say you didn’t see the password in the script? Of course you didn’t. What good would a password script be if all you had to do was look at the script and pull out the password? That’s like writing the combination to a lock on the back of the lock. This script is a little hard to crack just by looking at the source code.  The Form Elements This script contains form elements, so we will start from the bottom and meet the players:  Put in Your Three-Number Password to Enter:              The form itself is named userInput, which makes sense.  The first text box is named u1, the second is named u2, and the third is named u3.  Finally, a form button, when clicked, starts a function called GoIn  .  Now you know the names and will understand the hierarchy statements, so let’s go back to the top.  The Script Here’s the function GoIn   being created. The brace always comes right after the function name:  function GoIn   { var Password = new Array “p”,”j”,”l”,”t”,”o”,”e”,”o”,”b”,”x”,”z”   Next is the array. To the viewer, it looks like a run of random letters, which is what we want. It should look like there is no rhyme or reason to why the letters are set in the order they are. In reality, there is an order—at least an order we know—so that as the script pro- gresses, we can call for array letter number 1, number 4, and number 5, put them all together, and create joe.html.  229   JavaScript Goodies  Now, do you see a little pattern emerging? The other letters will never enter into it. We are interested only in the second letter in the list, which is represented by the number 1, so the letter is j.  The second number in the password script is 4. The letter represented by the number 4 is o. Remember, count up from 0!  The third number in the password is 5, and the letter represented by the number 5 is e.  By putting those three array items together and adding .html, we get the URL joe.html.  We made the order of the letters of joe correct. You can further attempt to confuse the reader by putting the letters out of order. Just make sure the numbers you call for are the numbers that coincide with the page name you are attempting to create.  Getting the Results into the Function This is new. The purpose of this function is to ensure that the data the user entered in the three text boxes is in the function so we can work with it. It basically pulls the values into the script:  function getNumbers   { return document.userInput.u1.value return document.userInput.u2.value return document.userInput.u3.value }  There was no need to do this in the game script in the last lesson because we were dealing with only one piece of data. Now, though, we have three. So, by setting up a function and calling for the return of the values found in the text boxes, we now have those three num- bers in the function.  It is a good idea to do this anytime you have multiple input values from a user.  The following lines aren’t necessary, but it is a good idea to assign a much simpler variable name to the data the user has entered in the text boxes. That way we don’t have to write out those long hierarchy statements again and again:  var input1 = document.userInput.u1.value var input2 = document.userInput.u2.value var input3 = document.userInput.u3.value  Now, we start to build the page’s URL from the data the user has entered. The three vari- able names pw1, pw2, and pw3 are assigned to the letters returned by taking the three num- bers entered by the user and grabbing the corresponding letters in the array:  230   Chapter 8 ➤ Arrays  var pw1 = Password[input1] var pw2 = Password[input2] var pw3 = Password[input3]  For example, if the user entered the number 3 in the first box, pw1 would be equal to t. That happens two more times using the data in the second and third text boxes.  The variable name pw is created using the values pw1, pw2, and pw3:  var pw = pw1 + pw2 + pw3  Finally, an if statement asks whether pw is equal to pw1+pw2+pw3. Of course, it is—the vari- able pw was created by using those three pw variables:  if  pw == pw1+pw2+pw3  {location.href = pw+ “.html”} }  Because pw always equals pw1+pw2+pw3, the script attempts to find a page with the URL made up of the three letters returned.  Unless the three letters are correct, the browser won’t find the page. An error message will pop up saying the page made up of the three letters the user posted can’t be found. Because the user is given no indication whether her answer is even close, every try is a ran- dom shot.  Ten letters exist, and three of them must be correct. That means the user has a 1-in-10 chance, times 3. Do the math; that’s a pretty slim chance of just guessing the correct three numbers.  Now, those odds of guessing the password ring true only if you make your array out of purely random letters or groupings of letters. A smart person might be able to go into the previous code after seeing what it is looking for and pick out joe through a little brain power. But if I made the name of the protected page bjz, figuring it out would be much harder because that’s just a group of letters that means nothing.  Toughening It Up Try setting up the text array with multiple letters in each position.  Try setting up the script so that you require four numbers.  Try setting up the script so that each of the text boxes pulls from a different array, and make each array a different grouping of ASCII text characters.  231   JavaScript Goodies  You could make this JavaScript even more challenging by rewriting it so the script contains two arrays. The first is a series of random numbers, which coincide with letters in a second array. Use the number from the first array to pull a letter from the second.  For example, suppose the user enters the number 0. In the first array, the number in the 0 position is 4. Now, use that 4 to pull out the letter at the number 4 index position in the second array. I can’t even begin to think of the odds of guessing that one correctly.  Your Assignment This time around, you won’t need to do much, but you will need to pay close attention to what you are changing. Take the script from this lesson, and alter it so that the new pass- word is 364.

Lesson 49: End-of-Chapter Review—A Quiz The purpose of this end-of-chapter review is the same as all the other ones. You are to take everything you have learned up to this point and create a new and useful script to place on your own pages.  Of course, we’ll offer one ourselves and then make a suggestion or two.  Table 8.1 shows the object-related JavaScript commands you’ve been given up to now.

There are five form element drop-down boxes with three answers each. The user will choose the answers she feels are correct and click the button to see her score:     function Gradeit   {  function getselectedIndex  { return document.quiz.q1.selectedIndex return document.quiz.q2.selectedIndex return document.quiz.q3.selectedIndex return document.quiz.q4.selectedIndex return document.quiz.q5.selectedIndex }  var Answers=new Array 1,2,2,3,1  var UserAnswers = new Array document.quiz.q1.selectedIndex, ➥document.quiz.q2.selectedIndex,document.quiz.q3.selectedIndex, ➥document.quiz.q4.selectedIndex,document.quiz.q5.selectedIndex  var count0 = 0  if  Answers[0] == UserAnswers[0]  {count0 = count0 + 1} else {count0 = count0}  if  Answers[1] == UserAnswers[1]  {count1 = count0 + 1} else {count1 = count0}  if  Answers[2] == UserAnswers[2]  {count2 = count1 + 1} else {count2 = count1}  if  Answers[3] == UserAnswers[3]  {count3 = count2 + 1} else {count3 = count2}  234   if  Answers[4] == UserAnswers[4]  {count4 = count3 + 1} else {count4 = count3}  alert “You got “ + count4 + “ 5 right.”   }        1: What is 2 + 2?     Choose One  4  2  22       2: Trees have:      Choose One  engines  leaves  dogs       3: This book is about:     Choose One  Nothing  JavaScript  Love and Romance       4: Who sang “Yesterday”?

Choose One  blue  green  off-blue            The beauty of this script is that it uses two arrays to get the final score. The first array con- sists of the correct answers, whereas the second array consists of the answers given by the user.  One by one, the answers are checked against each other. If the answer is correct, 1 is added to the score. If not, the score remains the same.  The results of the script are then displayed in an alert box.  You can see the script’s effect in Figure 8.6.

Deconstructing the Script Okay, this is a long script and it looks scary, but don’t be put off. It’s a lot of the same ele- ments again, and again, and again.  This script has form elements, so we’ll start at the bottom.  The Form Elements Rather than display all five drop-down boxes, let’s look at only the first one. The other four work exactly the same way. Hopefully, you can get the answer to this one:  236       1: What is 2 + 2?     Choose One  4  2  22      Chapter 8 ➤ Arrays  Figure 8.6 The results of the quiz.  The name of the entire form is quiz. Remember that the entire form contains all five drop- down menu boxes. You are seeing only the first one here. Look back at the full script if you need to.  The name of the first drop-down menu box is q1. We decided on that because it represent- ed question one, which makes sense.  The next four drop-down menu boxes are set up the same, except they are named q2 through q5, respectively.  Remember: JavaScript counts everything and starts counting at 0. In each of these drop- down menu boxes, each selection is assigned a number by the JavaScript. The first is 0, and it counts up from there.  237   JavaScript Goodies  Notice that the first choice—the one that will receive the number 0—is not a viable answer. It simply displays Choose One, so the user knows to click to choose an answer.  Finally, there is a form button after the five drop-down menu boxes:     That button triggers a function named Gradeit  .  Still with us? Good.  The Script The script is a little long, but there’s nothing new in it, and its inner workings are pretty straightforward.  The script begins by being surrounded by the function Gradeit  . This is the function the HTML form button triggers when the user clicks:  function Gradeit   {  You probably remember the next part from the last lesson. This function is making a point of bringing up the answers the user chose so that the data can be manipulated in this script. Notice the q1 through q5 names in the hierarchy statements:  function getselectedIndex  { return document.quiz.q1.selectedIndex return document.quiz.q2.selectedIndex return document.quiz.q3.selectedIndex return document.quiz.q4.selectedIndex return document.quiz.q5.selectedIndex }  Notice how I am not asking for the value the user entered because the input device is not a text box. It’s a drop-down menu box, and the command used to return that value is selectedIndex. Remember that from Chapter 5?  Next come the answers. The array was created as a key:  var Answers=new Array 1,2,2,3,1   The answers that are taken from the drop-down menu boxes are tested against these num- bers. If the numbers returned from the menu boxes are the same, the user gets 5 out of 5. If not, the user gets a lower score.  238   Chapter 8 ➤ Arrays  Here are the results of the quiz as given by the user:  var UserAnswers = new  Array document.quiz.q1.selectedIndex,  ➥document.quiz.q2.selectedIndex,document.quiz.q3.selectedIndex, ➥document.quiz.q4.selectedIndex,document.quiz.q5.selectedIndex   Yes, the format for setting it up in the single-line array format is a little long, but the answers are in the single-line format, so we felt this should be, too.  We could have made this line shorter by assigning variable names to the long hierarchy statements. However, we’re writing the statement only once, so assigning variable names is a step that just isn’t required.  Grading the Test Grading is achieved by comparing the Answers array and the UserAnswers array, one array item at a time. The 0 items in both arrays are compared. If they match, 1 is added. If not, nothing is done and it moves on to the next one.  Each time you grade another answer, you must change the variable name. It gets a little confusing, but follow it along.  First, a variable, count0, is created and assigned a 0 value:  var count0 = 0  You have to do this in case the user doesn’t get any of the answers correct. Without setting the count to 0 to begin, the JavaScript would throw an error if the result was 0 out of 5.  Now we move to the grading itself. Let’s look at only the first two questions being graded:  if  Answers[0] == UserAnswers[0]  {count0 = count0 + 1} else {count0 = count0}  if  Answers[1] == UserAnswers[1]  {count1 = count0 + 1} else {count1 = count0}  The first if statement compares the two numbers in the 0 position in the Answers and UserAnswers arrays.  239   JavaScript Goodies  If they are the same, count0 gets 1 added. If not, count0 remains the same value, 0.  The next two numbers in both arrays—the numbers in the 1 position—are now compared. If they are the same, count1, a new variable, equals count0 plus 1.  If not, count1 equals count0, or still 0.  The process continues this way, creating a new variable name to coincide with each new question’s grading. It looks like this. Follow the new variable names along:  if  Answers[2] == UserAnswers[2]  {count2 = count1 + 1} else {count2 = count1}  if  Answers[3] == UserAnswers[3]  {count3 = count2 + 1} else {count3 = count2}  if  Answers[4] == UserAnswers[4]  {count4 = count3 + 1} else {count4 = count3}  When all is said and done, count4 will have the final score out of five. An alert box is set to pop up with count4’s value displayed as a grade. It looks like this:  alert “You got “ + count4 + “ 5 right.”   Altering the Display Okay, we agree that displaying the score on an alert box is a little cheesy. The point of showing you this script is to provide an example of getting a JavaScript to grade a quiz.  The display is up to you. You easily have enough knowledge at this point to take the count4 variable and post it all over the place.  In fact, look back through the script. You can pretty easily display the user’s choices right along with her score. You can even make all that information pop up in a new browser window.  All we provided here was a way to get the math done. Now it’s up to you to make it pretty. Think about it for a moment; there must be 50 ways to get this script to display the results.  240   Chapter 8 ➤ Arrays  Your Assignment For this assignment, put together an entirely new script. The script should post a random image. Furthermore, the random image should have an URL attached to it. The URL should not be random—it should always be attached to that image when it displays.

You should be building scripts that do something that will be seen as a help to your Web site. This chapter is pretty much that idea wrapped up in six little scripts.  With only the JavaScript you know to this point, you have the ability to create rather large and involved scripts that can create some pretty great effects.  Because this is somewhat of a “wrap-up” chapter, allow me to talk about JavaScript usage for a short while.   JavaScript Goodies  Probably not.  As you’ve no doubt seen throughout this book, JavaScript can be rather flashy and intru- sive. I find that when I teach HTML and Web design to new programmers, they tend to immediately jump on the flash and pizzazz of JavaScript. Alert boxes, pop-up windows, and prompt boxes pop up all over the pages. Is that good? Is it wise to use JavaScript in such a way to force a user to look at or do something?  Think about your own surfing habits. Do you enjoy when sites throw up elements without your input? Do you like to be slowed down to witness an effect that doesn’t do much to help you? Case in point, would you like a site to pop up a prompt box that asks for your name just so that an alert box can pop up right after it proclaiming you are welcome into the site, calling you by the name you just entered?  I don’t know that you would. JavaScript is fantastically helpful when used to interact with your users but also as an aid to the user. Scripts should help them along and do some of the work for them. Scripts also should put on little shows now and again.  But they shouldn’t jump out and scream every time someone logs on to your site.  So, think about your own surfing. What is it that you’ve run into that you think a JavaScript could help you with? What script could you create that would be of assistance or add entertainment value to a Web site without throwing alert box confetti every time the user pops in?  It’s said that necessity is the mother of invention. The following scripts are ones that I think offer assistance and a little pizzazz without going bonkers.  After all, this is what you want. You want a Web site that interacts with users and makes their stay within your domain a little more enjoyable. That way, they’ll probably come back.  Let’s look at some great little scripts you can incorporate … and maybe alter a bit to suit your own needs.  Lesson 50: JavaScript Animation You already know about image flips that occur when the mouse passes over an image. Here you’ll go one step farther. This script takes a series of 10 images and plays them one after another, like a movie.  The script acts as an animator so you can animate either GIF or JPEG images without the use of an animator software package.  We’ve simply counted our images from 0 to 9, but if you use images in the correct order, this script will play them at whatever speed you want to create a basic animation:  244      var num=0  img0 = new Image  55,45  img0.src = “0.gif”  img1 = new Image  55,45  img1.src = “1.gif”  img2 = new Image  55,45  img2.src = “2.gif”  img3 = new Image  55,45  img3.src = “3.gif”  img4 = new Image  55,45  img4.src = “4.gif”  img5 = new Image  55,45  img5.src = “5.gif”  img6 = new Image  55,45  img6.src = “6.gif”  img7 = new Image  55,45  img7.src = “7.gif”  img8 = new Image  55,45  img8.src = “8.gif”  img9 = new Image  55,45  img9.src = “9.gif”  function startshow   {  num=num+1  if num==10  {num=0}  Chapter 9 ➤ Putting It All Together  245   JavaScript Goodies  document.mypic.src=eval “img”+num+”.src”   setTimeout “startshow  ”,”1000”  }            Display Animation   You can see the script’s effect in Figure 9.1.

Deconstructing the Script Let’s begin by talking about the 10 small blocks of code that start the script:  Img0 = new Image  55,45   Img0.src = “0.gif”  246   Chapter 9 ➤ Putting It All Together  Img1 = new Image  55,45  Img1.src = “1.gif”  We’re only showing the first two blocks of code here because the same format is followed again and again. Notice each of the small blocks of code calls for a new image, 0.gif through 9.gif.  The code is preloading the images. Remember what we’re trying to do here. The latter por- tions of the script, which we’ll get to in a moment, create an animation by showing 10 images in a row.  If you have to wait for the server to be contacted every time a new image is called for, it wouldn’t be much of an animation. You want all 10 images in the cache and ready to go when the user clicks to start the animation show. That’s why you need to preload all the images.  The format is pretty basic. It reads as if you were setting a new Date object. A variable name is assigned to a new Image object. The numbers in the parentheses are the height and width, in that order, of the image.  In the next line, the image source is offered in an object.property format: img1.src = “0.gif”. Note the double quotation marks. If you don’t surround the name of the image in quotation marks, the script will think that the dot separates an object from a property or a method and cause an error. But by inserting double quotation marks, you set “0.gif” apart as a string.  And so it goes 10 times. Each time, a new object is set with a new variable name, and then a source is offered.  The result is a download of the image. Now, when the animation is called for, all the images are already in the browser cache—or at least on their way—and the viewer should get a good show.  The Animation The basic concept here is that we’re going to perform an image flip, but we’re going to per- form it 10 times in a row. After those 10 flips have occurred, we’ll start from the top and do it all again.  The effect will be that 10 images flip by—one per second, or whatever timeframe you set— giving the impression of an animation. Here’s the code that does the trick. It’s not much, but it is powerful:  function startshow   {  247   document.mypic.src=eval “img”+num+”.src”   setTimeout “startshow  ”,”1000”  }  We’ll start at the top. I mean the very top—look back at the very beginning of the script, right before the preload commands. See where I initiated a variable?  I set that above everything else so that the variable num would be available after the func- tion started. Also, by setting it outside the function, I made it a global variable. Now let’s look at the bottom of the script:     Here’s the HTML flag that places the first image on the page. Note that it has the name mypic set to it. That’s going to be important when we look at the script’s hierarchy state- ment shortly. Back to the function ….  Sorry to jump around, but I needed to get you all the parts to understand how this func- tion works. We start by immediately increasing num by one:  That makes sense. 0.gif already is displaying on the page; we put it there through the HTML flag. We need 1.gif to appear now, so we add one to num.  Next, we need to check something. We don’t have a 10.gif; however, if num keeps getting one added to it, sooner or later it will equal 10. That’s a problem that easily can be fixed by telling the script that if num equals 10, just reset it to 0. Like so:  JavaScript Goodies  num=num+1  if num==10  {num=0}  It looks like this:  var num=0  num=num+1  if num==10  {num=0}  248   Chapter 9 ➤ Putting It All Together  The effect is a rollover from 9 to 0 and a count that starts all over again. Thus, the anima- tion appears to loop. Cool, huh? Here’s the code:  document.mypic.src=eval “img”+num+”.src”   Now let’s discuss the fancy stuff. We set the hierarchy statement to see the document, the specific image space mypic, and then to set a source. It’s done just like an image flip, except now we use the preload commands.  The command eval evaluates what is inside the parentheses. For example, say that num is showing a count of 7.  I’m just pulling a number out of my head. There’s no significance past that.   The text within the parentheses will therefore read img7.src. See that? The eval command then evaluates what that means—the source for img7 is 7.gif.  How do I know that? Look at the preload commands. See how img7.src equals 7.gif? That’s it!  Therefore, image 7.gif is placed in the image space mypic.  But how does it happen again and again? You should know this command by now:  setTimeout “startshow  ”,”1000”   The function is called for repeatedly every second using setTimeOut  .  So, the function fires, it adds one to num, and then that number is checked to see whether it is 10. If it’s not, the function evaluates the image source requested by the hierarchy state- ment. It then posts the image to the space.  This happens repeatedly, each time raising num by one and then resetting it when it gets to 10. The result is a 10-frame animation that loops again and again.  Calling for the Animation Here’s the code that starts the animation:   Display animation   Now, here’s something new. Look at the format of the hypertext link that starts the anima- tion. It points at JavaScript:startshow   rather than a hypertext link.  That’s a quick way to put active text on a page to trigger a function. By putting JavaScript: in the hypertext formula, the browser knows that a function, contained within the document, will be enacted. The function name that follows tells the browser which to trigger. It’s very clever.  249   JavaScript Goodies  Your Assignment This one will take a bit of thought. Change the script so that the animation is no longer in it. Then, make it so that when you click, you get the next image in line, repeatedly, until you have rolled through the entire set of 10 images.  It should change to the next image only when you click. Basically, you should turn this animation script into a slideshow script.

Lesson 51: Jumping Focus Between Form Elements This is a fun little script that acts as an aid to the user. Let’s say you set up a form that asks for information in a set structure. For example, you could ask for a phone number that is to be entered in three text boxes, a five- or nine-digit ZIP code, or a two-letter state abbrevi- ation. After the user has filled in the information, why not set it up so that the cursor sim- ply jumps right to the next text box?  You can get this effect by forcing the browser to put focus on the next element in line after the current element has reached its capacity.  I’ll even go you one better. I’ve added a little piece of code that jumps the cursor to the first form element when the page loads. That way, the form is ready and waiting when your user starts to type.  Here’s the script. It’s a little long, so I’ve added a few comments to help you at each stage of the process. It’s a tip you might want to think about when you get into writing bigger scripts. They can get confusing, even to the author. Here’s the code:          function check   { var letters = document.joe.burns.value.length +1; if  letters <= 4  {document.joe.burns.focus  } else {document.joe.tammy.focus  } }  250   Chapter 9 ➤ Putting It All Together    function check2   { var letters2 = document.joe.tammy.value.length +1; if  letters2 <= 4  {document.joe.tammy.focus  } else {document.joe.chloe.focus  } }    function check3   { var letters3 = document.joe.chloe.value.length +1; if  letters3 <= 4  {document.joe.chloe.focus  } else {document.joe.mardi.focus  } }    function check4   { var letters4 = document.joe.mardi.value.length +1; if  letters4 <= 4  {document.joe.mardi.focus  } else {document.joe.go.focus  } }                                 251   JavaScript Goodies  You can see the script’s effect in Figure 9.2.  Figure 9.2 After the first box was filled with four characters, focus jumped to the next box.  To see the effect on your own computer, click Lesson Fifty-One Script’s Effect in your down- load packet, or see it online at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com JSBook lesson51example. html.  Deconstructing the Script Okay, first things first.  Please understand that this works only with browser versions 4.0 and above—I’ll tell you why in a moment. But don’t let that stop you from installing this on your forms. Lower version browsers will not understand the event handler command and will not trigger the functions, which means no errors. Those users who have browser versions 4.0 or higher get the effect; those who don’t just fill in the form as they normally would.  The reason the script works in only 4.0 and above actually has to do with the event han- dler onKeyUp rather than the script itself. Keep reading, and I’ll tell you about my trial and error when writing the script and finally landing on the onKeyUp event handler.  The overall concept is this: There are four form elements, five if you count the submit but- ton. A small piece of JavaScript places focus  denoted by the cursor appearance  on the first form element, the first text box.  252   Chapter 9 ➤ Putting It All Together  Four JavaScript functions were created, and each is assigned to a text box. The JavaScript functions look at the number of characters within the text box. When the number reaches four, focus  again, the cursor  is placed on the next text box.  Each function can be changed around to your heart’s content allowing as many or as few letters as you want.  By the way, I tried this with other form elements, radio buttons, check boxes, and select boxes. The effect works for them all. The form element becomes highlighted, but that’s it. The user then has to use her mouse to complete the task. That’s not at all a bad thing; I just wanted to make you aware of it. This format works best with text boxes and text area boxes.  Now let’s break this code down, starting with the form elements.  The Form Elements                    This is a basic form whose name is joe.  After the form are four text boxes. Each box is given a name, size, and maximum length and is finally attached to a function triggered to work using the onKeyUp event handler.  Remember that from the previous code? That onKeyUp event handler is a relatively new command. This is where I ran into nothing but trouble when writing this script. The script must be set up so that every time someone enters a new character in a text box, the func- tion must run to recount the number of characters the user has entered.  I tried everything—I mean everything. I tried onFocus and onClick; I even tried setting the function to a for loop and a while loop. I set up a setTimeout   function. Nothing worked. But as soon as I entered onKeyUp, I had success. Each time a key is released, the function runs.  So easy, yet so hard to find. You’ll find that worrying over one little command will be one of your joys when writing JavaScript.  253   JavaScript Goodies  Now that you know the names of all the form elements, we can start to build some JavaScript hierarchy statements. For example, the first text box can be called on through the following statement:  document.joe.burns  document.joe.burns.value  Furthermore, the number of characters within the first text box can be returned through this hierarchy statement:  With those two concepts, the scripts basically build themselves. But wait! How did we get the focus to start in the first text box without any input from the user?  Getting the First Focus That didn’t just happen by default. We must “force” focus to the first text box. I did it in the BODY flag, like so:     That focus   is what does the trick. By attaching it to the end of a hierarchy statement, focus is put on the form element. In this case, it’s the first text box  burns  under the form  joe .  Keep that concept in mind. We’ll do it again and again throughout the four functions.  From Box One to Box Two The first two text boxes are named burns and tammy. If that seems odd to you, it isn’t to me because I am using my own name and those of my family. I actually find that remember- ing my variable names is easier if I use common names I can remember. Because JavaScript doesn’t worry about it, I don’t. It helps me, so I use it.  You just learned that if you attach focus   to the end of the hierarchy statement, you can set focus on the form element. Let’s put that concept to work.  The text box burns has its onKeyUp event handler set to a function named check  . It looks like this:  function check   { var letters = document.joe.burns.value.length +1; if  letters <= 4  {document.joe.burns.focus  } else  254   Chapter 9 ➤ Putting It All Together  {document.joe.tammy.focus  } }  The function first sets the number of characters found within the first text box  burns  to a variable and then adds one. The onKeyUp event handler is the trick. It forces the function to run every time something is entered.  Next, an if statement asks if the number of characters within the text box burns is less than or equal to four. If it is, focus remains on the text box burns.  We want the effect to allow four letters to appear in the text box, so to get that effect, we add one to the number of characters found in the box. That way, one equals two, two equals three, and so on. After the fourth letter is entered, the if statement is no longer true. Yes, you could get the same effect by not adding one and setting all the numbers up one, but that gets confusing. By adding one, you can set the if statement to the number of letters you want to appear in the box. It’s much easier to follow.  After the if statement is no longer true  letters now equals 5, but only four letters are in the box , focus jumps to the next box, tammy.  Now that focus is on tammy, the function check2   is the one that runs each time a key is let up. See that in the form elements? The text box tammy has onKeyUp set to check2  .  The function looks like this:  function check2   { var letters2 = document.joe.tammy.value.length +1; if  letters2 <= 4  {document.joe.tammy.focus  } else {document.joe.chloe.focus  } }  Does it look familiar? It should. It’s the exact same format as before except that the func- tion name has changed from check   to check2  .  The variable name letters has been changed to letters2, and the hierarchy statements are now set to jump from text box two to text box three.  The reason for the changes is that you can’t have the same variable names used twice to represent two different values within the same script.  After focus is on text box three, chloe, the function check3   takes over and performs the same tasks.  255   JavaScript Goodies  Got it?  Cool, huh?  After focus is on the fourth text box, mardi, the function check4   takes over and does the same thing, except this time when four letters are entered, focus jumps to the submit  button.  Don’t expect the submit button to do anything—it won’t.  Do you see how the functions work? Each is doing the exact same thing. You just have to change some variable names so that you won’t get JavaScript errors.  Your Assignment Using what you know from this script, rewrite the script so that a user can enter a phone number into three separate text boxes. This is often done so that the company receiving the information can keep the phone numbers separated by area code and exchange. It’s a fairly quick method of judging where groupings of customers are located.

Lesson 52: Limiting Check Box Choices Let’s stay in the same vein regarding using a script to assist a person filling out a form.  Here’s a fantastic effect. Multiple check boxes often are avoided in forms because users have a tendency to simply check all the boxes no matter what. Radio buttons have become the preferred element when a choice must be made. You typically see check boxes used as single items. I see them mostly at the end of larger forms asking whether I want to receive a newsletter or e-mail updates about a product I’m downloading.  But what if you want a user to choose two from, say, five elements?  Well, here’s a script you can attach to your forms that enables you to limit the number of checks your users can make. You’ll fall in love with check boxes all over again. I got the original idea for this script from an HTML Goodies reader. He has a similar script that works only in Internet Explorer, so I took the concept and rewrote it to work across browsers.  Here’s the script:  256   Chapter 9 ➤ Putting It All Together    function KeepCount   { var NewCount = 0 if  document.joe.dog.checked  {NewCount = NewCount + 1} if  document.joe.cat.checked  {NewCount = NewCount + 1} if  document.joe.pig.checked  {NewCount = NewCount + 1} if  document.joe.ferret.checked  {NewCount = NewCount + 1} if  document.joe.hampster.checked  {NewCount = NewCount + 1} if  NewCount == 3  { alert ‘Pick Just Two Please’  document.joe; return false; } }       Pick Only Two Please!      Dog    Cat    Pig    Ferret    Hampster    You can see the script’s effect in Figure 9.3.  To see the effect on your own computer, click Lesson Fifty-Two Script’s Effect in your down- load packet, or see it online at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com JSBook lesson52example. html.  Give it a try. I know it says to choose only two, but to see the effect, you’ll need to pick a third option.  Go ahead! Break the rules! Try to pick three!  You can even make different choices, unclick choices, and change things around. As long as you have only two, you’re good to go. But select three, and you get the alert.  257   JavaScript Goodies  Figure 9.3 Stop picking three!  Deconstructing the Script The example has only check boxes, but you can surround them with any number of extra form elements. I just singled out the form check boxes for demonstration purposes. The code looks like this:     Pick Only Two Please!      Dog    Cat    Pig    Ferret    Hampster    These are basic check boxes. The form is named joe, and each check box is then given a NAME. The NAME is equal to what the check box represents—that’s pretty basic form stuff.  The trick is the onClick   inside each of the check boxes.  Notice that the onClick   asks for a return from a function named KeepCount  . That return function enables you to disallow the third box  or whichever you choose  to be checked.  258   Make a point of following that format; otherwise, this JavaScript won’t give you the desired effect.  Chapter 9 ➤ Putting It All Together  Got it? Super. Moving along ….  The Script It’s a fairly simple little script that looks like this:    function KeepCount   { var NewCount = 0 if  document.joe.dog.checked  {NewCount = NewCount + 1} if  document.joe.cat.checked  {NewCount = NewCount + 1} if  document.joe.pig.checked  {NewCount = NewCount + 1} if  document.joe.ferret.checked  {NewCount = NewCount + 1} if  document.joe.hampster.checked  {NewCount = NewCount + 1} if  NewCount == 3  { alert ‘Pick Just Two Please’  document.joe; return false; } }    The script works because it’s set up to inspect every check box every time. That’s how you’re able to check, uncheck, and check again as long as only two are selected. The script counts the number of check marks every time you click.  We start with the function, which I called KeepCount   for fairly obvious reasons. You’ll remember that this function triggers every time your user selects a check box. We need to give the JavaScript somewhere to keep a count, so I set it up as a variable named NewCount.  Now we get to the magic. Notice the script checks each check box right in a row, every time. Here’s just the first blip of code:  if  document.joe.dog.checked  {NewCount = NewCount + 1}  259   JavaScript Goodies  If the first check box  dog  is checked, NewCount gets one added to it. If not, it moves along to the next check box.  Following the script down, if cat is checked, one is added. If not, we go to the next blip.  Each check box is tested in order. The script keeps count again and again each time the user clicks. But what if three are checked?  if  NewCount == 3  { alert ‘Pick Just Two Please’  document.joe; return false; }  If NewCount is equal  ==  to 3, up pops the alert box and the user is returned to the form; therefore, the third check box is false. It deselects.  The function bracket and the end-script flag round out the script.  The reason the script is capable of counting the boxes repeatedly is at the top of the func- tion. Every time the function triggers, the NewCount value is set back to 0.  You can set this to as many check boxes as you want and as many choices from those boxes as you want. If you use the effect more than once on a page, though, please remem- ber that you must change the NAME of the check boxes, so you must also change those names in the script.  You’ll need a blip of code for every check box you have for the check boxes to count each time. Just make sure that your script equals your check boxes both in number and in NAMEs. My suggestion is if you’re going to use this more than one time on the page, paste an entirely new script with a new function name and new count name  other than NewCount .  Just be sure to keep the return command in the check boxes themselves. That’s what makes the magic in this little script.  Your Assignment I’ll bet at least one of you noticed that this script has an alert in it. The first text in this chapter warned against using them. Well, actually it warned against using a lot of them.  Let’s take that to heart. Rewrite this script so that an alert no longer exists, but rather the entire run of check boxes becomes unchecked.  Here’s a hint: The change is quite minimal. Think about what command you would use when constructing an HTML form to create a button to clear the contents. After you have that, you’ll know the command to uncheck every box.  260   Chapter 9 ➤ Putting It All Together  When you get the command, remember that it is now going to act on the form, so add the two parentheses after the command.  Wow, I practically gave it to you.  Just remember that if you use this method as part of a larger form, it resets the entire thing.

Lesson 53: Positioning a New Window In Lesson 19  see Chapter 4, “Flipping Images and Opening Windows with Mouse Events”  I discussed how to open a new window. If you remember, numerous methods are available for altering the look of that window, but there’s more.  In this lesson, I’ll show you a couple of neat tricks to working with a pop-up window. First, we’ll start with a basic script that enables you to position the window when it pops up. After you have a handle on that, I’ll give you one more line of code that will change your pop-up window to a pop-under window. That means the window pops up behind the par- ent window rather than resting on top, as new windows normally do.  We’ll start with the script that enables you to position a new window.  I want to point out that I am triggering this new window through a button. Often, new windows are triggered simply through onLoad event handlers. I’ll quickly discuss that also before the end of the lesson. I just want to use the button to show the code so it’s a more controlled method to start with.  Here’s the script:    function goNewWin   {     Place the window var NewWinPutX=100; var NewWinPutY=210;    Get what is below onto one line  TheNewWin =window.open “untitled.html”,’TheNewpop’, ‘height=200,width=200,fullscreen=yes,toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no, status=no,menubar=no,scrollbars=no,resizable=no’ ;  261   JavaScript Goodies    Get what is above onto one line  TheNewWin.moveTo NewWinPutX,NewWinPutY ; }               You can see the script’s effect in Figure 9.4.  Figure 9.4 100 in and 210 down from the top.  To see the effect on your own computer, click Lesson Fifty-Three Script’s Effect in your down- load packet, or see it online at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com JSBook lesson53example. html.  Deconstructing the Script Here’s the basic thinking. To apply an effect to a new window, you must make that new window be seen as a single entity. The easiest method of that in JavaScript is to assign the new window to a variable name.  262   Chapter 9 ➤ Putting It All Together  After you have that, you can then apply JavaScript commands to the variable name and affect the entire window. With me? Good.  We start by setting the entire script into a function. That enables us to call on the new window however and whenever we want using event handlers or some other command. Like so:  function goNewWin   {  We start this script by setting a couple of parameters in terms of placement. We create two new variables: NewWinPutX denotes where along the X  or horizontal  axis the window should be placed, and NewWinPutY denotes where along the Y  or vertical  axis the window will sit. Here’s the code:     Place the window var NewWinPutX=100; var NewWinPutY=210;  If you’re wondering how the window is actually placed, the coordinates we just set are applied to the new window’s upper-left corner. Using this script, that corner is at exactly 100 and 210.  Now let’s assign the entire new window to a variable name all its own:    Get what is below onto one line  TheNewWin =window.open “untitled.html”,’TheNewpop’, ‘height=200,width=200,fullscreen=yes,toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no, status=no,menubar=no,scrollbars=no,resizable=no’ ;    Get what is above onto one line  The window code is exactly what you read in Lesson 19; I just have it set to the variable TheNewWin.  Now we’ll position it:  TheNewWin.moveTo NewWinPutX,NewWinPutY ;  The command that does the trick is moveTo.  Notice how moveTo has been set to affect the entire window by attaching it to the variable name representing the entire window—NewWin.  The moveTo command understands where to place the window because we have given it the parameters we set up previously: NewWinPutX,NewWinPutY.  263   JavaScript Goodies  After you get a new window set apart and attached to a variable name, you can have a great time playing with the window as a whole.  Now, you might be wondering why I set up the script so that I am calling for parameters from outside the moveTo command. I could have just as easily entered the numbers I want- ed rather than going through the trouble of setting up NewWinPutX,NewWinPutY.  Good question. I did it that way specifically so I could break out the height and width. I design these scripts so that many people can use them, and I like to make them as easy as possible to manipulate, even for a beginner. By breaking out the positions, I can set aside a piece of code, title it like I did in the previous example, and make it rather blatant where to set the position coordinates. It’s a help to another user, nothing more than that.  Here’s another example, popping the window up and under.  Making a Pop-Under Window For a new window to fall behind the parent window, you must do what’s known as blurring the focus on that new window. We’ll use the blur you learned about in Chapter 2, “Popping Up Text with Mouse Events.”  You might have noticed in your own surfing that a pop-under window quickly shows up as an outline and then falls back behind the main window. That quick appearance is the new window coming to focus. After that focus is on the window, the code immediately blurs that window’s focus, and it falls behind.  The effect is rather easy to get. We’ll just add one line to the previous script:  TheNewWin.blur  ;  You most likely could have guessed that one, huh? We know we needed to blur the entire window, so we set the command with the variable representing the entire new window.  Placement within the script is really our only concern. I put the line last in my function. The new script would look like this:    function goNewWin   {     Place the window var NewWinPutX=100; var NewWinPutY=210;    Get what is below onto one line  264   TheNewWin =window.open “untitled.html”,’TheNewpop’, ‘height=200,width=200,fullscreen=yes,toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no, status=no,menubar=no,scrollbars=no,resizable=no’ ;  Chapter 9 ➤ Putting It All Together    Get what is above onto one line  TheNewWin.moveTo NewWinPutX,NewWinPutY ;  TheNewWin.blur  ; }    Using the onLoad Event Handler to Trigger the New Window As I said before, a button seems a silly method of using this format. You’ll most likely want the effect to fire as soon as the page loads.  To get that, you simply delete the previous HTML button code and fire the function using the onLoad event handler in the BODY flag. It’ll look something like this:     Your Assignment Let’s see whether you can break out another set of parameters, other than the positioning X and Y numbers.  Alter this script so two new variables are set up that alter the new window’s height and width. That means you’ll need to pull those parameters out of the window code, of course. You’ll also need to write a line of code that resizes the window—try using resizeTo  .  Oh, and make the new window open via the onLoad event handler.  I know it’s coding overkill, but it just might help a less knowledgeable coder down the line. Plus, it’s a pretty good assignment, if I do say so myself.

Lesson 54: Self-Typing Typewriter This is a fantastic effect. A text box shows up and the computer appears to be typing into it. Its uses can range from a simple greeting, to page instructions, to simply keeping a view- er’s attention.  265   JavaScript Goodies  Here’s the script:  If you like to put scrolls on your page, this is a type of scroll but with a little twist. I also don’t see it as being as intrusive as a scroll. Let’s take a look.    var i = 0 var typeString= “All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.” +” All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. ➥All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. “ +” All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. ➥All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. “ +” All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. ➥All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. “  function type   { var typeLength= typeString.length document.typewriterScreen.typepage.value= ➥document.typewriterScreen.typepage.value + typeString.charAt i  i++ setTimeout “type  ”,70  }              The script’s effect appears in Figure 9.5.

What’s Happening? Here’s the scoop on how the typing effect is created.  Each time the JavaScript is run, the script posts the value of the TEXTBOX with the next let- ter in the string, chosen by i. It works similarly to a scroll, working one letter into the string each time it runs.  266   Chapter 9 ➤ Putting It All Together  Figure 9.5 Typewriter typing.  The first time the JavaScript runs, the return is a blank TEXTBOX and the letter A from the string. That return is posted.  The next time it runs, the return from the TEXTBOX is A with the next letter in the string, l, added. That return is also posted.  The next time the script runs, the return from the TEXTBOX is Al and the next letter in the string, l, is added. That is posted.  If this happens again and again, the effect is the letters typing themselves to the screen. Now, let’s dig into the script.  Deconstructing the Script Usually, we would start by naming the HTML form elements, but not this time. The form elements actually play a role in the effect, so we will discuss them last after you understand the typing effect.  This script begins by setting up a variable i and setting it to one. Then, a very long literal string is given the variable name typeString. It looks like this:  var i = 0 var typeString= “All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.” +” All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. ➥All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. “  267   JavaScript Goodies  +” All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. ➥All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. “ +” All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. ➥All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. “  Notice that each statement in quotation marks is connected by a plus sign so that one will just follow the other in one long line of text.  The Typing Function The function is named type  :  function type   { var typeLength= typeString.length document.typewriterScreen.typepage.value= ➥document.typewriterScreen.typepage.value + typeString.charAt i  i++ setTimeout “type  ”,70  }  It is triggered to run through an onLoad= event handler in the BODY flag.  First, the variable typeLength is created and given the value of the number of letters in the literal string, typeString.length.  Next, the TEXTBOX of the following HTML form is set up to receive the output of the script. You can probably guess just from this line of code that the form itself is named typewriterScreen and the TEXTBOX is named typepage. They are.  The typing effect is created by taking the value of the TEXTBOX and adding the first charac- ter of typeString. That’s done with the following code:  = document.typewriterScreen.typepage.value + typeString.charAt i   Remember that i is equal to one.  After that occurs, i starts to move incrementally up. Notice the double plus signs.  Finally, the code setTimeout type  ,70  sets a timeout for the script of 70 1000 of a second before it runs through the function again.  The HTML Form Elements As I said earlier, the name of the form is typewriterScreen and the name of the TEXTAREA box is typepage. You can see that in the following code:  268   Chapter 9 ➤ Putting It All Together          This form element differs from the others we’ve used because this one plays a part in the effect. Notice the attribute WRAP=”virtual”. That forces the text to wrap at the edge of the TEXTBOX rather than continue going off to the right.  But it’s the size that gets the look. The COLS attribute is set two letters longer than the text All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. By doing that, we were able to create what appear to be carriage returns right where we want them. Without each new line of text appearing on a new line, a great deal of the effect would be lost.  Your Assignment Add some code to the preceding script so that after the entire string of text has posted, an alert box pops up.  Hint: It should happen when the count is equal to the number of characters in the string.

Lesson 55: Scrolling Credits When you go to the movies, do you stick around and watch the credits? Wouldn’t it be great to get that kind of scroll on a Web page credit list?  That’s what this script does—it scrolls the page rather than the text. It’s a great effect, and a fitting end to the book’s last lesson:     var I = 0; function scrollit   { if  I == 1000  {stop = true} else { self.scroll 1,I ; I = eval I + 1 ; setTimeout “scrollit  ”, 20 ; } }  269   JavaScript Goodies                                      JavaScript Goodies       by     Joe Burns, Ph.D.      &     Andree Growney       The script’s effect appears in Figure 9.6.     Figure 9.6 Credits scrolling.  270   Chapter 9 ➤ Putting It All Together  To see the effect on your own computer, click Lesson Fifty-Five Script’s Effect in your down- load packet, or see it online at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com JSBook lesson55example. html.  Deconstructing the Script Okay, first off, let me explain what this is all about:                           Do you see that code, right below the BODY flag and right above the HTML that will appear in the document window? It’s there to add space before the text. If there is no space above the text, the page can’t scroll.  Now remember, when you use this script, either make the page that will scroll longer than the browser’s viewing area or add a bunch of breaks above the text so that the page is long enough to scroll.  Plus, if you create enough space so that the text is pushed down out of the browser screen, you get the effect of the text scrolling up and out of the bottom, like during a movie’s credits.  The script starts again by setting the variable I to 0 outside a function.  The function is then set and named scrollit  :  var I = 0; function scrollit   {  The function starts by setting up an if condition that states when I equals 1000, the scroll is to stop:  if  I == 1000  {stop = true}  Because that won’t be true for 1,000 cycles of the script, something else has to happen.  The following code sets the scroll of the page, denoted by self.scroll, to scroll up one line:  else { self.scroll 1,I ;  Then one is added to I:  I = eval I + 1 ;  271   JavaScript Goodies  Notice the eval   method. You should remember that it is used to set the results of the items within the parentheses to a numeric value.  Finally, the script is given a rest for 20 1000 of a second and the function is run again:  setTimeout “scrollit  ”, 20 ;  The process occurs repeatedly until I reaches 1000, or until the end of the page is reached and it can’t scroll anymore.  The rest of the code is basic HTML to make the page long enough to actually have some- thing to scroll.  Here’s a hint about using this script: It looks best if the script starts the scroll on a blank page. That way, the text pops up from the bottom of the browser screen like normal movie credits.  To get that effect, you must either add enough blank lines of code above the first line of text to literally push the text off the screen or set up some other method of pushing the text off the bottom of the screen. Maybe a transparent 1×1 image set to a height of 400 or 600 would work well. I got the effect in the example by simply adding lines.  Now, take this code and make some credits. Be sure to remember Andree and me. Heck, we showed you how to do all this stuff; the least you could do is give us a credit.  Your Assignment The assignment is to create your site’s own scrolling credits, plus one more thing—create good and useful scripts.

Setting all those FONT COLOR flags can take weeks.  Well, FONT no more. This script is set up to create those multicolored runs of letters with little or no work on your part—aside from entering the text, of course. I mean … you have to do something, right?  This script was sent to me to use as a tip. I really liked it the first time I saw it. Yeah, I’m 37  at least I was when I wrote this text , but bright lights and lots of color still make me happy. The script itself is a lot more interesting than the effect suggests. The coding is com- pact and gets the job done quickly.  You might want to test this script in a Netscape Navigator browser. It’s not that the coding is Navigator-specific; it’s just that if you look at the source code in IE, all you see is the script. In Navigator, you see the entire run of letters and the colors attached to them.   JavaScript Goodies  Here’s the script:        Put Some Colors Into The Text     <!-- Start hiding var i  function ColoredText   { var argLen = ColoredText.arguments.length; if  argLen == 0  {argLen = 1}  var text = ColoredText.arguments[0]; var textLen = ColoredText.arguments[0].length; var defClrsArray = new Array “red”,”purple”,”cyan”,”green”,”blue”, ➥ “magenta” ;   default colors, change as needed  for  i=0; i<textLen; i++  { charColor = text.charAt i ;  if  argLen == 1  { colorCode = Math.floor Math.random   * defClrsArray.length ; tempStr = charColor.fontcolor defClrsArray[colorCode]  }  else { colorCode = i %  argLen - 1 ; tempStr = charColor.fontcolor ColoredText.arguments[colorCode+1]  } document.write tempStr  } }    Stop hiding -->       274   Script Tip 1 ➤ Rainbow Text        <!-- Start hiding  ColoredText “This is a text sample written using the function ➥ ColoredText” ;  document.write  “ ”   ColoredText “Another text sample, this time only with red and orange ➥ repeatedly”,”red”,”orange” ;  document.write  “  ”   ColoredText “Another sample with shades of green”,”006000”,”007000”,”008000”,”009000”,”00A000”,”00B000” ;  document.write  “     ”   ColoredText “Try refreshing the page a couple of times!” ;  document.write  “  ”      Stop hiding -->           The effect is shown in Figure ST1.1. Of course, this is in black and white, so you should go see it online  see the following link .  To see the effect on your own computer click Script Tip 1 in your download packet or see it online at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com stips scripttip81effect.html.  The code is available for copy and paste at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com stips  scripttip81script.html or by viewing the source of the page in your download packet.  275   JavaScript Goodies  Figure ST1.1 The letters are really color- ful … really. I know the shot is in black and white, so just take my word for it.  This is actually two scripts in one. Let’s begin with the bottom script—that’s the one that has all the display text:    <!-- Start hiding ColoredText “This is a text sample written using the function ➥ ColoredText” ; document.write  “ ”  ColoredText “Another text sample, this time only with red and orange ➥ repeatedly”,”red”,”orange” ; document.write  “  ”  ColoredText “Another sample with shades of green”,”006000”,”007000”,”008000”,”009000”,”00A000”,”00B000” ; document.write  “     ”  ColoredText “Try refreshing the page a couple of times!” ; document.write  “  ”     Stop hiding -->    I can’t stress enough that the previous code is truncated. See how some of the long lines break into two lines? When you run this on your system, the lines must all be on one line as it shows in the script.  276   Script Tip 1 ➤ Rainbow Text  What is on this page is for display purposes only.  Okay, you can see that this is both the text on the page and a script. Notice that the text that appears on the page is enclosed in the argument to the function. The concept is that the text within the instance will be displayed on the page only after the function ColoredText   has had the opportunity to act upon it.  Notice also that the HTML commands that alter the text are not included with the text. Those HTML tags are contained within document.write commands. They had to be because this is a script. Without the document.write, the script wouldn’t know what to do with the text and you’d get an error.  If you tried to put the tags inside the ColoredText   instance, the script wouldn’t see them as tags but rather as text to be altered. The concept of tags outside the text is pretty easy to follow. Notice all the beginning tags are in the document.write before the text, and all the end tags are in the document.write after the text.  No big deal. Moving along ….  If you look at the first ColoredText   line of text, you see that it’s just text with nothing following it. Yet, the next two lines of text do have something following them. It might seem odd at first, but the text that had nothing following it is the most colorful.  The second line has “red” and “orange” after it. Note the displayed text is only red and orange.  The next line has a series of green hex codes; thus the text is in shades of green.  Here’s a good rule of thumb: The more colors you offer after the text, the more colorful your text will be. The more shades of the same color you offer, the more smoothly your text will appear to flow. If you put in 50 different shades of green from lightest to darkest, your text will roll through that spectrum.  What Are Those Colors? They’re arguments. See the format? First, you have text in double quotation marks and then a list of elements, in this case colors, in double quotation marks one after the other.  That’s JavaScript shorthand. You could get the exact same effect if you simply created an array of all the greens and called for one after the other, as is shown in Chapter 8, “Arrays.” It would be a lot of typing, though. This way, the browser understands that what follows are arguments, thanks to the format. What’s more, the arguments are turned into an array for you.  Now, that’s helpful.  277   JavaScript Goodies  You now have four lines of text, two of which have arguments, so you know what color they’re going to be. But how does that code that has no arguments get to be so darn  colorful?  Putting Color to the Text Now on to the fun part. Let’s get to acting on those lines of text. First off, let’s look at the really colorful ones, those without arguments:  function ColoredText   { var argLen = ColoredText.arguments.length; if  argLen == 0  {argLen = 1} var text = ColoredText.arguments[0]; var textLen = ColoredText.arguments[0].length; var defClrsArray = new Array “red”,”purple”,”cyan”,”green”,”blue”, ➥”magenta” ;   default colors, change as needed for  i=0; i<textLen; i++  { charColor = text.charAt i ;  if  argLen == 1  { colorCode = Math.floor Math.random   * defClrsArray.length ; tempStr = charColor.fontcolor defClrsArray[colorCode]  } else { colorCode = i %  argLen - 1 ; tempStr = charColor.fontcolor ColoredText.arguments[colorCode+1]  } document.write tempStr  } }    Stop hiding -->    Again, the script is a little out of order. You’ll need to make a point of getting it into the same format as the display in the script.  The function isn’t overly long, but it does get goofy at times, so let’s examine it in two parts. First, I’ll discuss the variables and how the non-argument text is created.  278   Script Tip 1 ➤ Rainbow Text  The name of the function is Coloredtext  . That’s the same name as the function that wrote the text to the page. Actually, it was the same function. By placing the text inside the function instance, you literally pass the text to the function. It’s after the text is given color that it’s written to the page.  Let’s start at the top.  The variable argLen is given the value of the argument’s length. Remember, I previously said that the color names that follow the display text are arguments. The JavaScript knows they’re arguments because of the format in which they are presented.  Obviously, the first line of text does not have any arguments. That would make the argu- ment equal to zero. You can’t have that, so the next blip of code asks whether the argu- ment is equal to zero. If it is, the variable argLen is given the value of 1. That will still enable you to separate it from those that have at least two arguments, in the second line  of text.  JavaScript has already turned those arguments into an array, so you need to get some hier- archy statements into array format to deal with them. That’s these two:  var text = ColoredText.arguments[0]; var textLen = ColoredText.arguments[0].length;  The first line enables you to pull out a specific argument by calling for its array number. The second tells you the length of the array, meaning the number of items in the array.  The next line is a default list of colors. This is where the color in the non-argument text comes from. If there isn’t a set of arguments, use these:  var defClrsArray = new Array “red”,”purple”,”cyan”,”green”,”blue”, ➥”magenta” ;  Remember I said the script gets a little goofy? Here it comes. The next little section deals with attaching color to each of the letters in the display text:  for  i=0; i<textLen; i++  {  It starts with a for loop. The loop is set up with three conditions, each separated by a semi- colon. The first condition sets a value to a variable; the second condition determines how often the loop should occur. In this case, the loop continues only as long as there are let- ters. See that? As long as i is less than the length of the text, it keeps looping.  Finally, the third condition does something to the variable if the loop isn’t finished. In this case it adds one. The double plus sign does the adding. The effect is that each letter in the  279   JavaScript Goodies  run of text is looked at one after the other until there’s no more text. The following code sets a variable name to the character represented by i:  charColor = text.charAt i ;  Remember, this loops through again and again, so each time it loops, charAt i  is differ- ent. The command charAt   pulls a specific letter out of a run of text. In this case, the let- ter it pulls is the letter equal to the number represented by i. As the loop rolls, i increases.  The following actually sets color:  if  argLen == 1  { colorCode = Math.floor Math.random   * defClrsArray.length ; tempStr = charColor.fontcolor defClrsArray[colorCode]  }  An If statement starts it off testing whether argLen is equal to 1. We know it is in the first line of text because I set it that way earlier. Remember that? If there are no arguments, argLen is equal to 1. In this case, it’s equal to 1.  The variable colorCode is given a specific value through a little math. Just like algebra class, let’s start inside the parentheses. Math.random generates a random number between 0 and 1 without choosing either 0 or 1. It could be .334 or .562 or anywhere in that range of num- bers. That random number is then multiplied by the length of the default color array.  The number resulting from that equation is then floored by Math.floor. The floor takes whatever number is inside the parentheses and drops it to the lower whole number. For example, if the answer in the parentheses was 2.6, Math.floor would turn it into 2.  Yes, there’s an equal to that going the other way. Math.ceil pushes the number to the ceil- ing, or the next higher full number. The number 2.6 would therefore become 3.  Here’s an interesting thing to keep in mind: Notice how some arrays are set and some are random? If you refresh the example a few times, you’ll notice that the lines with set arrays remain static and display the same color scheme. Those that use random colors, however, change.  Keep that in mind: Use this script either for random or a set color scheme.  And speaking of color ….  Assigning Color The next line is a hierarchy statement that uses the default array of colors, represented  by the variable charColor, and assigns the color as a fontcolor to what’s inside the   280   Script Tip 1 ➤ Rainbow Text  parentheses. The command fontcolor works just like   in HTML. If you look at the source code of this script in Netscape Navigator, you’ll see letter after letter written with individual font color tags.  If the previous line generated the number 2, cyan would be the color plucked from the array. Remember, JavaScript starts counting at 0. That cyan color would be set into a  fontcolor by the array statement inside the parentheses.  From the default color array, defClrsArray, pluck out the number represented by colorCode.  Next, assign it all to a variable named tempStr.  Now you have the colors yanked from the default list. But what about those texts that actually have arguments? And how does that text get written to the page?  We’ve already used up just about the entire function. Now we’re interested in just this:  else { colorCode = i %  argLen - 1 ; tempStr = charColor.fontcolor ColoredText.arguments[colorCode+1]  } document.write tempStr  } }  See how it starts with else? That’s because I cut it off in the middle of an if statement. If the display text carries an argument with it, this else statement is brought into play.  The variable colorCode is given a numeric value through a fairly fancy equation.  The value of i is % against the argument length minus one. For example, say you have six arguments. It would be six colors in this case. Let’s say the for loop has rolled a few times and is now equal to 5.  The percent sign is a mathematical operator that returns the remainder of an equation. So let’s do the math.  5 %  6–1  produces 5 % 5. There is no remainder, so 0 is returned. That is equal to the first element in the array created through the argument. The loop rolls again, and now i is equal to 6.  6 %  6–1  results in 6 % 5, which equals 1.2. The remainder, 2, is returned. The third color in the array is therefore returned  JavaScript starts counting at 0 .  281   JavaScript Goodies  The next line works just like its partner. The charColor.fontcolor is given the value repre- sented by the array of arguments plucked out by whatever number is returned by the line we just discussed plus one. That value is assigned to the variable tempStr.  Again, in the world of JavaScript, fontcolor is equal to   in HTML. Look at the source code in Navigator to see them all.  That’s pretty slick, eh?  Lastly, a basic document.write puts tempStr on the page and we’re done.  282   Script Tip 2  Full Text Date Script  A reader wanted to post a date that goes beyond the basic number returns. He wanted the date to display in text. I am the author of the following script, which I wrote to present the day and the month in text.  As an added bonus, the script adds the “th”, “st”, “nd”, or “rd” depending on the day of the month. I also used a new method to extract a four-digit year, rather than a two-digit year. It’s a bit long, but it works pretty well. It looks like this:     DaysofWeek = new Array   DaysofWeek[0]=”Sunday” DaysofWeek[1]=”Monday” DaysofWeek[2]=”Tuesday” DaysofWeek[3]=”Wednesday” DaysofWeek[4]=”Thursday” DaysofWeek[5]=”Friday” DaysofWeek[6]=”Saturday”   JavaScript Goodies  Months = new Array   Months[0]=”January” Months[1]=”February” Months[2]=”March” Months[3]=”April” Months[4]=”May” Months[5]=”June” Months[6]=”July” Months[7]=”August” Months[8]=”September” Months[9]=”October” Months[10]=”November” Months[11]=”December”  RightNow = new Date    var day = DaysofWeek[RightNow.getDay  ] var date = RightNow.getDate   var Month = Months[RightNow.getMonth  ] var Year = RightNow.getFullYear    if  date == 1  date == 21  date == 31  {ender = “ st ”}  else if  date == 2  date == 22  {ender = “ nd ”}  else if  date == 3  date == 23  {ender = “ rd ”}  else {ender = “ th ”}  document.write “Today is “ +day+ “ “ +Month+ “ “ +date+ ender+ “, ➥” +Year+ “.”     The script produces the result shown in Figure ST2.1. I’ve made it a little bigger in the screen capture than it will come out on your page simply so you can better see the format.  284   Script Tip 2 ➤ Full Text Data Script  Figure ST2.1 A great display of the date in a usable format.  To see the effect on your own computer, click Script Tip Two in your download packet or see it online at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com stips scripttip31.html.  The code is available for copy and paste at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com stips  scripttip31script.html or by viewing the source of the page in your download packet.  Let’s start from the top. This script relies on two arrays. The first array lists the days of the week, and the second array lists the months of the year. Here’s the first array, the days of the week:  DaysofWeek = new Array   DaysofWeek[0]=”Sunday” DaysofWeek[1]=”Monday” DaysofWeek[2]=”Tuesday” DaysofWeek[3]=”Wednesday” DaysofWeek[4]=”Thursday” DaysofWeek[5]=”Friday” DaysofWeek[6]=”Saturday”  An array is just what you see—a listing of things the JavaScript can refer to later. This spe- cific array is made up of text strings. Note that each day of the week is surrounded by dou- ble quotation marks. Those double quotation marks tell the browser that what is contained within should be treated as just text. However, arrays can contain just about any text, com- mand, number, or combination of the three you want.  285   JavaScript Goodies  Each array starts with a line that announces to the browser that an array is starting. That line looks like this:  DaysofWeek = new Array    The format is similar to setting up a new Date  , which you’ll actually do later. The line announces a new Array   and gives the array a name. In this case, the name is DaysofWeek. I made the name up just like I would a variable name because, in reality, it is a variable name. It’s just that this variable has multiple values.  Notice that the seven days of the week are numbered 0–6. It’s what’s called an index number. The format is to offer the name of the array, square brackets around the index number, and then the item that is being indexed. In this case it’s a text string, so the dou- ble quotation marks surround the text.  The getDay   method returns the day of the week, but it returns that day as a numeric value, 0–6 representing Sunday through Saturday. Now do you see the reason for the order of days? We’ve set up an array of days that is equal to the returns that getDay   will return. A little later, we’ll get into why this is important.  Now that you’re somewhat familiar with the format of an array, let’s take a look at the sec- ond one. This one deals with the months of the year:  Months = new Array   Months[0]=”January” Months[1]=”February” Months[2]=”March” Months[3]=”April” Months[4]=”May” Months[5]=”June” Months[6]=”July” Months[7]=”August” Months[8]=”September” Months[9]=”October” Months[10]=”November” Months[11]=”December”  286  The name of the array is Months, and the months are arranged in order 0–11 because those are the numbers returned by using the getMonth   method.  Okay, now you’re up to speed with the concept and structure of an array. You can begin calling for the array index through the getDay   and getMonth   methods.   Script Tip 2 ➤ Full Text Data Script  Taking Elements from the Arrays Here’s the code you’re worried about right now:  RightNow = new Date   var day = DaysofWeek[RightNow.getDay  ] var date = RightNow.getDate   var Month = Months[RightNow.getMonth  ] var Year = RightNow.getFullYear    The first line should be very near and dear to your heart by now. The variable name RightNow is assigned to a new Date   object. That new date  object  contains all the infor- mation regarding the current date and time. Next, you’ll use a couple of methods to extract from that Date   object the day, date, month, and year.  Let me explain this first line because, after you get this line down, the rest just falls into place:  var day = DaysofWeek[RightNow.getDay  ]  The line starts by assigning the variable name day to the result of what follows.  What follows is the variable name of the first array, DaysofWeek. Now you know that this line will act on the first array, which is the one that lists the days of the week.  The format is the same as one of the DaysofWeek array items. Square brackets immediately follow the array name, and inside those brackets is the code that returns the day of the week: RightNow.getDay  .  So what’s going to happen is the RightNow.getDay   will return a number, 0–6, representing the day of the week. Let’s say the number returned is 4. In the DaysofWeek array, 4 means Thursday. Thus, the variable day now represents Thursday. When you call on the variable day, the text Thursday is returned.  The next line of code  var date = RightNow.getDate    follows a similar format but is not attached to an array. This is the number day of the month, and you want that to remain a number.  The next line follows the array format exactly, except this time around you’re looking for the month of the year:  var Month = Months[RightNow.getMonth  ]  287   JavaScript Goodies  Let’s say it’s May. RightNow.getMonth   would therefore return the number 4. That’s equal to the text string May in the Months array. Thus, when you call on the variable name Month, you’ll get the text string May.  The last line of code might be new to you:  var Year = RightNow.getFullYear    In the past, I’ve used the older getYear   method to extract the year from the Date   object. Well, that works, but it returns only a two-digit year. That created some problems when Y2K came and went. Because we’re past the year 1999, you should start to use only the getFullYear   method because it returns the full four-digit year. You should start using it across the board when you want a year displayed.  Now you have all the returns ready to go. You have the day in text, the number date, the month in text, and a four-digit year. All you need to do now is decide which two-letter extension should print after the day number. Of course, it has to be the correct two letters; you don’t want your text to read Tuesday, May 11rd, 1999.  That would be bad.  Adding Those Two Letters After you write a computer language for a while, you start to find sections of commands you really enjoy using. In HTML, I really like tables. I think they’re great. In JavaScript, it’s the if else conditional statements. I’m amazed at how flexible and powerful they really are. I used another one in this script—you’ve probably seen it by now. It looks like this:  if  date == 1  date == 21  date == 31  {ender = “ st ”} else if  date == 2  date == 22  {ender = “ nd ”} else if  date == 3  date == 23  {ender = “ rd ”} else {ender = “ th ”}  The purpose of the previous conditional statements is to look at the number returned from the RightNow.getDate   object.method statement. Remember that you assigned that num- ber to return the variable name date.  288   The purpose of these lines of code is to look at the number and decide which two-letter extension should follow. Let’s think it through logically. Yes, you could set up a condition for every number 1–31, but that’s really going overboard.  Script Tip 2 ➤ Full Text Data Script  There are only three times when the “st” is needed.  There are only two times when the “nd” is needed.  There are only two times when the “rd” is needed.  The rest of the numbers get the “th”.  So, you should set up the conditions as follows:  if  date == 1  date == 21  date == 31  {ender = “ st ”}  The first statement reads, “If the date is equal to 1 or equal to  notice the double equal signs  21 or equal to 31, then the variable ender equals  st ”. That would help produce “1st”, “21st”, and “31st”.  You probably already know that the HTML   makes text appear as the smaller letters up high. You can also set that to   if you want, but I don’t think the effect is quite as nice.  Did you catch that double vertical lines mean “or”? That’s a great way of adding multiple conditions that have the same result all in one line of code rather than writing each condi- tion out on its own. If you don’t know, you’ll find that vertical line on the same keyboard button as the backslash, usually just above the Enter key.  As with all if statements, if the first condition does not apply, the script rolls over to the next one in line. It looks like this:  else if  date == 2  date == 22  {ender = “ nd ”}  else if  date == 3  date == 23  {ender = “ rd ”}  This tests whether the date number is either 2 or 22. If so, ender is equal to  nd . If not, you move along:  289   Is the date 3 or 23? If so, ender is equal to  rd . If not, you move on:  JavaScript Goodies  else {ender = “ th ”}  This is a catchall. You set up a conditional system that tests the date number return over three sets of if statements: If the number meets none of the statements, this else state- ment handles it. If the number gets this far—and it’s a darn good bet it will because “th” is the most frequently used text—ender is equal to  th .  Now that you have all the parts, use a basic document.write   statement to get it onto the page for all the world to see:  document.write “Today is “ +day+ “ “ +Month+ “ “ +date+ ender+ “, “ +Year+ “.”   Got it? Good.  290   Script Tip 3  Random Banner Ad Script  Again, this one was by request. It’s a random banner script. I wrote this one, so feel free to use it. The script uses two arrays and five images to get its effect. The script posts a random banner. What’s more, the banner is active. You can click it to go where the banner reads. It’s a quick script that can be used in myriad ways.  I have every intention of doing this entire script quickly. It’s all review:     banners = new Array   banners[0]=” ” banners[1]=” ” banners[2]=” ” banners[3]=” ” banners[4]=” ”   document.write “  ” +TheImage+ “  ➥ ”     To see the effect on your own computer, click Script Tip Three in your download packet or see it online at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com stips scripttip34.html.  The code is available for copy and paste at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com stips   scripttip34script.html or by viewing the source of the page in your download packet.  JavaScript Goodies  GoTo = new Array   GoTo[0]=”http:  www.htmlgoodies.com” GoTo[1]=”http:  www.developer.com” GoTo[2]=”http:  www.mtv.com” GoTo[3]=”http:  www.vh1.com” GoTo[4]=”http:  www.whitehouse.gov”  var Number = Math.round 4 * Math.random   ;  var TheLink = GoTo[Number] var TheImage = banners[Number]  The Arrays  banners = new Array   banners[0]=” ” banners[1]=” ” banners[2]=” ” banners[3]=” ” banners[4]=” ”  GoTo = new Array   GoTo[0]=”http:  www.htmlgoodies.com” GoTo[1]=”http:  www.developer.com” GoTo[2]=”http:  www.mtv.com” GoTo[3]=”http:  www.vh1.com” GoTo[4]=”http:  www.whitehouse.gov”  292  The script starts off with two arrays. The first array, named banners, is a series of five images. Those are our banners. Figure ST3.1 shows what banner0.gif through banner4.gif look like.   Script Tip 3 ➤ Random Banner Ad Script  Figure ST3.1 The five images you’ll need for this script.  You can grab each of the four images at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com stips banner0.gif through http:  www.htmlgoodies.com stips banner4.gif.  Notice that double quotation marks surround each indexed item so you know each is to be handled as if it were just simple text. Notice also that no quotation marks are around the zero or the name of the image. That would mess up the script by stopping the line too early and result in an error.  The second array contains the URLs that will match the banners. Note that the URLs are in the same order as the banners. That way, you can use the same number to call for an ele- ment from each array. For example, the first banner reads “HTML Goodies Home Page.” The first GoTo array item is the URL for HTML Goodies. Now you can use the number 0 to return both the Goodies banner and the Goodies URL. With me?  The Random Number  var Number = Math.round 4 * Math.random   ;  The variable number is assigned a random number between 0 and 4.  That number is created by multiplying 4 times a random point between .001 and .999 cre- ated by the Math.random commands. The numbers returned can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. The Math.round object.method statement ensures that the number is rounded off so there are no remainders in the result.  293   JavaScript Goodies  Calling for the Array Index  var TheLink = GoTo[Number] var TheImage = banners[Number]  Two new variable names are created. TheLink represents the text return from the GoTo array, whereas the variable TheImage represents the return from the banners array.  In both cases, the same number—the random number created earlier—is used to choose the item from both arrays. That way you know all the banners URLs will line right up.  Writing It to the Page Next, you’ll use JavaScript to build a line of HTML. Because this HTML creates something on the page, remember to place this script wherever on the page you want the effect to appear:  document.write “  ” +TheImage+ “  ➥ ”   You’re using a document.write   statement to get it to the page. Notice that the A HREF command is fully built—you’re just filling in the blanks. The two text strings from the arrays are placed, and the entire line of HTML is centered.  When the page displays, the banner is centered on the page and is active to the URL it is representing.  See how we’ve taken parts from other scripts and built something new? You can do that. Using just what’s on this page, you could make a random line of text come up on your page or use a function to enact the script so it offers random fortunes, like the Magic 8- Ball. You can do it.  294   Script Tip 4  Frames Script  If you ever have trouble writing code for frames, like I do, then this is the script for you.  All you do is ask for a certain number of frames in rows and columns, and the script writes it out for you.  On top of its functionality, it offers some new JavaScript coding to look at. Plus, it is easily understandable when you start to break it down.  Here it is:       Frame Maker       JavaScript Goodies    Below are Variables that will be used in each paste function var top=” ” + “\r” + “ My Frame Page ” + “\r” + ➥”  ” var nf=” ” + “\r” + “You need a frames-capable browser to ➥view this page.” + “\r” + “ ” + “\r” + “ ” var f=” ” var bc=”bordercolor=blue>” var MW=”marginwidth=0” var MH=”marginheight=0”   Below are six functions that produce frame code in the TEXTAREA box function framesa   { document.Framer.Fillit.value=top + “\r” + “<frameset cols=50%,* “ + “ “ + bc + “\r” + “<frame src=w.htm” +” “ + “name=One” + “\r” + “scrolling=auto” + “ “ + MW + “ “ + MH + “ “ + ➥”noresize=yes>” + “\r” + “<frame src=x.htm” +” “ + “name=Two” + “\r” + “scrolling=auto” + “ “ + MW + “ “ + MH + “ “ + ➥”noresize=yes>” + “\r” + f + “\r” + nf }  function framesb   { document.Framer.Fillit.value=top + “\r” + “<frameset rows=50%,* “ + “ “ + bc + “\r” + “<frame src=w.htm” +” “ + “name=One” + “\r” + “scrolling=auto” + “ “ + MW + “ “ + MH + “ “ + ➥”noresize=yes>” + “\r” + “<frame src=x.htm” +” “ + “name=Two” + “\r” + “scrolling=auto” + “ “ + MW + “ “ + MH + “ “ + ➥”noresize=yes>” + “\r” + f + “\r” + nf }  function framemixa   { document.Framer.Fillit.value=top + “\r” + “ ” + “\r” + “<frame src=w.htm” + “ “ + “name=One” + “ “ + “scrolling=yes”  296   Script Tip 4 ➤ Frames Script  + “\r” + MW + “ “ + MH + “ “ + “noresize=yes>” + “\r” + “ ” + “\r” + “<frame src=x.htm” + “ “ + “name=Two” + “ “ + MW + “\r” + MH + “ “ + “scrolling=yes>” + “\r” + “<frame src=y.htm” + “ “ + “name=Three” + “ “ + “scrolling=no” + “\r” + MW + “ “ + MH + “ “ + “noresize=no>” + “\r” + f + “\r” + f + “\r” + nf }  function frames3v   { document.Framer.Fillit.value=top + “\r” + “<frameset cols=33%,33%,*” + “ “ + bc + “\r” + “<frame src=w.htm name=One” + “ “ + “scrolling=auto” + “\r” + MW + “ “ + MH + “ “ + “noresize=yes>” + “\r” + “<frame src=x.htm” + “ “ + “name=Two” + “ “ + ➥”scrolling=auto” + “\r” + MW + “ “ + MH + “ “ + “noresize=yes>” + “\r” + “<frame src=y.htm” + “ “ + “name=Three” + “ “ + “scrolling=auto” + “\r” + MW + “ “ + MH + “ “ + “noresize=yes>” + “\r” + f + “\r” + nf }  function frames3h   { document.Framer.Fillit.value=top + “\r” + “<frameset rows=33%,33%,*” + “ “ + bc + “\r” + “<frame src=w.htm name=One” + “ “ + “scrolling=auto” + “\r” + MW + “ “ + MH + “ “ + “noresize=yes>” + “\r” + “<frame src=x.htm” + “ “ + “name=Two” + “ “ + ➥”scrolling=auto” + “\r” + MW + “ “ + MH + “ “ + “noresize=yes>” + “\r” + “<frame src=y.htm” + “ “ + “name=Three” + “ “ + “scrolling=auto” + “\r” + MW + “ “ + MH + “ “ + “noresize=yes>” + “\r” + f + “\r” + nf }  297   JavaScript Goodies  function framemixb   { document.Framer.Fillit.value=top + “\r” + “ ” + “\r” + “ ” + “\r” + “<frame src=w.htm” + “ “ + “name=One” + “ “ + “scrolling=no” + “ “ + MW + “\r” + MH + “ “ + “noresize=yes>” + “\r” + “<frame src=x.htm” + “ “ + “name=Two” + “ “ + MW + “\r” + MH + “ “ + “scrolling=yes>” + “\r” + f + “\r” + “ ” + “\r” + “<frame src=y.htm” + “ “ + “name=Three” + “\r” + “scrolling=no” +” “ + MW + “ “ + MH + “ “ + “noresize=no>” + “\r” + “<frame src=z.htm” +” “ + “name=Four” + “ “ + “scrolling=yes” + “\r” + MW + “ “ + MH + “ “ + “noresize=yes>” + “\r” + f + “\r” + f + “\r” + nf }   Below is the function that copies text from one box to the other function Copy   { if  document.Framer.Fillit.value==””  { alert  ‘The top box is empty.

Normally, when FORM commands are involved, I go after those first. Not this time. I want to start by talking about how the frame code is created.  300   Script Tip 4 ➤ Frames Script  If you were going to create a script like this, you might find yourself writing the same things again and again. Every frame code requires the HTML and TITLE flags. You’d also write the NOFRAMES code again and again. Yes, you could write it again and again, but it would be a whole lot easier if you simply assigned a short variable name to the code; then you could call it all up with just a couple of letters.  That’s what was done in the first block of code:  var top=” ” + “\r” + “ My Frame Page ” + “\r” +”  ”  var nf=” ” + “\r” + “You need a frames-capable browser to ➥view this page.” + “\r” + “ ” + “\r” + “ ”  var f=” ” var bc=”bordercolor=blue>” var MW=”marginwidth=0” var MH=”marginheight=0”     My Frame Page      You get to pick out what each of the variables represent, so I’ll just discuss a couple of them. With this, all you need to do is call for “top” and you’ll get the entire text string:  Won’t that make life a little easier? Now, you might notice the code \r stuck in there. Look again and notice where it’s stuck. It’s put in as if it were text  double quotation marks are around it . See what it does? It produces a line break when the text string is displayed. How’s that for a good trick? Just make sure the slash is a backslash—a forward slash does not make the line break.  So, now you have top for the header information, nf for the noframes text, f for the end frameset flag, bc for the body’s background color, MW for the marginwidth, and MH for the marginheight.  The First Frame Function Moving down the script, let’s look at the first, and easiest, frame function. This is the func- tion that produces the text for two vertical frames:  function framesa   {  301   JavaScript Goodies  document.Framer.Fillit.value=top + “\r” + “<frameset cols=50%,* “ + “ “ + bc + “\r” + “<frame src=w.htm” +” “ + “name=One” + “\r” + “scrolling=auto” + “ “ + MW + “ “ + MH + “ “ + ➥”noresize=yes>” + “\r” + “<frame src=x.htm” +” “ + “name=Two” + “\r” + “scrolling=auto” + “ “ + MW + “ “ + MH + “ “ + ➥”noresize=yes>” + “\r” + f + “\r” + nf }  It really looks cryptic, huh? Well, let’s break it down. When the function is called for, the first thing you’ll get is top. That’s the header information. Then you get a line break and then the frameset flag. The background color  bc  then is added and a line break. The first frame window’s source is next, adding a NAME, a line break, the scrolling=auto text, the marginwidth  MW , marginheight  MH , and finally the noresize=yes text.  You’ll notice a lot of blank spaces were created by using the code  “ “ . That’s the author’s preference. I always add spaces by putting a space on the end of the text inside the double quotation marks. This is another method that works just as well.  That format is followed again for the next frame window source: a line break, the end frameset flag  f , and another line break. Then the noframes text  nf  is added.  Put it all together and you get the following display:     My Frame Page       <frame src=w.htm name=One scrolling=auto marginwidth=0 marginheight=0 noresize=yes> <frame src=x.htm name=Two scrolling=auto marginwidth=0 marginheight=0 noresize=yes>     You need a frames-capable browser to view this page.      That format was followed six times until the author created the six FRAME code functions: framesa  , framesb  , framemixa  , frames3v  , frames3h  , and framemixb  . Read them through—go slowly because they get confusing. I was impressed the first time I went through it. It’s a pretty nice bit of coding.  302   Script Tip 4 ➤ Frames Script  The Buttons Let’s jump to the bottom again to get a handle on the buttons. You’ve probably noticed by now that this script has many of the same function types again and again. A bunch of but- tons display, but they all work pretty much the same way. Each has an onClick event han- dler that triggers a function found farther up the page.  First, here are a few names. Take a look at the code toward the bottom. You see that multi- ple FORM elements are used. The NAME of the form itself is Framer. The top TEXTAREA box is named Fillit, and the bottom box is named Pastebox.  When I spoke about the six frame functions last time, I neglected the code document.Framer.Fillit.value that starts each one. That code points to the first TEXTAREA box, setting its value. That’s why the text appears where it does.  That’s easy enough, but how does the text get pasted from the top box to the bottom box? Again, a button is involved, triggering the paste. The button’s purpose is to fire the func- tion Copy  . It looks like this:  function Copy   { if  document.Framer.Fillit.value==””  { alert  ‘The top box is empty.’  } else { document.Framer.Pastebox.value=document.Framer.Fillit.value } }  The function is an if else conditional statement. If the top box  document.Framer.Fillit.value  is empty  “” , throw up an alert that says so. Otherwise, what is in document.Framer.Fillit.value should now go into document.Framer.Fillit.value.  So far, so good, but there are two more buttons to deal with.  The Start Over button is similar to the one you just looked at. In fact, it fires the same Copy   function. The only difference is that it first launches an alert box that is intended to put you at ease. The button code looks like this:  <INPUT onClick=”alert ‘Misfire? No problem.’ ;Copy  ” type=button value=”Start Over”>  See how it’s done? The alert code is followed by a semicolon and then the function name. Nice effect.  303   JavaScript Goodies  The Clear All button fires another function named reset  . Don’t bother looking for it; it isn’t there. Reset is a function built into the browser. When you make Guestbook forms, you create a reset button through this code:     In this case, the coding is just a little different to allow you to put text on the reset button. Here’s how the author did it:     One click and everything goes away! Just remember that for this effect, every FORM element must be between the same FORM and  FORM flags; otherwise, only those elements within the reset’s FORM flags will erase.  All that’s left to do is open the new window and display it.  Showing the Code The button that displays the frame code in a new window looks like this:     The function view   looks like this:  function view   { if  document.Framer.Pastebox.value==””  { alert  ‘The paste box is empty.’  return false; }  else { alert ‘If you like the results, paste it to a text editor!’  boat = open  “”,”DisplayWindow”  see = parent.document.Framer.Pastebox.value boat.document.write  see  return true; } }  The function is again set up as an if else conditional statement. The purpose is to post an alert box if the user attempts to view when nothing is there to view:  if  document.Framer.Pastebox.value==””  { alert  ‘The paste box is empty.’   304   Script Tip 4 ➤ Frames Script  return false; }  If the bottom TEXTAREA box is empty  “” , the alert goes up and the return is false. That means the script dies right there. It doesn’t go any further.  Otherwise, the following occurs:  else { alert ‘If you like the results, paste it to a text editor!’  boat = open  “”,”DisplayWindow”  see = parent.document.Framer.Pastebox.value boat.document.write  see  return true;  Assign the code  “”,”DisplayWindow”  to the variable boat. Why boat? I don’t know; ask the author. Notice the empty quotation marks at the beginning. That is where a page URL would normally sit. Because it’s empty, it’s forcing the script to look at itself for the infor- mation to display.  Next, the variable see is assigned the value of what is in the bottom TEXTAREA box  parent. document.Framer.Pastebox.value . Now the command parent sits in front because you’re dealing with two windows and you want the information taken from the window that spawned the new one—the parent.  Into boat  the new window , you document.write see, the contents of the bottom TEXTAREA box found on the parent window. Then, it returns true, which completes the event.  There you go. I’ll bet the first time you saw this one, you thought it was going to take 10 tips to complete. That’s part of the beauty of JavaScript programming. You can use the same format again and again in the same script to get different results. I only had to show you one frame code function, and you could get them all.  305    Script Tip 5  Search Multiple Search Engines  When I started HTML Goodies, oh so long ago, I was sent a lot of scripts that were posted straightaway. I needed to fill space at first. As the months went on, I became more selective in what should be posted. I guess the two biggest criteria in posting a script were these: Is it original, and is it functional?  I received a bunch of scripts that would change the background of a page using everything from event handlers to a person’s name to make the change. It’s clever, but not overly use- ful. After you have the basic concept of changing the background color, you pretty much can take it from there.  I received the following multiple search engine script right in the middle of all those back- ground-color–changing scripts. The script was much larger than you see it here. I’ve cut it down a bit for this series of Script Tips. It used to search ten different engines, now it only searches five. Of course, by the end, you’ll know it well enough to add as many searches as you’d like.   JavaScript Goodies  The script is quite functional in that it allows many searches from one page. Results are posted in a new window so you never leave the search page. Plus, you don’t have to per- form each search individually. You could put in a keyword  or keywords, cleverly enough  and five search engines will return their results in five separate windows.  It’s a very helpful, and involved, script. People have been asking that I get into some more advanced JavaScript. Well, this should fit the bill.  Here’s the code:     function wordsplit items  { var charect = “”; for  var n = 1 ; n <= items.length ; n++  { if  items.substring n-1,n  == “ “  { charect+=”+”; } else { charect+=items.substring n-1,n ; } } return charect; }  function search   { var keywords=document.searching.query.value; var search1; var search2; var search3; var search4; var search5;  key=wordsplit keywords ;  if document.searching.yahoo.checked  { search1= document.searching.yahoo.value; search1+=key;  wind=window.open search1,”newwindow1”,”width=700,height=200, ➥scrollbars=yes” ;  }  308   Script Tip 5 ➤ Search Multiple Search Engines  else  if document.searching.altavista.checked  { search2 = document.searching.altavista.value; search2+=key;  wind=window.open search2,”newwindow2”,”width=700,height=200, ➥scrollbars=yes” ;  } if document.searching.webcrawler.checked  { search3 = document.searching.webcrawler.value; search3+=key;  wind=window.open search3,”newwindow3”,”width=700,height=200, ➥scrollbars=yes” ;  } if document.searching.lycos.checked  { search4 = document.searching.lycos.value; search4+=key;  wind=window.open search4,”newwindow4”,”width=700,height=200, ➥scrollbars=yes” ;  } if document.searching.excite.checked  { search5 = document.searching.excite.value; search5+=key;  wind=window.open search5,”newwindow5”,”width=700,height=200, ➥scrollbars=yes” ;  }  }     309   JavaScript Goodies    Enter the Key word :      Select the Search Engine s :    <INPUT TYPE=”checkbox” NAME=”yahoo” ➥VALUE=”http:  search.yahoo.com search?p=”> Yahoo   <INPUT TYPE=”checkbox” NAME=”altavista “VALUE=”http:  www.altavista.digital.com  ➥cgi-bin query?pg=q&what=web&fmt=.&q=”>Altavista   <INPUT TYPE=”checkbox” NAME=”webcrawler” VALUE=” http:  search.excite.com  ➥search.gw?c=web&lk=webcrawler&onload=&s=j >WebCrawler   <INPUT TYPE=”checkbox” NAME=”excite” ➥VALUE=”http:  www.excite.com search.gw?trace=a&search=”>Excite   <INPUT TYPE=”checkbox” NAME=”lycos” ➥VALUE=”http:  www.lycos.com cgi-bin pursuit?query=”>Lycos          Put in your keyword and search away. It’ll look like Figure ST5.1.  Figure ST5.1 The search interface is “framed” by the three  windows that pop up from each of the three chosen search engines.  310   Script Tip 5 ➤ Search Multiple Search Engines  To see the effect on your own computer, click Script Tip Five in your download packet, or see it online at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com stips scripttip42.html.

As with most scripts that include FORM elements, I want to start with them. If you’re a regu- lar Script Tip reader, you’re probably familiar with NAMEs and VALUEs. Still, read this over. You’ll find this form used in a different way from what you’re used to.  The form code looks like this:     Enter the Keyword :     Select the Search Engine s :   <INPUT TYPE=”checkbox” NAME=”yahoo” VALUE=”http:  search.yahoo.com search?p=”> Yahoo  <INPUT TYPE=”checkbox” NAME=”altavista” VALUE=”http:  www.altavista.digital.com cgi-bin query?pg=q&what= ➥web&fmt=.&q=”>Altavista  <INPUT TYPE=”checkbox” NAME=”webcrawler” VALUE=” http:  search.excite.com search.gw?c=web&lk=webcrawler&onload=&s=j “> ➥WebCrawler  <INPUT TYPE=”checkbox” NAME=”excite” VALUE=”http:  www.excite.com search.gw?trace=a&search=”>Excite  <INPUT TYPE=”checkbox” NAME=”lycos” VALUE=”http:  www.lycos.com cgi-bin pursuit?query=”>Lycos         Okay, you have three things to look for here. First is the text box in which the user enters the keyword to be searched. The second is the code that allows the choice of search engines, and the third is the button that triggers the function to search.  311   JavaScript Goodies  NAMEs The name of the FORM itself is searching, and the text box name is query. Each of the check boxes is given the name of the search engine it represents.  Finally, the button triggers a function called search  .  Now you know enough to start constructing hierarchy statements, but unlike other forms you’ve dealt with here, this has multiple hierarchy statements depending on what the user chose. We’ll get into how the JavaScript knows which has been clicked later.  The Check Boxes Yes, this could have also been done with radio buttons and, with some special coding, a drop-down menu. The reason the author chose check boxes is because that enables the user to check as many as desired. It doesn’t limit the choice. Let’s look at the first check box code:  <INPUT TYPE=”checkbox” NAME=”yahoo ➥”VALUE=”http:  search.yahoo.com search?p=”> Yahoo  It’s a basic INPUT TYPE=”checkbox” format. This check box represents Yahoo!, so that’s the NAME. Now, here’s the trick: see the VALUE? That VALUE is the URL that attaches to the Yahoo! search engine. If you attached the keywords entered by the user to the end of that URL, you’d get a search performed.  It’s the same with the other four check boxes. Each VALUE is equal to the URL required to perform a search on that particular engine. The code is pretty easy to find. You just go to the search page of the engine and look at the source code; I’m sure that’s where the author got it.  So, you have a text box that assigns the variable query to keywords. You also have check boxes that return URLs of search engines. Put the two together, and you get a full search string. Seeing the process yet?  Replacing the Space with a Plus Sign I have found that one of the hardest things about writing a JavaScript is trying to set up code so that every possible thing a user could do is handled in one way or another. I always forget something.  Many of you know that when using a search engine, a plus sign  +  between words is a good idea to help to search. Let’s look at the code that searches the keywords entered in this script. If a space is found, a plus sign replaces it.  312   I am worried about the code that makes up the first function, wordsplit items . It looks like this:  Script Tip 5 ➤ Search Multiple Search Engines  function wordsplit items  { var charect = “”; for  var n = 1 ; n <= items.length ; n++  { if  items.substring n-1,n  == “ “  { charect+=”+”; } else { charect+=items.substring n-1,n ; } } return charect; }  Now, this is not the function that performs the search. That function is called search  , and it’s coming later. This function is one that is called upon as part of search. Rather than going back and forth, I’ll tell you what this does so that you can just plug it in later.  Notice the function has the parameter items in the instance. That means that items is returned to the function to be acted on.  The function begins with a variable, charect, being set and assigned the value of nothing. See the empty quotation marks? That means “no space”.  Next a loop is created with this code:  for  var n = 1 ; n <= items.length ; n++   The loop’s format follows this pattern: A variable, n, is created and given the value of 1. Then a condition is set, which states that n is less than, or equal to, the length of charac- ters in the item. Finally, the third element of the loops states what should happen as long as the condition is not met. The code n++ means that n should move upward incrementally. Double minus signs mean moving downward in the same fashion.  So, what in the world does this do? It looks at each character in the item one by one. Again, this is a little out of order. The item is given the same value as what the user writes into the text box. Stay with me; that will happen soon. For now, just take my word that that’s what it means.  Each time a new character is looked at, an if else statement is employed. If the character is a space, that space is replaced with a plus sign  + . If it is not a space  else , the character stays the same and the loop fires up again, checking the next character.  313   JavaScript Goodies  This happens as long as n is less than the length of characters in the text entered by the users. Every character is checked, and every empty space is given the new value of  + .  Then, after all the characters have been checked, the loop shuts down and the new text is returned. That means the script now has it stored for later use. And you will use it later.  Doing the Search You’ve set up search URLs and created something that will check the entered text for spaces. Now, you’ll do the search.  Because five search engines are represented, I really need to show you only one section of the function because the other four follow the same format. Here’s the top of the function triggered by the button and the first search, Yahoo!:  function search   { var keywords=document.searching.query.value; var search1; var search2; var search3; var search4; var search5; key=wordsplit keywords ; if document.searching.yahoo.checked  { search1= document.searching.yahoo.value; search1+=key; wind=window.open search1,”newwindow1”,”width=700,height=200, ➥scrollbars=yes” ;  The function traditionally starts with function search   and then the curly bracket.  Next a variable, keywords, is set and assigned the value of what was written in the text box:  document.searching.query.value.  Next, five new variables are set, search1 through search5. They are not assigned any value yet; they are just being created now so that they will be available later to receive values.  Next, you attach the output of the text box with the previous function that checked for spaces:  key=wordsplit keywords ;  314   Script Tip 5 ➤ Search Multiple Search Engines  Here, the variable key is created and assigned the value of wordsplit keywords . Get what just happened? keywords represents what was written into the text box. Because that vari- able name is within the instance of the function, it is given over to it. Thus, what was writ- ten into the text box is handed to the function wordsplit   to be checked for spaces.  Remember that the results of that handing off are assigned the variable name key. That means that key is now the text entered by the user with any spaces changed to plus signs. It’s ready to be used in a search.  Next are the if statements. Five of them are used because the user had five search engines to choose from:  if document.searching.yahoo.checked  { search1= document.searching.yahoo.value; search1+=key;  wind=window.open search1,”newwindow1”,”width=700,height=200, ➥scrollbars=yes” ;  It reads as follows: If the check box Yahoo! is checked, search1  remember creating that?  is to have the VALUE found in the check box representing Yahoo!  that’s the search URL .  Next, search1 is to have the variable key added to it. Remember that key is the text entered by the user. The addition takes place because of this operator: +=. See that? It means to con- catenate or build together the strings you’re working with.  So now search1 represents the entire URL plus the text to be searched. Now you need to open that URL in a new window:  wind=window.open search1,”newwindow1”,”width=700,height=200, ➥scrollbars=yes” ;  A new window opens using search1 as its URL. That performs the search. The new window has the name of newwindow1, is 700×200, and will have scrollbars.  The second curly bracket ends this particular if statement.  But what if Yahoo! is not checked?  Then this particular if statement is not true and is ignored. The script goes on to the next, and the next, and the next until one is correct.  But what if no check boxes are checked?  Then none of the if elements are true and nothing happens. The script just sits there look- ing back at you.  315   JavaScript Goodies  Can I put up an alert saying to post?  Using the format here, it’s a bit rough. Here’s the catch 22: If you put an alert as a final else statement, that alert will pop up every time, regardless of whether the user checked a box.  To prevent that else from being called on every time, you need to put an else between every if statement. Then the alert pops up only when no other boxes are checked; how- ever, this limits the search capabilities because the user can’t choose multiple engines. As soon as the script runs into an if statement that is true, it stops.  I played around with some code, checking all the ifs in one shot, and it started to be too much code for what it produced. I’m happy with the page just sitting still if no search engines are checked.  So, there you go! It’s a multiple search engine script.  316   Script Tip 6  Image Proportion Script  If you’ve ever attempted to guess at the correct height and width when attempting to resize an image in HTML code, you know it can be pretty rough guessing.  Sure, you could open an image editor, but I like to stay inside the browser. This script solves those problems. You can stay in the browser and still get those proportions and get a look at the image before choosing the numbers.  I received this “Proportional” script from Ann Evans. It was a great idea. You enter the height and width of an image you want to resize. Then, by entering a new height, the script figures the new width, keeping the same proportions the image original had.  I really liked the script, but thought it asked too much of the user. I knew you could grab the image’s height and width straight from the image. Then, after setting the new height and width, it seemed logical to show the image in its new dimensions.   JavaScript Goodies  So, using Ann’s original calculations and table structure, I rewrote and added on until I got this:       var path = prompt “Where will I find the image? Put in full URL or Hard Drive ➥Path and Image Name For example: C: directory image.jpg”,”Only image name ➥ required if in same directory”   if path == “Only image name required if in same directory”  { alert ‘Come on, put in an image name’  javascript:location.reload   }  if path == null  { alert ‘Do not click Cancel’  javascript:location.reload   }  else {document.write “ ” ;}     <!-- The following contains the two resize functions and two new ➥window functions -->     var high = document.thepic.height; var wide = document.thepic.width;  function newW   {  a = high; b = wide; c = document.calc.h2.value; d =  b*c  a; document.calc.width2.value = Math.round  }  318   Script Tip 6 ➤ Image Proportion Script  function newH   { a = high; b = wide; e = document.calc.wb2.value; f =  a*e  b; document.calc.height2.value = Math.round f  }  function newWin   { var OpenWindow=window.open “”, “newwin”, “height=500,width=500” ; OpenWindow.document.write “ ”  OpenWindow.document.write “ Image ”  OpenWindow.document.write “ ”  OpenWindow.document.write “ ”  OpenWindow.document.write “<IMG SRC=” +path+ “ HEIGHT=” +c+ “ ➥WIDTH=” +d+ “>”  OpenWindow.document.write “ ”  OpenWindow.document.write “ ”  }  function newWin2   { var OpenWindow=window.open “”, “newwin2”, “height=500,width=500” ; OpenWindow.document.write “ ”  OpenWindow.document.write “ Image ”  OpenWindow.document.write “ ”  OpenWindow.document.write “ ”  OpenWindow.document.write “<IMG SRC=” +path+ “ HEIGHT=” +f+ “ ➥WIDTH=” +e+ “>”  OpenWindow.document.write “ ”  OpenWindow.document.write “ ”  }         Resize It      319   JavaScript Goodies        Height: <SCRIPT  LANGUAGE=”javascript”>document.write “ ”+high+” ”      Width: <SCRIPT  LANGUAGE=”javascript”>document.write “ ”+wide+” ”     Enter New Height: <INPUT TYPE=”text” SIZE=5   <INPUT TYPE=”button” VALUE=”Solve” onClick=   New Width Equals <INPUT TYPE=”text” NAME=   <INPUT TYPE=”button” onClick=”newWin  ”  ➥ NAME=”h2”>   ➥”newW  ”>   ➥”width2” SIZE=10>   ➥VALUE=”Let Me See It”>              Height: <SCRIPT  LANGUAGE=”javascript”>document.write “ ”+high+” ”      Width: <SCRIPT  LANGUAGE=”javascript”>document.write “ ”+wide+” ”     Enter New Width: <INPUT TYPE=”text” SIZE=5   <INPUT TYPE=”button” VALUE=”Solve” onClick=   New Height Equals <INPUT TYPE=”text”   <INPUT TYPE=”button” onClick=”newWin2  ”  ➥NAME=”wb2”>   ➥”newH  ”>   ➥NAME=”height2” SIZE=10>  ➥VALUE=”Let Me See It”>          Figure ST6.1 shows the script in action.  To see the effect on your own computer, click Script Tip Six in your download packet, or see it online at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com stips scripttip45example.html. When you are prompted for an image name, enter angel.jpg. Of course, you can always enter the full URL to one of your own images, too, if you’re connected to the Internet.  320   Script Tip 6 ➤ Image Proportion Script  Figure ST6.1 This is the interface of the image proportion script with a second window showing the new propor- tions of the image entered into the text boxes.  I should point out that the system has a little bug. Because the image you call for might not be in cache, sometimes the incorrect height and width are displayed. Don’t worry, though, because you can fix that by simply refreshing the page.  However, even if the displayed height and width are incorrect, the results created from your entering a new height or width will be correct.  The code is available for copy and paste at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com stips  script- tip45script.html or by viewing the source of the page in your download packet.  The script uses a series of steps to complete the effect. Let’s start with the first thing you see on the page, the prompt. The blip of prompt code asks for the path to the image. Yes, I know it’s a little wordy and long to read.  After the prompt has the path and name of the image, it uses that to create an image flag that posts the image to the page. Let’s look at it. Please understand that I have greatly reduced the amount of text in the prompt box for this example:     var path = prompt “Text on the gray”,”Text in the box”   if path == “Text in the box”  { alert ‘Come on, put in an image name’   321   JavaScript Goodies  javascript:location.reload   }  if path == null  { alert ‘Do not click Cancel’  javascript:location.reload   }  else {document.write “ ” ;}    One of the hardest things to do when writing a script is to guess all the possibilities that could occur when someone uses your script. When this prompt pops up, I saw four events that could happen. Here are those events and my solutions:  1. The user enters a correct image name or path.  Solution: The image is posted.  2. The user clicks OK to display the image.  Solution: Create an alert box telling user to enter the image name.  3. The user clicks Cancel.  Solution: Create a prompt box asking for image name.  4. The user enters incorrect information.  Solution: I can’t predict incorrect information, so that results in a broken image, which gives a 40×40 height and width.  I wrote the previous prompt to cover each of those concerns. If you’d like to go back to the example and try each event, click here. Otherwise, let’s take it in order:  var path = prompt “Text on the gray”,”Text in the box”   This is the basic format of a prompt. Again, I have greatly reduced the text used in the original, so you’ll get the idea. Whatever the user types in the box is assigned the variable name path:  if path == “Text in the box”  { alert ‘Come on, put in an image name’  javascript:location.reload   }  322   Script Tip 6 ➤ Image Proportion Script  The first if statement is used if the user simply clicks OK without changing the informa- tion in the box.  If the “path” equals “Text in the box”  note the double quotation marks so that ‘Text in the box’ is seen as a text string rather than code , an alert pops up that reads Come on, put in an image name. After the user clicks OK in the alert box, javascript:location.reload   reloads the page and the prompt pops up again.  Here are two things you should notice: the curly brackets around the alert, and the reload. These are important so that the script understands it should do both if the statement is true. Also, note that the text string is the same as what is in the text box on the prompt. Be sure those two are the same when you use the script; otherwise it won’t work.  Here’s the second if statement. The script goes to this one if the first isn’t found to be true. This is triggered if the prompt data is null. That means the user simply clicked Cancel. Notice that null is not in quotes. It is not a text string, but rather a literal:  if path == null  { alert ‘Do not click Cancel’  javascript:location.reload   }  The same basic format is used if this if statement is true. An alert pops up, the page is reloaded, and the prompt pops up again. Consider this next bit of code:  else {document.write “ ” ;}  If both of the if statements are false, which is what you’re hoping for, a document.write statement is used to create a basic image flag posting the picture the user has entered.  See the NAME=thepic in the flag? That will become important in the next section of this Script Tip.  Grabbing and Displaying the Dimensions You might have noticed that after the prompt, I have placed four functions inside one set of   and   flags. That’s common; there’s no need to create a separate set of flags for each function. As long as they don’t share any variable names, you can just line them up one after the other.  I am concerned with the first two lines, before the functions begin lining up:  var high = document.thepic.height; var wide = document.thepic.width;  323   JavaScript Goodies  Each line assigns a variable name to a dimension of the image. The variable high is pro- duced from the hierarchy statement document.thepic.height.  See thepic? That’s the name of the image space. That name was put into the image flag cre- ated from the prompt code. That way these lines of code understand that the height returned should be from that image space.  The same format is followed to get the width. So, now high and wide represent the image’s height and width. You want to post that in the table that appears below the image:            Height:    document.write “ ”+high+” ”        Width:    document.write “ ”+wide+” ”        Enter New Height:         <INPUT TYPE=”button” VALUE=”Solve” onClick=”newW  ”>     New Width Equals         <INPUT TYPE=”button” onClick=”newWin  ” VALUE=”Let Me See It”>  324   Script Tip 6 ➤ Image Proportion Script             What you see in this code is the first table. This is the one that enables you to enter a new height and get the new width.  This is a table, but it also uses FORM elements so that text can be entered by the user. Therefore, you need to get a handle on the FORM NAMEs.  The FORM itself is called calc. The first text box, the one that will accept the new height, is named h2. The second text box, the one that will display the new width, is named width2. Those two text boxes can now be given attention through hierarchy statements such as document.calc.width2.value.  There are also two buttons. The first fires a function called newW  . That creates the new width value. The second triggers a function called newWin  , which produces the new win- dow showing the image with the new dimensions.  We’re interested in the displays, first off. Here’s the first table cell that displays the image height:   Height:    document.write “ ”+high+” ”       Notice an entire script format is used to get the job done. This is common. It adds up to a bit of text, but you get the display you need. The return from +high+ is bold just for display purposes. The format is followed again to display the width in the next table cell.  To perform any calculations, you’re going to need three numbers: The old height and width  you already have that , a new height or width from the user  you can see the box that will receive that value , and a function that will do the math for you. In this case, that function is called newW  .  New Width The first table has a button that fires a function named newW  . It looks like this:  function newW   {  325   JavaScript Goodies  a = high; b = wide; c = document.calc.h2.value; d =  b*c  a; document.calc.width2.value = Math.round d  }  To make the math equation that will figure the new width a little easier, a is assigned to the image’s current height, which is represented by high. Then, b is assigned to the current width, represented by wide.  Next, the new height value entered by the user—document.calc.h2.value  the text box —is assigned the variable c.  The calculation for the new width is  b*c  a, and the result of that equation is assigned the variable d.  Now, you need to display it in the text box document.calc.width2.value. However, very sel- dom do numbers calculate perfectly, so you need to take d and round it off. You do that using Math.round d .  Now the new width displays in the text box. But what of the second table and figuring the new height? The function is very similar, except for where user input comes from and the equation. It is called newH   and looks like this:  function newH   { a = high; b = wide; e = document.calc.wb2.value; f =  a*e  b; document.calc.height2.value = Math.round f  }  Now the information from the viewer is coming from a text box called wb2. If you look at the code for the second table, you’ll see that text box. The calculation for the new height is  a*e  b, and that value is sent to a text box named height2. Again, look at the second table code and you’ll see it.  Because you’re dealing with new numbers here, you must assign new variable names to the new height and width. Notice that e equals the new width, and f equals the new result. Notice also that the variable names were changed in the equation. You must make these changes; otherwise, both equations will use the same numbers, which is not good.  326   Script Tip 6 ➤ Image Proportion Script  So far, you’ve grabbed the image’s current height and width and, using that information plus one value from the user, created a new height or new width. That’s pretty good, but it’s better if you can then take those values and show the user what the image will look like.  Let Me See It In the two table codes, the last button is used to pop up the new window to display the image with the new height and width. Just as with the two functions that perform the number calculations, these two display functions are very similar. I’ll walk you through the first and quickly show you the changes in the second.  Here’s the first display function:  function newWin   { var OpenWindow=window.open “”, “newwin”, “height=500,width=500” ; OpenWindow.document.write “ ”  OpenWindow.document.write “ Image ”  OpenWindow.document.write “ ”  OpenWindow.document.write “ ”  OpenWindow.document.write “<IMG SRC=” +path+ “ HEIGHT=” +c+ “ ➥WIDTH=” +d+ “>”  OpenWindow.document.write “ ”  OpenWindow.document.write “ ”  }  Because of width concerns, a couple of the lines have been truncated. Please be aware that each line starts with OpenWindow.document.write, and all that comes before the next should go on one line.  You should notice immediately that this is the basic format for opening a new window using a function. The window opens through the window.open, object.method format.  The effect is achieved by assigning the variable OpenWindow to the new window. Notice the empty quotation marks just inside the parentheses. That forces the script to look to itself for what will appear in the new window.  Next, the name newwin is assigned to the new window. It will never come into play in this script, but the format requires you to have it.  Then, the height and width of the new window is offered. I thought about setting up the script so that the height and width would conform to the new image size, but decided against it. It was a lot of coding for very little event. Besides, if the user creates an image that is too large for the 500×500 window, he can always click the maximize button.  327   JavaScript Goodies  Now, you begin lining up lines of HTML code to go into the new window. These lines of code are written to the new window through document.write statements assigned to the new window through the variable OpenWindow. Each is a new line of code.  As you can see, it’s about as simple an HTML document as you can get. It offers a title, background color, and centered image. The image is what you’re concerned with now.  I used three variables to create the new image. The first is path. Remember that from way back in the prompt code? That’s the name and path of the image. Then, c is the new height, and d is the new width. When the document.write statement writes it to the page, it appears as inline image code and the image displays in the dimensions set by the math function from the last tip.  If you recall, you needed to change a couple of variable names to do the math for the sec- ond table’s results. Well, to get that second table’s results to display, you must use those new variable names in a new function set up to display the image:  function newWin2   { var OpenWindow=window.open “”, “newwin2”, “height=500,width=500” ; OpenWindow.document.write “ ”  OpenWindow.document.write “ Image ”  OpenWindow.document.write “ ”  OpenWindow.document.write “ ”  OpenWindow.document.write “<IMG SRC=” +path+ “ HEIGHT=” +f+ “ ➥WIDTH=” +e+ “>”  OpenWindow.document.write “ ”  OpenWindow.document.write “ ”  }  It looks similar, but a few changes have been made. The name of the function is newWin2  , so it can be called on by the second button. Notice that the name of the window has changed—it is now newwin2. You can’t have two windows with the same name on the same page. Because you figured the new height and width using e and f, those are the variable names used to create the new image.  So, there you go, multiple scripts working together to create one nice effect. I don’t know that this script is good to put online for others to play with; I see it more as something to help you when creating your own pages.  328   Script Tip 7  A Calculator  Here we go with a script that has been requested time and time again—a calculator. Here’s the code. It’s a little long, but after you get into it, you’ll see it could have been three times as long if it weren’t for some fancy coding tricks:         <!-- start hiding  function getPi   {return Math.PI}   JavaScript Goodies  function getRandom   {return Math.random  }  function change   { var temp = document.calculator.text.value;  if  temp.substring 0,1  == “-”  {document.calculator.list.value = “”; document.calculator.text.value = 0 - document.calculator.text.value ➥ * 1}  if  temp.substring 0,1  != “-”  {document.calculator.list.value =””; document.calculator.text.value = “-” + temp.substring 0,temp.length } }  function recip x  {document.calculator.text.value =  1  x  } function raisePower x  {  var y = 0  y = prompt “What is the exponent?”, “”   document.calculator.text.value = Math.pow x,y  }     end hiding -->                      330   Script Tip 7 ➤ A Calculator              <INPUT TYPE=BUTTON VALUE=” Backspace “ NAME=”backspace” onClick=” ➥document.calculator.text.value = document.calculator.text.value.substring ➥  0,document.calculator.text.value.length*1 -1 ”>       <INPUT TYPE=BUTTON VALUE=” Clear “ NAME=”clear” onClick=”document.calculator.text.value=’’”>           <INPUT TYPE=BUTTON VALUE=” 7 “ NAME=”but7” onClick=” ➥document.calculator.text.value+=’7’”>       <INPUT TYPE=BUTTON VALUE=” 8 “ NAME=”but8” onClick=” ➥document.calculator.text.value+=’8’”>       <INPUT TYPE=BUTTON VALUE=” 9 “ NAME=”but9” onClick=” ➥document.calculator.text.value+=’9’”>       <INPUT TYPE=BUTTON VALUE=” + “ NAME=”add” onClick=” ➥document.calculator.text.value+=’+’”>       <INPUT TYPE=BUTTON VALUE=” - “ NAME=”subtract” onClick=” ➥document.calculator.text.value+=’-’”>      331   JavaScript Goodies    <INPUT TYPE=”BUTTON” VALUE=” 1 x “ NAME=”reciprocal” onClick=” ➥recip document.calculator.text.value ”>       <INPUT TYPE=”BUTTON” VALUE=” x^y “ NAME=”power” onClick=” ➥raisePower document.calculator.text.value ”>       <INPUT TYPE=BUTTON VALUE=” sin “ NAME=”sin” onClick=” ➥document.calculator.text.value= Math.sin document.calculator.text.value* ➥3.141592653589793 180 ”>           <INPUT TYPE=BUTTON VALUE=” 4 “ NAME=”but4” onClick=” ➥document.calculator.text.value+=’4’”>       <INPUT TYPE=BUTTON VALUE=” 5 “ NAME=”but5” onClick=” ➥document.calculator.text.value+=’5’”>       <INPUT TYPE=BUTTON VALUE=” 6 “ NAME=”but6” onClick=” ➥document.calculator.text.value+=’6’”>       <INPUT TYPE=BUTTON VALUE=” * “ NAME=”multiply” onClick=” ➥document.calculator.text.value+=’*’”>       <INPUT TYPE=BUTTON VALUE=”   “ NAME=”divide” onClick=” ➥document.calculator.text.value+=’ ’”>      332   Script Tip 7 ➤ A Calculator    <INPUT TYPE=BUTTON VALUE=”  x  “ NAME=”absolute” ➥onClick=”document.calculator.text.value=Math.abs  ➥document.calculator.text.value ”>       <INPUT TYPE=BUTTON VALUE=” exp. “ NAME=”exp” onClick=” ➥document.calculator.text.value+=’E’”>       <INPUT TYPE=BUTTON VALUE=” cos “ NAME=”cos” ➥onClick=”document.calculator.text.value=Math.cos  ➥document.calculator.text.value*3.141592653589793 180 ”>           <INPUT TYPE=BUTTON VALUE=” 1 “ NAME=”but1” onClick=” ➥document.calculator.text.value+=’1’”>       <INPUT TYPE=BUTTON VALUE=” 2 “ NAME=”but2” onClick=” ➥document.calculator.text.value+=’2’”>       <INPUT TYPE=BUTTON VALUE=” 3 “ NAME=”but3” onClick=” ➥document.calculator.text.value+=’3’”>       <INPUT TYPE=BUTTON VALUE=”   “ NAME=”leftbracket” onClick=” ➥document.calculator.text.value+=’ ‘“>       <INPUT TYPE=BUTTON VALUE=”   “ NAME=”rightbracket” onClick=” ➥document.calculator.text.value+=’ ’”>    333   JavaScript Goodies      <INPUT TYPE=BUTTON VALUE=” x? “ NAME=”square” onClick=” ➥document.calculator.text.value= document.calculator.text.value ➥* document.calculator.text.value”>       <INPUT TYPE=BUTTON VALUE=” round “ NAME=”round” ➥onClick=”document.calculator.text.value=Math.round  ➥document.calculator.text.value ”>       <INPUT TYPE=BUTTON VALUE=” tan “ NAME=”tan” ➥onClick=”document.calculator.text.value=Math.tan  ➥document.calculator.text.value*3.141592653589793 180 ”>           <INPUT TYPE=BUTTON VALUE=” 0 “ NAME=”but0” onClick=” ➥document.calculator.text.value+=’0’”>       <INPUT TYPE=BUTTON VALUE=” . “ NAME=”decimal” onClick=” ➥document.calculator.text.value+=’.’”>               <INPUT TYPE=BUTTON VALUE=” = “ NAME=”equals” ➥onClick=”document.calculator.text.value=eval  ➥document.calculator.text.value ”>       <INPUT TYPE=BUTTON VALUE=” x? “ NAME=”sqrt”  334   Script Tip 7 ➤ A Calculator  ➥onClick=”document.calculator.text.value=Math.sqrt  ➥document.calculator.text.value ”>       <INPUT TYPE=BUTTON VALUE=” rand “ NAME=”random” onClick=” ➥document.calculator.text.value = getRandom  ”>       <INPUT TYPE=BUTTON VALUE=” pi “ NAME=”pi” onClick=” ➥document.calculator.text.value+= getPi  ”>                You can see it in action in Figure ST7.1.  Figure ST7.1 The calculator after figur- ing a stunningly difficult equation that apparently added up to 48.  335   JavaScript Goodies  To see the effect on your own computer, click Script Tip Seven in your download packet or see it online at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com stips scripttip52effect.html.  The code is available for copy and paste at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com stips   scripttip52script.html or by viewing the source of the page in your download packet.  Okay, the overriding first concern is the display. The calculator face is nothing more than a big table, five cells tall by eight cells across. You’ll notice that some of the cells span multi- ple cells. The display, for instance, rolls across five cells. The Backspace and the Equals but- tons both span two. See that?  You’ll find as you get into the calculator that the vast majority of the calculations are done inside the table using onClick event handlers. Only a few functions are involved for some of the larger returns.  Let’s get into it and attack the first line of cells in the table. This is the line that includes the display, backspace, and clear buttons. This line is quite different from the others, so let’s examine it by itself:                      <INPUT TYPE=BUTTON VALUE=” Backspace “ NAME=”backspace” onClick=” ➥document.calculator.text.value = document.calculator.text.value.substring  ➥0,document.calculator.text.value.length*1 -1 ”>     <INPUT TYPE=BUTTON VALUE=” Clear “ NAME=”clear”onClick=” ➥document.calculator.text.value=’’”>      336   The Display The display is created through the use of form commands that create a simple text box. The code looks like this:  Script Tip 7 ➤ A Calculator           Wait! There are two text boxes, but I only see one!  That’s because one is hidden. See how the TYPE is set to HIDDEN? That’s a great way to have a couple of boxes and display only one. Later in the script, we’ll talk about the button that changes the number in the display from positive to negative, or back again. To do that, you must exchange data back and forth. By using this hidden text box, you have a place to set the data before you move it back. Stay tuned; we’ll get to that button soon enough.  The name of the form itself is calculator, and the name of the display text box is text. In addition to a name, the box is also given a value set to nothing. See the empty quotation marks? That’s to ensure there’s nothing in the display to start with.  Now, you know that any time you want to send something to the display, you use the hier- archy document.calculator.text.value.  The Backspace Button The backspace button is next. The code looks like this:  <INPUT TYPE=BUTTON VALUE=” Backspace “ NAME=”backspace” ➥onClick=”document.calculator.text.value = ➥document.calculator.text.value.substring  ➥0,document.calculator.text.value.length*1 -1 ”>  This button is a bit of a code monster. Before getting into it, let’s stop and think about what it’s supposed to do. By clicking the Backspace button, you want the last number in the display to be eliminated. To do that, you need to make the JavaScript see that what is in the display text box is individual numbers in a string. If you do that, you can then set it so the last number of the string is eliminated with a click of the button.  Notice the button has a name and then a value so that it displays correctly, but it’s the onClick event handler that does the dirty work. When clicked, the value found in the  display  document.calculator.text.value  is set to a substring. See how the command  substring is added after the equal sign? In the instance  the parentheses  then, a compari- son is set up. Remember that in a substring instance, the larger of two elements is per- formed. In this case, there’s zero and then a calculation.  337   JavaScript Goodies  The calculation is the length of what appears in the display, times one, minus one. It’s that minus one that does the trick. By taking one away, you clip off the last item in the sub- string  that’s the last number ; then by clicking the Backspace button, you clip off the last number. Clever, no?  The Clear Button This works much the same way as the Backspace button using an onClick to enact an effect upon the display:  <INPUT TYPE=BUTTON VALUE=” Clear “ NAME=”clear” ➥onClick=”document.calculator.text.value=’’”>  This has a name, then a value attached for display, and then the magic of the onClick. By clicking the button, you’re setting the value of the display box to … well, nothing. See the empty single quotation marks? No matter what has come before or what is presently in the display text box, by clicking the Clear button, you set it to nothing, thus you clear it.  Next, let’s start on the numbers and the calculator functions. From here on, the buttons all pretty much work the same way. The hard part is keeping them in the correct order so the table display is correct.  The Other Buttons Let’s get into the buttons you find past the top row. Each of these buttons works in basical- ly the same onClick way. It’s the format of the table that will probably be most confusing.  If you’ve looked at the code, you might wonder why the keypad numbers are not all in a row. This is because the author has opted for this calculator to sit inside a table, so he had to set up all the buttons in the order that would display them in the table. If you follow it along, it goes something like this:  Numbers 7, 8, 9, plus, minus, reciprocal, power, sine  Numbers 4, 5, 6, times, divide, absolute, exponent, cosine  Numbers 1, 2, 3, left par., right par., square, round, tangent  Zero, decimal, +- sign, equals, square root, random, Pi  Let’s examine that first line. It’s a good representation of the next two lines:      <INPUT TYPE=BUTTON VALUE=” 7 “ NAME=”but7” onClick=” ➥document.calculator.text.value+=’7’”>  338   Script Tip 7 ➤ A Calculator         <INPUT TYPE=BUTTON VALUE=” 8 “ NAME=”but8” onClick=” ➥document.calculator.text.value+=’8’”>        <INPUT TYPE=BUTTON VALUE=” 9 “ NAME=”but9” onClick=” ➥document.calculator.text.value+=’9’”>        <INPUT TYPE=BUTTON VALUE=” + “ NAME=”add” onClick=” ➥document.calculator.text.value+=’+’”>        <INPUT TYPE=BUTTON VALUE=” - “ NAME=”subtract” onClick=” ➥document.calculator.text.value+=’-’”>        <INPUT TYPE=”BUTTON” VALUE=” 1 x “ NAME=”reciprocal” onClick=” ➥recip document.calculator.text.value ”>        <INPUT TYPE=”BUTTON” VALUE=” x^y “ NAME=”power” onClick=” ➥raisePower document.calculator.text.value ”>        <INPUT TYPE=BUTTON VALUE=” sin “ NAME=”sin” onClick=” ➥document.calculator.text.value= Math.sin document.calculator.text.value* ➥3.141592653589793 180 ”>    339   JavaScript Goodies  It’s fairly obvious that the lines are a bit convoluted due to the space restrictions on this page. Please make a point of following the form shown in the code link for this script; oth- erwise, you’re sure to get errors.  Let’s discuss them one at a time, but let’s do it by only showing the button code. There’s no need to continue displaying all the table code. This is a JavaScript Script Tip, right? Right.  Seven This button represents the number 7:  <INPUT TYPE=BUTTON VALUE=” 7 “ NAME=”but7” onClick=” ➥document.calculator.text.value+=’7’”>  The Value “ 7 “ is on the face of the button, and the Name given is “but7”  as in button seven . When the button is clicked, a 7 is placed in the display window denoted by docu- ment.calculator.text.value. See that in the previous onClick statement?  Please note: The operator += acts to add or concatenate two text strings. By using the +=, the display is not replaced with the number, but rather the number is placed at the end of the display. So, when you click 7, a 7 displays. If you then click again, the += places the next 7 after the first rather than simply replacing it. That way, every time you click, that value is added to the display rather than replacing what is already in the display. Later, after all the numbers and operators are lined up, you’ll figure the equation.  Got it? Good. Moving along ….  Eight The same holds true for the number 8. An onClick puts the number 8 in the display  window:  <INPUT TYPE=BUTTON VALUE=” 8 “ NAME=”but8” onClick=” ➥document.calculator.text.value+=’8’”>  Nine The same goes for the number 9:  <INPUT TYPE=BUTTON VALUE=” 9 “ NAME=”but9” onClick=” ➥document.calculator.text.value+=’9’”>  340   Script Tip 7 ➤ A Calculator  Add Now we get into the actual format of how the calculator works. This is the addition but- ton:  <INPUT TYPE=BUTTON VALUE=” + “ NAME=”add” onClick=” ➥document.calculator.text.value+=’+’”>  Note the format is the same as the number buttons except this button places a plus sign in the display window. This button simply sets a plus sign in place so that an addition can occur; it doesn’t actually do the addition. That occurs when the equal button comes into play.  Subtract Take a look at this:  <INPUT TYPE=BUTTON VALUE=” - “ NAME=”subtract” onClick=” ➥document.calculator.text.value+=’-’”>  Look familiar? Again, the button does not perform any subtraction. It simply places a minus so that later, when the equal button is clicked, a subtraction can occur.  Reciprocal Here’s an interesting piece of code:  <INPUT TYPE=”BUTTON” VALUE=” 1 x “ NAME=”reciprocal” onClick=” ➥recip document.calculator.text.value ”>  Do you know what this is? Me neither, so I looked it up. It is a function that figures a pair of numbers that has 1 as its product. That is, what number, when divided into the number in the display, produces the number 1?  Okay, I don’t really get it either, but if you’re a math person I’m sure it makes perfect sense to you. I’m only here to show you how to do it. This is the first button in this row that actually must have a number posted in the display to function.  When the onClick is enacted, it appears as if a JavaScript command called recip is enacted. Nope. recip is actually the name of a function found between the HEAD commands. It looks like this:  function recip x  {document.calculator.text.value =  1  x  } function raisePower x   341   JavaScript Goodies  { var y = 0 y = prompt “What is the exponent?”, “”  document.calculator.text.value = Math.pow x,y  }  When you click, the x is replaced with the value inside the display. See that in the previous onClick: recip document.calculator.text.value ? That value is then set into a fraction with 1 as the denominator.  Next, another function named raisePower   is brought into work. A variable—y—is set to 0. Then, y gets a value from the user through a prompt. That value acts as the exponent or power. Finally, the display receives the number it originally had raised to the power the user offered through the use of the Math.pow ,  format. The first  is the number, and the second  is the power it will be raised to.  If nothing is written inside the display then the math acts on nothing and nothing is returned.  Power The code for the power button is as follows:  <INPUT TYPE=”BUTTON” VALUE=” x^y “ NAME=”power” onClick=” ➥raisePower document.calculator.text.value ”>  It uses the same format as the previous code, except here the JavaScript command raisePower is set to act on what is inside the display and raise it to the first power.  Sine Sine is the ratio of the side opposite the angle of the hypotenuse. Here is the code:  <INPUT TYPE=BUTTON VALUE=” sin “ NAME=”sin” onClick=” ➥document.calculator.text.value=  Math.sin document.calculator.text.value*3.141592653589793 180 ”>  Now we get into another format of finding the answer. Again, a number must be shown in the display for this to work. When the button is clicked, the value of the display is created through the Math object setting a sine  Math.sin  by multiplying the number displayed by Pi  3.141592653589793  and then dividing that by 180. Even though you might not under- stand the math, do you see how it works?  342   Script Tip 7 ➤ A Calculator  The Next Two Lines The next two lines of code are as follows:  Numbers 4, 5, 6, times, divide, absolute, exponent, cosine  Numbers 1, 2, 3, left par., right par., square, round, tangent  These work exactly the same way. The numbers post to the display using the same formats as shown previously. The multiply and divide do not perform the action; they simply place the correct character so that the math can be done later. The square, round, tangent, absolute, exponent, and cosine math is done basically the same way as shown previously, using JavaScript commands and short math equations just like the previous one. You might not understand the math, but you can understand this format:  Absolute: Math.abs document.calculator.text.value ”  Exponent: onClick=”document.calculator.text.value+=’E’  Cosine: Math.cos document.calculator.text.value*3.141592653589793 180   Square: document.calculator.text.value * document.calculator.text.value  Round: Math.round document.calculator.text.value ” Math.tan document.calculator.text.value*3.141592653589793 180 ”  Next, let’s get into actually how the calculator works and the final line of buttons. They get a little tricky.  The Last Row of Buttons OK, we’re on to the last line of buttons. This one gets a little tricky, so let’s take it by itself.  The last line of buttons look like this:  Zero, decimal, +- sign, equals, square root, random, Pi  Here are the actual button codes without all the table coding:  <INPUT TYPE=BUTTON VALUE=” 0 “ NAME=”but0” onClick=” ➥document.calculator.text.value+=’0’”> <INPUT TYPE=BUTTON VALUE=” . “ NAME=”decimal” onClick=” ➥document.calculator.text.value+=’.’”>   <INPUT TYPE=BUTTON VALUE=” = “ NAME=”equals” ➥onClick=”document.calculator.text.value=eval   343   JavaScript Goodies  ➥document.calculator.text.value ”> <INPUT TYPE=BUTTON VALUE=” x1 2 “ NAME=”sqrt” ➥onClick=”document.calculator.text.value=Math.sqrt  ➥document.calculator.text.value ”> <INPUT TYPE=BUTTON VALUE=” rand “ NAME=”random” onClick=” ➥document.calculator.text.value = getRandom  ”> <INPUT TYPE=BUTTON VALUE=” pi “ NAME=”pi” onClick=” ➥document.calculator.text.value+= getPi  ”>  Allow me to discuss these a little out of order. You’ve seen some of the formats before, so I’ll talk about them first.  Zero and Decimal Does this look familiar:  <INPUT TYPE=BUTTON VALUE=” 0 “ NAME=”but0” onClick=” ➥document.calculator.text.value+=’0’”> <INPUT TYPE=BUTTON VALUE=” . “ NAME=”decimal” onClick=” ➥document.calculator.text.value+=’.’”>  It should. Both of these buttons act like the other number buttons 1–9. You click, and a 0 is placed in the display. You click, and a decimal point is placed in the display.  Again, notice the use of += to add the number to the display rather than replacing what is already displayed.  Square Root Here is the code for the Square Root button:  <INPUT TYPE=BUTTON VALUE=” x1 2 “ NAME=”sqrt” ➥onClick=”document.calculator.text.value=Math.sqrt  ➥document.calculator.text.value ”>  Just as before, the number displayed is acted on through the Math object and the command sqrt to create the result.  In case you’re wondering, x&189 is the ASCII code to display x1 2. Cool, huh?  <INPUT TYPE=BUTTON VALUE=” rand “ NAME=”random” onClick=” ➥document.calculator.text.value = getRandom  ”>  Random  344   For this random button, and the Pi button that follows, the author decided to use a func- tion. Note in the code how the display  document,calculator.text.value  is created by going to the function getRandom  , which looks like this:  Script Tip 7 ➤ A Calculator  function getRandom   {return Math.random  }  The function simply returns  return  a random number  created through Math.random  to the display. It seems simple enough, but you might ask why not just follow the same for- mat for putting it all in the onClick? I guess you could, but I would think the author set this aside as a function because the random number had nothing to do with the display. By setting it in a function, he separated it from any other numbers, which is probably a good idea.  Pi This is the same as the previous one:  <INPUT TYPE=BUTTON VALUE=” pi “ NAME=”pi” onClick=” ➥document.calculator.text.value+= getPi  ”>  The number for Pi is returned from a function that looks like this:  function getPi   {return Math.PI}  Again, could the author have simply done it inside the button itself? Yes. This, I think, is just a cleaner method of doing it. Plus, pi has a decimal point in it, and that’s tough to get into a simple display. Doing this solved that problem pretty quickly.  Equals Ah, now you get to the meat of the calculator function—the equal button. If you click this one, you get the answer. How you get the answer is a matter of how the author set up the script:  <INPUT TYPE=BUTTON VALUE=” = “ NAME=”equals” ➥onClick=”document.calculator.text.value=eval  ➥document.calculator.text.value ”>  Remember earlier in the script, the majority of the buttons simply set numbers or operators  +, -,  , *  into the display? You clicked the numbers and they displayed one right after the other so that when you were done putting in all your numbers, the equation you entered appeared there in the display.  345   JavaScript Goodies  The equal button simply says “Do it!” after you’ve entered the numbers. There in the dis- play is a math equation. Click the equal button, and that equation is evaluated  eval  and the result is placed in the display. Poof! Your answer! And you thought it was hard ….  There’s one more button to worry about. It’s the one that changes a number from negative to positive or the other way around. It’s clever and is a Script Tip unto itself.  Positive to Negative There’s one more thing to worry about in this calculator script—the button that changes numbers from negative to positive. At the beginning of this Script Tip, you saw two text boxes, one of which was hidden. Now that hidden text box comes into play.  Three codes are used here. The first is the button that triggers the function that changes a number from positive to negative or back again. It has the value of +- on the front, and the code looks like this:     The button itself isn’t all that hard to understand; all it does is enact a function called change  . That function looks like this:  function change   { var temp = document.calculator.text.value;  if  temp.substring 0,1  == “-”  {document.calculator.list.value = “”; document.calculator.text.value = 0 - document.calculator.text.value ➥ * 1}  if  temp.substring 0,1  != “-”  {document.calculator.list.value =””; document.calculator.text.value = “-” + temp.substring 0,temp.length } }  Now, remember, that the previous display is a little cramped. Make sure the function is in the format shown in the script code.  Let’s take a look at what happens. When the button is clicked, the value that appears in the display  document.calculator.text.value  is assigned the variable name temp.  Next, the script tests to see whether the value is already negative. An if statement asks if the text.substring’s first character is equal to the minus sign. Remember that any time you set a substring, you must set up a comparison where the larger number wins. In this  346   Script Tip 7 ➤ A Calculator  case the two numbers are 0 and 1. The one is bigger, so it wins and the first character in the substring is checked.  Notice the two equal signs: That means “is equal to.”  If the first character is equal to the minus sign, the hidden text box comes into play. Here’s that code:       I have listed the hidden box and then the display text box. Both of them come into play here. The hidden text box is given the name list. Now you can get at the box using the hierarchy statement document.calculator.list.value.  So, back to “If the first character is the minus sign.” If it is, the hidden text box is given a value of nothing. By doing that, it brings it into play. That hidden box is then set to 0, the value in the display is taken away, and the result is multiplied by 1. That sets the same number to a positive value.  If the first character is not a minus sign, the second if statement comes into play. This statement asks if the first character is not equal to a minus sign.  != is the operator for “is not equal to” .  If this if statement is true then, again, the hidden box is given a value of nothing to bring it into play. The value of the hidden box is then set to a minus sign plus the full length of the temp variable substring.  I know that seems a bit much, but by adding the value through a substring, the value remains the same. Rather than the entire thing being seen as one entity, which it is not, it remains a string of characters, which it is.  And that wraps up the calculator. It is quite involved and sometimes a little rough to get hold of, but now that you’re through it, I think you’ll agree it was a manageable project.  347    Script Tip 8  Placing a Cookie  Ever since HTML Goodies was created, the cookie has been the one thing that people either hated or couldn’t wait to get on their Web pages. I have a tutorial on what a cookie actually is on the HTML Goodies site at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com tutors cookie.html. It’s a lot of reading, but basically a cookie is a text file—less than 4K—a server places on your com- puter to track or remember things for you.  Whatever you think about cookies, there’s no denying they’re popular. In this Script Tip, we’ll get into how you can set, and retrieve, cookies for your visitors.  The script was originally sent to be posted on HTML Goodies by Giedrius. Usually, I alter the scripts for these tips a bit. Not this one; I barely touched it, except to change a display. I like it just how the author put it together. I also made a point of keeping his name in the code as author. I would ask you do the same.   JavaScript Goodies  First, let’s get into how this specific script works; then we’ll talk about how you can use the format to create larger, more useful effects. For instance, I altered the script to show two separate messages depending on whether this is the user’s first time receiving a cookie. One reads Nice to meet you, and the other reads, Welcome back. I’ll show you how to do that after you get through the script in its current state.  Here’s the script:    <!--   This script was made by Giedrius cookie_name = “NameCookie2010”; var GuestName;  function putCookie   { if document.cookie  { index = document.cookie.indexOf cookie_name ; } else { index = -1;}  if  index == -1  { GuestName=window.prompt “Hello! What’s your name?”,”Nobody” ; if  GuestName==null  GuestName=”Nobody”; document.cookie=cookie_name+”=”+GuestName+”; expires=Tuesday, ➥05-Apr-2010 05:00:00 GMT”; } else { namestart =  document.cookie.indexOf “=”, index  + 1 ; nameend = document.cookie.indexOf “;”, index ; if  nameend == -1  { nameend = document.cookie.length;} GuestName = document.cookie.substring namestart, nameend ; if  GuestName==”Nobody”  { GuestName=window.prompt “Hello again!!!”+”\n”+”Last time you didn’t ➥tell me your name. Maybe you want to do it now?”,”Nobody” ; if   GuestName!=”Nobody” && GuestName!=null   {document.cookie=cookie_name+”=”+GuestName+”; expires=Tuesday, ➥05-Apr-2010 05:00:00 GMT”;} if  GuestName==null  GuestName=”Nobody”; } }  350   Script Tip 8 ➤ Placing a Cookie  }  function getName   { if document.cookie  { index = document.cookie.indexOf cookie_name ; if  index != -1  { namestart =  document.cookie.indexOf “=”, index  + 1 ; nameend = document.cookie.indexOf “;”, index ; if  nameend == -1  {nameend = document.cookie.length;} GuestName = document.cookie.substring namestart, nameend ; return GuestName; } } }  putCookie  ; GuestName=getName  ;    STOP HIDING THE SCRIPT-->        document.write “Hello, “+GuestName+”, nice to meet you!!!” ;    You’ll feel better if you have a cookie, which is shown in Figure ST8.1.

Please note that you will get the prompt only the first time you use it. Past that, there’s already a cookie set, so there’s no need to ask for your name again.  The code is available for copy and paste at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com stips   scripttip60script.html or by viewing the source of the page in your download packet.  The script, actually scripts, isn’t very threatening in the present form. The code first checks to see whether it has already set a cookie. If not, it sets one. It then checks to see whether the person entered her name the last time. If not, it requests the name again. If a cookie has already been set, it simply displays the name. All these checks means you’re bound to have quite a few conditional statements checking things for you.  351   JavaScript Goodies  Figure ST8.1 The prompt is asking for the user’s name. That information is sent to a cookie by the script.  There’s no simple way to attack this script, so let’s just get started from the top down. First, you set a couple of variables and check to see whether a cookie exists:  cookie_name = “NameCookie2010”; var GuestName;  function putCookie   { if document.cookie  { index = document.cookie.indexOf cookie_name ; } else { index = -1;}  The first line sets a text string value to the variable name cookie_name. Usually, I put var before each of these types of statements, but not now. I left it out to be able to make the point that when setting variable names, the command var isn’t necessary because the sin- gle equal sign implies that that one item is to be representative of the other.  Yes, you could write this as  var cookie_name = “NameCookie2010”;  but you don’t have to. As the author wrote it is sufficient.  352   Script Tip 8 ➤ Placing a Cookie  The next line does use the var command because in this case, the variable name is only being brought into play for later, but as of yet it does not have a value assigned to it. You just want to have it in the JavaScript’s memory for when you need it later. The function putCookie   is actually a little mis-named. This function does not put any cookie; it checks to see whether a cookie already exists:  if document.cookie   The if statement asks for the document.cookie. Although the text is confusing, remember that cookie is actually a property of document. Yes, I know that the cookie does not reside in the document, but rather in a file in another part of the hard drive. That doesn’t matter to JavaScript. cookie is a property and simply saying document.cookie starts the process of looking for one. For once, something that should be difficult is easy. Go figure. So, is there a cookie? You need to find out.  Now, here’s the rest of the if statement:  { index = document.cookie.indexOf cookie_name ; } else { index = -1;}  It attempts to set index  a property, the index of something  to equal document.cookie.indexOf cookie_name . Remember that cookie_name is NameCookie2010. You set that first thing in the script, remember?  Notice how you grabbed the cookie. You know that cookie is a property of document just as any form elements would be. That’s why you get to use a hierarchy statement format when going after the cookie.  The command indexOf   is a method that returns the location of a text string. Basically, the line looks to see whether a text string named NameCookie2010 appears on this computer. If it does appear, the statement is already true. So, nothing needs to be set because index is already equal to NameCookie2010. Let’s move on to what follows in the else statement.  The else statement says to set the index to -1 if the other can’t be found. You might remember that -1 is used in JavaScript to indicate a string is not found because JavaScript counts 0 as a viable number. This command sets the cookie index to null.  Why? Why not set the cookie right then and there?  Because it’s not that easy. Besides, the author is not really going to set the index to -1—he set it there to indicate that the named cookie has not yet been set for this document.  353   JavaScript Goodies  Setting the Cookie Okay, this is a little backward so I’m going to describe how it runs. In the previous code you set up a test that looked for a cookie named NameCookie2010. If the cookie was found then the variable index was given the value of the location of the cookie. If there was no cookie, index was given the value of -1. So what happens if index is -1? Well, this:  if  index == -1  { GuestName=window.prompt “Hello! What’s your name?”,”Nobody” ; if  GuestName==null  GuestName=”Nobody”; document.cookie=cookie_name+”=”+GuestName+”; expires=Tuesday, ➥05-Apr-2010 05:00:00 GMT”; } else { namestart =  document.cookie.indexOf “=”, index  + 1 ; nameend = document.cookie.indexOf “;”, index ; if  nameend == -1  { nameend = document.cookie.length;} GuestName = document.cookie.substring namestart, nameend ; {  It’s yet another if statement, but look at how it’s constructed. If there is not a cookie, or if there is not but one of the named value, the first part is enacted and a cookie is set. If there is, the cookie is read and a certain part of it is assigned to the variable GuestName.  It’s backward from the first if statement that checks first and then sets to place a cookie. This if statement places first, and if it doesn’t need to place, it reads the cookie. Let’s place it first:  if  index == -1  { GuestName=window.prompt “Hello! What’s your name?”,”Nobody” ; if  GuestName==null  GuestName=”Nobody”; document.cookie=cookie_name+”=”+GuestName+”; expires=Tuesday, ➥05-Apr-2010 05:00:00 GMT”; }  Let’s say index is equal to -1. First, the variable GuestName is given the value of a prompt. As you can see, the prompt pops up and asks for a name. In the text box, though, is the text Nobody. See that in the previous code? It’s important.  The next line checks the variable value. If GuestName equals  double equal sign  null, mean- ing nothing, GuestName is set to Nobody. Now you have a safety net in case the user just   354   Script Tip 8 ➤ Placing a Cookie  simply presses Enter, thus entering Nobody. You also have it set up so that if the user blanked the text box and pressed Enter, the variable is set to Nobody anyway.  Finally, you actually set the cookie. The hierarchy statement document.cookie followed by an equal sign sets. You have the text of the cookie to be set first with the name of the cookie itself, then the text the user entered, and then an expiration date. Notice the format for the date. You must follow that just as you see it.  Here’s the text as it appears in the cookie set on my system: NameCookie2010. Here’s the code:  Joe ~~local~~ E:\HTML Goodies\Scripttips\ 0 3625486336 30069884 1906963680 29301170 *  First is the name of the cookie and then the word I entered, Joe. Next is the location— notice it’s local. Last is the expiration date in milliseconds because JavaScript counts time in milliseconds.  So the cookie is set; at least what you wrote to the cookie is set. But what if there already is a cookie? Well, you need to grab what the user wrote. You already know by looking that the text the user wrote is second in the run of text. So, you need to grab just that. Here’s the code that does it:  } namestart =  document.cookie.indexOf “=”, index  + 1 ; nameend = document.cookie.indexOf “;”, index ; if  nameend == -1  { nameend = document.cookie.length;} GuestName = document.cookie.substring namestart, nameend ; {  As you can see, the document.cookie is acted on by using the method indexOf. That com- mand returns a location of a string depending on two arguments within the instance  parentheses . In this case, you are interested in the text string set by the cookie.  First, the variable namestart is assigned the index of an equal sign and the text of the string. Remember that in this case, a text string’s first character is always given the value  of 0 and the last character is given the value of -1. If you think about it for a moment, you’ll realize that that’s JavaScript for beginning and end, and JavaScript sees 0 as a viable number.  355   JavaScript Goodies  So, you have a method of grabbing the beginning of the string plus one  the +1 . The equal sign is not shown in the string, but it’s implied as the name jumps to the next line; there- fore, you’re looking for something that starts with an equal sign in the length of the text string. That’s the word Joe in the previous code.  Next in the script, nameend is given the index of a semicolon and the length of the text string. A semicolon is seen as the end of a line in JavaScript, so this denotes the end of the line after the word Joe.  The next line states that if the end of the text is the end of the line of text  nameend = -1  then make nameend equal to the entire remainder of the text string. This would come into play if no expiration date were in place and Joe ended the line of text.  Finally, the variable GuestName is given the value of what is contained between namestart and nameend. That’s the text entered by the user. That text is assigned as a text string to a variable and can be used and posted anywhere on the page, or any other page for that mat- ter because the cookie never goes away.  Next, let’s look into what happens if GuestName actually represents the default—Nobody. We can’t just let that lie now, can we?  What About Nobody? If a user comes to your page and doesn’t play nice with this script, allowing it to simply read Nobody by pressing Return, you should make a point of showing that person the error of his ways and give him a second chance.  Here’s the code you’re interested in:  if  GuestName==”Nobody”  { GuestName=window.prompt “Hello again!!!”+”\n”+”Last time you didn’t ➥tell me your name. Maybe you want to do it now?”,”Nobody” ; if   GuestName!=”Nobody” && GuestName!=null   {document.cookie=cookie_name+”=”+GuestName+”; expires=Tuesday, 05-Apr-2010 ➥05:00:00 GMT”;} if  GuestName==null  GuestName=”Nobody”; }  This little blip of code is the annoyer. It comes into play only if a cookie has been set and the person is returning. The script never incorporates this code if there is no cookie because of the code’s placement. Let’s see how it works.  Let’s start with another familiar if statement asking if the value of GuestName is equal to Nobody. If so, a prompt is fired up and the user is again asked to put in his name.  356   Script Tip 8 ➤ Placing a Cookie  Notice the \n in the window.prompt. That represents a new line to JavaScript, so this won’t all be run together.  Again, the default is set to Nobody.  Now you need to set the cookie off of what the user did. The next line tests for that. The double ampersands  &&  means “and”. So, you’re testing whether the value of GuestName is not equal  !=  to Nobody and not equal to nothing  null . If that’s the case—meaning at least something was put in the text box—then it is set to a cookie.  The next line is the catchall if the user blanks the text box and goes on. The code tests if GuestName is equal to null. If it is, the value is reset to Nobody. You can now be pretty sure that the user will get this warning again when he stops back.  That’s the extent of what you need to do to set the cookie. Next, we talk about grabbing it and posting it to the page.  Displaying Cookie Contents The cookie is set, so now you need to use coding to go get it. In the case of this script, the display is immediately after setting the cookie. Keep in mind that that doesn’t always have to be the case. You easily can split this code and set on one page but grab and display on another. That’s the purpose of these cookies—to carry information across pages.  This blip of code looks very similar to the one you looked at previously. The reason is because the two perform the same duties, except the first one grabs the text string from the cookie to assign it to the variable GuestName, whereas this one grabs it so it can be dis- played. Here’s the code:  function getName    { if document.cookie  { index = document.cookie.indexOf cookie_name ; if  index != -1  { namestart =  document.cookie.indexOf “=”, index  + 1 ; nameend = document.cookie.indexOf “;”, index ; if  nameend == -1  {nameend = document.cookie.length;} GuestName = document.cookie.substring namestart, nameend ; return GuestName; } } }  357   JavaScript Goodies  putCookie  ; GuestName=getName  ;  This is a function, so there has to be something to trigger it. Look at the last line of the script. GuestName is equal to the function getName—that’s what starts it. The entire script must be put into the browser memory; then the last line fires this function by calling for its output.  So here we go. If there is a document.cookie  which you know exists, at least in this format , index equals what is contained in the cookie NameCookie2010.  If the index is non-existent  -1 , namestart is equal to the equal sign plus one to the length.  Consequently, nameend is equal to the rest of that line until the end, which is represented by the semicolon. Remember all of this two tips ago?  If there is no end to the string  nameend==-1  then nameend is equal to the full length of the cookie. This occurs if no expiration date is set. GuestName then must be given the value of what is between namestart and nameend, which is what the user entered.  Finally, the script is told to return that value.  The next line is what started the entire process in the first place, triggering the first func- tion you looked at, putCookie  . You know the next line—it fires up the function you just looked at.  Displaying It After GuestName is given the value of what is contained in the cookie, you can place it any- where on the page using document.write statements. Here’s what the author used:    document.write “Hello, “+GuestName+”, nice to meet you!!!” ;    The text appears and the name is displayed.  So, there you go: A cookie is set and retrieved. It’s a great script, but I do see one problem with it. After a cookie is set, the text always reads Nice to meet you. Well, after 10 visits, you’re not “meeting” your user anymore.  I took the script, altered it a bit, and got it to display the Nice to meet you greeting the first time it displayed. Each time after that, it reads Welcome back. Here’s how.  358   Script Tip 8 ➤ Placing a Cookie  Two Different Welcomes If you want to see this new coding in action, point your browser to http:  www. htmlgoodies.com stips scripttip64effect.html.  The new code, including the text denoted in the following, can be found at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com stips scripttip64script.html.  When I set out to do this, I knew the answer was going to be a conditional statement of some kind. I also knew it would say something such as, if the user is a first-timer, use this greeting. If not - use this.  The question then becomes what would you use to check? The answer is a new variable I named FirstTime. The variable is inserted into the script in specific places so that if the user receives a cookie for the first time, her FirstTime variable is set to “y”. All times after that, the variable is set to “n”. Then, you could do a simple check to see whether the vari- able is “y” or “n” and set the document.write as you see fit.  Notice the n and y are in quotes. That sets them aside as text strings rather than values.  Placing the Variable Here’s the top of the script. Look for the FirstTime variable:  cookie_name = “NameCookie2010”; var GuestName; var FirstTime  function putCookie   { if document.cookie  { index = document.cookie.indexOf cookie_name ; FirstTime = “n” }  else  { FirstTime = “y” index = -1; }  Notice first that var FirstTime is set so it will be recognized the rest of the way through the script. I often refer to this as putting the variable into play.  359   JavaScript Goodies  Strange as it might seem, the first thing you check is whether a cookie exists; therefore, the first setting FirstTime could receive is “n”, meaning it isn’t the user’s first time. See the placement? It’s just after the index of the cookie is found and set to a variable name.  The reason for the placement is because after that point in the script, the majority of things are meant to set new cookies, right? If that’s true, somewhere in the new cookies you need to insert the line that sets FirstTime to “y”. Look at the previous code, and you’ll see it. It’s in the first else function.  It’s there because of the structure of the script. You want the placement so that when FirstTime is given a value, at no other time in the script would the value change. By putting it in the first if and else statements, you can be assured that if there is a cookie, FirstTime will be set to “n”. Also, because else is skipped if the original statement is true, you know you can safely place the second FirstTime there.  If there is a cookie, the script sets it to “n” and skips the else. If not, the else comes into play and sets FirstTime to “y”.  That’s the hard part; now we get to the fun. This little piece of code posts a greeting depending on which value was assigned:    if  FirstTime == “y”  {document.write “Hello, “+GuestName+”, nice to meet you!!!” ;} else {document.write “Hello, “+GuestName+”, welcome back!!!” ;}    It’s another if statement that tests only whether FirstTime is equal to “y”. If it isn’t then you know it has to be “n” and the else statement will take it from there.  You should be able to take it from here. If it’s “y” then the greeting reads Nice to meet you. But if it’s “n” then the greeting reads, Welcome back.  360   Script Tip 9  A 16.7 Million- Color Script  Please Note! This script was written specifically to work on MSIE browsers.

If you didn’t take it from the code, this is a table format. The table is four cells wide with one cell spanning across all four. That spanning cell is the one that receives the color.  The red, green, and blue settings are all drop-down select box form elements. As you have probably noticed, there are 256 choices in each drop box, 000–255.  What the script does is offer the viewer the ability to choose the RGB values and in turn changes them to the more Web-friendly hex values. It does this through the three drop- down boxes. Let’s start with those.  The drop-down box code looks like this:   255   254   253   253   252   251   250   364   Script Tip 9 ➤ A 16.7 Million-Color Script  Many items have been deleted here to save space:   005   004   003   002   001   000   It’s a little backward from how I do my boxes. I always have the option selected choice first. This author decided to go the opposite way and put it at the bottom. No problem, it works just as well.  Now, let’s talk a little about colors so you get the concept of this box. You probably know that in Hex code, FFFFFF equals white and 000000 equals black.  The concept of a hex code is two characters representing a level of red, green, and blue. The levels are 1–9 and A–F. The higher the number or letter, the more intense the color. So, FF is the highest saturation of color, and 00 is the lowest saturation.  In the case of white, FF FF FF means the highest saturation of red, green, and blue. That’s white. When you’re dealing with light, mixing all the colors together gives you white. Don’t believe me? Grab a crystal glass and shine white light into it. All the colors con- tained in that white light will show on the wall.  In the case of black, 00 00 00 means no saturation of color at all because black is the absence of color. If I wanted red, I could set the hex to FF 00 00. That’s a ton of red, no green, and no blue. Are you getting my drift here?  Now let me throw a monkey wrench into the mix. That hex code I was just talking about is actually a representation of a three-digit, or decimal, code used to make color. It works the very same way. 000 is equal to no color saturation at all, and 255 is equal to complete saturation.  Now at the code for the drop-down menu, previously in the chapter. Start at the bottom. You can see that the choice 000 has a value of 00 in hex. The next choice is 001, which has a value of 01 in hex. If you continue up the menu, you’ll see the hex gradually getting stronger as the three-digit number increases. Basically, what you have here is all 256 num- bers in a drop-down box and their hex counterparts as the values for the choices.  With that in mind, we can begin to describe how this script functions. When the script first loads, zero values are shown in the R, G, and B drop boxes. That’s equivalent to black, so black is shown in the table cell. In addition, the hex 000000 is shown in the text box.  365   JavaScript Goodies  Each time a new value is selected, both the table cell and the text box are updated, so a function that alters them both must be involved.  If you’ve looked at the code, you can see the table being constructed in the document.write statements, but you might also have noticed that only one drop-down box is in the code, yet three show up on the page. It’s a clever trick we’ll get to as the tip goes on.  What Are All Those Back Slashes for? So glad you asked. The backslash is what’s known as an escape sequence. It basically enables you to type in data that shows as text or that alters the text around it. In this case, the author is using  \” :     That backslash followed by a double quotation mark allows a double quotation mark to appear on the page. You could probably guess that if you stuck a double quotation mark in there, the script would think you were ending the line and errors would fall all over the place. The author could have simply written the code without any quotation marks, but he wanted quotation marks around the attribute when the page compiled, so the backslash, double quotation mark combination was used to get them.  You’ll see this all the way through the script. Don’t think it means anything more than a simple double quotation mark.  Building the Table The code for the table is written to the page through JavaScript document.write commands. It looks like this:  document.write “<TABLE BORDER=\”0\” CELLPADDING=\”0\” ➥CELLSPACING=\”0\” WIDTH=\”100%\”>” ;  document.write “ ” ;  document.write “<TD BGCOLOR=\”000000\” HEIGHT=\”25\” ID=\”box\” ➥COLSPAN=\”4\”>  ” ;  document.write “ <FONT COLOR=\”ffffff\” ➥FACE=\”arial, geneva, times new roman\” SIZE=\”2\”> Red: ➥    ” ➥+menu+”   <FONT COLOR=\”ffffff\” ➥FACE=\”arial, geneva, times new roman\” SIZE=\”2\”> Green: ➥   ”  366   Script Tip 9 ➤ A 16.7 Million-Color Script  ➥+menu+”   <FONT COLOR=\”ffffff\” ➥ FACE=\”arial, geneva, times new roman\” SIZE=\”2\”> Blue: ➥  <SELECT NAME=\”blue\” ONCHANGE=\”mix  ;\” ➥SIZE=\”1\”>”+menu+”    ➥<INPUT NAME=\”code\” MAXLENGTH=\”7\” SIZE=\”10\” ➥TYPE=\”text\” VALUE=\”000000\”>  ” ;  document.write “ ” ; document.write “ ” ;  You see how messed up it looks. But let’s take it step-by-step, and you’ll quickly see how it works.  To begin with, the table is created:  document.write “<TABLE BORDER=\”0\” CELLPADDING=\”0\” CELLSPACING=\”0\” WIDTH=\ ➥”100%\”>” ;  The table has no border, has no cell padding or spacing, and spans the width of the page  100% .  Next, a form is started. Remember that you’re going to use drop-down boxes and they are form elements, so you need a form:  document.write “ ” ;  The name of the form is Color.  Next, the first table cell—the one that will span the others—is written to the page:  document.write “<TD BGCOLOR=\”000000\” HEIGHT=\”25\” ID=\”box\” ➥COLSPAN=\”4\”>  ” ;  The cell has a black background, is 25 pixels high, has the ID name box, and spans the next four columns. Now let’s look at the three drop-down menus.  You might notice that the next line is much longer than it has to be. This could be written with multiple document.write statements, but the author chose to put it all on one line. No sweat. It works just the same. Let’s take just the first part of it:   <FONT COLOR=\”ffffff\” FACE=\”arial, geneva, ➥times new roman\” SIZE=\”2\”>  Red:     ”+menu+” ➥    367   JavaScript Goodies  This is the first of four table cells. The background color is white, the font face is Arial, and it will contain the Red drop-down menu. Now for the clever part.  Notice that contained within the table cell are the beginning commands for a select box. The NAME will be red, and when something changes within the box  onChange , a function named mix   will be called into play.  Then, a variable named mix is called for, and the select box is ended. But what is mix?  Look at the full script again. Menu is a text string made up of the entire drop-down menu discussed in Script Tip 8, “Placing a Cookie.” That’s the reason you see only one drop-down menu in the code, but three pop up in the browser window. The author set the box to a variable name and then called for it three times. Why not? All three menus are the same, and it saves typing time.  If you continue through the table code, you’ll see the next two cells being created exactly the same way, except the next one has the NAME “green” and the third has the NAME “blue”.  The last blip of code in that long run creates the text box that will receive the hex code. It looks like this:   <INPUT NAME=\”code\” MAXLENGTH=\”7\” SIZE=\”10\” ➥TYPE=\”text\” VALUE=\”000000\”>  ” ;  The text box is given the name code and a value of 000000 that displays when the page is first loaded. That’s what the three drop-down menus will read, so that’s what is displayed.  Finally, a  FORM and a  TABLE are written to complete the table.  Now you have a table with parts you can grab through hierarchy statements. The text box is reachable through document.ColorMix.code.value, and each drop-down menu reads the same, except the color appears where “code” is in the statement: document.ColorMix.red.value, document.ColorMix.blue.value, and document.ColorMix.green.value.  The box that receives the color is a little different; it carries an ID and is affected by a func- tion discussed in the next section.  The mix   Function The engine that makes this script run is a simple function named mix  .  The mix   function performs the same maneuver twice sending the same result to two dif- ferent places. One result goes to the table cell to display the color, while the other goes to the text box to display the hex code. The function looks like this:  368   Script Tip 9 ➤ A 16.7 Million-Color Script  function mix   { if  document.all  { document.all “box” .style.background = “”+document.ColorMix.red.options[document.ColorMix.red.selectedIndex] ➥.value+document.ColorMix.green.options[document. ➥ColorMix.green.selectedIndex].value+document. ➥ColorMix.blue.options[document.ColorMix.blue.selectedIndex] ➥.value;  document.ColorMix.code.value = “”+document.ColorMix.red.options[ ➥document.ColorMix.red.selectedIndex]. ➥value+document.ColorMix.green.options[ ➥document.ColorMix.green.selectedIndex] ➥.value+document.ColorMix.blue.options[ ➥document.ColorMix.blue.selectedIndex].value; } else { alert “Sorry, your browser does not support the programming ➥needed to run this script.” ; } }  The function begins like all other functions do, but the command function, the name of the function, mix, the instance, and then a curly bracket encase what the function will do.  The first line of the function is the reason this will not run on Netscape Navigator browsers. The if statement begins with the command if document.all .  That is a proprietary command understood by IE4 and above browsers. By attaching all to a document, you basically set it up to be a representation of all the elements in the HTML document. It helps you attach style attributes to elements of the page.  For now, its usage in the if statement basically asks if the browser can support the com- mand all. If it can’t, an alert pops up telling the user he doesn’t have a browser powerful enough to run the script. Bummer.  But let’s stick with what happens if the document.all is recognized and the mix   function runs.  Remember that each of the drop-down menus carries with it an onChange event handler. That way, any time the user alters the display of the menu, the function is triggered to run. No matter what change is made, the script responds. Pretty slick.  369   JavaScript Goodies  The first item you’re interested in altering is the long table cell. This is the line that attach- es the function to it:  document.all “box” .style.background =  Now document.all is carrying arguments. See the parentheses after all? In this case, all is being used as an array representing all the elements on the page. What is in the instance is box—the ID name given to the table cell. So now you’re focusing right on that specific ele- ment of the page.  But what will you do to it? You’ll work with the background style. See the format? You’re going to set a background style color for that specific element, box.  This is the reason the script doesn’t function properly in Netscape Navigator. This format is MSIE only.  Next, you need to set the background style to some color. That color is formed by taking the value selected by the user from the Red, Green, and Blue drop-down menus. Here’s the first blip of code:  “”+document.ColorMix.red.options[document.ColorMix.red.selectedIndex]  The color code begins with a pound sign   . It’s in quotation marks and is attached to the front of the hex code. Next, you grab the red code. The item comes from the first drop- down box denoted by document.ColorMix.red.options. Exactly what hex was chosen is rep- resented by [document.ColorMix.red.selectedIndex].  selectedIndex is the value of the item chosen; those values are hex codes. So, if the user selects 255, the value FF is returned to this run.  Now look at the code again. The same thing happens when grabbing the value from the Green and then the Blue drop-down menus. When those three hex values are put together, you get a hex code. That hex code is assigned to the table cell, and the background color changes. In the next full line of the function, the exact same thing occurs. The choices the user made are pulled together to create a hex code; however, in this line of code, the hex is sent to the text box for display:  document.ColorMix.code.value =  So, each time a new value is selected in any of the boxes, the mix   function is triggered. That function firsts tests the browser; then it grabs the choices the user made, changes the table cell background, and sends the hex to a text box for display.  It’s a great script, but as I said, it works only in MSIE 4.0 and above. I took some time to play with the code and got it to work in Netscape  and of course MSIE also .  370   Script Tip 9 ➤ A 16.7 Million-Color Script  Making It Work in Netscape Okay, let’s just stop and think it through. For this script to run in Netscape Navigator  NN , you must eliminate all the commands NN doesn’t understand. Therefore, document.all and document.all “box” .style.background must be eliminated.  You have to flip the script upside down for NN to run it. For NN to run hierarchy state- ments, the elements must already be loaded into the browser memory. In the case of the MSIE-only script, the commands came first and then the table was built. It’s opposite here: First, you have to build the table, and then you can post the function.  Finally, in NN, table cells are not seen as individual items. You can’t change a specific cell in a dynamic fashion. You can, however, change the page background. You’ll do that next.  Changing that background is shown in Figure ST9.2.  Figure ST9.2 It’s basically the same script, except the entire background changes rather than just a bar of color. I actually like the effect much better because I can see a bigger patch of the color.  371  To see the effect on your own computer, click Script Tip NineB in your download packet, or see it online at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com stips scripttip68effect.html.  The code is available for copy and paste at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com stips script- tip68script.html or by viewing the source of the page in your download packet. I don’t know that such a long script needs to be reposted here for just a few changes.   Losing the MSIE-Only Commands The biggest thing is to find an equivalent to the way the original author worked with docu- ment.all. It was basically a line of code that had to be true for the function to work. So, I set up an if statement that will always be true. The code is at the top of the script:  JavaScript Goodies  var zork = 1 if  zork==1   I created a variable named zork and set it to 1. Next, I asked if zork was equal to 1. It is, of course, so the script goes on. The drop-down menu is assigned the entire run of hex codes.  Flipping the Table and Function Note the script. I just copied and pasted the document.write statements above the function. It was a simple cut and paste.  Changing the Page Background Step three is to set up the script so that the background is being changed rather than the table cell. The first line of code in the function is now set up to alter document.bgColor— the background of the page. The user’s choices are gathered just the same way as before; I didn’t change that at all.  One More Slight Change Instead of having the page background appear white, I had it appear black because that’s what the drop-down menus read when the page is first loaded. I did that by adding a BGCOLOR attribute in the   flag.  Now the script will run in Netscape as well as MSIE. This is actually a good way to help you learn JavaScript. Find a script that will run only in one browser or another; then take the time to find out why and alter the script so it will run in both.  Because of the makeup of the browsers, I wasn’t able to get the effect exact, but I got pretty close, don’t you think?  372   Script Tip 10  A Digital Clock with Image Display  In lesson 40 in Chapter 7, “Clocks, Counts, and Scroll Text,” I told you that I had a digital clock that runs displaying numbers. This is it. You need a lot of little parts to make in run. First, let me show you the code; then we’ll get to where you can grab the parts you’ll need.  Here’s the script:        <!--  var d=new Array  ; for i=0;i<10;i++  { d[i]=new Image  ; d[i].src=”dgt”+i+”.gif”; } var pm=new Image; pm.src=”dgtp.gif”;   JavaScript Goodies  var am=new Image; am.src=”dgta.gif”; var dates,min,sec,hour; var amPM=”am”;  function clock   { dates=new Date  ; hour=dates.getHours  ; min=dates.getMinutes  ; sec=dates.getSeconds  ; if hour < 12  { amPM=am.src; } if hour > 11  { amPM=pm.src; hour=hour-12; } if hour == 0  { hour=12; } if hour < 10  { document[“tensHour”].src=”dgtbl.gif”; document[“Hour”].src=d[hour].src; } if hour > 9  { document[“tensHour”].src=d[1].src; document[“Hour”].src=d[hour-10].src; } if min < 10  { document[“tensMin”].src=d[0].src; } if min > 9  { document[“tensMin”].src=d[parseInt min 10,10 ].src; } document[“Min”].src=d[min%10].src; if sec < 10  { document[“tensSec”].src=d[0].src; } if sec > 9  { document[“tensSec”].src=d[parseInt sec 10,10 ].src; } document[“Sec”].src=d[sec%10].src; document[“amPM”].src=amPM;  374   Script Tip 10 ➤ A Digital Clock with Image Display  setTimeout “clock  ;”,100 ; }   -->             ➥   ➥   ➥  ➥   ➥          Here’s the clock. You’ll get something that looks similar to Figure ST10.1.  Figure ST10.1 A screen capture from the Script Tip showing the clock and the images you must download to install the clock on your page.

The images you’ll need are available through a Zip file found in your download packet or online at http:  www.htmlgoodies.com JSBook digitalclockface.zip.

The names of the numbers speak for themselves. The A and the P are for a.m. and p.m., respectively, and the dgtcol image is the colon column. The dgtbl is the blank image that shows up when nothing is called for—it’s also the default image. It shows up even if the script doesn’t run. You’ll see that in the image code.  And speaking of that code, here it is:                       Now, you might have noticed that I have listed them vertically, but in the code on the page they’re all in one long line. When you put this on your page, use the long line. The reason is that browsers often mistake a carriage return for a space. If that happens, a space will exist between each number and the effect will die.  You’ll notice I’ve broken out the dgtcol images. They never change, so at this point, you need not worry about them.  376   Script Tip 10 ➤ A Digital Clock with Image Display  The two hour numbers are broken down into tensHour and Hour. The minutes are done the same way  tensMin and Min , as are seconds  tensSec and Sec .  The final digit is the amPM image.  Now that you have the image code down, let’s load them.  Loading All the Images One of the main concerns about running a digital clock like this one is getting all those images into the browser’s memory cache. If you have to wait for a download every time a new number is needed, the effect will die. You want all those images loaded when they’re called for, so you should preload them. Here’s the code that does it:  var d=new Array  ; for i=0;i<10;i++  { d[i]=new Image  ; d[i].src=”dgt”+i+”.gif”; }  This is a very clever piece of script. Ten images must load: the numbers 0–9. There are other images, yes, but it’s the numbers we’re concerned with right now.  You begin by setting up an array, but the array doesn’t exist yet. You’ll build it in a moment, and it will be named d.  This code forms a loop. Remember that from lesson 35 in Chapter 6, “Mathematics, Random Things, and Loops?” In this case it’s a for loop with three conditions, and i equals 0. As long as i is less than 10, it will loop through. If i isn’t yet 10, you add 1 to it  ++ . Therefore, i will eventually equal 10 and the loop will stop.  Whatever is between the curly brackets  { }  following the loop is done every time the loop flows through.  Notice the square brackets  [ ] . That’s JavaScript for a number replacement. The variable i is sitting in there. Each time the script loops through, i is replaced with the number it rep- resents set by the previous loop.  So, the first time the loop executes, this is created:  d0=new Image  ; d0.src=”dgt0”.gif”;  The next time, you get this:  d1=new Image  ; d1.src=”dgt1”.gif”;  377   JavaScript Goodies  Following the process through, the script runs 10 times. Recognize the format? The codes it’s creating are preloads. By looping through, the digit images are preloaded.  What about the other images? Here you go:  var pm=new Image; pm.src=”dgtp.gif”; var am=new Image; am.src=”dgta.gif”; var dates,min,sec,hour; var amPM=”am”;  Okay, they’re in the cache. Let’s post them, correctly, to the page.  Displaying the Images Let’s begin playing around with replacing those image tags with the correct numbers, depending on what time it is.  The time is grabbed from the user’s browser, so there’s no need to worry about daylight savings time or time zones. As long as the viewer has her browser set correctly, you’re good to go. If she doesn’t, well, you can’t help that.  Let’s start at the top of the script just below the loading loop and code:  function clock   { dates=new Date  ; hour=dates.getHours  ; min=dates.getMinutes  ; sec=dates.getSeconds  ; if hour < 12  { amPM=am.src; } if hour > 11  { amPM=pm.src; hour=hour-12; } if hour == 0  { hour=12; } if hour < 10  { document[“tensHour”].src=”dgtbl.gif”; document[“Hour”].src=d[hour].src; } if hour > 9  {  378   Script Tip 10 ➤ A Digital Clock with Image Display  document[“tensHour”].src=d[1].src; document[“Hour”].src=d[hour-10].src; } if min < 10  { document[“tensMin”].src=d[0].src; } if min > 9  { document[“tensMin”].src=d[parseInt min 10,10 ].src; } document[“Min”].src=d[min%10].src; if sec < 10  { document[“tensSec”].src=d[0].src; } if sec > 9  { document[“tensSec”].src=d[parseInt sec 10,10 ].src; } document[“Sec”].src=d[sec%10].src; document[“amPM”].src=amPM; setTimeout “clock  ;”,100 ; }  Don’t get put off by its size. It’s basically the same thing again and again after you get to the numbers.  Now … from the top!  The function is named clock  . You might have noticed that it’s called for by an onLoad event handler in the   tag. If you didn’t notice, well, it is.  First, you get to some basic clock-building JavaScript. Hopefully, you remember this from Chapter 7:  dates=new Date  ; hour=dates.getHours  ; min=dates.getMinutes  ; sec=dates.getSeconds  ;  The variable dates is given the value new Date  . Date   is a JavaScript method that con- tains all the elements of the current date and time. Remember?  See all the separate elements? Now, you need to use some more code to simply suck out the parts you want. In this case, you want the hour  getHours   , minutes  getMinutes   , and seconds  getSeconds   .  The three items are assigned the variable names hour, min, and sec, respectively.  379   JavaScript Goodies  Now that you have the elements, let’s test them:  if hour < 12  { amPM=am.src; } if hour > 11  { amPM=pm.src; hour=hour-12; } if hour == 0  { hour=12; }  Let’s start with the hour: If it’s less than 12, the image tag named amPM receives the am.src. If you remember the preload commands, that would be dgta.gif.  If the hour is greater than 11, you put the pm.src  dgtp.gif  into the tag amPM, and you take the number represented by hour and subtract 12. That’s because JavaScript works in mili- tary time. If the time is 20, you take away 12, and get 8 p.m. Get it?  Finally, what if hour is equal to 0  midnight ? The code says to make hour 12. Now that that’s all fixed, let’s place the hour:  if hour < 10  { document[“tensHour”].src=”dgtbl.gif”; document[“Hour”].src=d[hour].src; } if hour > 9  { document[“tensHour”].src=d[1].src; document[“Hour”].src=d[hour-10].src; }  You’re worried about two numbers here: If the hour is 10 or greater, you need to place a 1 in the first image and then whatever the hour is in the next. If the hour is 9 or less, you need a blank in the first digit space and whatever the number is below.  It works through a series of if statements. You start by asking whether the hour is less than 10. If so, the tenHour image tag gets the dgtbl.gif—that’s the blank image. The second image, Hour, gets the digit equal to the hour  1–9 . It’s done by using the square brackets and allowing the variable inside the square brackets to be replaced by the variable value. Make sense?  If the hour is greater than 10, the first image  tensHour  gets the number one image and the second number is created by the hour minute ten. Remember that the hour returned is in military time, but in the previous code, you took 12 away from any number greater than  380   Script Tip 10 ➤ A Digital Clock with Image Display  12. If the hour returned is 2300 hours, you subtracted 12, resulting in 11. Then, you took away 10 here, resulting in 1. 1 is then used to post the image.  The minutes and seconds are also done through some fancy mathematical fun.  Minutes and Seconds You’re in the home stretch now. You’ve grabbed the time, configured the returns into num- bers you can play with, and used those numbers to post the a.m. p.m. image and the two hour images. Now, you’ll set the minutes and seconds.  Here’s the code:  if min < 10  { document[“tensMin”].src=d[0].src; } if min > 9  { document[“tensMin”].src=d[parseInt min 10,10 ].src; } document[“Min”].src=d[min%10].src; if sec < 10  { document[“tensSec”].src=d[0].src; } if sec > 9  { document[“tensSec”].src=d[parseInt sec 10,10 ].src; } document[“Sec”].src=d[sec%10].src; document[“amPM”].src=amPM; setTimeout “clock  ;”,100 ;  The script plays with the minutes and seconds in the same way it did the hours, through if conditional statements.  If the minute returned is less than tensMIN  the first minute image , it is set to d0.src. If you look at the previous script, you’ll see that is the dgt0.gif.  If the minute is more than 9, you must get the correct 10 number in the tensMin position. You already know that the minute returned is 10 or above, so you need 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. The little math equation parseInt min 10,10  does the trick.  parseInt is a JavaScript function that turns a text string into an integer and returns that integer. Let’s say that the minute returned is 43. If you divide 43 by 10, you get 4.3. The second number allows you to set the base of the integer returned. In this case, 10 is the base. That gets rid of whatever comes after the decimal point  3 in this example . The number returned is therefore 4.  381   JavaScript Goodies  Now that you have the first minute image, you need the second. That is done, again, by a quick mathematic equation. The value assigned to Min is arrived at by taking the minute returned, dividing it by 10, and returning the remainder. That’s what the percentage sign does.  For example, say the minute returned is 36. If you divide that by 10, you get 3.6. The remainder is 6, which is what’s returned.  The seconds are done exactly the same way, following the same math and using the sec- onds returned.  Finally, the amPM flag is given the value represented by the variable amPM from the previous code. Remember that? It was almost the first thing you set in the script.  Okay, you’ve posted all the images. The problem is that the second changes, well, every second. You need to get this script to run again and again to repost again and again. The effect is a running digital clock.  The setTimeout   method does that; it’s set to run the function clock   every 100 1000ths of a second.  That should do it.  382   Appendix A  JavaScript Basic Concepts  This appendix contains the following:  Literals Boolean Literals Comments Document Object Model Event Handlers Literal Integers Methods Objects Operators Properties String Variable  Literals A literal is a name assigned to a variable. It is an unchanging title that remains throughout the script. Here’s an example:  var browser = navigator.Appname   JavaScript Goodies  This has created a variable called browser that is now equal to the browser name.  A literal string is any set of characters with quotation marks around it. This set of characters doesn’t change. For example, in this code  document.write “Hello there”   “Hello there” is a literal string.  Boolean Literals Boolean literals are literals that have only two values, 1 and 0. The Boolean literal often is used to represent true  1  and false  0 . It helps to think of the true and false as yes and no. Consider this example:  window.open “” NAME=”newwindow” HEIGHT=300,WIDTH=300,TOOLBAR=1;   The toolbar=1 is a Boolean literal that means yes, you want a toolbar.  Comments Comments are lines of text that are written to the page but do not affect the script’s work- ings. The most common use is to add lines into a script along the way as a description of what is happening:      This prompt requests user name and assigns it the variable ‘username’ var username = prompt “What is Your Name?”     In the previous code you see the double slash comment command. The double slash      comments out everything that follows it as long as it stays on the same line. If you allow the text to go to another line without another set of double slashes, the script will think the comment is part of the code and will most probably throw an error.  Multiple-line comments can be created using this format:   *In between the slash and star, you can have  multiple lines of text.  As long as the code is surrounded it will all comment out.*   Rule of thumb: Keep the asterisk on the side of the slash closest to the text.  384   Appendix A ➤ JavaScript Basic Concepts  Document Object Model The concept of hierarchy is of the utmost importance to JavaScript. An example is writing a line to denote a specific text box HTML form element. Let’s say the form itself is named FormA and the text box is named Tbox.  The HTML code would look like this:         If you were to write a line of JavaScript representing the text that a user might type into that text box, the code would look like this:  window.document.FormA.Tbox.value  That statement shows the hierarchy of the page. The browser window, window, is the largest overriding element in the statement. All events will happen within the browser window. The document  document  is the next largest, and then the form itself  FormA . Next is the text box  Tbox , and finally value, which represents what the user has typed into the text box.  The concept of hierarchy is consistent throughout JavaScript and is known as the Document Object Model  DOM .  The name DOM, however, is not very descriptive. So, throughout this book, the term hier- archy statement is used to represent the DOM in any JavaScript.  Event Handlers An event handler is a command that sits inside an HTML flag and does not require the beginning   flag to work. An example is using an onClick event handler inside the HTML code for a button. When the mouse clicks on the button, the event handler per- forms the event it’s set up to do. Here’s an example:    <INPUT TYPE=”button” VALUE=”Click For An Alert” onClick=”alert “Thanks for clicking!” ”>    When the button is clicked, the alert button pops up. You can get a complete list of event handlers in Appendix B, “JavaScript Command Reference.”  385   JavaScript Goodies  Literal Integers A literal integer is any whole number. For instance, 9 is a literal integer, whereas 9.23 is not. Literal integers can also be hexadecimal notation employing the numbers 1–9 and the let- ters a–f. This hex color code for purple is an example of a literal integer: 800080.  Methods A method is any function that acts on an object. The command window.open   is used to open a new browser window. In this case, window is the object and open   is the method acting on the object.  Methods can be easily recognized by the two parentheses immediately following them. Sometimes those parentheses are given certain parameters by putting those parameters between the parentheses. When the parentheses are empty, the method acts fully on the object it follows.  Objects Objects are items that already exist to JavaScript, such as Math or Date or are created through JavaScript code. Objects are items that either can be acted on or have certain properties or characteristics attached to them.  Operators Think of an operator as something that connects or works between two literals. The binary operators shown in Table A.1 are the most common.  Table A.1 Binary Operators Operator + - *   %  Meaning Add Subtract Multiply Divide Divide and return remainder  The operators in Table A.2 test the relationships between literals.  386   Appendix A ➤ JavaScript Basic Concepts  Table A.2 Operators Testing Relationships Between Literals Operator < > <= >= = == !=  & && ?:  Meaning Less than Greater than Less than or equal to Greater than or equal to Assignment Equal to Not equal to Or And  adding JavaScript commands together  And  literal  Conditional  The operators in Table A.3 are used to separate and end JavaScript commands and lines.  Table A.3 Operators That Separate and End JavaScript Commands Operator , ;  Meaning Separates commands Ends a line of JavaScript  Properties A property is a characteristic or portion of a larger object. An example of a property is the status bar of the browser window written this way: window.status  object.property .  String A string is any number of characters inside double or single quotation marks. Here’s an example:  document.write “This is a string”   This example simply writes that string to the HTML document.  Variable The ability to assign variable names to lines of code is paramount in JavaScript. Except for JavaScript commands themselves and an additional short list of unacceptable variable  387   JavaScript Goodies  names in Appendix C, “JavaScript Reserved Variable Words,” a variable can be any series of letters or numbers, or a combination of both.  JavaScript allows for two levels of variables, local and global.  Local variables are variables that are viable only within a function. JavaScript understands that whenever a variable is encased within a function, that variable name is viable only inside that function. That way, if you copy and paste a script onto a page that already has a script on it, any variables that are equally named will not clash as long as that variable name is found within a function.  Global variables are variables that are not found within functions, and therefore they can clash with the variables on the same page.  Here’s an example:    var joe = 12 function writeit   { var joe = “Joe Burns” document.write joe  }    The variable joe is used twice, but because one occurrence is found outside the function— the global variable—and one is found inside the function—the local variable—the two will not clash.  Now, with all that said, it is not a good idea to follow this format and use similar variable names within your scripts. The purpose of the local variables being hidden is far more for protection against clashes with other scripts on the same page than with variable names within the same script.  388   Appendix B  JavaScript Command Reference  This appendix is arranged in alphabetical order. It covers the commands found in this book, plus commands that can be substituted in some of the scripts in this book.  Please note that JavaScript is case sensitive. The capitalization pattern used in this appendix is how the commands must appear in your scripts; otherwise, they will not work.  action Property An action works with the return of an HTML form. It works the same as the value you assign to the ACTION attribute when you define a form, and it’s primarily used to call server- side CGI scripts. It’s used to actually do something with the form information. Let’s say you have a form you have named forma. It would look like this:         You could send the output of that form to an e-mail address by using the following com- mand:          JavaScript Goodies  alert Method The alert method displays a JavaScript modal dialog box containing the text noted in the command. The alert box offers only an OK button—unlike the confirm box, which offers both an OK and a Cancel button. Follow this format to have an alert box open upon the loading of the page:     The alert box is shown in Figure B.1.  Figure B.1 An alert box.  You can find alert used as part of a JavaScript example in Lesson 6 in Chapter 2, “Popping Up Text with Mouse Events.”  See also: confirm and prompt  alinkColor Property You use alinkColor to return the active link color using a document.write statement:    document.write “The active link color “ +document.alinkColor+ “.”     390   Appendix B ➤ JavaScript Command Reference  You can find alinkColor used as part of a JavaScript example in Lesson 3 in Chapter 1, “The Basics.”  See also: bgColor, fgColor, linkColor, and vlinkColor  appCodeName Property The appCodeName property returns the codename string of the browser. The command uses this format:    document.write “You are using “ +navigator.appCodeName+ “.”     You can find appCodeName used as part of a JavaScript example in Chapter 1, Lesson 3.  See also: appName, appVersion, navigator, and userAgent  appName Property This returns the official name of the browser string:    document.write “You are using “ +navigator.appName+ “.”     You can find appName used as part of a JavaScript example in Chapter 1, Lesson 3.  See also: appCodeName, appVersion, navigator, and userAgent  appVersion Property This command returns the browser version number string:    document.write “You are using “ +navigator.appVersion+ “.”     You can find appVersion used as part of a JavaScript example in Chapter 1, Lesson 3.  See also: appCodeName, appName, navigator, and userAgent  array Method Arrays are variables. For the most part, variables have only one value. However, an array is a variable with multiple values. An array can be an ordered collection of many numbers, letters, words, or objects, or a combination of those four.  391   JavaScript Goodies  When you create an array, the items are assigned a number, starting at 0 and counting up:  var NewArray= “item0”, “item1”, “item2”, “item3”   You can also set up arrays of literals by numbering them in this fashion:  var dayName=new Array 7  dayName[0]=”Sunday” dayName[1]=”Monday” dayName[2]=”Tuesday” dayName[3]=”Wednesday” dayName[4]=”Thursday” dayName[5]=”Friday” dayName[6]=”Saturday”  <SCRIPT LANGUAGE=”javascript” document.write dayName[5]     After creating an array, you can call for only one item of the array by calling for the item by number. Using the previous array of the days of the week, this code would return Friday:  You can find array first used as part of a JavaScript example in Lesson 15 in Chapter 3, “Manipulating Data and the Hierarchy of JavaScript.” Chapter 8, “Arrays,” is devoted to arrays.  back Method The back method is used in conjunction with the history object to move throughout the browser’s history list:   history.back      one page back in history history.back -3     moves three pages back in history    You can set the number so the back command moves as many pages as you want. Be care- ful, though, that the user actually has as many pages in his history as you call for.  Please note that if back is used within a frameset, the entire frameset will not reload. Each frame that was changed loads the page that came before it.  You can find back used as part of a JavaScript example in Chapter 2, Lesson 9.  See also: forward, go, and history  392   Appendix B ➤ JavaScript Command Reference  bgColor Property This sets or returns the document background color. Here, bgColor is used inside an HTML radio button and the onClick event handler to set the background color:         You can find bgColor used as part of a JavaScript example in Chapter 1, Lesson 3.  See also: alinkColor, fgColor, linkColor, and vlinkColor  big Method The big method is used to alter a text string. It sets the string to print to the document one font size bigger than the default:    var textString = “Hello there!” document.write textString.big       See also: blink, bold, fixed, fontcolor, fontsize, italics, small, and strike  blink Method The blink method sets a text string to blink on and off in the browser window:    var textString = “Hello there!” document.write textString.blink       This is a Netscape Navigator–only command. Internet Explorer will not recognize it. Besides, this is an unwelcome command. For the most part, people do not like blinking text, so use it sparingly if at all.  See also: big, bold, fixed, fontcolor, fontsize, italics, small, and strike  393   JavaScript Goodies  bold Method The bold method sets a text string to appear in bold text font:    var textString = “Hello there!” document.write textString.bold       See also: big, blink, fixed, fontcolor, fontsize, italics, small, and strike  close Method The close method acts on its object—window or self—to close the window. The following code shows how a button can close the main window using an onClick event handler:         See also: clear, open, window, write, and writeln  confirm Method The confirm method displays a dialog box that offers both an OK and a Cancel button. Refer to the section “The alert Method” earlier in this appendix for a different type of box. This script uses a function to offer a confirm box as a test when entering a page. The confirm method returns either true or false, depending on the user’s choice of button:    function confirmit   {if  !confirm  “Are you sure you want to enter?”   history.go -1 ;return “ “}    The confirm box is shown in Figure B.2.  You can find confirm used as part of a JavaScript example in Lesson 21 in Chapter 4, “Flipping Images and Opening Windows with Mouse Events.”  See also: alert and prompt  394   Appendix B ➤ JavaScript Command Reference  Figure B.2 The confirm box.  Date Object Date is an object that contains all date and time information, allowing for the return of both specific date and time strings. This is the simplest use of the object to return a full date and time string:    var  dayandtime = new Date   document.write “It is “ +dayandtime+ “.”     You can find Date used as part of a JavaScript example in Chapter 3, Lesson 12.  See also: getDate, getDay, getFullYear, getHours, getMinutes, getMonth, getSeconds, getTimezoneOffset, and getYear  defaultStatus Property of window The defaultStatus property of the window object is used to display a string message in the browser’s status bar. You use defaultStatus when you want an event to occur in the status bar requiring no loading. For example, a scroll would be placed in the status bar through a defaultStatus. A text rollover, which requires loading, should use “status”  covered later in the Appendix :  395   JavaScript Goodies    defaultStatus = “This page’s title is “ +document.title+ “.”    You can find defaultStatus used as part of a JavaScript example in Chapter 3, Lesson 14.  See also: status and window  document Object The document object represents the current HTML document loaded into the browser. Here, document is acted on by a write method to post text to the page:    document.write “Hello there!”     You can find document used as part of a JavaScript example in Chapter 1, Lesson 1.  See also: write and writeln  document Property document is both an object and a property. The document property is part of the window object. You don’t see window a great deal because the window object is often implied, as it is in this example:  document.bgColor = red  The technically correct method of writing the previous line is  window.document.bgcolor = red  However, because window is the overriding, highest-level object in JavaScript, window is not required at the beginning of hierarchy statements. It is simply implied.  See also: alinkColor, anchor, bgColor, cookie, fgColor, lastModified, linkColor, location, referrer, title, and vlinkColor  eval Method eval is a method that forces a string value to evaluate to a string expression. Here’s an example:  396   Appendix B ➤ JavaScript Command Reference    document.mypic.src=eval “img”+num+”.src”     You can find eval used as part of a JavaScript example in Lesson 36 in Chapter 6, “Mathematics, Random Things, and Loops.”  fgColor Property The fgColor property represents the foreground color  actually the text color  of the cur- rent HTML document. You could return the fgColor color  text color  using a document.write statement:    document.write “The text color “ +document.fgColor+ “.”     You can find fgColor used as part of a JavaScript example in Chapter 1, Lesson 3.  See also: alinkColor, bgColor, linkColor, and vlinkColor  fixed Method The fixed method sets a string to a font much like the typewriter text   font in HTML:    var textString = “Hello there!” document.write textString.fixed       See also: big, bold, fontcolor, fontsize, italics, small, and strike  fontcolor Method fontcolor works similarly to the   flag in HTML. It sets a string to a specific color:    var textString = “this will be red text” document.write textString.fontcolor “red”      See also: big, bold, fixed, fontsize, italics, small, and strike  397   JavaScript Goodies  fontsize Method fontsize sets a text string to a relative sized font much like the   HTML flag:    var textString = “this will be red text” document.write textString.fontsize “4”      See also: big, bold, fixed, fontcolor, italics, small, and strike  for loop The for loop is used to run a group of code statements repeatedly, by setting a series of parameters that have to be true for the looping to stop. Traditionally, for loops are used when you know how many times you want a loop to run. This is the format for a for loop:    for  i=1; i<=5; i=i+1  { JavaScript event }    The event loops as long as i is less than or equal to 5. Notice that each time the loop runs, i has one added to it; therefore, this script loops five times.  You can find the for loop used as part of a JavaScript example in Chapter 6, Lesson 35.  See also: while  forward Method forward is used with the history object to move through the browser’s history list:    history.forward         moves one page forward in the history history.back -3     moves three back in the history    You can set the number of pages higher or lower than 1, but remember that the user might not have visited enough pages for the button created by this code to work. It’s best to just use 1.  You can find forward used as part of a JavaScript example in Chapter 2, Lesson 9.  See also: back, go, and history  398   Appendix B ➤ JavaScript Command Reference  frame Property The frame property is used to denote a specific frame window, usually in terms of a hyper- text link. Frames are given a numeric order, starting with 0, in the order they appear on the HTML document. This example loads page.html into the second frame in the list of frame commands:         frame can also be written as an object representing a portion of the browser window set aside through HTML FRAMESET flags. The frame itself is named in the HTML as shown in the following code:           After it is named, each frame window is an object and can be targeted to receive a hyper- text link output through JavaScript, as shown in the following code:  parent.frame1=page3.html  function Object The purpose of the function command is to both combine and name a group of JavaScript events specifically to create a single event. By assigning a function name to a set of JavaScript commands, the entire group of events can be called later in the script by using just the function name.  The format for creating a function is shown in the following code. This function will be named bob:    function bob   { JavaScript commands and statements }    The function can be triggered to run in different ways. The following format calls the  function when the HTML document loads into the browser window. Note the parentheses  399   JavaScript Goodies  following the function name. It’s the same format used with a method to act on an object—that’s because a method is a function applied to an object.     You can find function first used as part of a JavaScript example in Chapter 3, Lesson 14.  getDate Method The getDate method returns the numeric integer of the day of the month  1–31, if the month has that many days :    RightNow = new Date  ; document.write “Today’s day is “ + RightNow.getDate  + “.”     You can find getDate used as part of a JavaScript example in Chapter 3, Lesson 12.  See also: getDay, getFullYear, getHours, getMinutes, getMonth, getSeconds, getTimezoneOffset, and getYear  getDay Method The getDay method returns the numeric integer of the day of the week, where Sunday is 0 and Saturday is 6:    RightNow = new Date  ; document.write “Today’s day is “ + RightNow.getDay  + “.”     This numeric representation is not very helpful. You’ll need to write a script to change the number into a day text string using an array.  You can find getDay used as part of a JavaScript example in Chapter 3, Lesson 12.  See also: getDate, getFullYear, getHours, getMinutes, getMonth, getSeconds, getTimezoneOffset, and getYear  getFullYear Method The getFullYear method returns a four-digit integer  rather than two  representation of the current year:  400   Appendix B ➤ JavaScript Command Reference    RightNow = new Date  ; document.write “The hours is “ + RightNow.getFullYear  + “.”     This command was created as a repair to the Y2K bug.  You can find getFullYear used as part of a JavaScript example in Chapter 3, Lesson 12.  See also: getDate, getDay, getHours, getMinutes, getMonth, getSeconds, getTimezoneOffset, and getYear  getHours Method The getHours method returns the numeric integer of the current hour in military format, 0–23:    RightNow = new Date  ; document.write “The hours is “ + RightNow.getHours  + “.”     You can find getHours used as part of a JavaScript example in Chapter 3, Lesson 12.  See also: getDate, getDay, getFullYear, getMinutes, getMonth, getSeconds, getTimezoneOffset, and getYear  getMinutes Method The getMinutes method returns the numeric integer of the current minute, 0–59:    RightNow = new Date  ; document.write “The minute is “ + RightNow.getMinutes  + “.”     You can find getMinutes used as part of a JavaScript example in Chapter 3, Lesson 12.  See also: getDate, getDay, getFullYear, getHours, getMonth, getSeconds, getTimezoneOffset, and getYear  getMonth Method The getMonth method returns the numeric integer of the current month. In one of the more interesting JavaScript quirks, this method is actually always off by 1 because it sees  401   JavaScript Goodies  January as 0. To fix that, you should always add 1 to the output of the method. Here’s the format:    RightNow = new Date  ; NewMonth = [RightNow.getMonth+1] document.write “The Month is “ + NewMonth + “.”     You can find getMonth used as part of a JavaScript example in Chapter 3, Lesson 12.  See also: getDate, getDay, getFullYear, getHours, getMinutes, getSeconds, getTimezoneOffset, and getYear  getSeconds Method The getSeconds method returns the numeric integer of the current second, 0–59:    RightNow = new Date  ; document.write “The seconds are “ + RightNow.getSeconds  + “.”     You can find getSeconds used as part of a JavaScript example in Chapter 3, Lesson 12.  See also: getDate, getDay, getFullYear, getHours, getMinutes, getMonth, getTimezoneOffset, and getYear  getTimezoneOffset Method The getTimezoneOffset method returns the number of minutes difference between your user’s computer and Greenwich mean time  GMT :    RightNow = new Date  ; document.write “The minutes offset is “+ RightNow.getTimezoneOffset  + “.”     See also: getDate, getDay, getFullYear, getHours, getMinutes, getMonth, getSeconds, and getYear  getYear Method The getYear method returns a two-digit representation of the year, created by taking the current year and subtracting 1900:  402   Appendix B ➤ JavaScript Command Reference    RightNow = new Date  ; document.write “The year is “ + RightNow.getYear  + “.”     You can get the full four-digit year representation by using the getFullYear method or by re-adding the 1900.  For years after 1999, getYear returns a three-digit value instead of a two-digit value.  You can find getYear used as part of a JavaScript example in Chapter 3, Lesson 12.  See also: getDate, getDay, getFullYear, getHours, getMinutes, getMonth, getSeconds, and getTimezoneOffset  go Method go works with the history object to load pages from the user’s history file:    history.go -2      Go back two pages in the history    You can find go used as part of a JavaScript example in Chapter 2, Lesson 9.  See also: forward and history  history Object history is an object representing the browser’s history file, which is the list of pages the viewer has visited during the current session. The following example returns the number of items listed in the history file. The command value is used to retrieve the number:    document.write “You’ve been to “ + history.length + “pages.”     You can find history used as part of a JavaScript example in Chapter 1, Lesson 3.  See also: back and forward  host Property The host property returns the name of the user’s host and the port being used to connect to the Internet. If no port is specified, just the host name is returned:  403   JavaScript Goodies    document.write “You’re from “ +location.host+ “.”     The line might return www.joe.com:80.  You can find host used as part of a JavaScript example in Chapter 1, Lesson 3.  See also: hostname, href, location, and protocol  hostname Property The hostname property returns the user’s host in the same manner as host, but without the port number attached:    document.write “You’re from “ +location.hostname+ “.”     The line might return www.joe.com.  You can find hostname used as part of a JavaScript example in Chapter 1, Lesson 3.  See also: host, href, location, and protocol  href Property of location href is used to denote a string of the entire URL of a specified window object. Using this property, you can open a specified URL in a window:         You can find href used as part of a JavaScript example in Chapter 2, Lesson 6.  See also: host, hostname, location, and protocol  if else The if else structure is a conditional statement. The format states that if something is true, enact a specified JavaScript event. If not, enact a different JavaScript event.  The format follows this pattern:    if  condition to be met  {JavaScript event}  404   Appendix B ➤ JavaScript Command Reference  If the condition following the if condition is met, the function in the first set of braces is enacted. If not, the function in the second set of braces runs.  In addition, you can set up a series of if conditions with no else. You would write one if statement after another, as shown in the following code:  else {some other JavaScript event}      if  condition to be met  {JavaScript event} if  condition to be met  {some other JavaScript event} if  condition to be met  {some other JavaScript event} if  condition to be met  {some other JavaScript event}    However, if you follow this format, you should ensure that one of the if statements will be true every time, even if it means adding a condition that acts as a catchall if all your con- ditions are false. By setting up your if else statements so that each time the script runs, at least one of them is true, you have control over whatever input the user or the script itself offers.  You can find if else first used as part of a JavaScript example in Chapter 4, Lesson 21.  indexOf Method The method indexOf returns the numeric location of a specific string or character. Because JavaScript counts everything and begins counting at 0, every string has an ordered set of letters.  In addition, indexOf can be used to check whether something does not appear in a string through the use of the -1 condition. Here’s an example:    if  document.TheForm.email.value.indexOf “@” ==-1  {alert “there’s no @, this is not a valid email address” } else {alert “Go on” }    405   JavaScript Goodies  This code checks to see whether the text string entered in the text box e-mail includes an @. You use -1 because 0 is actually an index number in the mind of JavaScript. Therefore, you can’t ask whether there are 0 instances of @. If an @ appears in the text box, there is a 0 index number. The -1 format checks for no instances.  You can find indexOf used as part of a JavaScript example in Lesson 43 in Chapter 7, “Clocks, Counts, and Scroll Text.”  italics Method The italics method is used to make a string print to a document in italics:    var textString = “Hello there!” document.write textString.italics       See also: big, bold, fontcolor, fontsize, small, and strike  lastModified Property When a document is altered and saved, or placed on a server, a date is recorded. The lastModified method returns that date to the current document:    document.write “I updated this page on “ +document.lastModified+ “.”     But remember that lastModified depends on the server’s records. It isn’t always accurate, so use it as a guide, rather than as an end-all for the last updated date.  You can find lastModified used as part of a JavaScript example in Chapter 1, Lesson 3.  See also: alinkColor, anchor, bgColor, cookie, fgColor, lastModified, linkColor, location, referrer, title, and vlinkColor  length Property The length property returns a number representing the number of items that appear with- in the object it is attached to. The following example returns the number of pages the user has visited by returning the length of the history object:    document.write “You’ve been to “ +history.length+ “pages”     406   Appendix B ➤ JavaScript Command Reference  This property can also be used to return the number or characters in a string or HTML form text box.  You can find length used as part of a JavaScript example in Lesson 24 in Chapter 5, “Forms: A Great Way to Interact with Your Users.”  See also: array and history  linkColor Property The linkColor property denotes or returns the color of the links within the current  document.  You could return the linkColor, in hexadecimal form, using a document.write statement:    document.write “The link color “ +document.linkColor+ “.”     You can find linkColor used as part of a JavaScript example in Chapter 1, Lesson 3.  See also: alinkColor, fgColor, and vlinkColor  location Object location represents Internet address information about the current HTML document. You can use the current location to jump to another location. The event will look similar to a simple hypertext link being clicked:           You can find location used as part of a JavaScript example in Chapter 2, Lesson 6.  See also: host, hostname, href, location, pathname, port, and protocol  location Property The location property represents the location of the current document. Use it to return the page’s URL:  407   JavaScript Goodies    document.write “You’re looking at “ +document.location+ “.”     You can find location used as part of a JavaScript example in Chapter 1, Lesson 3.  Math Object Note the capitalization: The M is uppercase. Math is an object, but by itself it means noth- ing other than that it represents mathematics. But after you attach a method to Math, it can represent a number or a method of manipulating numbers. Table B.1 lists many of the Math object’s methods and properties. You’ll be able to tell the methods because they are followed by parentheses—the properties are not. Again, notice the capitalization.  Table B.1 Math Object Methods Method Math.abs argument  Math.acos argument  Math.asin argument  Math.atan argument  Math.atan2 argument1, argument2  Math.ceil argument   Math.cos argument  Math.exp argument  Math.floor argument   Math.E Math.LN2 Math.LN10 Math.log Math.LOG10E Math.LOG2E Math.max arg1,arg2  Math.min arg1,arg2  Math.PI Math.pow arg1, arg2  Math.random Math.round  408  Return Value The absolute value of an argument The arc cosine of the argument The arc sine of the argument The arc tangent of the argument The angle of polar coordinates x and y The number 1 larger than or equal to the argu- ment The cosine of the argument A natural logarithm The number 1 less than or equal to the argu- ment Base of natural logarithms Logarithm of 2  appx. 0.6932  Logarithm of 10  appx. 2.3026  Logarithm of positive numbers greater than 0 Base-10 logarithm of E Base-2 logarithm of E The greater of the two arguments The lesser of the two arguments The value of pi arg1 raised to the arg2 power A random number between 0 and 1 Rounds to the nearest number   Appendix B ➤ JavaScript Command Reference  Table B.1 continued Method Math.sin argument  Math.sqrt argument  Math.SQRT1_2 Math.SQRT2 Math.tan argument   Return Value The sine of the argument The square root of the argument The square root of 1 2 The square root of 2 The tangent of the argument  The previous arguments are put together using these mathematics operators:  +: Add –: Subtract *: Multiply  : Divide  For example    Math.square 2*2     will return 2, the square root of four  2*2     Many of the preceding Math.methods that represent numbers can be used together to create mathematical equations. This code returns a random number between 1 and 50:    Math.round 50 * Math.random   ;    You can find Math, and some of the preceding methods, used as part of a JavaScript exam- ple in Chapter 6, Lesson 33.  navigator Object navigator is the object containing all the information regarding the user’s browser:    document.write “You’re using “ +navigator.appName+ “.”     You can find navigator used as part of a JavaScript example in Chapter 1, Lesson 3.  See also: appCodeName, appName, appVersion, and userAgent  409   JavaScript Goodies  onBlur Event Handler onBlur is enacted when the form item loses focus, meaning cursor attention has moved away from the element:         You can find onBlur used as part of a JavaScript example in Chapter 2, Lesson 6.  onChange Event Handler onChange occurs when data in a form item is changed and focus is moved off that item:          You can find onChange used as part of a JavaScript example in Chapter 2, Lesson 6.  onClick Event Handler When the mouse is clicked on a particular element identified by the event handler, onClick is enacted:         You can find onClick used as part of a JavaScript example in Chapter 2, Lesson 6.  onDblClick Event Handler onDblClick is new to the HTML 4.0 code and can be used in a range of elements, including forms, tables, and the   command that can encompass any item. The event handler is performed when the mouse is clicked twice. This example shows the use of the   flag:       The   command is only there to carry the onDblClick. It alters the image in no other way.  You can find onDblClick and   used as part of a JavaScript example in Chapter 2, Lesson 8.  410   Appendix B ➤ JavaScript Command Reference  onFocus Event Handler onFocus occurs when focus is placed on a form item, meaning it was clicked or moved to by pressing the Tab key:    <INPUT TYPE=”text” onFocus=”window.status=’Fill in your name’”    You can find onFocus used as part of a JavaScript example in Chapter 2, Lesson 6.  onKeyDown Event Handler onKeyDown is enacted when the user presses a key:         onKeyUp Event Handler When the user releases the key, onKeyUp is enacted:        onLoad Event Handler onLoad appears in the BODY flag of the HTML document:     Its purpose is to act as a trigger for a function, or the JavaScript code that is attached to it, when the page loads.  You can find onLoad used as part of a JavaScript example in Chapter 2, Lesson 6.  onMouseDown Event Handler onMouseDown is new with HTML 4.0, so not all browsers support it yet. This event occurs when the mouse button is clicked down:     You can find onMouseDown used as part of a JavaScript example in Chapter 2, Lesson 8.  411   JavaScript Goodies  onMouseMove Event Handler onMouseMove occurs when the user moves the mouse:     onMouseOut Event Handler onMouseOut is usually used in conjunction with the onMouseOver event handler to create an image flip effect:  <A HREF=”http:  www.cnn.com” onMouseOver=”document.pic1.src=’menu1on.gif’” ➥onMouseOut=”document.pic1.src=’menu1off.gif’”>     You can find onMouseOut used as part of a JavaScript example in Chapter 2, Lesson 7.  onMouseOver Event Handler When the mouse passes over the top of the item, onMouseOver occurs:  <A HREF=”http:  www.cnn.com” onMouseOver=”document.pic1.src=’menu1on.gif’” onMouseOut=”document.pic1.src=’menu1off.gif’”>     You can find onMouseOver used as part of a JavaScript example in Chapter 2, Lesson 5.  onMouseUp Event Handler onMouseUp takes place when the user releases the mouse button and is often used in con- junction with onMouseDown to create an effect of two events with one mouse click:  <A HREF=”http:  www.cnn.com” onMouseDown=”document.pic1.src=’menu1on.gif’” onMouseUp=”document.pic1.src=’menu1off.gif’”>     You can find onMouseUp used as part of a JavaScript example in Chapter 2, Lesson 8.  412   Appendix B ➤ JavaScript Command Reference  onSelect Event Handler onSelect is enacted when some, or all, of the form element is highlighted:         onSubmit Event Handler The onSubmit event occurs when the form is submitted. This event handler goes best in the submit-button portion of the HTML form:         You can find onSubmit used as part of a JavaScript example in Chapter 2, Lesson 6.  onUnload Event Handler Like the onLoad event handler, onUnload is often found in the BODY flag:     It is enacted when the user moves to another page or unloads the current page.  You can find onUnload used as part of a JavaScript example in Chapter 2, Lesson 6.  open Method You can use open to open a new browser window, in which you can load a whole new HTML document, or to create a second window from the original page. This code opens a new browser window and loads page.html into it:    window.open ‘page.html’       function openWindow    This example creates a new browser window and fills it with the text from the document.write statements:  413   JavaScript Goodies  { OpenWindow=window.open “”, “newwin”, “height=250,width=250”  OpenWindow.document.write “ ”  OpenWindow.document.write “ Welcome ”  OpenWindow.document.write “ ”  OpenWindow.document.write “ Welcome to my page! ”  OpenWindow.document.write “ ”  OpenWindow.document.write “ ”  }    This code sets the new window’s HEIGHT and WIDTH to 250 pixels. The open method also allows you to set the window elements shown in Table B.2.  Table B.2 Window Elements That Can Be Set with the open Method Window Element Toolbar Menu bar Scrollbars Resizable Location Directories Status  Can Be Set to… Yes or no Yes or no Yes or no Yes or no Yes or no Yes or no Yes or no  You can find open, and the commands listed previously, used as part of a JavaScript  example in Chapter 4, Lesson 19.  See also: window  parent Property of frame and window parent is used in hierarchy statements to denote the document in a frame situation or the document that spawned the new window:         See also: frame and window  414   Appendix B ➤ JavaScript Command Reference  pathname Property The pathname method is used to return the path portion of a URL without the root of the server:    document.write “You’re at www.joe.com ” +location.pathname+ “.”     See also: host, hostname, href, port, and protocol  port Property port returns the port the user is attached to during her Internet session:    document.write “You’re using port: “ +location.port+ “.”     See also: host, hostname, href, pathname, and protocol  prompt Method prompt is used to display a JavaScript dialog box in order to gather information from the user. The prompt is always assigned a variable. The information offered by the user then takes on that variable name. If the user offers no information, the value for the variable is entered as null.  In the following example, the text in the first set of quotation marks appears on the prompt box. The text in the second set of quotation marks appears in the text area on the prompt box. If you do not want text in the text area, leave the quotation marks empty:    var name =  prompt “This is a Prompt Box”, “write your name here”     Figure B.3 shows what the prompt box looks like.  You can find prompt used as part of a JavaScript example in Chapter 3, Lesson 11.  See also: alert and confirm  415   JavaScript Goodies  Figure B.3 The prompt box.  protocol Property protocol is the set of rules used by the browser to deal with the currently loaded page or the file the hypertext link is pointing at:    document.write “This document is displayed using “+location.protocol+ “.”     Returned strings might include http, ftp, mailto, news, file, or JavaScript.  See also: host, hostname, href, pathname, and port  referrer Property referrer returns the URL of the document visited just before the current document:    document.write “You just came from “ +location.referrer+ “.”     You can find referrer used as part of a JavaScript example in Chapter 1, Lesson 3.  See also: document  416   Appendix B ➤ JavaScript Command Reference  self Property self denotes the current window. This example creates a button that closes the current window:         selectedIndex Property selectedIndex is used to return the number representing the index of a select item. For example, the following HTML form drop-down menu box is a series of select items:        Red   Green   Blue      The options Red, Green, and Blue are numbered 0, 1, and 2, respectively. To return that index number to a JavaScript, you would use this hierarchy statement:  document.FormA.SelectBox.selectedIndex  You can find selectedIndex used as part of a JavaScript example in Chapter 5, Lesson 27.  setDate Method The method setDate is used to set a number representing the day of the month, 1–31, through the Date object:    var Millenium = new Date    var pointintime = Millenium.setDate “January 1, 2005”     The date January 1, 2005 is now a set point in the future and can be used to figure the amount of time between a point in time and January 1, 2005.  See also: setHours, setMinutes, setMonth, setSeconds, setTime, setTimeout, and setYear  417   JavaScript Goodies  setHours Method setHours is used to set the current hour from 0  midnight  through 23  military format  as a specific point in time. The format is    var Millenium = new Date    var pointintime = Millenium.setHours “January 1, 2001”      The format can be used to figure the number of hours until the specified date.  See also: setDate, setMinutes, setMonth, setSeconds, setTime, setTimeout, and setYear  setMinutes Method setMinutes is used to set the minute, 0–59, as a specific point in time. The format is    var Millenium = new Date    var pointintime = Millenium.setMinutes “January 1, 2001”      The format can be used to figure the number of minutes until the specified date.  See also: setDate, setHours, setMonth, setSeconds, setTime, setTimeout, and setYear  setMonth Method setMonth is used to set the current month, 0  January  through 11  December , as a specific point in time. The format is    var Millenium = new Date    var pointintime = Millenium.setMonth “January 1, 2001”      The format can be used to figure the number of months until the specified date.  See also: setDate, setHours, setMinutes, setSeconds, setTime, setTimeout, and setYear  418   Appendix B ➤ JavaScript Command Reference  setSeconds Method setSeconds is used to set the current second, 0–59, as a specific point in time. The format is    var Millenium = new Date    var pointintime = Millenium.setSeconds “January 1, 2001”      The format can be used to figure the number of seconds until the specified date.  See also: setDate, setHours, setMinutes, setMonth, setTime, setTimeout, and setYear  setTime Method setTime is the base of the Date object. It returns the number of milliseconds since  January 1, 1970 until the point in time set by you. The format is as follows:    var Millenium = new Date    var pointintime =  Millenium.setTime “January 1, 2001”      The format can be used to figure the total time until the specified date.  See also: setDate, setHours, setMinutes, setMonth, setSeconds, setTimeout, and setYear  setTimeout Method The setTimeout method is used to fire a function after a set amount of down time. The method should be used inside the function it will affect. The format is    function joe   { JavaScript events  var timer = setTimeout “joe  ”, 1000  }    419   JavaScript Goodies  This format loops the function joe repeatedly, waiting 1 second before starting the loop the next time. Remember that JavaScript counts time in milliseconds, so 1000 is equal to 1 second.  You can find setTimeout used as part of a JavaScript example in Chapter 7, Lesson 42.  setYear Method setYear is used to set the current year, minus 1900, as a two-digit representation. The for- mat is    var Millenium = new Date    var pointintime = Millenium.setYear “January 1, 2001”     The format can be used to figure the number of years until the specified date.  See also: setDate, setHours, setMinutes, setMonth, setTime, and setTimeout  You can find setYear used as part of a JavaScript example in Chapter 7, Lesson 41.  small Method small is used to alter text strings to display one size smaller than the browser default:    var textString = “Hello There” document.write “textString.small  ”     See also: big and fontsize  status Property The status area is the lowest portion of the browser window. It’s where Document Done appears when a page has finished loading. You can direct and alter the display in this space using this format:   link   You can find status used as part of a JavaScript example in Chapter 2, Lesson 5.  420   Appendix B ➤ JavaScript Command Reference  strike Method strike is used to create a strikethrough effect on a text string:    var textString = “Hello There!” document.write textString.strike       See also: big, bold, italic, and small  sub Method sub is used to create a subscript, such as the 2 in H2O:    var textString = “2” document.write “H”  document.write textString.sub    document.write “O”     See also: big, bold, italic, small, and sup  substring Method The method substring is used to return a portion of a text string between two indexes. Here’s an example:    var TextString = “Merry Christmas” var TheString = TextString.substring 1,0     This JavaScript returns the first letter of the text string because the number 1 is the greater of the two indexes.  sup Method sup works the same way as the sub method. It’s used to create superscript text, such as the st in 1st:    var textString = “st”  421   JavaScript Goodies  document.write “1”  document.write textString.sup       See also: big, bold, italic, small, and sub  title Property title refers to the title of the HTML document. Used with document, you can return the page’s title:    document.write “The Title is “ +document.title+ “.”     You can find title used as part of a JavaScript example in Chapter 1, Lesson 3.  toLowerCase Method toLowerCase is used to change a text string to all lowercase letters:    var textString = “Hello There!” document.write textString.toLowerCase       You can find toLowerCase used as part of a JavaScript example in Chapter 5, Lesson 24.  See also: toUpperCase  toUpperCase Method toUpperCase is used to change a text string to all uppercase letters:    var textString = “Hello There!” document.write textString.toUpperCase       The toUpperCase and toLowercase methods are good for case-insensitive string compar- isons.  You can find toUpperCase used as part of a JavaScript example in Chapter 5, Lesson 24.  See also: toLowerCase  422   Appendix B ➤ JavaScript Command Reference  userAgent Property userAgent returns the HTTP protocol header used to load the current HTML document:    document.write “The header reads “ +document.userAgent+ “.”     You can find userAgent used as part of a JavaScript example in Chapter 1, Lesson 3.  See also: appCodeName, appName, and appVersion  value Property value represents the text that is written, or given, to an HTML form item. The value of a text box or text area is the text the user has typed in. The value of a radio button or check box is a simple 1  yes  or 0  no , depending on whether the user has clicked the element.  In the following code         the text a user typed into the form’s text box is represented by  document.FormA.Tbox.value  You can find value used as part of a JavaScript example in Chapter 5, Lesson 23.  var Variable var is used to assign a variable name to a string or set of JavaScript commands. The tradi- tional method follows this pattern:    var navapp = navigator.appName document.write navapp    Now you can call for navigator.appName throughout the remainder of the script with just the variable name navapp.  Actually, the single equal sign is enough to set a variable name. The var isn’t required, but it’s still a good idea to use it to help yourself when writing scripts.  You can find var first used as part of a JavaScript example in Chapter 3, Lesson 11.  423   JavaScript Goodies  See also: the descriptions of local and global variables in Appendix A, “JavaScript Basic Concepts”  vlinkColor Property vlinkColor is used to return the current HTML document’s visited link color:    document.write “The link color is “ +document.vlinkColor+ “.”     You can find vlinkColor used as part of a JavaScript example in Chapter 1, Lesson 3.  See also: alinkColor, bgColor, fgColor, and linkColor  while Loop The while loop is a format that enables a JavaScript—or a set of JavaScript statements—to run again and again as long as a condition has not been met. Traditionally, while loops are used when you do not know how many times the script will loop. This is a possible format for a while loop:    var loops=input from a prompt or other method within the script var num=1 while  num <= loops  { JavaScript event }    Because the number that will be assigned to the loops variable is unknown, a while loop is used with a condition so that when the loop’s variable number equals the number returned from the script  num <= loops , the looping will stop.  You can find the while loop used as part of a JavaScript example in Chapter 6, Lesson 36.  See also: for loop  window Object The window is the browser window. This is the highest-level object accessible in the JavaScript hierarchy  DOM .  You can find window used as part of a JavaScript example in Chapter 2, Lesson 5.  424   Appendix B ➤ JavaScript Command Reference  For examples of its use, see the frame, parent, self, status, and top properties.  See also: alert, close, confirm, open, prompt, and write methods, and the onLoad and onUnload event handlers  write Method write is used with the document object to write lines of text to an HTML document. Those lines appear on the pages just as written, carrying no effects from the script. In this instance, the command is simply a delivery device:    document.write “Hello There!”     You can find write used as part of a JavaScript example in Chapter 1, Lesson 1.  See also: writeln  writeln Method The writeln method works much the same way as the write method. Using writeln affects how the document looks in its source code, breaking lines where the next writeln method starts. It does not alter the look of a document in the browser window—only in the source code:    document.writeln “Hello There!”     You can find writeln used as part of a JavaScript example in Chapter 1, Lesson 1.  See also: write  425    Appendix C  JavaScript Reserved Variable Words  When naming variables or functions, you must be careful not to use a word that already exists in the JavaScript language. The command words found in Appendix A, “JavaScript Basic Concepts,” and Appendix B, “JavaScript Command Reference,” are all off-limits.  You’ll do yourself a world of good if you start following a variable-naming convention. For example, you could start naming all your variables starting with your initials or your first name. I use the names of my family. I never run into trouble that way.  In addition, here is a list of off-limits words. Although they might not be currently in use in the JavaScript language, they are reserved for later versions of JavaScript:  abstract  default  break  byte  case  catch  char  class  const  continue  do  double  extends  false  final  finally  float  for  goto  if  implements  import  in  int  long  interface  native  new  null  package  private  public  return  short  instanceof  protected   JavaScript Goodies  static  super  switch  synchronized  this  throw  throws  And, of course, var and function are off-limits.  transient  true  try  void  while  with  428   Appendix D  Scripts Available on htmlgoodies. com  This appendix contains the following scripts:  Alert Scripts Button, Links, and E-mail Scripts The Three Cs: Clocks, Calendars, and Calculator Scripts Color Scripts Game Scripts HTML and Developer Scripts Image Scripts Scrolling Scripts Text-Based Scripts Miscellaneous Scripts  The http:  www.htmlgoodies.com JSBook  site offers more than 500 JavaScripts from many great authors. Each script is available for you to test, download, and use. Try your hand at altering some of these scripts. Make them better, change where the output appears in the browser window, or just use them as they are. They’re ready to go.   JavaScript Goodies  The scripts are loosely broken into the following categories:  Alert scripts—Such as button, link, and e-mail scripts; these all produce alert, prompt, or confirm boxes. Buttons and e-mail scripts—These deal with buttons and e-mail scripts. Clocks, calculators, and calendar scripts—These deal with numbers, times, or dates. Color scripts—These deal with color. Game scripts—These either play games or deal with them as their topics. Also, some scripts deal with leisure activities, such as music. HTML and developer scripts—These deal with HTML and the development of Web pages. A lot of these scripts work “behind the scenes” to create a look or an event to help your Web pages or Web site. This is also where you’ll find all the  password-protection scripts. Image scripts—These deal with, display, manipulate, or create image animation. Scrolling scripts—These scroll text in the document window, text boxes, and the status bar, among other places. Text-based scripts—These all have one thing in common: They produce text and manipulate text on the HTML document. Miscellaneous scripts—These don’t fit anywhere else.  Without further ado, here’s the list of scripts.  Alert Scripts These scripts all use alert, prompt, or confirm boxes.  No Clicking!: This script disables the user’s ability to click the page.
