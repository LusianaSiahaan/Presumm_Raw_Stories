Whether you are just starting  out with iPhone Development or already have some knowledge in this area, you will benefit  from what this book covers. Using this book's straightforward, step-by-step approach, you  will go from Xcode 4 apprentice to Xcode 4 Jedi master in no time.  Xcode 4 iOS Development Beginner's Guide will help you learn to build simple, yet powerful  applications for the iPhone from the ground up. You will master the Xcode 4   tools and skills needed to create applications that are simple yet, like Yoda, punch far   above their weight.  In this book, I have tried my level best to keep the code simple and easy to understand. I  have provided step-by-step instructions with screenshots at each step to make it easier.  You will soon be mastering the technology and skills needed to create some stunning  applications. Feel free to contact me at geniesoftstudios@gmail.com for any queries.  Any suggestions for improving this book will be highly appreciated.  What this book covers  Chapter 1, Introducing Xcode 4 Tools for iOS Development, introduces the developer to the  Xcode developer set of tools, the new features of the iOS 4 SDK and the iOS Architecture  Layers and their components. It also includes a discussion of Cocoa, Cocoa-Touch, and the  basics of object-oriented programming using Objective-C.  Chapter 2, Introducing the Xcode 4 Workspace, discusses how to download and install   the Xcode 4 and iOS4 SDK and introduces you to the Xcode 4 development environment   and the different types of libraries that are part of the workspace to create a simple   iPhone application.  Chapter 3, Working with the Interface Builder, introduces the developer to the Interface  Builder application and explains the iOS application life cycle when an application is run.   It also covers how to implement file saving and loading of Document-based applications,   as well as how to reposition the controls within the view when the device is rotated.   Preface  Chapter 4, Working with the Xcode Frameworks, introduces the developer to the different  types of Xcode frameworks for audio and video playback, and Core Location services for  determining geographical locations. It also covers how to build a simple database application  using the Core Data Framework.  Chapter 5, Designing Application Interfaces using MVC, introduces the developer to the  various layers of MVC and design patterns and the importance of implementing these in iOS  applications. It also covers how to interact with the user, with lots of code examples.  Chapter 6, Displaying Notification Messages, explores the different notification methods  through which we can communicate with the user to grab their attention, by using alerts,  activity indicators, sounds, and vibrations, with lots of code examples.  Chapter 7, Exploring the MultiTouch Interface, shows you how easy it is to incorporate both  single-touch and multi-touch support into your applications and include support for tapping,  pinching, and swipes. You will also learn about the built-in shake gesture and how to go  about responding to the shake motions, before finally learning about the accelerometer  and the new gyroscope features, as well as how to control your application UI when the  orientation changes.  Chapter 8, Debugging Xcode Projects, shows us how to go about debugging our projects,  through the use of the various debugging tools that Xcode provides. We are also introduced  to the new debugging features of the editor, and how to use the Static Analyzer tool to  determine potential memory leaks, dead code, and unreachable code, as well as using the  new Fix-it! feature to correct syntax errors as we type.  Chapter 9, Source Code Management with the Version Editor, focuses on the new features  of the Xcode Version Editor that has been integrated directly within the Xcode 4 IDE and  provides you with an easy way to manage your source code. By using this tool, you are able  to travel back through your revisions to compare previous changes made throughout the life  cycle of the file.  Chapter 10, Making your Applications Run Smoothly, focuses on how we can effectively use  Instruments within our applications to track down memory leaks and bottlenecks within our  applications that could potentially cause our application to crash on the user's iOS device.  We take a look into each of the different types of built-in instruments, which come as part  of the Instruments application and how we can use the Leaks instrument to help track down  and determine where memory leaks are happening within our code. We also look at how we  can configure instruments to display data differently within the trace document that is   being reported.  Chapter 11, Distributing your Application, provides you with the necessary steps that are  required to submit your applications to the App Store. It explains how to register devices for  testing and how to create and obtain provisioning profiles for development and distribution.  [  ]   What you need for this book  This book assumes that you have an Intel-based Macintosh running Snow Leopard  Mac  OS X 10.6.2 or later . You can use Leopard, but I would highly recommend upgrading to  Snow Leopard, as there are many new features in Xcode that are available only on Snow  Leopard. We will be using Xcode, an integrated development environment used for creating  applications for the iPad, iPhone, and other Mac applications. You can download the latest  version of Xcode at the following link: http:  developer.apple.com xcode .  Preface  Who this book is for If you ever wanted to learn how to build iOS applications and make your mark within the iOS  industry and have your applications compete with the rest, this book is for you. You should  have some basic programming experience with Objective-C, and a good understanding of  OOP, as well as some knowledge of database design.  Conventions  In this book, you will find several headings appearing frequently.  To give clear instructions of how to complete a procedure or task, we use:  Time for action – heading  1.  Action 1 2.  Action 2 3.  Action 3  Instructions often need some extra explanation so that they make sense, so they are  followed with:  What just happened? This heading explains the working of tasks or instructions that you have just completed.  [  ]   Preface  You will also find some other learning aids in the book, including:  Pop quiz – heading These are short multiple choice questions intended to help you test your own understanding.  Have a go hero – heading These set practical challenges and give you ideas for experimenting with what you   have learned.  You will also find a number of styles of text that distinguish between different kinds of  information. Here are some examples of these styles, and an explanation of their meaning.  Code words in text are shown as follows: " If you observe the content of the MyClass.h file,  you will notice that at the top of the file is a import statement."  A block of code is set as follows:   -  BOOL application: UIApplication * application     didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: NSDictionary * launchOptions {      Override point for customization after application launch.   [window makeKeyAndVisible];   return YES; }  When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines  or items are set in bold:  -  BOOL application: UIApplication * application     didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: NSDictionary * launchOptions {       Override point for customization after application launch.   [window addSubview:viewController.view];   [window makeKeyAndVisible];   return YES; }  Any command-line input or output is written as follows:  defaults delete com.apple.Xcode  rm –rf ~ Library Application\ Support Xcode  New terms and important words are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, in  menus or dialog boxes for example, appear in the text like this: "Click on the Next button to  proceed to the next step of the wizard."  [  ]   Preface  Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.  Tips and tricks appear like this.  Reader feedback  Feedback from our readers is always welcome.

[  ]   1  Introducing Xcode 4 Tools for   iOS Development  Welcome to the exciting world of iPhone Programming using Xcode 4. Since the  release of the original iPhone back in 2007, it has taken the world by storm and  opened up a whole new world to developers. This unique device comprises   a multi-touch interface, video and audio playback capabilities, stunning  graphics and sound, map and localization services, always-on internet and   Wi-Fi services, and a whole range of built-in sensors which can be used to  create everything from stunning games to business applications. You are probably eager to get stuck right in and start creating that next big  thing to hit the AppStore, and start to join those other tens of thousands of  developers. The goal of this chapter is to give you enough insight into Xcode  and its components, the framework layers of the iOS architecture, and some  basics of Objective-C. By the end of this book, you will have a firm grasp of Cocoa-Touch, and  understand most of the design patterns used by the Objective-C frameworks  in order to go on and build some fantastic applications. These could be along  the lines of a real estate application that shows a listing of all properties within  the surrounding suburbs using an SQLite database to store its data, and core  location services to display the property on the map, with directions on how  to get there. You could even create an educational game using flash cards and  sounds. The possibilities are endless; all it takes is an idea and you.   Introducing Xcode 4 Tools for iOS Development  In this chapter, we will:            Learn about the features and components of the Xcode development tools Learn about Xcode, Cocoa, Cocoa-Touch, and Objective-C Take a look into each of the iOS technology layers and their components Take a look into what comprises the Xcode developer set of tools Take a look at the new features in the iOS4 SDK  There is a lot of fun stuff to cover, so let's get started.  Throughout this chapter and the rest of this book, I will be making  references to iOS. Apple is calling its new Operating System "iOS 4", and it  is the next generation of the world's most innovative operating system and  works for the iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch.  Development using the Xcode tools  In order to develop for the iPhone or any other iOS device, you will need to download  and install the Xcode developer tools. You can find these development tools on the CDs  that come with your Mac. However, it is always best to download the latest version of the  developer tools from the Apple website at http:  developer.apple.com .  Before you proceed to download these tools, Apple requires you to register as an iOS  developer at http:  developer.apple.com programs register . The registration  is free and provides you with access to the iOS SDK  software development kit  and other  resources that are useful for getting started.  iPhone SDK core components The iPhone SDK includes a suite of development tools to assist you with development of  your iPhone, and other iOS device applications. We describe these in the table below:  COMPONENT Xcode  DashCode  iPhone Simulator  DESCRIPTION This is the main Integrated Development Environment  IDE  that enables  you to manage, edit, and debug your projects. This enables you to develop web-based iPhone and iPad applications, and  Dashboard widgets.  The iPhone Simulator is a Cocoa-based application that provides a  software simulator to simulate an iPhone or iPad on your Mac OS X.  [  ]   Chapter 1  COMPONENT Interface Builder  Instruments  DESCRIPTION This is the graphical visual editor for designing your user interfaces for  your iPhone and iPad applications. In previous releases of Xcode, this  was a separate standalone application. In Xcode 4, this has now been  integrated as part of the development IDE. These are the Analysis tools that help you optimize your applications and  monitor for memory leaks in real-time.  The Xcode tools require an Intel-based Mac running Mac OS X version 10.6 or later in order  to function correctly.  Inside Xcode, Cocoa, and Objective-C  Xcode 4 is a complete toolset for building Mac OS X  Cocoa-Based  and iOS applications.  The new single-windowed development interface has been redesigned to be a lot easier  and even more helpful to use than it has been in previous releases. It can now also identify  mistakes in both syntax and logical errors, and will even fix your code for you.  It provides you with the tools to enable you to speed up your development process,  therefore becoming more productive. It also automates deployment of both your   Mac OS X and iOS applications.  The Integrated Development Environment  IDE  allows you to do the following:            Create and manage projects, including specifying platforms, target requirements,  dependencies, and build configurations Supports syntax colouring and automatic indenting of code Enables you to navigate and search through the components of a project, including  header files and documentation Enables you to Build and Run your project Enables you to debug your project locally, run within the iOS simulator, or remotely,  within a graphical source-level debugger  Xcode incorporates many new features and improvements, apart from the redesigned user  interface; it features a new and improved LLVM  Low Level Virtual Machine  compiler that  has been supercharged to run three times faster and 2.5 times more efficiently.  This new compiler is the next generation compiler technology designed for   high-performance projects and completely supports C, Objective-C, and now C++.   It is also incorporated into the Xcode IDE and compiles twice as fast and quickly as   GCC and your applications will run faster.  [  ]   Introducing Xcode 4 Tools for iOS Development  The list below includes the many improvements made to this release:                The interface has been completely redesigned and features a single-window  integrated development interface. Interface Builder has now been fully integrated within the Xcode development IDE. Code Assistant opens in a second window that shows you the file that you are  working on, and can automatically find and open the corresponding header file s . Fix-it checks the syntax of your code and validates symbol names as you type. It will  even highlight any errors that it finds and will fix them for you. The new Version Editor works with GIT  Open-Source  version control software  or Subversion. This will show you the file's entire SCM  software configuration  management  history and will even compare any two versions of the file. The LLDB debugger has now been improved to be even faster and it uses less  memory than the GDB debugging engine. The new Xcode 4 development IDE now lets you work on several interdependent  projects within the same window. It automatically determines its dependencies so  that it builds the projects in the right order.  Xcode allows you to create a number of build configurations to test your iOS applications,   for debugging using the Static Analyzer, or profiling using the Instruments application.   Xcode also allows you to archive your application in order to submit to the Apple App   Store for review.  It supports several source-code management tools, namely, CVS "Version control software  which is an important component of the Source Configuration Management  SCM " and  Subversion that allows you to add files to a repository, commit changes, get updated  versions, and compare versions using the Version Editor tool.  The iPhone Simulator  The iPhone Simulator is a very useful tool that enables you to test your applications without  using your actual device, whether this is your iPhone or any other iOS device. You do not  need to launch this application manually, as this is done when you Build and Run your  application within the Xcode Integrated Development Environment  IDE . Xcode installs   your application on the iPhone Simulator for you automatically.  [ 10 ]   The iPhone Simulator also has the capability of simulating different versions of the iPhone  OS, and this can become extremely useful if your application needs to be installed on  different iOS platforms, as well as testing and debugging errors reported in your application  when run under different versions of the iOS.  Chapter 1  While the iPhone Simulator acts as a good test bed for your applications, it is  recommended to test your application on the actual device, rather than relying  on the iPhone Simulator for testing. This is because the speed of the iPhone  Simulator relies on the performance of your Mac instead of the actual device.  The iPhone Simulator can be found at the following location:  Developer  Platforms iPhoneSimulator.Platform Developer  Applications.  Layers of the iOS architecture  Apple describes the set of frameworks and technologies that are currently implemented  within the iOS operating system as a series of layers. Each of these layers is made up of a  variety of different frameworks that can be used and incorporated into your applications:  We will now go into detail and explain each of the different layers of the iOS Architecture;  this will give you a better understanding of what is covered within each of the Core layers.  The Core OS layer This is the bottom layer of the hierarchy and is responsible for the foundation of the  operating system which the other layers sit on top of. This important layer is in charge of  managing memory—allocating and releasing memory once the application has finished with  it, taking care of file system tasks, handling networking, and other operating system tasks. It  also interacts directly with the hardware.  [ 11 ]   Introducing Xcode 4 Tools for iOS Development  The Core OS layer consists of the following components:  COMPONENT NAME OS X Kernel  Mach 3.0  BSD  Berkeley Standard  Distribution  Sockets  Security  Power Management  Keychain Certificates File System  Bonjour  DESCRIPTION Based on Mach 3.0, it is responsible for every aspect of the   operating system.  A subset of the OS X Kernel responsible for running applications within  a separate process. Based on the kernel environment within the Mac OS X it is responsible  for the drivers, and low-level UNIX interfaces of the operating system.  Part of the CFNetwork Framework for providing access to BSD sockets,  HTTP and FTP protocol requests. The Security Framework provides functions for performing  cryptographic functions  encrypting decrypting data . This includes  interacting with the iPhone keychain to add, delete, and modify items. Conserves power by shutting down any hardware features that are  not currently being used. Part of the Security Framework for handling and securing data. Part of the Security Framework for handling and securing data. The System Framework gives developers access to a subset of the  typical tools they would find in an unrestricted UNIX development  environment. Part of the CFNetwork Framework for providing access to BSD   sockets, HTTP and FTP protocol requests, and Bonjour discovery   over a local-area-network.

It provides fundamental access to the iPhone OS services. The Core Services Layer  consists of the following components:  Chapter 1  COMPONENT NAME Collections  Address Book  Networking  File Access SQLite  Core Location Net Services  Threading  Preferences  URL Utilities  DESCRIPTION Part of the Core Foundation Framework which provides basic data  management and service features for iOS applications. Provides access to the user's Address Book contacts on the   iOS device. This is part of the System Configuration Framework, which  determines network availability and state on an iOS device. Provides access to lower-level operating system services. This lets you embed a lightweight SQL database into your application  without running a separate remote database server process. Used for determining the location and orientation of an iOS device. Part of the System Configuration to determine whether a Wi-Fi or  cellular connection is in use and whether a particular host server   can be accessed. Part of the Core Foundation Framework which provides basic data  management and service features for iOS applications. Part of the Core Foundation Framework which provides basic data  management and service features for iOS applications.

The Media layer is made up of the following components:  COMPONENT NAME Core Audio  OpenGL Audio Mixing  Audio Recording  Video Playback  Image Formats: JPG, PNG,  and TIFF PDF Quartz  Core Animations  OpenGL ES  DESCRIPTION Handles playback and recording of audio files and streams and also  provides access to the device's built-in audio processing units. Used for creating 2D and 3D animations Part of the Core Audio Framework, provides the possibility to mix  system announcements with background audio. For example, iOS  would announce callerID while fading in out the background media. Provides the ability to record sound on the iPhone using the  AVAudioRecorder class. Provides the ability to playback Video using the  MPMoviePlayerController class.  Provides interfaces for reading and writing most image formats  – part of the Image I O Framework. Provides a sophisticated text layout and rendering engine. Framework for image and video processing, and animation using the  Core Animation technology. Provides advanced support for animating views and other content.  This is part of the Quartz Framework. This is a subset of the OpenGL Framework for creating 2D and 3D  animations.  For more information on the iOS Media layer, please refer to the Apple  Developer Connection website at http:  developer.apple.com  library ios documentation Miscellaneous Conceptual  iPhoneOSTechOverview MediaLayer MediaLayer.html   apple_ref doc uid TP40007898-CH9-SW4  The Cocoa-Touch layer The Cocoa-Touch layer provides an abstraction layer to expose the various libraries for  programming the iPhone, and other IOS devices. You probably can understand why You probably can understand why   Cocoa-Touch is located at the top of the hierarchy due to its support for Multi-Touch  capabilities. The Cocoa-Touch layer is made up of the following components:  [ 14 ]   COMPONENT NAME Multi-Touch Events  Multi-Touch Controls  View Hierarchy  Alerts  People Picker  Controllers  Accelerometer Gyroscope  Localization Geographical  Web Views Image Picker  Chapter 1  DESCRIPTION These are the events which are used to determine when a Tap,  Swipe, Pinch, double-tap has happened. That is, TouchesMoved,  TouchesBegan, TouchesEnded. Based on the Multi-Touch model, this determines when a user  has placed one or more fingers touching the screen before  responding to the action accordingly.  Deals with the Model-View-Controller and the objects within   the view. Using the UIAlertView class, these are used to communicate to  the user when an error happens, or to request further input. Based on the AddressBook Framework, which displays the  person's contact details. Based on the Model-View-Controller for presenting standard  system interfaces and provides much of the logic needed to  manage basic application behaviors. For example, managing the  reorientation of views in response to device orientation changes.  Responds to motion and measures the degree of acceleration,  and rate of rotation around a particular axis. Adds maps and satellite images to location-based apps, similar to  the one provided by the Maps application. Provides a view to embed web content and display rich HTML. Provides a potentially multi-dimensional user-interface element  consisting of rows and components.

A good example of a Cocoa-related application is Mail or Text Edit.  This framework consists of a collection of shared object code libraries known as the Cocoa  frameworks. It consists of a runtime system and a development environment. This set of  frameworks provides you with a consistent and optimized set of pre-built code modules   that will speed up your development process.  Cocoa provides you with a rich layer of functionality, as well as a comprehensive   object-oriented like structure and APIs on which you can build your applications.   Cocoa uses the Model-View-Controller  MVC  design pattern.  What are Design Patterns? Design Patterns represent and handle specific solutions to problems that arise when  developing software within a particular context. These can be either a description or a  template, on how to solve a problem in a variety of different situations.  What is the difference between Cocoa and Cocoa-Touch? Cocoa-Touch is the programming language framework that drives user interaction on iOS. It  consists of and uses technology derived from the Cocoa framework and was redesigned to  handle multi-touch capabilities. The power of the iPhone and its user interface are available  to developers throughout the Cocoa-Touch frameworks.  Cocoa-Touch is built upon the Model-View-Controller structure; it provides a solid stable  foundation for creating mind blowing applications. Using the Interface Builder developer  tool, developers will find it both very easy and fun to use the new drag-and-drop method  when designing their next great masterpiece application on iOS.  The Model-View-Controller  We will just touch on this subject briefly as this will be covered in Chapter 5, Designing  Application Interfaces using MVC. Basically, the Model-View-Controller  MVC  comprises   of a logical way of dividing up the code that makes up the GUI  Graphical User Interface    of an application. Object-Oriented applications like Java and .Net have adopted the MVC  design pattern.  [ 16 ]   Chapter 1  The MVC model comprises of three distinctive categories:        Model: This part defines your application's underlying data engine. It is responsible  for maintaining the integrity of that data. View: This part defines the user interface for your application and has no explicit  knowledge of the origin of data displayed in that interface. It is made up of It is made up of  Windows, controls, and other elements that the user can see and interact with. Controller: This part acts as a bridge between the model and view and facilitates  updates between them. It binds the Model and View together and the application  binds the Model and View together and the application  logic decides how to handle the user's inputs.  What is Object-Oriented Programming?  Object-Oriented programming  OOP , provides an abstraction layer of the data on which you provides an abstraction layer of the data on which you  operate. It provides a concrete foundation between the data and the operations that you  perform with the data, in effect, giving the data behavior.  By using the power of Object-Oriented programming, we can create classes and later extend  its characteristics to incorporate additional functionality. Objects within a class can be  protected to prevent those elements from being exposed; this is called "Data Hiding".  What is Data Hiding? Data Hiding is an aspect of Object-Oriented Programming  OOP  that allows developers to  protect private data and hide implementation details by encapsulating this within a class.  In the following Java code example, we take a look at how we implement hiding of variables,  and only exposing those methods to extract this information:  public class Dog {    public - a violation of data hiding 'rules'   public string name;     private - not visible outside the class   Private float age;   .   .   .  [ 17 ]   Introducing Xcode 4 Tools for iOS Development  Downloading the example code You can download the example code files for all Packt books you have  purchased from your account at http:  www.PacktPub.com. If you  purchased this book elsewhere, you can visit http:  www.PacktPub. com support and register to have the files e-mailed directly to you.  In the partial Dog class snippet above, we show how we are able to expose and hide  variables within a class. In the following example below, we look at how we go about using  the Getters and Setters to store and retrieve information, without directly assigning values to  the variables:  public class Dog {   private String name;   private String gender;   private String breed;    private float weight;   private float height;   private float age;       Here are 'get' and 'set' methods for the private variable  declared above.   public void setName String name {     this.name = name;     }   public String getName   { return name;}   public void setGender  String gender {     this.gender = gender;     }   public String getGender   { return gender;}   public void setBreed  String breed {     this.breed = breed;     }   public String getBreed   { return breed;}   public void setHeight float height   {      If  height >= 0  { this.height = height;}   }    public float getHeight   { return height;}   public void setWeight float weight {     if  weight >= 0  { this.weight = weight;}   }   public float getWeight   { return weight;}   public float getAge   { return age;}   public void setAge float age {     if  age >= 0  { this.age = age;}   } }  [ 1 ]   In the above code snippet, we have declared a number of different variable data types as  well as the getters and setters to retrieve and assign values to these variables. Generally Generally  speaking, all variables declared within a class should be made private; since these types are  variables declared within a class should be made private; since these types are  not made visible outside the class. The only methods which should be made visible to a class  must be made public and therefore supplemented with the "get" and "set" methods. In the  following code snippet, we look at how we use the getters and setters to store and retrieve  the data:  Chapter 1  public class Main {      **    * @param args the command line arguments    *    public static void main String[] args  {     Dog myDog = new Dog  ;          Use the 'set' method to assign each property.     myDog.setName "Frodo" ;     myDog.setGender "Male" ;     myDog.setBreed "Pug" ;     myDog.setWeight  float 9.0 ;     myDog.setHeight  float 36.0      myDog.setAge  float 10.0 ;         Output each of the values using the Getters.      System.out.println "Name   = " + myDog.getName    ;     System.out.println "Gender = " + myDog.getGender   ;     System.out.println "Breed  = " + myDog.getBreed   ;     System.out.println "Weight = " + myDog.getWeight   ;     System.out.println "Height = " + myDog.getHeight   ;     System.out.println "Age  = " + myDog.getAge   ;   } }  In the above code snippet, we declare a new instance of our Dog class and then use   the Setters method to add values to each of our private method variables, before   finally displaying this information out to the screen via the Getters methods.  If you are interested in learning more about Object-Oriented Programming,  please consult the Apple Developer documentation or via the following  link: https:  developer.apple.com library ios  documentation Cocoa Conceptual OOP_ObjC Articles  ooOOP.html  [ 1 ]   Introducing Xcode 4 Tools for iOS Development  What is Objective-C?  When I first started to develop for the iPhone, I realised that I needed to learn Objective-C,  as this is the development language for Mac and iOS. I found it to be one of the strangest  looking languages I had ever come across. Today, I really enjoy developing and working with  it, so will you too.  Objective-C is an object-oriented programming language used by Apple primarily for  programming Mac OS X, iPhone, and other iOS applications. It is an extension of the C  Programming Language. If you have not done any OOP programming before, I would  seriously recommend that you read the OOP document from the Apple Developer website.  On the other hand, if you have used and are familiar with C++, .Net or Java, learning  Objective-C should be relatively easy for you to understand.  Objective-C consists of two types of files:  .h: These types of files are called 'Header' or 'Interface files' .m: These types of files are those which contain your program code   logic and make use of the 'Header' files. These are also referred to as  'implementation' files.  Most Object-Oriented development environments consist of the following parts:              An Object-Oriented programming language An extensive library consisting of objects A development suite of developer tools A runtime environment environment  For example, here is a piece of code written in Objective-C:  - int method: int i {   return [self square_root: i]; }  Now, let's examine the code line by line to understand what is happening.  We declare a function called method and a variable i, which is passed in as a parameter. We  then pass the value to a function called square_root to calculate   the value and the calculated result is returned.  If we were to compare this same code to how it would be written within C, it would look   like this:  int function int i  {   return square_root i ; }  [ 20 ]   Directives In C C++, we use directives to include any other header files that our application will need   to access. This is done by using include. In Objective-C, we use the import directive. If   you observe the content of the MyClass.h file, you will notice that at the top of the file   is a import statement:  Chapter 1  import   @Interface myClass : NSObject{ } @end  The import statement tatement is known as a ""pre-processor directive." As I mentioned previously, As I mentioned previously,  in C C++, you use the include pre-processor directive to include a files content with the  current source file. In Objective-C, you use the import statement to do the same, with the  exception that the compiler ensures that the file is only included once.  To import a header file from one of the framework libraries, you would specify the header  filename using the angle brackets    , within the import statement. If you wanted to  import one of your own header files to be used within your project, you would specify and  make use of the double quote marks  " " , as you can see from our code file, MyClass.m:  import "MyClass.h" @implementation MyClass @end  Objective-C classes  A Class can simply be defined as a representation of a type of object; think of it as a blueprint  that describes the object. Just as a single blueprint can be used to build multiple versions of  a car engine, a class can be used to create multiple copies of an object. In Objective-C, you  will spend most of your time dealing with classes and class objects. An example of a class  object is the NSObject class. NSObject is the root class of most of the Objective-C classes.  It defines the basic interface of a class and contains methods that are common to all classes  that inherit from it.  The @interface directive To declare a class, you use the @interface compiler directive that is declared within  MyClass.h, as follows:  @interface MyClass : NSObject { }  [ 21 ]   Introducing Xcode 4 Tools for iOS Development  The @implementation directive To implement a class declared within a header file, you use the @implementation compiler  directive, as follows:  import "MyClass.h" @implementation MyClass @end  Class instantiation In Objective-C, in order for us to create an instance of a class, you would typically use the  alloc keyword to allocate memory for the object and then return the variable in a class type.  This is shown in the following example:  MyClass *myClass = [MyClass alloc];  If you are familiar with other languages such as Java or C.Net, instantiating a class can be  done as follows:  MyClass myClass = new MyClass  ;  Class access privileges In OOP, when you are defining your classes, bear in mind that by default, the access privilege  of all fields within a class are @protected. These fields can also be defined as @public,   or @private.  The following table below shows the various access privileges that a class can contain:  ACCESS PRIVILEGE @private @public  @protected  DESCRIPTION A class member is only visible to the class that declares it. A class member is made visible to all classes that instantiate   this class. Class members are made visible to the class that declares it as well  as other classes which inherit from the base class.  We have only covered a small part of the Objective-C programming concepts.  If you are interested in reading a bit more about this area, please refer to the  following website: http:  developer.apple.com documentation  Cocoa Conceptual ObjectiveC ObjC.pdf  [ 22 ]   Chapter 1  Introducing the Xcode Developer set of tools  The Xcode developer set of tools comprise of the Xcode Integrated Development  Environment  IDE , Interface Builder, iPhone Simulator, and Instruments for Performance  Analysis. These tools have been designed to integrate and work harmoniously together.  Introducing the core tools The Xcode IDE is a complete full-featured development environment, which has been  redesigned and built around to allow for a better smoother workflow development  environment. With the integration of the GUI designer  Interface Builder , it allows a   better way to integrate the editing of source code, building, compiling, and debugging.  The Interface Builder is an easy to use GUI designer which enables you to design every  aspect of your applications UI, for Mac OS X and iOS applications.  All of your form objects are stored within one or more resource files, these files contain  the associated relationships to each of the objects. Any changes that you make to the form  design are automatically synchronized back to your code.  The iPhone Simulator provides you with a means of testing your application out, and to see  how it will appear on the actual device. The Simulator makes it a perfect choice to ensure  that your user interface works and behaves the way you intended it to and makes it easier  for you to debug your application. The iPhone Simulator does contain some limitations,  which cannot be used to test certain features, so it is always better to deploy your app to  your iOS device.  The Welcome to Xcode screen To launch Xcode, double-click on the Xcode icon located in the  Developer  Applications folder. Alternatively, you can use Spotlight to search for this: simply   type Xcode into the search box and Xcode should be displayed in the list at the top.  When Xcode is launched, you should see the Welcome to Xcode screen as shown in the  screenshot below. From this screen, you are able to create new projects, check out existing  projects from the SCM, and modify those files within the Xcode integrated development  environment. It also contains some information about learning Xcode as well as Apple  Developer resources.  [ 23 ]   Introducing Xcode 4 Tools for iOS Development  The panel to the right-hand side of the screen will display any recent projects which you have  opened. These can be opened and loaded into the IDE by clicking on them:  The Xcode Integrated Development Environment The Xcode Integrated Development Environment is what you will be using to start to code  your iPhone applications.  This consists of a single-window user interface, consisting of the Project Window, Jump and  Navigation Bars, and the newly integrated Interface Builder designer. We will talk more about  the Xcode 4 workspace environment in Chapter 2, Introducing the Xcode 4 Workspace:  [ 24 ]   Features of the iPhone Simulator The "iPhone Simulator" simulates various features of a real iOS device.  simulates various features of a real iOS device.  The screenshot below displays the iPhone 4 simulator:  Chapter 1  Below we list some of the features which you are able to test using the   iPhone Simulator:  TYPE Screen Rotation: Support for gestures:  DESCRIPTION Left, Top, and Right Tap Touch and Hold Double Tap Swipe  [ 25 ]   Introducing Xcode 4 Tools for iOS Development  TYPE  Low-Memory warning  simulations  DESCRIPTION Flick Drag Pinch Notifies all running applications  whenever the amount of free  memory falls below a safe  threshold. This can happen  when memory is allocated to  objects, but never released.  Although the iPhone simulator is just a simulator to simulate certain tasks, it does come with  the following limitations:                        Making phone calls Accessing the Accelerometer Gyroscope Sending and receiving SMS messages. Installing applications from the App Store Accessibility to the camera Use of the microphone Several core OpenGL ES features  Performance and Power Analysis tools Unit testing tools Source Code Management  SCM  Subversion Version Comparison tool  Companion tools and features  These tools are classified as profiling tools which are the instruments that handle the following:  Instruments  The Xcode instruments allow you to dynamically trace and profile the performance of your  Mac OS X, iPhone, and iPad applications. You can also create your own Instruments using reate your own Instruments using  DTrace and the Instruments custom builder.  [ 26 ]   Chapter 1  We do not cover DTrace in this book, if you are interested in reading a bit  more about this area; please consult the Apple Developer Documentation  at the following: http:  developer.apple.com library  mac documentation Darwin Reference ManPages man1  dtrace.1.html  apple_ref doc man 1 dtrace. DTrace has  not been ported to iOS, so it is not possible to create a custom instrument for  devices running iOS.  Through the use of instruments, you can achieve the following:            Ability to perform stress-tests on your applications Monitor your applications for memory leaks, which can cause   unexpected results Gain a deeper understanding of the execution behaviour of your applications Track down difficult-to-reproduce problems in your applications In the screenshot displayed below, it shows you the current list of available  instrument templates which you can choose from, to perform a variety of different  traces on your iOS applications. We will be discussing and using these in greater  detail, when we come to Chapter 10, Making your Applications run smoothly.  [ 27 ]   Introducing Xcode 4 Tools for iOS Development    In the following screenshot, we display the Instruments environment where you  can start to create your robust test harness for your application to ensure that any  memory leaks and resource-intensive tasks are rectified to avoid problems later  when your users download your app and experience issues:  If you are interested in learning more about the other applications that are  included with Xcode and the iOS 4 SDK, please consult the Apple Developer  documentation at the following: http:  developer.apple.com   iPhone OS4 SDK new features  The iOS4 SDK comes with over 1,500 APIs that contain some high quality enhancements  and improvements which allow endless possibilities for developers to create some stunning  applications. The table below provides an overview of these features:  FEATURE Multi-Tasking  DESCRIPTION This is perhaps the most awaited feature. It is an assortment of seven different  services: Audio, VoIP, location, local and push notifications, task completions,  and fast app switching that will make it possible and simple enough to use  many applications at the same time. This will allow you to play the audio  continuously, receive calls while your device is locked or other apps are being  used. Location-based applications will continue to guide you, and receiving  alerts will be possible without the app running and the app will finish even  when the customer leaves in the middle of it.  [ 2 ]   Chapter 1  FEATURE Apps Folder  Game Center  iAd  DESCRIPTION Another important feature in iOS4 is the Apps Folder. This feature allows you  to drag an icon on top of another one and a new folder will be automatically  created. It will be named according to the name of the category the particular  icon or application comes from. Game Center provides social networking services, where you can take part in  leader boards and participate in other online activities with other players. iAd is a mobile advertising platform to allow developers to incorporate  advertisements into their application. It is currently supported on iPhone, iPod  Touch, and iPad.  The list above contains some of the important new features of iOS 4. If you are  interested in a more detailed listing of all of the features in each of the releases;  check out the following: http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki iPhone_ OS_Version_History.  Summary  In this chapter, hopefully you have gained a good understanding of Xcode and the  development tools and the new and improved single-windowed development IDE.   We have also covered some of the basics relating to Object-Oriented Programming and  Objective-C. It will soon become apparent why Objective-C was chosen as the language   of choice for developing Mac OS X and iOS applications.  Now that we've learned about what comprises the Xcode developer tools, we   are now ready to get stuck into and learn about the new Xcode 4 workspace and  development environment.  In the next chapter, we will dive right in and take a closer look at the Xcode 4 workspace  environment as well as using some of the tools we have explained in this chapter. We will  also start to develop a simple application using Xcode and Interface Builder.  [ 2 ]    2  Introducing the Xcode 4 Workspace  In the previous chapter, we covered the Xcode development tools. We also took  a look into Xcode, the Cocoa Framework, and Cocoa-Touch layers and delved  into a crash-course on the features of Objective-C. Finally, we looked into the  new features of iOS 4. In this chapter, we will learn how to download and install the Xcode developer  tools and Software Development Kit  SDK . We will familiarise ourselves with  the newly re-designed development environment, and introduce you to the  Xcode 4 workspace and preferences as well as working with the new Xcode  Assistant and Code Assistants. We will finally create a simple iPhone application, that will incorporate the use  of Views and View Controllers.  In this chapter, we will:              Development Tools.

Introduce you to the Xcode 4 Workspace and the Unified Navigator UI Learn about the Xcode Workspace Preferences Preferences Create a simple "Hello World" iPhone application using Views and using Views and  Views and   View Controllers Learn how to reset the Xcode development environment  We have got quite a bit to cover, so let's get started.   Introducing the Xcode 4 Workspace  Downloading and installing the iOS SDK  Before we can start to build our iOS applications, you must first sign up as a registered iOS  Developer at http:  developer.apple.com programs ios . The registration process  is free and provides you with access to the iOS SDK  Software Development Kit  and other  developer resources that are really useful for getting you started.  Once you have signed up, you can then download the iPhone SDK as shown in the  screenshot below. It is worthwhile making sure that your machine satisfies the following  system requirements prior to your downloading the iPhone SDK:      Only Intel Macs are supported, so if you have another processor type  such as the have another processor type  such as the  another processor type  such as the  older G4 or G5 Macs , you're out of luck. You have updated your system with the latest Mac OS X release  If you want to develop applications for the iPad and iPod Touch, this uses the  same operating system  OS  as the iPhone, so you can still use the iPhone SDK.  This SDK allows you to create universal applications that will work with both the  iPhone and iPad running on iOS 4.2 and above.  [ 32 ]   Once you have downloaded the SDK, you can proceed with installing it. You will be required  to accept a few licensing agreements. You will then be presented with a screen to specify the  destination folder in which to install the SDK:  Chapter 2  If you select the default settings during the installation phase, the various tools will be  installed in the  Xcode4 Applications folder.  The installation process takes you through the custom installation option screens. You  probably would have seen similar screens to this if you have installed other Mac software.  The screenshot below shows what you will see here:  [ 33 ]   Introducing the Xcode 4 Workspace  These options give you a little more control over the installation process. For example, you  are able to specify the folder location to install Xcode as well as   setting a variety of other options.  By default, Xcode 4 will be installed on the root directory of your Hard Drive in  the following folder location:  Xcode4 Applications.  The iOS4 SDK comes as part of the "xcode_4.0.1_and_ios_sdk_4.3.dmg" download which  we installed in the previous section. You are also able to download this separately from the  download page. The SDK consists of the following components which are mentioned in the  list below and provides a reference to the relevant area to find out more information:            Xcode: Please refer to Chapter 1, iPhone SDK Core Components for more information  on this component. DashCode: Please refer to Chapter 1, iPhone SDK Core Components for more  information on this component iPhone Simulator: Please refer to Chapter 1, iPhone SDK Core Components for more  information on this component Interface Builder: Please refer to Chapter 1, iPhone SDK Core Components for more  information on this component Instruments: Please refer to Chapter 1, iPhone SDK Core Components for more  information on this component  The following image displays a list of the various tools that are installed as part   of the default settings during the installation phase. These are installed in the    Xcode4 Applications folder:  [ 34 ]   Chapter 2  Removing the Xcode Developer Tools Should you ever wish to uninstall Xcode  in the event that something went disastrously  wrong  it is a very straightforward process. Open the terminal window and run the   uninstall-devtools script:  sudo   Library uninstall-devtools --mode=all    is the directory where the tools are installed. For typical installations, the full path  is  Xcode4 Library uninstall-devtools  Before you proceed to do this, make sure that this is what you really intend to do  as once it's gone, it's permanently deleted. In any event, you can always choose  to reinstall the Xcode developer tools. It is also worth checking that the  Xcode4  Library  folder has also been removed. If not, just move it to the Trash.  Getting to know the Xcode Development Environment  I am hoping that up to this point, you would have successfully downloaded and installed  the Xcode 4 developer tools and iOS SDK. From this point on, we will start to familiarise  ourselves with the newly redesigned Xcode 4 development workspace and what is involved  in migrating older projects, as well as creating a new project from scratch.  One environment to bind them all The first thing that you will notice when you fire up the Xcode 4 IDE is that the interface has  gone through some significant changes that provide better workflow to enable developers  to be more productive. The new interface features a LCD-like display, similar to that found in  iTunes. This is called the Activity Window and is used for displaying warnings and compiler  error messages during the build process of a project.  [ 35 ]   Introducing the Xcode 4 Workspace Working within a single-development environment The main area of Xcode  called the workspace  is dedicated to the document that is  currently being viewed, whether it is code, a data model, or the project's graphical interface.  This area can also be arranged to view multiple documents, to allow a comparison of their  differences  such as comparing two versions of the same code file . The content area also   has support for viewing of PDFs and other file types supported by the extendable Quick   Look feature:  One other new thing that you will notice is that, above the content area is what is called the  'Jump Bar' that presents a hierarchical "breadcrumb-like" listing, which was introduced in  iTunes and Finder; with its only difference being that it is fully interactive; users can click on  any path along the bar and select a popup that allows them to navigate at that level via a  dynamic popup window that is displayed.  It also contains a Project Navigator control. This contains icon tabs that present a variety  of different types of development-related information and are contained within the same  window, and these are as follows:      Provides a means of listing all of your projects and files, that are contained within means of listing all of your projects and files, that are contained within  of listing all of your projects and files, that are contained within  your workspace A Project Symbol listing which lists all classes and methods used by listing which lists all classes and methods used by  which lists all classes and methods used by   your project  [ 36 ]   Chapter 2            A new and improved search feature, which can perform project-wide searching Issues listing containing all of the build errors that your project contains Helpful debugging information information An area, that shows you all breakpoints, which are flagged in your project breakpoints, which are flagged in your project , which are flagged in your project Contains a section, which lists all of the Build logs  Creating a new project To create a new project in Xcode 4, launch the Xcode 4 development IDE and then click on  Create a new Xcode project in the Welcome to Xcode startup screen. This is shown in the  screenshot below. If you already have Xcode 4 opened, choose File  New  New Project:  Migrating older projects into the new environment Xcode 4 provides you with a number of quick and easy ways to migrate your older Xcode  projects into the new development environment. You can choose to right-click on your  project and select to open the project in Xcode 4, or you can similarly drag your project   onto the Xcode 4 icon.  [ 37 ]   Introducing the Xcode 4 Workspace  You can also use the File  Open command within the Xcode 4 IDE. Xcode 4 can read and  build projects built in Xcode 3.2 through to 3.2.6. Opening your project s  in Xcode 4 does  not upgrade or alter it in any way and any changes that you make to the project will remain  compatible with earlier versions of Xcode.  Writing a simple iPhone application This is where the real fun starts, and I know that you are eager to get stuck in and start  creating a simple iPhone application. We will be creating a simple Hello to Xcode 4  application making use of View Controllers. We won't be using Xcode's Interface builder   in this chapter, as it will be covered in Chapter 3, Working with the Interface Builder.   So let's get started.  Time for action – creating your first iPhone application In this section, we will look at building a simple iPhone application to display a welcome  message to our View.  Before we can proceed with creating our "HelloXcode4" application, we must first launch  the Xcode development environment. If you haven't already got this open, it can be located  within the  Xcode4 Applications folder, or you can use the spotlight feature to help you  search for this. What we now need to do is to create our project by following these simple  steps below:  1.  Click on the Create a new Xcode project. This will bring up the project template   dialog as shown in the screenshot below.  2.	 Select the Window-based application. What this template is going to give   you is a Window and an application delegate. An application delegate   UIApplicationDelegate  is an object that responds to messages from a  UIApplication object. It is worth mentioning here that there can only be one  UIApplication object, and the project template takes care of creating this for us 3.	 Click on the Next button and you will be prompted to enter a name for your project. 4.	 Enter HelloXcode4 for the Product Name. Don't worry about the Company Identifier  as this will be populated for you by default. This is used for submission of your App  to the AppStore.  5.	 Click on the Next button to proceed to the next step of the wizard. 6.	 You will then be asked to choose a location where you would like to save your   project. This can be any location that you desire.  [ 3 ]   Chapter 2  7.	 You will also notice that there is an option to automatically save your project to   Source Control, which will create a local repository on disk so you can check-in your  work. This option is not checked by default. It is advisable to have this checked, if  you are working in a team environment where you have multiple people working   on the same project.  Xcode 4 provides support for both Git and SVN for Version Control. We will cover this   in greater detail when we come to Chapter 9, Source Code Management with the   Version Editor.  Once your project has been created, you will be presented with the Xcode interface. All  files that the project template created for you will be displayed within the Project Navigator  window section:  The important files to take note of are the following: main.m, HelloXcode4AppDelegate. h, and HelloXcode4AppDelegate.m.  [ 3 ]   Introducing the Xcode 4 Workspace  The main function is where the single UIApplication object is created and the function  called UIApplicationMain   takes care of that. You may be asking yourself, how does the  HelloXcode4AppDelegate get hooked up to the UIApplication object? Remember  when we created our project earlier on, the creation process created an Interface Builder   .xib  file for us called MainWindow.xib; this is the file that takes care of forming this  relationship for us.  Now, we will check out the implementation of the delegate, HelloXcode4Delegate.m.   There are several messages that we can get from the UIApplication object.  However, the template has already created the one which we care about: — applicationDidFinishLaunchingWithOptions:  -  BOOL application: UIApplication * application     didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: NSDictionary * launchOptions {      Override point for customization after application launch.   [window makeKeyAndVisible];   return YES; }  This function is where we will be creating our view controller, which will eventually hold our  label object for our text output. In order to create a view controller, we first need to add  another class to our project that subclasses UIViewController:  1.  Select the Classes folder, located within your project and then choose    File  New  New File..., or Command + N:  [ 40 ]   2.  Next, select the Cocoa Touch Class in the left column under iOS and select the   UIViewController subclass template from the list of available templates.  3.  Click on the Next button to proceed to the next step of the wizard. 4.  Enter HelloXcode4ViewController as the name of the file to create, and then click   on the Save button.  Chapter 2  You will notice when you look at the new implementation file  HelloXcode4ViewController.m that it contains some commented   out functions as shown in the following code snippet:  @implementation HelloXcode4ViewController   *     The designated initializer.  Override if you create the     controller programmatically and want to perform customization that     is not appropriate for viewDidLoad. -  id initWithNibName: NSString * nibNameOrNil bundle: NSBundle     * nibBundleOrNil {   if   self = [super initWithNibName:nibNameOrNil       bundle:nibBundleOrNil]   {        Custom initialization   }   return self; } *    *    Implement viewDidLoad to do additional setup after loading the     view, typically from a nib. -  void viewDidLoad {   [super viewDidLoad]; } *    *    Override to allow orientations other than the default portrait     orientation. -  BOOL shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation: UIInterfaceOrientation  interfaceOrientation {      Return YES for supported orientations   return  interfaceOrientation == UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait ; } *   [ 41 ]   Introducing the Xcode 4 Workspace  View controllers are meant to be used by overriding the base implementation of various  methods. In our case, we want to override the populate a view controller:   In our case, we want to override the loadView method, which is used to manually      Implement loadView to create a view hierarchy programmatically,    without using a nib file. -  void  loadView  We don't need to add controls directly to the view controller as these are added to a  UIView, that is a property of the view controller. We have not allocated the view yet, so we  are going to start to do this here.  First, we need to create a UIView object that is the size of our display and link this up to the  view controllers view property:       Create a frame that sets the bounds of the view   CGRect frame = CGRectMake 0, 0, 960, 640 ;         Allocate our view   self.view = [[UIView alloc] initWithFrame:frame];         Set the view's background color   self.view.backgroundColor=[UIColor greenColor];  View Controllers have a view property that needs to be set to our new UIView object. Next,  we will be creating a label to store our text output:          set the position of our text label   frame = CGRectMake 10, 170, 350, 50 ;         allocate memory for our label   UILabel *label = [[UILabel alloc] initWithFrame:frame];         Assign some text to our label control   label.text = @"iPhone Programming using Xcode 4";   label.textColor = [UIColor redColor];         now, add the label to the view   [self.view addSubview:label];         it is a good idea to release the memory allocated by our label   [label release]; }  [ 42 ]   Chapter 2  Now that we have created our view controller, which contains a label that will display the  words iPhone Programming using Xcode 4, we need to create an instance of our view  controller and add it to our application. If you recall when we were discussing the function  applicationDidFinishLaunching, this is where we will be adding our view controller.  Before we can do this, we first need to add a import statement at the top of our  HelloXcode4AppDelegate.m implementation file, in order for the compiler to find   the declaration of this object. This is shown below:  import "HelloXcode4AppDelegate.h" import "HelloXcode4ViewController.h"  Now that you have done this, we are ready to start creating our View Controller code within  this file  HelloXcode4AppDelegate.m :  -  BOOL application: UIApplication * application     didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: NSDictionary * launchOptions {          allocate the memory for our view controller   self.viewController = [HelloXcode4ViewController alloc];         now, we need to add our view controller to the window   [window addSubview:self.viewController.view];         Override point for customization after application launch.   [window makeKeyAndVisible];   return YES; }  Just as we have done in the similar examples above, we needed to allocate a new  HelloXcode4ViewController and then add that to our window. We could just   create our view controller locally, but this is not a good idea as it can cause memory leaks.  A much better approach is to create a reference, which can be released once we have  finished using it. I have created a property called ViewController, which will be used   to store our view controller.  [ 43 ]   Introducing the Xcode 4 Workspace  This has been defined within the HelloXcode4AppDelegate.h file and is shown in the  following code snippet:  import    @class HelloXcode4ViewController;  @interface HelloXcode4AppDelegate : NSObject   {   UIWindow *window;      HelloXcode4ViewController *viewController; }  @property  nonatomic, retain  IBOutlet UIWindow *window; @property  nonatomic, retain  HelloXcode4ViewController  *viewController;  @end  We now need to tell the compiler to actually create the getter and setter functions  for our new property. We need to do this back in our HelloXcode4AppDelegate.m  implementation file by adding the @synthesize property. This is shown below:  @synthesize window; @synthesize viewController;  You will see that one already exists for our window object, so just place this underneath.  Finally we need to release our reference to our view controller property when the dealloc  method is called. You should notice that a dealloc function already exists within the  HelloXcode4AppDelegate.m file; we just need to modify it to include removal of   our view controller object:  -  void dealloc {   [viewController release];   [window release];   [super dealloc]; }  So there you have it, we have added our view controller to our view and have released the  memory when the device is stopped. You are now ready to Build and Run your application.  You can do this in one of two ways, either click on the play button within the Xcode 4 IDE,   or click on Product  Run "HelloXcode4":  [ 44 ]   Chapter 2  When you run the application, you should see an image similar to the screenshot below:  [ 45 ]   Introducing the Xcode 4 Workspace  What just happened We first created a CGRect object, which sets the bounds for our view. We then positioned  our view to start from top  0, 0  and set it to the size of the iPhone display of  960, 640   as well as setting our view background to green.  Next, we needed to specify where we would like to position our label text. In order to do  this, we needed to create another CGRect object and then allocate memory for our label  object and then add the label to our view controller.  Finally, we released the memory used by our label object  this is good programming practice  and will prevent your application from having memory leaks .  In the HelloXcode4AppDelegate.h file, you will notice that we have declared an   @class declaration at the top of the interface  HelloXcode4AppDelegate.h  file. This  HelloXcode4ViewController class is a forward declaration and it tells the compiler that  a class name with this exists within our project. Without this declaration, the compiler would  report an error at the first reference to HelloXcode4ViewController. In the @interface  section of this file, we declare a member variable to hold our view controller. We then use  the @property method to wrap our member variable with implicit getters and setters.  Working with the new Xcode Assistant A new improved feature, included within Xcode 4, is the Xcode Assistant. This assistant  comes with two modes of tracking: Automatic and Manual mode. Automatic tracking  mode comes with several criteria, which you can choose from. These are: Counterparts,  Superclasses, Subclasses, or Siblings. The Assistant selects the file s that best meet the  selected criteria and opens those files in the Assistant Pane within the source editor. In  Manual Mode, you select the file to display in the Assistant Pane. You can also use the  Version Editor to compare any two versions of the file. To enable the Assistant, click   on the Assistant button in the workspace editor:  [ 46 ]   Chapter 2  When this button is selected, the Assistant opens a second editor pane in the main editor  area of the workspace window. For source files, the assistant displays the counterpart of  the file, which is displayed in the standard editor pane. For instance, if you have opened  an implementation file, the assistant will display the corresponding header interface file  and vice-versa. You also have the ability to choose from several other display criteria to be  used by the assistant. To do this, click on the Counterparts item in the navigation bar for the  assistant editor pane. This is shown in the following screenshot, and the choices, which are  offered to you, are dependent on the type of file that you are viewing:  Selecting a file in the project navigator will cause that file to be shown in the normal editor  pane and automatically track and show the associated file counterpart in the other pane.  If the assistant is set to use Manual mode, it will allow you to open any file in the assistant  editor pane, including the same file as the one you're working on in the other editor pane. If  you hold down the Option key and click or just hold down the Option key when selecting the  file in the project manager, it will display the chosen file in the Assistant pane, rather than  the standard pane and therefore switches the Assistant into manual mode.  [ 47 ]   Introducing the Xcode 4 Workspace  The Assistant editor pane can be displayed to the right of the standard editor or below it. If  you wanted to do this, you would Choose View  Editor  Change Split Orientation to switch  between a vertical and horizontal split for the two editor panes:  Introducing the Xcode 4 Workspace Environment  Xcode 4 uses one type of main window, called the workspace window, to hold most of the  data you need. You can have as many workspace windows open as you need. A second  window, called the Organizer window, is used for organizing your projects and reading  documentation. For iOS projects, the Organizer window is also used for managing devices.  Application ToolBar The Xcode toolbar provides you with quick access shortcuts to various common functions,  that are used within the IDE environment. Some examples are code folding, version editor,  and code assistants.  [ 4 ]   The following screenshot shows you the Xcode application toolbar which contains the types  of options that you have made available to you within the editor for Code Folding, Syntax  Coloring, and any issues your project contains:  Chapter 2  One other neat feature that has been integrated into Xcode 4 is the ability to open other files  outside your project. This is done by right-clicking and selecting the project name located  above the Activity window as shown in the following screenshot:  Application Status Bar Activity Window This provides you with system messages about the progress of a range of activities including  compiler and syntax errors and information relating to project builds. In previous versions of  Xcode, this was known as the status bar:  WorkSpace Settings If you have used previous versions of Xcode, you will notice that the many windows used to  perform the development tasks you work with on a daily basis, have now been combined  into a single window. The work area has had several unique UI elements applied that make it  much easier to work on many different tasks, even multiple projects, and best of all without  cluttering your work area.  [ 4 ]   Introducing the Xcode 4 Workspace  Introducing the Unified Navigation UI  The newly introduced Navigation UI contains a list of useful navigators that provide you  with an easy way to filter your project. This is located on the left-hand side within the Xcode  workspace and includes a List of files in your project, Sorted Symbols, a Central Search  Interface, Issues Tracking, Debugging data with Compressionable Stack traces, Active and  Inactive Breakpoints, and a persistent Collection of logs.  The Unified Navigator provides live filtering of content and search results so that you can  spend more time focusing on your current task:  Listing files in a project The Project Navigator shows you a list of all of your projects, folders, and files that are  included within your project workspace:  [ 50 ]   The Project navigator also contains badges, which are for SCM and pertain to subversion and  code repositories. We will be discussing these in Chapter 9, Source Code Management with  the Version Editor.  Chapter 2  Status M U A D I R * ?  Description Specifies that the file s  have been modified locally. Specifies that the file s  have been updated in the repository. Specifies that the file s  have been added locally. Specifies that the file s  have been deleted locally. Specifies that the file s  have been ignored. Specifies that the file  s  have been replaced within the repository. Specifies that the folder contents contain mixed statuses. Not yet added to the source control repository.  It is worth mentioning that these badges propagate up to the highest  container, so that you can see the source control status of the whole  workspace, regardless of the level disclosed. These are discussed in greater  detail in Chapter 9, Source Code Management with the Version Editor.  Sorted Symbols The Symbol Navigator allows you to browse through the symbols within your project.   It is a good idea to wait until Xcode has finished indexing your project before you use   this feature:  [ 51 ]   Introducing the Xcode 4 Workspace  To specify exactly what you would like to have listed within this view, use the Search text   box which is located at the bottom of the navigator as well as the scope buttons located   at the top:  An explanation of each of these scope buttons is given below:  SCOPE BUTTON All  System  Members Flat  DESCRIPTION When this button is selected, the symbol navigator displays all types of symbols.  Alternatively, when this is not selected, it displays all the classes and protocols. When this option is selected, the navigator displays all the symbols that are  contained within the system frameworks as well as those that are contained  within your project. To see only the symbols in your project, deselect this button. When this option is selected, the navigator displays the members of classes. When this option is selected, the navigator displays all of the classes arranged  alphabetically. When this option is deselected, the navigator displays the class  hierarchy.  Central Search Interface The Central Search Interface allows you to search for a specific term throughout your entire  project, or projects that are contained within the Xcode workspace. The results found will be  displayed within this pane:  [ 52 ]   Searches can be customized by clicking on the magnifying glass within the search field and  choosing Show Find Options to display the Find Options dialog as shown below. You will also  notice that the Find Options dialog allows you to search on Regular Expressions as well:  Chapter 2  You are also able to filter the results returned to display what you would like to have listed in  this view at any given time. You can do this by using the Search text box, which is located at  the bottom of the navigator. An explanation of each of these symbols is given below:  TYPE =  C  V  DESCRIPTION When this is displayed, these contain any comment fields, which contain the matching  search term. When these types are displayed, they denote the classes used by the system  frameworks. In our HelloXcode4 example project above, our variable is making use of  the system framework UIViewController class. When these types are displayed, these relate to any variables, which contain  the search term. In our HelloXcode4 example project, we have declared  a pointer variable *viewcontroller which has been declared of type  HelloXcode4ViewController that inherits the UIViewController class.   Issues Tracking During the building process of your application, the compiler analyzes your program code  for potential problems. If the compiler finds any problems while building your code, the  issues navigator is displayed. Selecting any of the errors or warnings in the list will display the  line at which the problem occurred in the source editor. The issues navigator allows you to  display problems by file or by type.  Using Static Analysis to find potential problems Another neat new feature, which has been integrated into the Xcode 4 IDE, is the Static  Analyzer. This new addition allows you to examine the syntax of your code for bugs prior to  building. The analyzer displays the program logic-flow of your application, which can help  you track down potential bugs found within your application. Don't worry too much about  this, as we will be covering this in greater detail when we come to Chapter 8, Debugging  Xcode Projects.  [ 53 ]   Introducing the Xcode 4 Workspace  Debugging data with Compressionable Stack Traces Whenever you pause execution of your program code, or run your code up to the point  where your breakpoint exists, Xcode will open up the debug navigator and display the  threads that were running when the execution was paused. Under each of these threads  listed, is the thread stack at the point up to which your program executed. If you select a  stack frame, you will see the corresponding source file or disassembled object code, that   will be displayed within the source editor window.  There is also a feature to allow you to display how much stack information you would like  the threads and stacks navigator to display and this can be done by using the slider which is  located at the bottom of the debug navigator window. We will be discussing this in greater  detail when we come to Chapter 8, Debugging Xcode Projects.  Active inactive breakpoints Setting breakpoints within your code can be useful when you want to stop at known points  within your code where you might know the problem exists, or you may just want to check  the values of variables within your source code.  In any event, these can be very useful. To set breakpoints within your code, you need to have  a source code file open and then click in the gutter area next to the spot where you would  like to stop execution. When you add a breakpoint within your code, Xcode automatically  enables breakpoints, as indicated by the breakpoint state button in the toolbar:  You can toggle between enabled and disabled states of breakpoints by clicking on the  breakpoint-state button. You can also disable an individual breakpoint by clicking on its icon.  To remove a breakpoint completely, drag it out of the gutter area. We will be discussing this  in greater detail when we come to Chapter 8, Debugging Xcode Projects.  [ 54 ]   Chapter 2  Collection of Logs The log navigator in Xcode 4 replaces what was known as the build log window within Xcode  3. When you select one of the builds in the build log, the results are displayed within the  editor area. To proceed to see the error or warning listed within the build, double-click on it  to have it opened within the source editor pane. This view can also display a more verbose  listing of the error or warning, by clicking on the list icon at the end of the command line.   We will be discussing this in greater detail when we come to Chapter 8, Debugging   Xcode Projects.  Jump Bar This is a new addition to Xcode 4, which I absolutely love. This neat feature, that looks like  more of a "BreadCrumb" Bar, provides you with a quick way of navigating from one folder to  another from within the Xcode IDE. It is displayed at the top of every editor pane and shows  the relative location of your current file. If you click on any location, it will jump to any other  folder at the same level:  Using Code Assistants A new feature that has been introduced within Xcode 4 is the use of Code Assistants. This  includes a new Fixit feature that provides advanced code completion and flags common  bugs or typos. The Fix-it feature can suggest appropriate symbol spellings and supply correct  punctuation, assisting developers to write code faster, making fewer mistakes. Through  the use of Static analysis you can find and flag common bugs and errors such as a failure to  properly release memory that is no longer needed. We will be covering this in greater detail  when we come to Chapter 8, Debugging Xcode Projects.  Introducing the new and improved LLVM Compiler 2.0 This technology is an open source compiler technology, which is currently being led by  Apple's compiler team to be used in several high-end performance projects around the  globe. The LLVM 2.0 compiler has also been substantially updated and now compiles twice  as fast as the GCC compiler, producing applications which run faster. It has been rewritten   as a set of optimized code libraries, which have been designed around today's modern   chip architectures.  It has been fully integrated into the Xcode 4 development IDE and provides complete  support for the following languages: C, Objective-C, and C++.  [ 55 ]   Introducing the Xcode 4 Workspace  Version Editor This new improved version makes your life a lot easier, compared to previous versions of  Xcode. This is now part of the Xcode 4 IDE, and makes it easy for you to see any two versions  of your source code side-by-side which you want to compare, in real time, all within your  Xcode 4 development workspace. You are also able to view this comparison view much like  Apple's Time Machine. With its timeline look and feel, you are able to drag the slider in the  middle that allows you to travel back in time through your project, allowing you to compare  any two versions of your file.  This slick editor interface can also show you a detailed log of post events and track blame  for post check-ins. It is even possible to manage multiple projects within a single Xcode 4  workspace. We will be covering this in greater detail when we come to Chapter 9, Source  Code Management with the Version Editor.  File Templates Library The File Templates library ranges from a variety of templates for applications to subclasses of  commonly used Cocoa classes. To use a template, using your mouse, drag it from the library  to the folder in the Project navigator where you want to keep it.  File Templates have sub-categories, from which you can choose from the popup menu below  the line of buttons. You can also display the templates as icons, or icons with their associated  text as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 56 ]   When you click on a template, an information window will open to the left and  contain a description about how to go about using the template. Refer to the  screenshot below, which explains this.  Chapter 2  Code Snippets Library The Code Snippets library contains fragments of reusable code that you can use within your  applications. In order to use one of these predefined code snippets, you need to select it  with your mouse and drag it into the code editor to the source code file you want to apply  this to:  [ 57 ]   Introducing the Xcode 4 Workspace  You also have the ability to create your own reusable code snippets to be used within the  other interesting projects that you create. To do this, first highlight the piece of code within  your source code and drag it into the code snippet library window panel.  A popup window will be displayed alongside your code snippet. Provide your code snippet  with a meaningful name as well as a completion shortcut  optional . Using a completion  shortcut, allows you to add it to your source code without having to grab it from the Code  snippet library. You just type in the name and your code will appear:  If you are adding any new code snippets or editing code snippets that are added  to the Code Snippet Library, these snippets will be flagged with the word "User"  to differentiate between what are user-defined and System code snippets.  Object Library The Object Library contains various objects, that are organized with subcategories and  provide information in popup windows as we have seen with File Templates and Code  Templates. These objects are for use with Interface Builder  We will be talking more about  Interface Builder in the next chapter . The Screenshot below shows a sample list of the  different types of objects that the Object Library contains:  [ 5 ]   Chapter 2  Media Library The Media Library includes graphics and icons that are located within the Resources   folder of your project or workspace. There is a Search field located at the bottom of the  libraries pane, which you can use to filter the library items that are displayed from within   the selected library:  [ 5 ]   Introducing the Xcode 4 Workspace  Resetting Xcode's Development Environment Settings In the event that something goes horribly wrong by which you have made some changes  to your Xcode development environment settings and have caused your IDE to become  unstable, don't panic! There is a very easy way to reset your environment settings back to  their default settings. To do this, we first need to open up the Terminal utility application  using Shift  Command  U. At the command prompt, type in the following commands:  defaults delete com.apple.Xcode  rm –rf ~ Library Application\ Support Xcode  These commands will delete the plist file for Xcode and put everything back to their  default settings. Before you do this, take note of the following:  This will remove all of your Xcode preferences, which includes: layout choices,  file history, and toolbar settings.  Xcode Workspace Preferences  Xcode gives you the ability to change and customize the default installation settings to be  more to your liking. We will be focusing on what each of these buttons comprise of in the  sections below:  [ 60 ]   General This button allows you to control general environment settings such as your auto-save and  navigation preferences:  Chapter 2              Auto-save: Xcode has the ability to automatically auto-save files that you have  changed before building, quitting Xcode, committing files to a repository, or closing  a workspace window. Issues: Xcode can display runtime warnings and errors in place in the editors, and  also in the issue navigator. You can select one or both of these options. Select the  Continue building after errors checkbox if you want Xcode to continue building a  target when an error occurs. Dialog Warnings: Xcode has several warning dialogs that you can disable by clicking  a Do not show this message again checkbox in the dialog. To re-enable all of these  warning dialogs, click on the Reset "Don't Ask Me" Warnings button. Activation: To shift the focus to a new tab or window when it opens, select the  When a tab or window opens, make it active checkbox. Navigation: You can use this to configure what happens when you navigate to and  select a file in the project navigator or jump bar.  Optional navigation: You can use the navigation chooser to set how you would like  the Xcode development environment to look. You can specify what you want to  do when you open a file. You can specify to have it open in any editor pane in any  window and tab, or to open the file in a new editor pane, window, or tab.  Behaviors The Behaviors preference pane allows you to specify actions that occur when certain  operations are initiated or completed. You use this to tailor your workflow, for example,  to always show the latest Build Log when you start a build. Triggers include starting and  stopping building, testing, launching, searching, or restoring a device. Actions include   playing sounds, bouncing the dock icon, or executing a script.  Another example where this is useful is when you want Xcode to display the debug area  when your code pauses at a breakpoint or you can choose to display the Issues Navigator  when the build fails. You can even specify Xcode to go to a specific tab within your  workspace, all handled right within the Alerts pane.  Fonts & Colors These preferences determine how you would like to configure the Xcode Integrated  Development Environment editor setup to suit your needs. From here, you are able   to choose from a variety of color schemes or customize one to your liking.  [ 61 ]   Introducing the Xcode 4 Workspace  Text Editing These preferences allow you to configure the Xcode Integrated Development Environment  editor setup to suit your needs. You can specify to turn on off line numbering, code folding,  code completion, as well as many other options relating to indentation of your code.  Key Bindings Key binding refers to the shortcuts that you use to access operations within the Xcode  development IDE. These generally follow the norms for Mac OS X software, but the key  bindings specified within this section are specific to Xcode.  Documentation This preference panel lets you define how to manage the Apple Developer documentation.  You may recall that this was an option during the installation of Xcode. Selecting the  checkbox ensures that you keep the documentation up-to-date; similarly you can use the  button to do this on demand. By default, you will have access to the Mac OS X Snow Leopard  core library and the Xcode 4 iOS developer libraries. You can also specify and choose from a  range of other libraries.  Locations When you build your project within Xcode 4, the progress is shown in the Activity View  located on the toolbar. The build steps are recorded within the Build log of the log navigator.  This keeps a catalog of the build logs so you can see results from previous builds if required.  You can specify the location of where you would like to store these project-generated files project-generated files   as necessary to suit your workflow. By default, Xcode stores project-generated files in  standard folders inside ~ Library Developer Xcode. The following form options The following form options   are explained below:    Derived Data  index, logs, build  location: Xcode 4 provides a new way for indexing files by creating an index for the entire  workspace. This resolves any issues that occurred in previous versions when  referencing across projects. The indexer uses the new LLVM compiler 2.0 to   parse its source files and this improves performance dramatically.  [ 62 ]   Chapter 2        Snapshots Location: The Snapshots feature has been modified to be much faster and more reliable than  it has been in previous versions of Xcode. In order to be able to use Snapshots, you  need to ensure that you install the System Tools as part of your Xcode 4 installation. Archives Location: This location specifies where you would like to create distribution builds of your  product. These could be used to provide development milestones, or posting nightly  builds of your product, or for distributing the final release of your product. Build Location: Xcode 4 allocates a common directory for each project or workspace with each  project being placed within a separate folder under its project name. If the same  project is located within two separate workspaces, the same project is created in  two different locations so that its precompiled headers, indexes, and build products  do not conflict with one another. If you don't want to accept the default folder  location, you can change this to something more appropriate.  Source Trees This preference is aimed at software development teams for which a particular source file s  is required to be located in a different location other than the project folder. An example   of this might be where you want to share a custom class among other developers or team   of developers.  Distributed Builds The Distributed Builds preferences pane is used to set up workgroup builds and to make your  computer available on the local area network to teammates for their workgroup builds. By  using this set up, you can reduce your build times by adding the processing power of your  teammates' computers to your own by converting your local builds to workgroup builds.  Workgroup builds are network-based builds that can use more than one computer to build  a product. Workgroup builds involve a build client and one or more build servers. The build  client is the computer that initiates the build and uses a set of build servers to complete  it. Build servers are computers that have been made available to assist build clients in  completing their builds. One computer can be both a client and a server.  [ 63 ]   Introducing the Xcode 4 Workspace  Summary  In this chapter, we covered a substantial amount of topics relating to the Xcode 4 workspace  environment. We saw how to go about downloading and installing Xcode 4 and the iOS4 SDK  as well as what comprises the Xcode 4 IDE and the different types of libraries that are part  of the Xcode 4 workspace  File Templates, Code Snippets, Object Library, and so on . We  also created a very simple iPhone application using View Controllers and using the system  frameworks to display a label to the view.  Now that we've learned about the main components of the Xcode 4 workspace environment  and how to go about building a simple iPhone application, we are ready to start focusing on  the GUI side of things with Interface Builder.  In the next chapter, we will dive right in and work with the Interface Builder  GUI   application. We will also improve on our very simple iPhone application and start to add  controls from our Object library as well as learning how to connect these components   up to the program logic so that we end up with a fully functional iPhone application.  [ 64 ]   3  Working with the Interface Builder  In this chapter, we will learn about the interface builder application and how  we can use this visual tool to design our user interfaces for our iOS applications.  We will also look at how we can use objects from the Object library to create  the necessary outlets and actions so that we can programmatically use these  within our code, as well as learning how to reposition and bind objects so that  they work together.  In this chapter, we will:                  Familiarise ourselves with the Interface Builder tool Learn how to add controls to our view-based controller using MVC Learn how to Position and Align controls to the User Interface Understand what are Rotatable and Resizable Interfaces Learn how to reposition controls within the view when the device is rotated Learn how to bind UI control objects to code Enhance our "Hello World" iPhone application, created in the previous chapter Learn how to implement File Saving and Loading  We have got quite a bit to cover, so let's get started.   Working with the Interface Builder  Getting to know the Interface Builder environment  Interface Builder  IB  is a visual tool that enables you to design the user interface for your  iPhone or iPad applications. By using Interface Builder, you are able to drag and drop views  onto your window and then connect the various views with outlets and actions so that they  can programmatically interact with your code.  In Xcode 4, Interface Builder  IB  appears in the editor area of the workspace window when  you select an xib file from the project navigator window. When you open an xib file, the  Interface Builder file inspectors appear in the utility area, and you are able to select Interface  Builder Objects from within the libraries' pane and drag them into your interface builder  canvas area.  An xib file is what gets created by Interface Builder, and contains the user  interface design and objects. In previous versions of Xcode, nib files were used  and were created by NeXTStep computers back in the mid-late 80s. More  information on the nib file format can be found at the following location:  http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Interface_Builder.  [ 66 ]   Chapter 3  Adding Controls to your user interface Now, this is where the real fun starts. We will start by creating our iPhone application. Instead  of creating a typical "Hello World" application, we will be making this one a bit more flexible.  The program will present the user with a  UITextField  field for typing in their name, as  well as a  UIButton  button which will display the message "Welcome to iOS Programming  "followed by the name of the user. This will be outputted to our Output  UILabel    label control.  We have some fun work ahead, so grab yourself a cup of your favorite beverage and let's   get started.  Time for action – creating the HelloXcode4_GUI application Before we can proceed with creating our "HelloXcode4_GUI" application, we must first  launch the Xcode development environment. This can be located in the  Xcode4  Applications folder. Alternatively, you can use the spotlight to search for Xcode by   typing xcode into the search box window.  When you launch Xcode, you will be presented with the Welcome to Xcode screen, as shown  in the following screenshot:  [ 67 ]   Working with the Interface Builder  It is very simple to create this in Xcode. Just follow the steps listed below:  1.  Choose Create a new Xcode project, or File  New Project. This will bring up the   project template dialog, which is shown in the screenshot below.  2.  We need to select the View-based application template to use. What this template   provides us with is a starting point for an application that uses a single view. It  provides a view controller to manage the view, and an xib file that contains the view. 3.  Ensure that you have selected iPhone from under the Device Family dropdown, as   the type of view to create:  4.  Click on the Next button. You will be prompted to enter in a name for your project. 5.  Enter in HelloXcode4_GUI and then click on the Next button to proceed to the next  step of the wizard. You will then be asked to choose the location where you would  like to save your project.  You will also notice that there is an option to automatically save your project to Source  Control. If this option gets checked, this will create a local repository on disk so you can  check-in your work. This option is not checked by default.  [ 6 ]   Chapter 3  Source Control allows you to keep track of changes made to a file  and who applied those changes. If you have worked with Microsoft  Visual Source-Safe or Tortoise SVN, you will already be familiar with  Source Control and how it works. We will be covering this in Chapter  9, Source Code Management with the Version Editor.  What just happened? In the above section, we looked at the steps involved in creating a View-based Application  for our HelloXcode4_GUI application. In the next section, we will take a look at the main  components of our application and the core application architecture, before taking a look   at the Application Life-Cycle for all iOS applications.  [ 6 ]   Working with the Interface Builder  Application structure of our HelloXcode4 example application Once our project has been created, you will be presented with the Xcode workspace  interface. All files that the project template created for you will be displayed within the  Project Navigator window section. The important files to take note of are the following:        Main.m HelloXcode4_GUIAppDelegate.h, and HelloXcode4_GUIAppDelegate.m  Main.m The main function is where the single UIApplication object is created and the function  called UIApplicationMain   takes care of that. This function takes four parameters, and uses  them to initialize the application. There is no reason to edit this main function as it is just  there to simply kick-start your application xibs and view controllers into running:  import    int main int argc, char *argv[]  {   NSAutoreleasePool * pool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init];   int retVal = UIApplicationMain argc, argv, nil, nil ;   [pool release];   return retVal; }  Although you should never have to change the default values passed into this function,  it is worth explaining their purpose in terms of starting the application. In addition to the  argc and argv parameters passed into main, this function takes two string parameters that  identify the principal class  that is, the class of the application object  and the class of the  application delegate.  If the value of the principal class string is nil, UIKit uses the UIApplication class by   default. If the value of the application delegate's class is nil, UIKit assumes that the  application delegate is one of the objects loaded from your application's main nib file    which is the case for applications built using the Xcode templates . Setting either of   these parameters to a non-nil value causes the UIApplicationMain function to   create an instance of the corresponding class during application startup and use it for   the indicated purpose. If your application uses a custom subclass of UIApplication  which   is not recommended, but certainly possible , you would specify your custom class name in  the third parameter.  [ 70 ]   HelloXcode4_GUIAppDelegate.h In the HelloXcode4_GUIAppDelegate.h interface file, we need to create a forward   @class declaration HelloXcode4_GUIViewController. This basically tells the compiler a class  with the name exists. In the @interface section, we declare a member variable to hold our  view controller. Lastly, we use the @property directive to wrap our member variables with  implicit get and set functions:  Chapter 3  import    @class HelloXcode4_GUIViewController;  @interface HelloXcode4_GUIAppDelegate : NSObject       {   UIWindow *window;   HelloXcode4_GUIViewController *viewController; }  @property  nonatomic, retain  IBOutlet UIWindow *window; @property  nonatomic, retain  IBOutlet HelloXcode4_GUIViewController     *viewController;  @end  The HelloXcode4_GUIAppDelegate gets hooked up to the UIApplication object via  the Interface Builder  .xib  file called MainWindow.xib. This file contains a Window and   a View.  HelloXcode4_GUIAppDelegate.m The associated implementation file of the delegate, HelloXcode4_GUIAppDelegate.m,   contains several messages that we can get from the UIApplication object and the template   has already created one for us—applicationDidFinishLaunchingWithOptions:  -  BOOL application: UIApplication * application     didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: NSDictionary * launchOptions {       Override point for customization after application launch.   [window addSubview:viewController.view];   [window makeKeyAndVisible];   return YES; }  You will also notice that when the project was created, it added our view controller. This will  eventually hold our label object for our text output. You will notice when you look at the  new implementation file, HelloXcode4_GUIViewController.m that it contains some  commented out functions.  [ 71 ]   Working with the Interface Builder  The MainWindow.xib file Another task that occurs at initialization time is the loading of the application's main nib file.  If the application's information property list  HelloXcode4_GUI-info.plist  file contains  the  NSMainNibFile  Main nib file base name key, the UIApplication object  loads the nib file specified by that key as part of its initialization process.  The main nib file is the only file that is loaded for you automatically. However, you can load  additional nib files later as needed.  Nib files are disk-based resource files that store a snapshot of one or more objects. The main  nib file of an iOS application typically contains a window object, the application delegate  object, and perhaps one or more other key objects for managing the window.  Loading a nib file reconstitutes the objects in the nib file, converting each object from   its on-disk representation to an actual in-memory version that can be manipulated by   your application.  Objects loaded from nib files are no different than the objects you create programmatically.  For user interfaces, however, it is often more convenient to create the objects associated  with your user interface graphically  using the Interface Builder application  and store them  in xib files rather than create them programmatically. It is worth mentioning at this point,  anything that can be done within the Interface Builder application can also be created  dynamically through code. As you can see from the code snippet below, we create a   button control and set its size and caption, before adding it to our view:  - void viewDidLoad {    UIButton * btn = [UIButton     buttonWithType:UIButtonTypeRoundedRect];    btn.frame = CGRectMake 0, 0, 100, 50 ;    [btn setTitle:@"Hello, world!" forState:UIControlStateNormal];    [self.view addSubview:btn]; }  The Core Application Architecture layer Every iOS application that you develop is built using the UIKit framework. Games on the  other hand use the Core Graphics and OpenGL ES frameworks. The UIKit framework  provides you with the key objects needed to run the application and to coordinate the  handling of user input and the display of content on the screen.  From the time your application is launched, to the time that it exits, the UIKit framework  manages the majority of the application's key infrastructure. An iPhone application receives  events continuously from the system and must respond to those events. Receiving the   [ 72 ]   Chapter 3  events is the job of the UIApplication object, but responding to the events is the  responsibility of your custom code. In order to understand where you need to respond to  events, it helps to understand a little bit about the overall life cycle and event cycles of an  iPhone application. We describe these cycles below.  The application life cycle The application life cycle comprises the sequence of events that occur between the launch  and termination of your application. When a user launches your application by tapping the  icon on the Home screen, the system displays some transitional graphics and proceeds to  launch your application by calling its main function.  This function handles the bulk of the initialization work before being handed over to the  UIKit, that loads the application's user interface and enters its event loop. UIKit coordinates  the delivery of events to your custom objects and responds to commands issued by your  application. Whenever a user performs an action that would cause your application to quit,  UIKit notifies your application and begins the termination process.  In the screenshot below, it shows the simplified startup life cycle for a newly launched iOS  application. This diagram shows the sequence of events that occur between the time the  application starts up and the point at which another application is launched. At key points in  the application's life, UIKit sends messages to the application delegate object to let it know  what is happening. During the event loop, UIKit also dispatches events to your application's  custom event handlers, which are your views and view controllers:  [ 73 ]   Working with the Interface Builder  At initialization and termination, UIKit sends specific messages to the application delegate  object to let it know what is happening. During the event loop, UIKit dispatches events to  your application's custom event handlers.  The applicationDidFinishLaunching: method is created automatically and is used  to kick off your application. This event fires automatically on your delegate whenever your  application launches.  The applicationWillTerminate: method is called at termination time when your  application is running in the foreground or background to perform any required cleanup. You  can use this method to save user data or application-state information that you would use  to restore your application to its current state on a subsequent launch. This method is not  called if your application is currently suspended.  Time for action – adding object controls to our View We will now start to design our user interface, using the controls from our Xcode Object  Library. Firstly, from the Project Navigator window, and under the Resources folder, select  the HelloXcode4_GUIViewController.xib file. A blank View canvas will be displayed   to which we will start to add our components:  [ 74 ]   In the coming pages, we will be adding the following control items to our View Controller:  Chapter 3           UILabel   UITextField   UILabel   UIButton   In the next section, we will start to build the user interface for our example application   by dragging some of the UI components to our canvas, and changing some of the  components' properties:  Next, to add an item to our canvas, follow these steps:  1.  Simply drag the  UILabel  Label item from the Object Library to the view, as shown  in the screenshot above. You can use the search field located at the bottom of the  Object Library to locate any of the UI elements.  2.    Once the label control has been added, select this control and click on the Object  Attributes button and enter the text Please Enter Your Name:  [ 75 ]   Working with the Interface Builder  You will notice that the Object Attributes properties pane is displayed and contains various  properties associated with this particular control. You are able to apply the Text Color and  Background Color for your label, as well as alignment:  The screenshot below shows our updated label control with the text which we added  previously. Next, we will start to add our remaining controls to our View Controller:  [ 76 ]   Chapter 3  What we now need to do is to add the remaining control objects to our View. We still need  to add our UITextField, UIButton, and UILabel objects. To achieve this, follow these steps:  1.  From the Object Library, select and drag a  UITextField  TextBox control to the view   and place this control directly under our label control Please Enter Your Name.  Resize the control accordingly.  2.  Next, select and drag a  UILabel  Label control and add this to our view. Resize this  accordingly as this will be used to display the output. Click on the Object Attributes  tab and enter the text Label for Output.  3.  We are nearly there, so just hang in for a couple of minutes. We need to add a    UIButton  Round Rect Button control to our view. Modify the Object Attributes of  the Round Rect Button control and set its Title to OK.  If you have followed the steps correctly, your view should look like something shown in the  screenshot below. If it doesn't look quite the same, feel free to adjust yours:  If you were to run this application, all you would see would be the controls as laid out on  your screen. The only interaction that will happen up to this point is that the keyboard will  be displayed if you clicked into the Text Field.  Clicking on any of the other controls will not do anything as we will need to hook these up.  This is done in the section Binding Control Objects later in this chapter where we will be  creating and making use of Outlets and Actions.  [ 77 ]   Working with the Interface Builder  Interface Builder provides some nice features for aligning and setting the properties of visual  elements within your View. These are called guidelines or crosshairs which enable you to  ensure that your controls align up correctly. In the screenshot below, we will look at how   we can use these guidelines to position our controls within the view:  when you change the size and position of a Label, Button, or Text Fields. These are  referred to as automatic guides. They provide you with a good way to optimally position  controls within your user interface and ensure that you conform to the Apple Human  Interface Guidelines to ensure a consistent visual and behavioral experience throughout  your application, by providing a professional look and feel, as well as ensuring that your  application looks and behaves the same way as existing iOS applications on the iPhone.  For more information on the Apple Human Interface Guidelines, please refer to the  following: http:  developer.apple.com library mac documentation  UserExperience Conceptual AppleHIGuidelines XHIGIntro XHIGIntro. html%23  apple_ref doc uid TP30000894-TP6.  Interface Builder will also show dynamically updated guides and will even show  you the pixel distances between various points within the window. You can also  add your own custom guides via the Editor  Add Vertical Guide  or Horizontal  Guide  menu. These will remain visible while you are designing your user  information, but don't display when your application is running.  What just happened? In the above section, we looked at the steps involved in adding a number of controls to  our view from the Xcode Object Library as well as setting their control properties using the  Object Attributes button. Finally, we look at how we can use the guidelines and crosshairs to  position and align visual elements within our view to ensure that they line up correctly.  [ 7 ]   Chapter 3  Understanding Rotatable Interfaces Rotatable and Resizable interfaces allow you to look at your applications or web content in  various views. For instance, say you wanted to view a website or play a game in landscape  mode; the iPhone introduces a way and provides on-the-fly rotation which is fast, and  provides a natural feel.  When designing your iOS applications, think about how the user will be interacting with  your application. Will you be designing an app that will force portrait mode only, or will it  be flexible enough to allow for multiple views. The best part of all this is that the process to  enable rotation is a painless process.  Time for Action – enabling Interface Rotation To allow your application's interface to rotate and resize, all that is required is a single  method. When the iPhone wants to check to see whether it should rotate your interface,  it sends the shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation: message to your view  controller, along with a parameter that indicates which orientation it wants to check.  Your implementation of shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation: should compare  the incoming parameter against the different orientation constants in the iOS, by either  returning TRUE  or YES  if you want to support that orientation.  The four basic screen orientation constants are described below:  ORIENTATION METHOD Portrait Portrait upside-down  Landscape Left Landscape Right  iOS ORIENTATION CONSTANT UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait UIInterfaceOrientationPortraitUpsideDown  This is rarely used on  the iPhone as this is mainly used and implemented on the iPad.  UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeLeft UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeRight  For example, to allow your iOS interface to rotate to either the portrait or landscape left  orientations, you would implement shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation: in  your view controller as the following:  - BOOL shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation: UIInterfaceOrientation     interfaceOrientation { Return  interfaceOrientation == UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait      interfaceOrientation == UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeLeft ; }  [ 7 ]   Working with the Interface Builder  What just happened? The Return statement handles everything and it returns the result of an expression  comparing the incoming orientation parameter  interfaceOrientation  to the  UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait and UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeLeft.  If either of the comparisons is true, the function returns TRUE. Alternatively, if either one of  the possible orientations are checked, the function returns FALSE.  By adding this simple method to your view controller, your application will automatically  sense and rotate the view for portrait or landscape left orientations.  Relocating controls within the view on Rotation When we rotate our iOS application, the screen dimensions shift. The only problem is  that we still end up with the same amount of free usable space, but our view is laid out  differently. In order to ensure that controls fully utilise and resize automatically for the new  orientation, we use the combination of rotatable and resizable screen rotation.  The Simulator supports changes in view orientation. To change the view to landscape mode,  press the Command + Right Arrow key combinations. The screenshot below shows how your  application looks in landscape mode. Press the Command + Left arrow key to change it back  to portrait mode:  You will notice that your application did not respond to the changes in view orientation. This  is because you need to modify your code so that when the view orientation changes, the  event that handles this fires.  [ 0 ]   Chapter 3  In Xcode, open the HelloXcode4_GUIViewController.m file and look for the following  code snippet:  -   BOOL shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation: UIInterfaceOrientation     interfaceOrientation {      Return YES for supported orientations   return  interfaceOrientation == UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait ; }  Modify the code above to return YES. This is shown below:  -   BOOL shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation: UIInterfaceOrientation     interfaceOrientation {      Return YES for supported orientations   return YES; }  When you run the application again, you will notice that your application rotates as the view  orientation changes:  Making our Components work together  In this section, we will be discussing how to go about making our HelloXcode4_GUI  application and its components interact with each other. We want to ensure that when the  user enters in their name, and clicks on the OK button, the Output will display Welcome to  iOS Programming along with the user name.  [ 1 ]   Working with the Interface Builder  We will take a look at how to go about connecting our controls via the use of Outlets and  Actions. The controls that we will create are shown in the table below:  DATA TYPE  UILabel   UITextField   UILabel   UIButton   OBJECT NAME lblName txtUsername lblOutput btnOK  Time for action – binding Control Objects The way in which we achieve this is to connect our controls via the use of outlets and actions  which we will be discussing in this section:  1.  Open the HelloXcode4_GUIViewController.xib file. 2.  Select the Username textbox control and hold down the Ctrl key while using the   mouse to drag this into the HelloXcode4_GUIViewController.h interface file  and release the mouse button:  3.  Next, once we have dragged the object to which we want to bind within our code,  we need to specify its connection type, and provide a name and type as shown in  the screenshot below:  An outlet  IBOutlet  is basically a variable by which an object can be referenced.  An example of this could be that you have created a field in Interface Builder used  to collect the user's name or e-mail address and you have created an outlet for this  in your code called userName. Using this outlet, you would be able to access or  change the contents of this field: IBOutlet UILabel *Username;  [ 2 ]   4.  Next, we need to create an Action for our OK button which will be used to    display the greeting message on the screen when it is pressed. Open the  HelloXcode4_GUIViewController.m implementation file.  5.  Select the OK button, hold down the Ctrl button while using the mouse to drag this   into our implementation file and release the mouse button. This is shown in the  screenshot below:  Chapter 3  6.  Next, once we have dragged the object to which we want to bind within our code,  we need to specify its connection type, and provide a name and type as shown in  the screenshot below. The Type, Event, and Arguments need not be filled in, as  these are the default values:  An Action  IBAction  on the other hand, is basically a method defined within your code  that is called when an event takes place. Objects such as Buttons and Switches can trigger  actions when a user performs a task such as touching objects on the screen.  - IBAction displayName: id sender;  7.  Next, we need to enter in the following code snippet, which will be responsible for  displaying the greeting message on the screen when the user enters in their name  and the OK button is pressed: -  IBAction btnOK: id sender {   NSString *WelcomeMsg=[[NSString alloc] initWithFormat:@"Welcome       to iOS Programming %@",txtUsername.text];      lblOutput.text=WelcomeMsg;   lblOutput.textColor=[UIColor blueColor]; }  [ 3 ]   Working with the Interface Builder  What just happened? We created an action button, btnOK which when clicked, displays the contents of the text  field entered by the user. It formats the output as a string output, sets the color to blue   and displays the text. As you can see, by adding this simple method to your view controller,  your application will automatically sense and rotate the view for portrait or landscape   left orientations.  Format specifiers allow you to manipulate how you would like to represent your data to  the screen. These types of specifiers use the standard C format specifiers. In the example  above where we are initializing our output message, we use the %@ specifier which tells the  initWithFormat function that we are expecting to format the text entered within our  txtUsername control as String.  In Standard C, this could be written as:  printf "%s",txtusername.text ;  For more information on the format specifiers, please consult Apple's  String Programming Guide for Cocoa at the following location: http:   developer.apple.com library mac documentation Cocoa  Conceptual Strings Articles formatSpecifiers.html.  Time for action – repositioning the Controls In the previous section, we looked at how to change the orientation of our view using the  iPhone Simulator and also observed that the size and positioning of the controls remained.  This is not a desirable way to do things in the real-world, as this does not give the user a  good experience while using your application. Ideally, you should reposition your controls   on the screen so that they change according to the view orientation that the phone is  currently in.  In order to reposition the controls within our view, let's go back to our previous example in  Interface Builder and follow these steps:  1.  Select the Label control; select View  Utilities  Size. 2.  Modify the Autosizing attribute of the control as shown in the screenshot below.   This will cause the Label control to expand contract as the view orientation changes.  At the same time, the control will anchor to the left, top, or right of the screen:  [ 4 ]   Chapter 3  3.  Modify the AutoSizing attribute for the Text Field control as shown in the    screenshot below:  4.  Modify the AutoSizing attribute for the Label Field control which will be used to   display our output, as shown in the screenshot below:  [ 5 ]   Working with the Interface Builder  5.  Modify the Autosizing attribute for the Round Rect Button control which is shown  in the screenshot below. You will notice that we are not going to resize the control  when the view orientation changes. We just need to anchor this control to the top  of the screen:  6.  Run the application, and rotate your screen so that the view changes, and you will   see that your changes have been applied. This is shown in the screenshot below:  What just happened? In this section, we took a look at the steps involved in making our controls reposition  themselves within the view when the device has been rotated. We also looked at how we  are able to use the Autosizing Attribute feature of the object to allow our controls to expand  and contract as the view changes.  [ 6 ]   Chapter 3  Enhancing our iPhone application Now that we have learned how to position controls within our view, we are going to apply  some enhancements to our HelloXcode4_GUI application. You will notice that when you  type into the name field, the keyboard appears, but when you click on the Done or Return  button s , nothing happens and the keyboard still stays visible making other controls on your  view impossible to get to.  In this section, you will be learning about how to address this problem, by hiding the  keyboard when the Done or Return buttons are pressed.  When an object processes input, these are called responders. In the case of a text field or  text view, when it gains first responder status, the keyboard is displayed and will remain on  screen until the field gives up, or resigns its responder status.  Time for action – hiding the keyboard In the case of our Username text field, we could resign its first responder status and  get rid of the keyboard by adding the following line of code to our HelloXcode4_ GUIViewController.m file:  [txtUsername resignFirstResponder];  Calling the resignFirstResponder method tells the input object to give up its claim to the  input control, hence the keyboard disappears.  There is a second common method for hiding the keyboard in iOS applications through the  Did End on Exit event of the field. This event occurs when the return or done keyboard  button is pressed.  To add keyboard hiding to our HelloXcode4_GUI application, follow these steps:  1.  Switch back to our application in Xcode and create the action declaration for a   method hideKeyboard within the HelloXcode4_GUIViewController.h file. - IBAction hideKeyboard: id sender;  2.  Next, we need to implement the hideKeyboard method within the   HelloXcode4_GUIViewController.m file by adding the following code after the  @implementation directive: - IBAction hideKeyboard: id sender { [txtUsername resignFirstResponder]; }  [ 7 ]   Working with the Interface Builder  To connect fields to the hideKeyboard method manually, follow these steps:  1.  Open the HelloXcode4_GUIViewController.xib file which should display   within Interface Builder.  2.  Select the field, and drag its connector into the HelloXcode4_  GUIViewController.m file.  3.  Create an IBAction for the Did End On Exit event as shown in the screenshot below:  What just happened? In this section, we looked at the two different ways in which we can hide the keyboard  when the Done or Return buttons are pressed. We saw that in order to hide the keyboard  onscreen; we must send the resignFirstResponder message to the object that currently  controls the keyboard  such as a text field . If we don't do this, the keyboard is displayed and  will remain on screen until the field gives up, or resigns its responder status. We also looked  at how we can connect up to our text field an event Did End On Exit which points to our  hideKeyboard method.  Have a go hero – enhancing the HelloXcode4 example Now that you have the basic example working, try improving the user experience a bit. The  application needs to be enhanced to allow the user to enter their age, gender, occupation,  and location. When the OK button is pressed; it should check the contents of each of these  fields to ensure that they have been filled in and display an error message in red text if any  of these have not been filled in, and update the background of the control that has not been  filled in:  [  ]   Chapter 3  1.  Modify the MainWindow.xib file to include the additional field objects. Refer to the   section Adding object controls to our View.  2.  Create the necessary outlets. Refer to the section Making our Components work   together on how to do this.  3.  Connect the method to each control to hide the keyboard when the Done or Return   buttons are pressed. Refer to the section Hiding the Keyboard.  4.  Update the method call to create each of the conditions that performs the check   and updates the label.  5.  Change the background color of the control that has not been filled in to be green.   You will need to make use of the UIColor class. Refer to the section Binding Control  Objects, or the Apple Developer Documentation located at the following: http:   developer.apple.com library ios documentation uikit reference  UIColor_Class Reference Reference.html.  For more of a challenge, try using the  notation instead of separate if statements. This will  enable you to check each form field in one hit. Once you have that working, you will have  a more user-friendly application that provides more information to be entered along with  validation on those fields and that provides error trapping.  Introducing Document-based applications  Document-Based application applies to the Cocoa environment and can be thought of as  a mini-application. Creating these types of applications provides you with the ability to  have multiple document windows opened at the same time, allowing you to switch focus  between each of them. It provides a framework for generating identically contained, but  uniquely composed sets of data that can be stored in files. An example of a document-based  application is TextEdit.  [  ]   Working with the Interface Builder  Time for action – creating a Document-based application It is very simple to create this in Xcode; just follow the steps listed below:  1.  Under the Mac OS X section header, select Application and then select the Cocoa   Application icon.  2.  Under the options pane, ensure that you have checked Create Document-Based   Application; if this is not selected, Cocoa will create a single-windowed application:  3.  Click the Next button to proceed to the next step, and enter a name for your project:  [ 0 ]   Chapter 3  4.  When you have entered a name for your project, click on the Save button. Your  project will be saved in the folder specified and the Xcode workspace will then   be displayed.  Let's start to see what the project wizard has created for us; the important files to take note  of are the MyDocument.m, MyDocument.h, and MyDocument.xib. Start by double-clicking  on the MyDocument.xib file; you will notice that there is already a Text Field that was  created containing the text "Your document contents here". Just delete that, as we will be  creating a new one for us to use:  [ 1 ]   Working with the Interface Builder  From the Object Library pane, drag and drop a Text View control and use the automatic  guidelines to resize the control to fill most of the window by using the Autosizing settings,  and enabling all four of the I-Bars and both the horizontal and vertical arrows. This is shown  in the screenshot below:  Before we can use our Text View control, we need to create an Outlet for this, in order for  us to Load and Save documents. In the following section, we will look at how we go about  creating Outlets, as well as adding properties, variables, and methods.  In the following screenshot, we need to create a connection within our MyDocument. h interface file, so that it points to our document Text View control. This is shown in the  following steps:  [ 2 ]   Chapter 3  1.  Drag the connection of the Text View control into the interface header file   of MyDocument.h. A Connection dialog will be displayed as shown in the  screenshot below.  2.  Next, provide a name for our Text View control as we will be referencing this control   when we come to load and save our files:  [ 3 ]   Working with the Interface Builder  What just happened? In this section, we learned about Document-based applications and how we are able to bind  controls and create Outlets for them so that they can be referenced within the code.   Creating Document-based applications enables you to do the following:                    They allow you to create new and open existing documents that are stored in files Save documents under user-designated names and locations Revert to saved documents Close documents  usually after prompting the user to save edited documents  Print documents and allow the page layout to be modified Represent data of different types internally Monitor and set the document's edited status and validate menu items Manage document windows, including setting the window titles Handle application and window delegation methods  such as when the   application terminates   If you would like to read up a bit more about Document-Based applications, check  out the Apple Developer Connection website at the following website location:  http:  developer.apple.com library mac documentation  Cocoa Conceptual Documents Documents.html.  File saving and loading When you try to run your application, you will see that you have the capability of a   mini-word processor and you have the ability to type, copy, paste, apply formatting to   fonts and colors, as well as showing the ruler and setting tabs.  When you try to save your document, it appears that your application doesn't know how  to save your document. You receive the following error message which is shown in the  screenshot below:  [ 4 ]   Time for action – implementing file saving and loading In order to make our application have the capability to Save and Load, follow these steps:  1.  Modify the MyDocument.h header file to include the following piece of    Chapter 3  highlighted code: import    @interface MyDocument : NSDocument {    IBOutlet NSTextView *rtfTextView;   NSAttributedString *docString; }  @property retain  NSTextView *rtfTextView; @property retain  NSAttributedString *docString;  @end  2.  The next stage is to implement the various methods in the MyDocument.m    implementation file. You will find that we already have the method stubs  defined within this file, so we just need to fill these in. The method called  windowControllerDidLoadNib is the method which gets run when the user  interface is loaded, and its purpose is to populate the Text View control. Add the  following highlighted code into this method:  -  void windowControllerDidLoadNib: NSWindowController     * aController {   [super windowControllerDidLoadNib:aController];         Add any code here that needs to be executed once the       windowController has loaded the document's window.   if  self.docString !=nil {     [[rtfTextView textStorage]setAttributedString:self.docString];   } }  3.  We are now going to add the code for the Reading and Writing. Locate the   dataOfType method and add the following highlighted code: -  NSData * dataOfType: NSString * typeName error: NSError     ** outError {   NSData *rtfData;   self.docString=rtfTextView.textStorage;   rtfData=[NSArchiver archivedDataWithRootObject:self.docString];   return rtfData; }  [ 5 ]   Working with the Interface Builder  4.  Next, we are now going to add the code for Reading the contents back into    the document. Locate the readFromData method and add the following  highlighted code: -  BOOL readFromData: NSData * data ofType: NSString * typeName     error: NSError ** outError {   NSAttributedString *tempString=[NSUnarchiver       unarchiveObjectWithData:data];   self.docString=tempString;   return YES; }  5.  Now that you have added all of the relevant code to the MyDocument.m   implementation file, you are ready to run your application. A screenshot of   the final output is displayed below:  What just happened? In this section we declared outlets, variables, and methods that we implemented into our  MyDocument.m file. We then used the NSAttributedString class to help us manage the  string which we needed to get and set the string contents from the TextView Control. So that  is why we needed to create an Outlet for this.  [ 6 ]   We then set the value of the textStorage property of the Text View control to be the  value of the attributed string property of the current window object. We also defined two  datatypes rtfData and docString, that will be used to store the document contents using  the NSArchiver class. We finally added code to our readFromData method to read the  contents of the file back into the document window by using the NSUnarchiver class.

[ 7 ]   Working with the Interface Builder  Summary  In this chapter, we covered the Interface Builder  IB  application, and how to go about  creating a very simple application which interacted with the user to display some text to the  screen using outlets and actions. We also got an insight into the iOS Application-Life-Cycle,  and what happens when an application is loaded by the user.  We also enhanced our iPhone application and added some rotation and resized the controls.  We also looked into the various ways of hiding the keyboard by resigning responders.  Now that we've learned about how to go about creating an application using Interface  Builder, we are ready to start to focus on the iOS 4 Xcode Frameworks.  In the next chapter, we will take a look at the iOS frameworks and where these are located.  We will create a simple Pop Quiz database application which will be making use of the Core  Data Frameworks, as well as creating an application to play video and audio. We will also get  acquainted with the Core Location and Map Kit Framework improvements, as well as the  new framework APIs.  [  ]   4  Working with the Xcode Frameworks  In this chapter, we will take a look at the different Xcode  Cocoa  development  frameworks and where these are located. Frameworks provide you with a  hierarchical directory that encapsulates shared resources, such as a dynamic  shared library, xib files, image files, header files, and reference documentation  in a single package. Multiple applications are then able to use all of these  resources simultaneously. The system loads these into memory as needed and  shares one copy of the resource among all applications whenever possible.  In this chapter, we will:                Introduce the different sets of Xcode Frameworks and their locations Take an insight into the Core Data Frameworks and build a simple database  application to save and retrieve data Learn how to play an audio file using the AV Foundation Frameworks Learn how to play a movie using the Media Player Frameworks Understand what comprises the Core Location Framework Learn about the Map Kit Framework and the improvements Learn how to go about building a simple Geographical Application  We have got quite a bit to cover, so let's get started.   Working with the Xcode Frameworks  Introducing the Frameworks  You may be wondering, what exactly are frameworks? Well, to sum it up, frameworks are  basically a group of code libraries that provide specific functionalities that save you time in  building common features yourself.  In previous chapters, you have already been using Apple's frameworks; in fact, every time  you use your Mac you make use of these frameworks. Most software that you use on your  Mac uses these frameworks, including Apple's Mac OS X operating system.  Frameworks are an integral part of Cocoa, which is an object-oriented environment which  you use to build Mac OS X software—including Mac and iOS applications. Cocoa consists of  the following main components:        The Xcode Tools The Core Frameworks: This includes the Foundation and Application Kit Additional Frameworks: WebKit, Core Data, and Core Animation, and so on  The above frameworks are highly optimized code libraries which provide you with a  straightforward and consistent interface to the features within the Mac OS X operating  system. If you wanted to implement a list box, command button, or web browser window;  these would operate the same way as those used in such programs as Safari, iTunes,   or Mail.  The Core Foundation frameworks are the fundamental Cocoa frameworks that are used in all  Cocoa applications and inherit all features from the NSObject.  NSObject was covered in Chapter 1, Introducing Xcode 4 Tools for iPhone  Development under the section Objective-C Classes or refer to the Apple  Developer Documentation at: http:  developer.apple.com  library mac documentation Cocoa Reference Foundation  Classes NSObject_Class Reference Reference.html  The main core frameworks which are supplied by Apple are located within the  System  Library Frameworks folder. If you take a look within this folder, you will notice that it  contains folders for every framework.  The table below describes each of the frameworks which are available to iOS devices. If frameworks which are available to iOS devices. If  you are interested in taking a look at these frameworks, you can find these located in the    Platforms iPhoneOS.platform Developer SDKs   System  Library Frameworks directory.  [ 100 ]     : The path to where your Xcode installation directory is located.   : The specific SDK version that your project is targeting.

Using Frameworks and APIs in iPhone development For the rest of this chapter, we will be creating a variety of applications that will be using the  Cocoa Frameworks, to create very capable, rich-media applications, to handle playing movie  and audio files, and navigational applications.  [ 102 ]   Chapter 4  Core Data Frameworks The Core Data framework is a framework which manages where data is stored, how this data  is stored, how it is cached, and how it handles memory management. This framework can be  described as a "Schema-driven object graph management and persistence framework"   and was first ported to the iPhone from Mac OS X, and came as part of the iPhone 3.0  first ported to the iPhone from Mac OS X, and came as part of the iPhone 3.0   SDK release.  So what exactly is the Core Data framework? If you are familiar with the Entity-Framework  which is available in Microsoft .NET, this is of a similar nature. The Core Data framework is an  abstraction layer which sits on top of an SQLite database, and enables developers to easily SQLite database, and enables developers to easily  database, and enables developers to easily  implement data-centric applications by modelling your data storage around entities  classes   that contain the relationships between them.  We are only going to scratch the surface on what is available with Core Data. Since this is  such a large topic, there are many books as well as online resources made available which go  into more depth than we will here. I hope to give you a general overview of what Core Data  is and how to implement it.  The following image shows the simplest and most common configuration of the stack.  Objects that you usually work directly with are located at the top of the stack, as well   as the managed object context and the managed objects that it contains:  [ 103 ]   Working with the Xcode Frameworks  Just to give you an insight of the three main management object models that the Core Data  Framework contains, I have described these below:  OBJECT MODELS Managed Object Context  Managed Object  Managed Object Model  DESCRIPTION This associates the in-memory objects with their associated in-storage  counterparts. This is the in-memory representation of a data-model object and is  saved to storage in a persistent store  table . This is the object-relational schema, which contains the entity  descriptions that are required to build the managed objects.   Building a simple database application In this section, we will look at building a simple iPhone application using Core Data to allow  the user to enter their name, date of birth and gender, and save and retrieve this information  from the database.  Time for action – creating the Core Data application Before we can proceed, we first need to create our "CoreDataExample" project. To refresh To refresh  your memory, you can refer to the section that we covered in Chapter 2, Introducing the  Xcode 4 Workspace under the section, Creating your first iPhone application.  1.	 Launch Xcode from the  Xcode4 Applications folder. 2.	 Choose Create a new Xcode project, or File  New Project. 3.	 Select the Window-based Application template from the list of available templates. 4.	 Select iPhone from under the Device Family dropdown. 5.	 Ensure that you have checked Use Core Data from under the Options section:  [ 104 ]   Chapter 4  6.	 Click on the Next button to proceed to the next step in the wizard. 7.	 Enter in CoreDataExample and then click on the Next button to proceed to the next   step in the wizard:  [ 105 ]   Working with the Xcode Frameworks  8.	 Specify the location where you would like to save your project. 9.	 Click on the Save button to continue and display the Xcode workspace environment.  There is not a lot of setting up to do as the Use Core Data option which we checked when we  created our project, has automatically set up some important variables and has also created  the files for us in our project. We don't need to include the CoreData.Framework, as this  has been automatically added for us.  The CoreDataSample.xcdatamodel file is where we will be defining the database schema   for our SQLite database and this file is located under the Models section within our   project workspace:  Follow these steps to create a new entity and then to add attributes to it, which will be used  to represent the data that is going to be stored:  1.	 Click on the + Add Entity button, located in the bottom left-hand corner of the entity   panel and name this entity Person.  2.	 Click on the + Add Attribute button located in the bottom right of the entity panel,   or similarly from the Attributes pane and enter name for the attribute.  3.	 Change the attribute type to String from the type selection box. 4.	 Repeat steps 2 and 3 to add the remaining attributes for dob and gender. 5.	 Save your project using File  Save, as we are done defining our database    table schema.  [ 106 ]   We are now ready to start writing the code to save and retrieve our data.  What we now need to do is to create our own view controller, that will be used to handle the  saving and loading of the data as well as containing our user interface:  1.	 From the Classes folder in your project, ctrl + click on the folder, and select New   File…. The following screen is displayed as shown below:  Chapter 4  2.	 Select the UIViewController subclass template from the list of available templates. 3.	 Ensure that the With XIB for user interface option is selected from under the   Options section.  4.	 Click on the Next button to proceed to the next step of the wizard.  [ 107 ]   Working with the Xcode Frameworks  5.	 Enter coreDataViewController as the name of the file to create, and then click on   the Save button.  The Source Control: Create local git repository for this project is not checked  by default.  Now that we have added our view controller class to our application, our next task is to  modify our application delegate and to make this the main root view controller:  1.	 Open the CoreDataExampleAppDelegate.h interface file, located within the   Classes folder of your project and add the following highlighted code as shown in  the code snippet below: @class coreDataViewController;     @interface coreDataExampleAppDelegate : NSObject             {      coreDataViewController *viewController; }     [ 10 ]   Chapter 4         @property  nonatomic, retain  IBOutlet coreDataViewController     *viewController; @end  What we have done in the code above is that we have declared an instance to our view  controller so that we can reference this object. What we need to do now is to modify the  call to the method applicationDidFinishLaunching. 2.	 Open the CoreDataExampleAppDelegate.m interface file, located within the   Classes folder, then modify your code module to include the additional highlighted  references as shown in the code snippet below: import "coreDataExampleAppDelegate.h" import "coreDataViewController.h"  @implementation coreDataExampleAppDelegate  @synthesize window, viewController;  -  BOOL application: UIApplication * application     didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: NSDictionary * launchOptions {         Override point for customization after application launch.     [window addSubview:viewController.view];     [window makeKeyAndVisible];     return YES; }  What we have added into our coreDataExampleAppDelegate.m implementation  file is a reference to our view controller so that it can be added to our main  window when it has finished launching. We needed to include a reference to our  coreDataViewController.h interface so that we can synthesize our accessibility  objects for the viewController object.  Our next step is to add and associate a new view controller object with the MainWindow. xib file and then connect it to our application window delegate class:  1.	 Select the MainWindow.xib file which is located under the Resource node. 2.	 Drag and drop a View Controller object from the Xcode Object Library onto the   MainWindow.xib window.  [ 10 ]   Working with the Xcode Frameworks  If you have done this correctly, you should see a new View Controller appear under the  existing objects as shown in the screenshot below:  What we now need to do is update the class value for our ViewController to point to our  coreDataViewController class which we created previously. This will contain our form  objects which we will be creating later on:  1.	 With the View Controller currently selected, navigate to View  Utilities    Identity Inspector, and then change the Custom Class value to read  coreDataViewController:  [ 110 ]   2.	 Next we need to update the NIB Name for our view controller. This can be achieved   by selecting the Attributes page in the inspector window, or View  Utilities   Attributes Inspector and then assign coreDataViewController as the NIB file:  Chapter 4  Our final task is to establish the connection between the application delegate and the   view controller.  1.	 Click on the coreData Example App Delegate item in the MainWindow.xib   window and drag this onto the core Data View Controller which will result in   a blue line appearing.  2.	 Upon releasing the mouse button, select the ViewController item from the menu.   This is shown in the screenshot below:  Now that we have associated and bound our View Controller to our application, we are  ready to add some actions and outlets to the class.  [ 111 ]   Working with the Xcode Frameworks  For this example, we will be building a Graphical User Interface to demonstrate the use of  the Core Data Framework. This will accept a Name, Date of birth, and Gender. We will need  to create events which will handle the saving and loading:  1.	 Open the coreDataViewController.h interface file located within the Classes   folder, then modify your code module to include the additional highlighted  references as shown in the code snippet below: import   @interface coreDataViewController : UIViewController {   IBOutlet UITextField *Name;   IBOutlet UITextField *DOB;   IBOutlet UITextField *Gender;   IBOutlet UILabel *recordsFound; } @property  nonatomic, retain  IBOutlet UITextField *Name; @property  nonatomic, retain  IBOutlet UITextField *DOB; @property  nonatomic, retain  IBOutlet UITextField *Gender; @property  nonatomic, retain  IBOutlet UILabel *recordsFound;  - IBAction saveData: id sender; - IBAction searchData: id sender; - IBAction clearData: id sender;  @end  What we have added into our coreDataViewController.h interface file, is that  we have set up what fields our form will contain, as well as setting up properties to  these objects so we can reference these when we come to Save and Load our data.  We have also declared the methods within our header file to avoid warnings at  compile time.  2.	 Next, open the coreDataViewController.m implementation file located within   the Classes folder, then modify your code module to include the additional  highlighted references as shown below: import "coreDataViewController.h" import "coreDataExampleAppDelegate.h"  @implementation coreDataViewController @synthesize recordsFound, Name, DOB, Gender;  -  IBAction saveData: id sender {     }  [ 112 ]   Chapter 4  -  IBAction searchData: id sender { }  -  IBAction clearData: id sender { }  As well as declaring our IBOutlets which we will be using on our form, we  need to add an @synthesize directive which will allow us to use them in our  coreDataViewController.m implementation file.  Our final part will be to create the user interface design, bind those objects to the outlets  which we created within our CoreDataViewController.h interface file, and then  create the necessary code for our events. We are now going to add our UITextField,  UIButton, and UILabel objects. To achieve this follow these simple steps:  1.	 Open the coreDataViewController.xib from within our CoreDataExample   project.  2.	 From the Object Library, select and drag a  UIToolBar  Toolbar control to the view   and place it to the top of our View Controller.  3.	 From the Object Library, select and drag a  UIButton  Button control and drag it  to the top left-hand position of our toolbar. From the Attributes Inspector window,  set the caption property of the control to Save and the Style of the button to be  Bordered, and set its identifier to be Refresh.  4.	 Repeat the same process as outlined in the previous step to add the Search and Save   buttons, and assign their styles accordingly as shown below: Name: Search          Style: Bordered       Identifier: Search Name: Save             Style: Bordered       Identifier: Save  5.	 Now, we need to select and drag a  UILabel  Label control and drag it to your form   and set its Title to display the text Name.  6.	 Select and drag a  UITextField  Textbox control and drag it to your form, and position   it next to your Name Label.  7.	 Repeat steps 5-6 to add the remaining two fields for the Date of Birth and Gender.  [ 113 ]   Working with the Xcode Frameworks  8.	 Finally, select a  UILabel  label control and drag this to your view, position it  somewhere underneath the Gender field. This is just for display purposes:  When the user clicks on the Save button, we call our saveData method. In order for this to  work, we must implement the code to obtain the managed object context and create and  store the managed objects containing the data that has been entered by the user.  In our CoreDataViewController.m implementation file, locate the saveData method  and add the following code as shown below:  -  IBAction saveData: id sender {      coreDataExampleAppDelegate *appDelegate = [[UIApplication       sharedApplication] delegate];   NSManagedObjectContext *context = [appDelegate       managedObjectContext];   NSManagedObject *newPerson;      newPerson = [NSEntityDescription       insertNewObjectForEntityForName:@"Person"       inManagedObjectContext:context];      [newPerson setValue:Name.text forKey:@"name"];   [newPerson setValue:DOB.text forKey:@"dob"];   [newPerson setValue:Gender.text forKey:@"gender"];      Name.text = @"";  [ 114 ]   Chapter 4    DOB.text = @"";   Gender.text = @"";      NSError *error;   [context save:&error];      recordsFound.text = @"Details have been saved to the database."; }  What we are doing in the above code is using our application delegate instance to identify  the managed object context. We then use this context object to create a new managed  object using the Person entity item, and then use the setValue method of the managed  object to store the name, date of birth, and gender fields. Finally, we call the contexts save  method to save this data.  In order to give the user the ability to search for a person's name, we need to implement the  code for searchData   method. We will need to do the same as we did in the saveData    method, but with one exception, that being to ensure that only objects with the name  entered by the user are retrieved by the user.  In our CoreDataViewController.m implementation file, locate the searchData method  and add the following code as shown in the code snippet:  -  IBAction searchData: id sender {      coreDataExampleAppDelegate *appDelegate = [[UIApplication       sharedApplication] delegate];   NSManagedObjectContext *context = [appDelegate       managedObjectContext];     NSEntityDescription *entityDesc = [NSEntityDescription       entityForName:@"Person" inManagedObjectContext:context];   NSFetchRequest *request = [[NSFetchRequest alloc] init];      [request setEntity:entityDesc];   NSPredicate *pred = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@" name =       %@ ", Name.text];   [request setPredicate:pred];      NSManagedObject *matches = nil;   NSError *error;   NSArray *objects = [context executeFetchRequest:request       error:&error];      if  [objects count] == 0  {     recordsFound.text = @"No matches were found matching your         criteria";  [ 115 ]   Working with the Xcode Frameworks    } else {     matches = [objects objectAtIndex:0];     DOB.text = [matches valueForKey:@"dob"];     Gender.text = [matches valueForKey:@"gender"];     recordsFound.text = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%d Matches         Found", [objects count]];   }   [request release]; }  What we are doing in the above code is using our application delegate instance to identify  the managed object context as we did for our saveData method. We then use this context  object to create a new managed object using the Person entity item, and then create a  predicate object to only return objects matching the name specified by the user. If a match  is found, those objects are placed in an array, and then the objects are displayed to the form  fields using the valueForKey method.  It is good programming practice to always release the memory used by your objects. This  will save you time investigating programming errors down the track. We will need to add  these form object outlet controls to our viewDidLoad   and dealloc   methods that are  contained within the coreDataViewController.m file:  -  void viewDidUnload {   [super viewDidUnload];      Release any retained subviews of the main view.      e.g. self.myOutlet = nil;   self.Name = nil;   self.DOB = nil;   self.Gender = nil;   self.recordsFound = nil; } -  void dealloc {   [Name release];   [DOB release];   [Gender release];   [recordsFound release];   [super dealloc]; }  The viewDidUnload method is called when our ViewController has been unloaded.  What we are doing in the above code snippet is freeing up the memory which we allocated  during program execution. The dealloc method is called as a final step when our  application has ended. In this code module, we are releasing each of our objects. To end this  tutorial, I have included a screenshot which shows the final Core Data Example application  with all visual components being populated with data from our Core Data database:  [ 116 ]   Chapter 4  What just happened? In this section, we looked at how we can build a simple database application using Core  Data and SQLite. We looked at what are the differences between Entities and Attributes, and  how to go about creating these, and then finally looked at how we use the Managed Object  Context and Managed Object Model to save and retrieve data from our SQLite database.  AV Foundation Frameworks The AV Foundation framework provides an Objective-C interface which handles the recording  and playing of audio and video content within your iOS application. This framework also  provides the AVAudioSession class which handles the configuring and managing of your  application's audio session.  The AVAudioSession class handles the following:      Playing an audio File Playing a movie using Media Player  [ 117 ]   Working with the Xcode Frameworks  Whilst the Media Player Framework proves to be great with handling your entire general  media playback, the AV Foundation Framework offers audio recording features making it  possible to record new sound files directly within your application.  In order to make it possible for your application to handle playing of audio and recording  within your application, you will need to include two new classes:  FRAMEWORK NAME AVAudioRecorder  AVAudioPlayer  DESCRIPTION Records Audio in a variety of different formats to memory or to a local file  on the iPhone. The recording process is even clever enough to continue  while other functions are running in your application. Plays back audio files of any length. By using this class, you can  implement a backing game soundtrack or other complex audio  applications and you have complete control over the playback, including  the ability to layer multiple sounds on top of one another.  As you can see, the Media Player Framework and the AV Foundation Framework work hand  in hand in order to handle playing of audio files.  Playing an audio File Playing an audio file is a simple process. Before we can do this, we need to first include the  AV Foundation Framework into our project. In the next section, we will be creating a simple In the next section, we will be creating a simple  application which will play an audio file using the MediaPlayer Framework.  The Media Player Framework is used for playing back video and audio from either local or  remote resources and can be used to call up the iPod interface from your application from  which you are able to select songs to play back. The Framework integrates well with all  the built-in media features that your phone has to offer and we will be making use of the  following five classes in our sample application:  FRAMEWORK NAME MPMoviePlayerController  MPMediaPickerController  MPMediaItem  DESCRIPTION Allows playback of a piece of media, which is either located  on the iPhone file system or through a remote URL. The  player controller can provide a GUI for scrubbing through  video, pausing, fast forwarding, or rewinding. Presents the user with an interface for choosing media to  play. You can filter the files which are displayed by using  the media picker, or allow the selection of any file from the  media library. A single piece of media, such as a song.  [ 11 ]   FRAMEWORK NAME MPMediaItemCollection  MPMusicPlayerController  Chapter 4  DESCRIPTION Represents a collection of media items that will be used  for playback. An instance of MPMediaPickerController  returns an instance of MPMediaItemCollection that can  be used directly within the next class—the music player  controller. Handles the playback of media items and media item  collections. Unlike the movie player controller, the music  player allows playback from anywhere in your application.  The MediaPlayer Framework supports playback of the following file formats:                    AAC  16 to 320Kpbs  AIFF AAC Protected  MP4 from iTunes Store  MP3  16 to 320Kbps  MP3 VBR Audible  formats 2-4  Apple Lossless WAV MOV, M4V, MPV, or MP4 video codec formats  Creating an application to play an audio file Playing audio files is one of the common tasks on the iPhone, apart from playing video  content. What we will be achieving in this section is to build a simple application which   will contain two buttons—Play Audio and Stop Audio.  Time for action – creating the MusicPlayer application Before we can proceed, we first need to create the MusicPlayer project. To refresh your To refresh your  memory, you can refer to the section which we covered in Chapter 2, Introducing the Xcode 4  Workspace under the section,Creating your first iPhone application:  1.	 Launch Xcode from the  Xcode4 Applications folder. 2.	 Choose Create a new Xcode project, or File  New Project 3.	 Select the View-based Application template from the list of available templates. 4.	 Select iPhone from under the Device Family dropdown.  [ 11 ]   Working with the Xcode Frameworks  5.	 Click on the Next button to proceed to the next step in the wizard. 6.	 Enter MusicPlayer as the name of the project, and then click on the Next button to   proceed to the next step of the wizard.  7.	 Specify the location where you would like to save your project. 8.	 Click on the Save button to continue and display the Xcode workspace environment.  The Source Control: Create local git repository for this project is not checked  by default.  Now that we have created our MusicPlayer project, we need to add an important  framework to our project to enable our application to have the ability to play audio files.  To add the AV Foundation Framework to your project, select the Project Navigator Group,  and then follow these simple steps as outlined below:  1.	 Select your Project. 2.	 Then select your project target from under the TARGETS group. 3.	 Select the 'Build Phases' tab. 4.	 Expand the 'Link binary with Libraries' disclosure triangle. 5.	 Finally, use the + to add the library you want. You can also search if you can't find   the framework you are after from within the list.  If you are still confused how to go about adding the frameworks, follow the screenshot  below which highlights the areas that you need to select  surrounded by a red rectangle :   [ 120 ]   Chapter 4  Now that you have added the AVFoundation.framework into your project, you need to start  building your user interface which will be responsible for playing the audio:  1.	 From the Object Library, select and drag a  UIButton  Round Rect Button control   and add this to our view, resize accordingly and then modify the Object Attributes  section of the Round Rect Button and set its title to Play Audio.  2.	 From the Object Library, select and drag a second  UIButton  Round Rect Button  control and add this to our view, resize accordingly and then modify the Object  Attributes section of the Round Rect Button and set its title to Stop Audio.  If you have followed the steps correctly, your view should look something like the screenshot  below. If it doesn't look quite the same as mine, feel free to adjust yours:  As you can see, our form doesn't do much at this stage and if you were to run this application  in the simulator, you would see the controls as laid out on your screen. Our next step is to  start to add some code into our MusicPlayerViewController.h interface file so that we  can utilise the methods that the AVAudioPlayer class has to offer:  1.	 Open the MusicPlayerViewController.h interface file, located within the located within the   and insert the following lines of code below the UIKit import   Classes folder and insert the following lines of code below the statement: import   import    @interface MusicPlayerViewController : UIViewController {   AVAudioPlayer *player;  [ 121 ]   Working with the Xcode Frameworks  }  @end  @property nonatomic,retain  AVAudioPlayer *player;  What we have just declared in the code snippet above, is to make our View  Controller aware of what the AVAudioPlayer class header has to offer by exposing  all of its class methods.  2.	 Next, open the MusicPlayerViewController.m implementation file, located located   within the Classes folder, then add the following lines of code: add the following lines of code: import "MusicPlayerViewController.h" @implementation MusicPlayerViewController @synthesize player;         We then need to declare an instance variable  player  to our AVAudioPlayer class, and  create a property which will enable us to reference the instance variable  player  from within  our MusicPlayerViewController.m implementation file; this object provides us with a this object provides us with a  simplified approach to interact with this variable and use it throughout our implementation  file. You can probably think of this as a pointer variable to our AVAudioPlayer class which  we defined in our associated interface file.  In order for our buttons to work, we need to create the associated actions for each of these,  as well as writing the necessary code to perform those tasks. This section will show you   how to go about connecting your buttons to action events, with each performing the   task of playing or stopping audio playback. So let's get started:  1.	 We need to create an action event, select the Play Audio button, and hold down   the Ctrl key while you drag this into the MusicPlayerViewController.m  implementation file class as shown below:  2.	 Specify a name for the action that you want to create. Enter playAudio as the name   of the action.  [ 122 ]   3.	 Set the type of event to be Touch Up Inside:  Chapter 4  4.	 Click on the Connect button to have Xcode create the event. 5.	 Repeat steps 3 – 4 to create the action event for the stopAudio button. 6.	 Add the following code snippet to our playAudio function which will handle   playing our sample audio file: -  IBAction playAudio: id sender {         Get the file path to the song    NSString *filePath =[[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"mus ic"       ofType:@"mp3"];         Convert the file path to a URL   NSURL *fileUrl = [[NSURL alloc]initFileURLWithPath:filePath];        Initialize the AVAudioPlayer   self.player = [[AVAudioPlayer alloc] initWithContentsOfURL: fileUrl       error:nil];         Release the memory allocated to our objects     [filePath release];   [fileUrl release];         Play the audio file      [self.player play]; }  [ 123 ]   Working with the Xcode Frameworks  What we have just added to our playAudio function is that we have declared a  variable  NSString  filePath which will contain the file path to our audio file. Next we  create a  NSURL  fileUrl, which converts our file path to an object which is what the  AVAudioPlayer needs when it is being initialized. Next, we set up and initialise the  AVAudioPlayer, and assign this to our player object. Finally, we release the memory  allocated to our filePath and fileUrl objects and then play the audio.  7.	 Add the following code snippet to our stopAudio function which will handle   stopping our audio file playback: -  IBAction stopAudio: id sender {   [self.player stop];    }  In the above code snippet, we pass the stop method to our player object. By doing  this, it tells the AV Foundation framework and the AVAudioPlayer class to cease all  playback of audio.  The screenshot below shows our MusicPlayer application running on the iPhone Simulator:  [ 124 ]   Chapter 4  What just happened? As you can see, by using the AV Foundation Framework and the AVAudioPlayer class, you  can incorporate audio and sounds within your iPhone applications. Feel free to experiment  further with the AV Foundation Framework. There is a wealth of documentation out there  which can help you understand this framework and many others in greater depth than we  have covered within this section.  In the next section, we will be looking at how we go about playing a movie file using the  Media Player Framework.  Playing a movie using Media Player Playing videos is one of the most common tasks on the iPhone. On the iPhone, all videos  must be played full-screen. Before we can play any videos, we need to include the  MediaPlayer Framework in our application; you will notice that this is the same framework  that we used when we were playing our audio file. In the next section, we will be creating a  simple application to play a movie file, so let's get started.  Time for action – creating the MoviePlayer application Before we can proceed, we first need to create our MoviePlayer project. To refresh your To refresh your  memory, you can refer to the section which we covered in Chapter 2, Introducing the Xcode 4  Workspace under the section Creating your first iPhone application.  1.	 Launch Xcode from the  Xcode4 Applications folder. 2.	 Choose Create a new Xcode project, or File  New Project. 3.	 Select the View-based Application template from the list of available templates. 4.	 Select iPhone from under the Device Family dropdown. 5.	 Click on the Next button to proceed to the next step in the wizard. 6.	 Enter in MoviePlayer as the name for your project, and then click on the Next   button to proceed to the next step of the wizard.  7.	 Specify the location where you would like to save your project. 8.	 Click on the Save button to continue and display the Xcode workspace environment.  Now that we have created our MoviePlayer project, we need to add an important  framework to our project to enable our application with the ability to play movie files.  [ 125 ]   Working with the Xcode Frameworks  To add the Media Player Framework to your project, select the Project Navigator Group, and  then follow these simple steps as outlined below:  1.	 Select your Project. 2.	 Then select your project target from under the TARGETS group. 3.	 Select the 'Build Phases' tab. 4.	 Expand the 'Link binary with Libraries' disclosure triangle. 5.	 Finally, use the + to add the library you want. You can also search if you can't find   the framework you are after from within the list.  If you are still confused how to go about adding the frameworks, follow the screenshot  below which highlights the areas that you need to select  surrounded by a red rectangle :  Now that you have added the MediaPlayer.framework into your project, we need to start  building our user interface which will be responsible for playing the movie:   1.	 From the Object Library, select and drag a  UIButton  Round Rect Button control and   add this to our view.  2.	 Resize accordingly and then modify the Object Attributes section of the Round Rect   Button and set its title to Play Movie.  We don't need to add a stop button, as we will be adding an event which will handle this for  us when the movie has finished playing.  [ 126 ]   If you have followed the steps correctly, your view should look something like the screenshot  below. If it doesn't look quite the same as mine, feel free to adjust yours:  Chapter 4  As you can see, our form doesn't do much at this stage and if you were to run this application  in the simulator, you would see the controls as laid out on your screen  The following text will show you how to connect your buttons up to action events which will  each perform the task of playing the video. So let's get started:  1.	 We need to create an action event, select the Play Movie button, and hold down   the Ctrl key while you drag this into the MoviePlayerViewController.m  implementation file class as shown below:  2.	 Specify a name for the action that you want to create. Enter in playMovie as the   name of the action.  [ 127 ]   Working with the Xcode Frameworks  3.	 Set the type of event to be Touch Up Inside:  4.	 Click on the Connect button to have Xcode create the event.  We now need to add the code to our playMovie function which will handle playing our  sample movie file. Enter in the following code snippet to this function:  -  IBAction playMovie: id sender {   NSString *filepath = [[NSBundle mainBundle]       pathForResource:@"sample-movie" ofType:@"mp4"];   NSURL *fileURL = [NSURL fileURLWithPath:filepath];   MPMoviePlayerController *moviePlayerController =       [[MPMoviePlayerController alloc] initWithContentURL:fileURL];    [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter]addObserver:self       selector:@selector moviePlaybackComplete:        name:MPMoviePlayerPlaybackDidFinishNotification       object:moviePlayerController];    [self.view addSubview:moviePlayerController.view];   moviePlayerController.fullscreen=YES;   [moviePlayerController play]; }  What we have just added to our playMovie function is that we have declared a  variable  NSString  filePath which will contain the file path to our movie file. Next we  create a  NSURL  fileUrl which converts our file path to an object, which is what the  MPMoviePlayerController needs when it is being initialized.  We then add the MPMoviePlayerController view to our custom view controller so that  it will appear on the screen. We specify that we want to display this fullscreen, and finally we  tell the moviePlayerController to commence playback.  [ 12 ]   Chapter 4  Since we have allocated memory to our moviePlayerController object, at this stage  we haven't released it yet, this being due to not knowing when the movie playback will  actually finish. Fortunately, the MPMoviePlayerController object comes prebuilt  with methods to handle this scenario and will dispatch a notification method called  MPMoviePlayerPlaybackDidFinishNotification to the NSNotificationCenter  when the movie playback completes. This is shown in the highlighted code in the   above snippet.  When we play back video content within our iPhone applications, you will sometimes need  to modify the scalingMode property of the MPMoviePlayerController object. By  setting this property it will determine how the movie image adapts to fill the playback size  that you have defined. The following scaling modes currently exist and are displayed below:          MPMovieScalingModeNone MPMovieScalingModeAspectFit MPMovieScalingModeAspectFill MPMovieScalingModeFill  The two main common scaling modes used are the MPMovieScalingModeAspectFill  and MPMovieScalingModeFill.  In order to implement this property in your application, insert the following line of code just  before the [moviePlayerController play] statement:  moviePlayerController.scalingMode = MPMovieScalingModeFill;  When you run your application, you will notice that the video fills the entire available space.  Next, we need to create the moviePlaybackComplete: method which will be   responsible for releasing our moviePlayerController object. This is shown in   the code snippet below:  -  void moviePlaybackComplete: NSNotification * notification {   MPMoviePlayerController *moviePlayerController = [notification       object];   [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter]removeObserver:self       name:MPMoviePlayerPlaybackDidFinishNotification       object:moviePlayerController];   [moviePlayerController.view removeFromSuperview];   [moviePlayerController release]; }  [ 12 ]   Working with the Xcode Frameworks  In the above code snippet, we pass the object to the notification method. This is whatever  we have passed in the previous code snippet, this being the moviePlayerController  object. We start by retrieving the object using the [notification object] statement and then  reference it with the new MPMoviePlayerController pointer.  We then send a message back to the NSNotificationCenter method which removes the  observer we previously registered within our playMovie function. We finally proceed with  cleaning up our custom view controller from our display, and then release the memory we  previously allocated to our moviePlayerController object.  The screenshot below shows our MoviePlayer application running on the iPhone Simulator  with movie playback in portrait mode; support is available to display this in landscape mode:  What just happened? In this section, we learned about the MediaPlayer framework, and how we can use this  within our applications to give us the ability to play audio and video. We learned about   the various scaling modes for video playback and how to implement these.  [ 130 ]   Chapter 4  So there you have it. As you can see, by using the Media Player Framework and the  MPMoviePlayerController class, you can incorporate movie playback within your   iPhone applications.  Core Location Framework Your iPhone comes built with the GPS  Global Positioning System  hardware as well as   some location and mapping software which shows you where you are at any given time   by using the built-in GPS receiver as well as information from cellular towers to derive   this information.  So, what is the Core Location Framework? It can be defined as a framework which adds  location awareness to your iPhone applications and makes use of the following events:  DESCRIPTION  METHOD NAME CLLocationManager A class which provides you with the mechanisms by which location  information gets delivered to your application. A single instance of  this class needs to be created, then optionally set some accuracy  properties, and then call the startUpdatingLocation method. Handles the events which are generated by the delegate methods  located within your CLLocationManager instance. The  CLLocationn object not only encapsulates the geographical  coordinates, but also captures the underlying information, such as  speed, altitude and direction, as well as various other properties.s.  CLLocation  The Core Location Framework can use any of the following technologies: GPS,  Cellular network, or Wi-Fi. If GPS is present, it is used first by the framework.  However, if the device does not support GPS, or if an error occurred while  obtaining the current location via GPS, the framework will use your Cell phone's  network, and then use Wi-Fi.  Time for action – making your application location aware Before we can proceed, we first need to create our CoreLocation project. To refresh your To refresh your  memory, you can refer to the section which we covered in Chapter 2, Introducing the Xcode 4  Workspace under the section Creating your first iPhone application:  1.	 Launch Xcode from the  Xcode4 Applications folder. 2.	 Choose Create a new Xcode project, or File  New Project. 3.	 Select the View-based Application template from the list of available templates.  [ 131 ]   Working with the Xcode Frameworks  4.	 Select iPhone from under the Device Family dropdown, as the type of view    5.	 Click on the Next button to proceed to the next step in the wizard. 6.	 Enter in CoreLocation and then click on the Next button to proceed to the next step   to create.  of the wizard.  7.	 Specify the location where you would like to save your project. 8.	 Click on the Save button to continue and display the Xcode workspace environment.  Now that we have created our CoreLocation project, we need to add an important  framework to our project to give our application the ability to provide location information.  To add the CoreLocation Framework to your project, select the Project Navigator Group and  then follow these simple steps as outlined below:  1.	 Select your Project. 2.	 Then select your project target from under the TARGETS group. 3.	 Select the 'Build Phases' tab. 4.	 Expand the 'Link Library with Libraries' disclosure triangle. 5.	 Use the + to add the library that you want. You can also search if you can't find the   framework you are after from within the list.  If you are still confused about how to add the frameworks, follow the screenshot below  which highlights the areas that you need to select  surrounded by a red rectangle :  [ 132 ]   Now that we have added the CoreLocation.framework into your project, we need to add the  code which will be responsible for displaying our location information.  In order to make our application location-aware, we need to import the <CoreLocation  CoreLocation.h> interface file and implement the CLLocationManagerDelegate  protocol declaration and create an instance variable to point to our location manager object:  Chapter 4  1.	 Open the CoreLocationViewController.h interface file, located within the located within the  Classes folder and then add the following code as shown in the snippet below: and then add the following code as shown in the snippet below: then add the following code as shown in the snippet below: add the following code as shown in the snippet below: import   @interface CoreLocationViewController : UIViewController       {   CLLocationManager *locationManager; }  In the above code snippet, we included a reference to the CoreLocation.h  interface library; we then created a delegate method of the CLLocationManager  method and then declared a variable which will hold the location to our  CLLocationManager object. We haven't quite finished yet. What we now need to do is modify our  ViewDidLoad method located within our CoreLocationViewController.m  implementation file.  2.	 Open the CoreLocationViewController.m implementation file located within located within  locate and uncomment the ViewDidLoad method, and   the Classes folder, then locate and uncomment the then add the following code as shown in the snippet below: -  void viewDidLoad {   [super viewDidLoad];   locationManager = [[CLLocationManager alloc] init];   locationManager.delegate = self;   [locationManager startUpdatingLocation];     }  In the above code snippet, what we have done is initialize and allocate  memory to our location manager object which we declared within our  CoreLocationViewController.h file. We then set up the delegate method to  be the current View Controller object, and then we tell the location manager to start  sending location event information.  [ 133 ]   Working with the Xcode Frameworks  What we have been doing so far is setting up our application to be location-aware,  but currently we still don't have any way of dealing with the information that the  location manager is sending back. Our next step is to implement two delegate methods  of the CLLocationManager object. The first one we will be implementing is the  locationManager:didUpdateToLocation method which is called whenever the  location manager updates to a new location. The location manager passes the previous  location and the new location, unless this is the first time, hence resulting in the  fromLocation being nil.  The second method which we will implement will be the didFailWithError. This method  captures any errors which have occurred within the location manager when trying to retrieve  a location value, in which case we will want to stop our location manager and make a call to  the stopUpdatingLocation method in order to conserve battery power on the device.  In order to determine the current location, we need to write the code for it. Follow these  steps to implement the didUpdateToLocation method:  1.	 Open the CoreLocationViewController.m implementation file located within located within   the Classes folder.  2.	 Add the following code as shown in the code snippet directly under the   viewDidLoad method: - void locationManager: CLLocationManager * manager     didUpdateToLocation: CLLocation * newLocation     fromLocation: CLLocation * oldLocation     {   NSLog @"Location found at the following coordinates:       %@",newLocation.description ;   [locationManager stopUpdatingLocation]; }  In the above code snippet: what this is doing is obtaining the current location  from the CLLocationManager delegate and updating the newLocation  and oldLocation values. We then use the description method of the  newLocation object to extract and display the coordinates to the debug window  using the NSLog function.  In this final section, we will implement the code to handle errors when the  CLLocationManager is unable to retrieve location information. We use the error property  which contains the information sent back from the CLLocationManager object and then  we call the stopUpdatingLocation method of our location manager object:  1.	 Open the CoreLocationViewController.m file, located within the    Classes folder.  [ 134 ]   Chapter 4  2.	 Add the following code snippet directly underneath the didUpdateToLocation   function: - void locationManager: CLLocationManager * manager     didFailWithError: NSError * error {   NSLog @"An error has occurred, error details are: %@", error ;   [locationManager stopUpdatingLocation]; }  In the above code snippet, when an error occurs and the CLLocationManager fails  to bring back location information for whatever reason, we need to stop this event  by calling the stopUpdatingLocation method which ceases further updates.  What just happened? In this section, we learned how we can use the Core Location Framework to incorporate  GPS-like functionality within our applications. We looked at how we can use the  CLLocationManager method to handle and provide updates to our current whereabouts,  as well as the didUpdateToLocation and didFailWithError method to determine  whether the location manager updated to a new location and what to do when we  experienced an error, such as connection lost or unable to retrieve the current location.  Map Kit Framework—new and improved Mapping applications can now include overlays that can identify regions on a map and  also allow you to draw routes with annotations for customized directions and other  functionalities.  Before we proceed with the next section, it is worth giving you an understanding of what  the MapKit mapping framework is; this framework is based on the Google Maps engine and  gives you the ability to add interactive maps to your applications. By adding this functionality,  it gives you the flexibility of scrolling and zooming Maps to any region within the world. Place  Holders  or annotations  can be added to the map to display additional information.  In the next section, we will be creating a map-based application making use of the Core  Location and Map Kit Frameworks, so let's get started.  [ 135 ]   Working with the Xcode Frameworks  Time for action – creating a simple geographical application Before we can proceed, we first need to create our MapKit project. To refresh your memory, To refresh your memory,  you can refer to the section which we covered in Chapter 2, Introducing the Xcode 4  Workspace under the section Creating your first iPhone application:  1.	 Launch Xcode from the  Xcode4 Applications folder. 2.	 Choose Create a new Xcode project, or File  New Project. 3.	 Select the View-based Application template from the list of available templates. 4.	 Select iPhone from under the Device Family dropdown. 5.	 Click on the Next button to proceed to the next step in the wizard. 6.	 Enter in MapKitSample and then click on the Next button to proceed to the next   step of the wizard.  7.	 Specify the location where you would like to save your project. 8.	 Click on the Save button to continue and display the Xcode workspace environment.  Now that we have created our MapKitSample project, we need to add an important  framework to our project to enable our application to have the ability to view map  information.  To add the MapKit Framework to your project, select the Project Navigator Group and then  follow these simple steps as outlined below:  1.	 Select your Project. 2.	 Then select your project target from under the TARGETS group. 3.	 Select the 'Build Phases' tab. 4.	 Expand the 'Link Library with Libraries' disclosure triangle. 5.	 Use the + to add the library that you want. You can also search if you can't find the   framework you are after from within the list.  [ 136 ]   If you are still confused about how to  add the frameworks, follow the screenshot below  which highlights the areas that you need to select  surrounded by a red rectangle :  Chapter 4  Now that you have added the MapKit.framework into your project, we need to import   the code into the View Controller which will be responsible for displaying our map   location information.  In order to make our application display the map to our view, we will need to import the    interface header file, so that we can utilise its methods:  1.	 Open the MapKitSampleViewController.h interface file, located within the located within the   Classes folder, then add the following code as shown in the snippet below: add the following code as shown in the snippet below: import   import    @interface MapKitSampleViewController : UIViewController {   MKMapView *mapView; }  In the above code snippet, we have included a reference to the Cocoa MapKit.h   header file which will expose its methods so that we can use these within our  MapKitSample implementation file. Then we have created an instance variable   mapView  which is a pointer to our MKMapView object which is responsible for  holding our Map location information.  [ 137 ]   Working with the Xcode Frameworks  2.	 We haven't quite finished yet. What we now need to do is modify our ViewDidLoad   method located within our MapKitSampleViewController.m implementation  file. Open the MapKitSampleViewController.m implementation file. Locate and uncomment the ViewDidLoad method. Add the following code as  shown in the snippet below: -  void viewDidLoad {   [super viewDidLoad];   mapView = [[MKMapView alloc] initWithFrame:[self.view bounds]];   [self.view addSubview:mapView]; }  In the above code snippet, what we have actually done is initialize and  allocate memory for our mapView object which we declared within our  MapKitSampleViewController.h file, and then we add our mapView   object to our current view so that we can display on the screen.  If you were to Build and Run your application now, you will see a map displayed within the  iOS Simulator. You have the ability to navigate around the map and zoom in and out.  The mapKit framework has the ability to show you your current location within the map. It  also allows you to set a variety of mapTypes. We will be adding some additional code to our  ViewDidLoad method which is located within our MapKitSampleViewController.m  implementation file:  1.	 Open the MapKitSampleViewController.m implementation file, located within  located within   the Classes folder.  2.	 Locate the ViewDidLoad method and then add the following highlighted code as   shown in the snippet below: -  void viewDidLoad {   [super viewDidLoad];   mapView = [[MKMapView alloc] initWithFrame:[self.view bounds]];   mapView.mapType = MKMapTypeHybrid;   mapView.showsUserLocation = YES;   [self.view addSubview:mapView]; }  In the above code snippet, what we have added is the ability to display our map in  Hybrid view  combination of satellite view and road information  as well as telling  our map to display our current location which will be indicated by an animated   blue marker.  [ 13 ]   Chapter 4  The iOS native Maps application allows you to choose from these three possible Map Types  which are explained below:  MAP TYPE CONSTANT MKMapTypeStandard  MKMapTypeSatellite MKMapTypeHybrid  DESCRIPTION This is the default type of map to display if none is specified and this  type will show a normal map containing street and road names.  Setting this type of map will display Satellite view information. This type of map will show a combination of a Satellite view with  road and street information overlaid.   We have finally made it. If you Build and Run your application; you should now see a map  displayed with the animated blue marker flashing. I have zoomed in at a random location to  show the capabilities of the MapKit Framework which are shown in the screenshot below:  [ 13 ]   Working with the Xcode Frameworks  When running MapKit applications using the iPhone Simulator, it will always  default to Apple's Headquarters which is located at 1, Infinite Loop based out  at California. In order to get a better location, it is better to use your iOS device  because the iOS simulator on the Mac OS X Snow Leopard can geocode your IP  address and get the approximate location.  What just happened? In this section, we looked at the two powerful frameworks, Core Location and MapKit. As we  saw in our example application, these two frameworks as often used together to deliver the  functionality of a location-aware iPhone application.  We use the location manager to receive updates on the user's location, and showed a   map using the satellite view. So as you can see, you can do some pretty neat stuff with   Core Location.  New Framework APIs  The iOS 4 SDK comes equipped with several new framework APIs. We will be describing what  each of these fantastic new additions to the iOS SDK consist of below:          Quick Look: Just like Mail can preview documents, Quick Look will allow developers  to present the same functionality in their apps. Calendar Access: The new Calendar Access API includes a new way for your  application to create and edit events directly from within the calendar application,  by using the Event Kit Framework. This allows you to create recurring events, set up  start and end times, and then assign them to any calendar on the device. In-App SMS: The in-App SMS API allows a way for developers to include the  functionality of sending SMS messages, directly from within their application.  Although this feature supports sending of messages to multiple numbers, it does not  include the ability to handle replying to SMS messages and does not include support  for sending MMS messages. Photo Library Access: With the Photo Library Access API, your iOS applications   now have the ability to directly access user photos and videos by using the Media  Library APIs.  [ 140 ]   Chapter 4  Have a go hero – modifying the Core Data example Now you have a good working knowledge of Core Data and how to go about adding   entities to a database application. The task will be to modify the database model, add   some form fields and create some entities to allow data to be written and retrieved from   a SQLite database:  1.  Create two additional entities—Job Title and Country and set their type to String.  You can refer to the section Building a simple database application located in this  chapter. Remember to save your project after you have added these attributes.  2.  Next, create two labels for the two entities above and modify their captions   appropriately.  3.  Next, create the text fields and outlets for the two entities that you created in the   first step prior to creating the synthesize methods for each of them.  4.  Next, modify the saveData method to save the data entered in the two fields. 5.  Modify the searchData method to retrieve the data and display the contents to   those two new entities.  6.  You will need to modify the viewDidUnload method to release the memory used   by those two entities and then release the memory to those objects within the  dealloc method.  7.  Once you are satisfied that everything has been completed, you can Compile and   then Build and Run the application.  Once you have implemented the above, you will have a fully customized application which  will be able to save and retrieve data for the newly created fields.

We then took a look into each of the new   APIs and improvements that have been added to the iOS 4 SDK.  Now that we've learned about each of the frameworks that come as part of the iOS4 SDK,  and having used some of these frameworks to create sample projects to play audio and  movies and GPS location services, we are ready to start focussing on what comprises   the Model-View-Controller Application design pattern and its relation to Xcode and   Interface Builder.  In the next chapter, we will take a look into the MVC Frameworks and gain a better  understanding of the MVC design pattern structure, and how both Xcode and Interface  Builder are used to implement MVC when creating views.  [ 142 ]   5  Designing Application   Interfaces using MVC  In this chapter, we will learn about the Model-View-Controller  MVC  and how  we can use this technology to build applications using Interface Builder. We  will look at each of the components involved in MVC, and why this technology  is a better alternative to the way you program, by keeping your program logic  separate from your user interface.  In this chapter, we will:            Understand the Model-View-Controller  MVC  design pattern structure and how pattern structure and how  structure and how  Xcode and Interface Builder implement MVC. Learn how to use the View-Based  Application Template. Understand what Table-Views are and how to go about creating a simple application. Understand what Navigation-based Applications and Rotatable and Resizable Applications and Rotatable and Resizable  and Rotatable and Resizable  Interfaces are and how to go about Repositioning controls within the View   on Rotation. Learn how to use Switches, Sliders, Segmented Controls, Scrolling Views, Web Views, Controls, Scrolling Views, Web Views, , Scrolling Views, Web Views,  Pickers, Date Pickers, and how to implement Custom Pickers. Learn how to handle basic user Input Output using TextFields, TextViews,   and Buttons.  We have got quite a bit to cover, so let's get started.   Designing Application Interfaces using MVC  Developing iOS applications using MVC design  To begin this chapter, we will start by explaining "what a Design Pattern" is. This will help   you understand how this interacts with MVC and then go into the various layers of what  makes up the Model-View-Controller and why this pattern was chosen when developing   iOS applications.  Reusing tested  or standard  solutions: Design patterns So what is a Design Pattern? A Design Pattern is basically something that offers a solution  to a problem by providing a set of general, reusable, and tested solutions pertaining to  common programming scenarios. Some examples of design patterns are the MVC Controller,  and Delegates which you have no doubt used in previous chapters when creating View-Based  or Window-Based applications.  Design patterns are used extensively throughout the iOS Frameworks, so if you create an  iPhone application, there is no doubt you will be using these in some way.  Understanding the Model-View-Controller design pattern Model-View-Controller  MVC  Pattern separates an applications data structure into three  separate parts, the Model, the View, and the Controller as shown in the following figure:  [ 144 ]   Chapter 5  The table below describes each of the components that make up and are part of the   MVC model:  MVC TYPE Model  View  DESCRIPTION The model provides the underlying data and methods that provide information to  the rest of the application. This view can consist of and is made up of one or more views, which contain different  types of objects, Buttons, Switches, Text Fields, and so on that a user can interact  with. This is basically defined as your user interface which the user will see.  Controller This part is the most important part which handles the interaction between different   types of objects. It handles receiving of user input and then determines how to  handle this accordingly. A Controller has the ability to access and update a view using  information from the model, that is, updating some text of a field.  So as you can see, by using the MVC design approach, you can break your application into  these three parts: the Model, the View, and the Controller. By using MVC, it forces you to  program in a more structured approach and allows you to even reuse code and the same  model design across multiple applications which use different views and controllers.  In the next section, we will take a look at how Xcode and Interface Builder  IB  implement  and use the Model-View-Controller.  Implementing MVC using Xcode and Interface Builder  In the previous chapters, you learned about Xcode and how to use Interface Builder. You  have also learned how to connect the objects in the XIB file to the code in an application via  the use of Outlets  IBOutlets  and Actions  IBActions  and what we were actually doing  was binding a view to a controller.  In the following section, we will take a look at what a View is and what a Controller is by  building a simple Pizza Ordering application that will allow the user to make a series of  choices from the menu and then calculate the total cost.  Time for action – building a Pizza order application Before we can proceed and create our "PizzaOrders" project, to refresh your memory, you PizzaOrders" project, to refresh your memory, you " project, to refresh your memory, you to refresh your memory, you  can refer to the section Creating your first iPhone application which we covered in Chapter 2,  Introducing the Xcode 4 Workspace:  1.  Launch Xcode from the  Xcode4 Applications folder. 2.  Choose Create a new Xcode project, or File  New Project. 3.  Select the View-based Application template from the list of available templates.  [ 145 ]   Designing Application Interfaces using MVC  4.  Select iPhone from under the Device Family drop-down. 5.  Specify the location where you would like to save your project. 6.  Click on the Save button to continue and display the Xcode workspace environment. 7.  Specify the location where you would like to save your project. 8.  Click on the Save button to continue and display the Xcode workspace environment.  Once your project has been created, you will be presented with the Xcode interface along  with all files that the project template created for you displayed within the Project Navigator  window pane.  In this section, we will start to add the components required to build our application user  interface. To refresh your memory, you can refer to the section Adding Controls to your User  Interface which we covered in Chapter 3, Working with the Interface Builder:  1.  From the Object Library, select and drag a  UILabel  control to the view and   position the control at the top of our view. We will need to click on the Object  Attributes tab and label our control Choose your Pizza Toppings by setting the  text property under the Label section. Resize the control accordingly so that all   of the text is displayed.  2.  From the Object Library, select and drag a  UILabel  control to the view and   position the control underneath the heading which we just created and added. We  will need to click on the Object Attributes tab and label our control Tomato by  setting the text property under the Label section. Resize the control accordingly  so that all of the text is displayed.  3.  Next, we will need to add a  UISwitch  Switch control which will be used to   determine whether we want to add Tomatoes to our Pizza or not. From the Object  Library, select and drag a UISwitch control and place it directly beside the label  control which we created in the previous step.  4.  Repeat steps 10 through 11 to add the remaining UILabel and UISwitch controls   for the following: Onion, Capsicum, Olives, Salami, Mozzarella Cheese, Thin Crust, Thick Crust,   Cheese Filled.  5.  Next, add a  UIButton  Round Rect Button control to our view. Modify the Object  Attributes of the Round Rect Button control and set its title to read Calculate.  6.  Our final step is to add a  UITextField  control which will be used to display   the total price of your Pizza. From the Object Library, select and drag a  UITextField control and place it to the right of the Calculate button which   we created in the previous step.  [ 146 ]   If you have followed the steps correctly, you view should look something like the screenshot  below. If it doesn't look quite the same, feel free to adjust yours:  Chapter 5  What just happened? In this section, we created a simple Pizza Ordering application to handle pizza topping  selections provided by the user and then calculate the purchase price. We looked at how  to go about adding a number of UILabel controls which will be used to display each  of the available pizza toppings to choose from, and a UISwitch control to show which  toppings have been selected. We then added a UITextField control which will be used to  display the total cost of your pizza selections. Finally we added a UIButton control which  will handle the processing to display the total purchase price for your pizza, based on the  toppings selected.  Time for action – binding our Controls using Outlets and Actions Our final step will be to bind our control objects to our View Controller and connecting  these via outlets and actions. We covered this in the section Making our Components work  together in Chapter 3, Introducing Interface Builder.  1.  Once you have created your outlets within the PizzaOrdersViewController.h  interface file, it should look something like this. What we are doing here is basically  letting our View Controller know what controls we will be dealing with: import    @interface PizzaOrdersViewController : UIViewController {  [ 147 ]   Designing Application Interfaces using MVC    IBOutlet UISwitch *toppingTomato;   IBOutlet UISwitch *toppingOnion;   IBOutlet UISwitch *toppingCapsicum;   IBOutlet UISwitch *toppingOlives;   IBOutlet UISwitch *toppingSalami;   IBOutlet UISwitch *toppingMozarella;   IBOutlet UISwitch *crustThin;   IBOutlet UISwitch *crustThick;   IBOutlet UISwitch *crustCheeseFilled;   IBOutlet UITextField *TotalPayment;   IBOutlet UIButton *Calculate; }  @property  nonatomic, retain  IBOutlet UISwitch *toppingTomato; @property  nonatomic, retain  IBOutlet UISwitch *toppingOnion; @property  nonatomic, retain  IBOutlet UISwitch *toppingCapsicum; @property  nonatomic, retain  IBOutlet UISwitch *toppingOlives; @property  nonatomic, retain  IBOutlet UISwitch *toppingSalami; @property  nonatomic, retain  IBOutlet UISwitch *toppingMozarella; @property  nonatomic, retain  IBOutlet UISwitch *crustThin; @property  nonatomic, retain  IBOutlet UISwitch *crustThick; @property  nonatomic, retain  IBOutlet UISwitch  *crustCheeseFilled;  @property  nonatomic, retain  IBOutlet UITextField *TotalPayment; @property  nonatomic, retain  IBOutlet UIButton *Calculate;  @end  2.  Our next step is to create the action event in our PizzaOrdersViewController. m implementation file. But we first need to synthesize our properties so that we can  use then within our view controller.  If we don't declare these, we will receive warning messages  which could result in unexpected results occurring in your  application. It is also good to declare these as we are able  to deallocate the memory used by these objects in our  dealloc method.  import "PizzaOrdersViewController.h"  @implementation PizzaOrdersViewController  [ 14 ]   Chapter 5  @synthesize Calculate; @synthesize TotalPayment; @synthesize toppingTomato,toppingOnion,toppingCapsicum,toppingOliv es,    toppingSalami,toppingMozarella,crustThin,crustThick,    crustCheeseFilled;  3.  Next, we declare our  IBAction  calculatePurchase method which will be method which will be  responsible for displaying the total amount that the user needs to pay for their  customized Pizza selection: -  IBAction calculatePurchase: id sender {    Declare and initialise each of our pizza toppings and base  types.   float totalAmount = 0.00;   float tomatoAmount = 0.00;   float onionAmount = 0.00;   float capsicumAmount = 0.00;   float oliveAmount = 0.00;   float salamiAmount = 0.00;   float mozarellaAmount = 0.00;   float thinCrustAmount = 0.00;   float thickCrustAmount = 0.00;   float cheeseCrustAmount = 0.00;         Handle each of our topping selections         Check to see if we have chosen to include Tomatoes on our  Pizza    if  [toppingTomato isOn] {     tomatoAmount = 0.50;    }   else { tomatoAmount = 0; }         Check to see if we have chosen to include Onions on our Pizza    if  [toppingOnion isOn] {     onionAmount = 0.80;   }   else { onionAmount = 0; }         Check to see if we have chosen to include Capsicum on our  Pizza    if  [toppingCapsicum isOn] {     capsicumAmount = 0.80;   }   else { capsicumAmount = 0; }      Check to see if we have chosen to include Olives on our Pizza    if  [toppingOlives isOn] {  [ 14 ]   Designing Application Interfaces using MVC      oliveAmount = 0.80;   }   else { oliveAmount = 0; }         Check to see if we have chosen to include Salami on our Pizza    if  [toppingSalami isOn] {     salamiAmount = 0.80;   }   else { salamiAmount = 0; }         Check to see if we have chosen to include Mozarella on our  Pizza    if  [toppingMozarella isOn] {     mozarellaAmount = 0.80;   }   else { mozarellaAmount = 0; }         Check to see if we have specified to have a Thin Crust Pizza.   if  [crustThin isOn] {     thinCrustAmount = 2.00;   }   else { thinCrustAmount = 0; }         Check to see if we have specified to have a Thick Crust  Pizza.   if  [crustThick isOn] {     thickCrustAmount = 2.50;   }   else { thickCrustAmount = 0; }         Check to see if we have specified to have a Cheese Filled  Crust       Pizza.   if  [crustCheeseFilled isOn] {     cheeseCrustAmount = 3.00;   }   else { cheeseCrustAmount = 0; }         Calculate our total amount based on what has been chosen   totalAmount =  tomatoAmount + onionAmount +       capsicumAmount+oliveAmount +      salamiAmount + mozarellaAmount + thinCrustAmount +         thickCrustAmount + cheeseCrustAmount ;         Output the total amount to the screen.   TotalPayment.text = [[NSString alloc]       initWithFormat:@"%5.2f",totalAmount]; }  [ 150 ]   Chapter 5  4.  OOur final step is to release the memory used by our view control objects which we  have declared. Xcode 4 creates these for you automatically when you declare the  outlets in your PizzaOrdersViewController.h interface file: -  void dealloc {   [toppingTomato release];   [toppingOnion release];   [toppingCapsicum release];   [toppingOlives release];   [toppingSalami release];   [toppingMozarella release];   [crustThin release];   [crustThick release];   [crustCheeseFilled release];   [TotalPayment release];   [Calculate release];   [super dealloc]; }   The screenshot below shows our Pizza Orders application running within the iOS simulator  with the output displaying the user's chosen Pizza selections:  [ 151 ]   Designing Application Interfaces using MVC  What just happened? In this section, we added the program logic to our Pizza Ordering application to calculate  and display the total cost of the pizza based on the selections made by the user. When the  Calculate button is pressed, a call is made to the calculatePurchase method which we  created within our PizzaOrdersViewController.m implementation file. This method  determines what options have been chosen, and then calculates the cost for each chosen  topping and crust size before finally displaying the total cost of your customized pizza out   to the UITextField control.  Implementing views What are views comprised of? Views can be made up of one or more views, and these can  also be created programmatically to be added as a sub-view. They can also contain different  types of user interaction objects like Buttons, Switches, Text Fields, and so on. When views  are loaded at runtime, they can create any number of objects, and even implement a basic  level of interactivity on their own, for example, displaying a virtual keyboard when the user  clicks on a text area field control. Views are entirely independent of any application logic.   By using this separation, it conforms to the core principles of the MVC design approach.  Implementing view controllers View Controllers handle the interactions within a view and also establish the connection  points for outlets and actions by using the IBOutlet and IBAction directives. These  directives get added to your project's implementation file code. These directives will also  need to be added to the headers of your view controller.  An outlet  IBOutlet  is basically a variable by which an object can be referenced. An  example of this could be that you have created a field in your view to collect the user's name  or e-mail address and you have created an outlet for this in your code called userName.  By using this outlet, you are able to access or change the contents of this field. Before you  are able to use this field, a reference to this would need to be declared in the View Controller  header file as follows:  IBOutlet UITextField *userName;  By declaring this reference, it allows you to use Interface Builder to visually connect the  Views Text Field objects to the userName variable, so that your code can fully interact with  the TextField object by changing its properties, calling its methods, and so on.  [ 152 ]   Chapter 5  Before you can access the property of the username field, you will need to use the two  important Objective-C @Property and @Synthesize directives which we need to declare   in our code:  DIRECTIVE @Property  @Synthesize  DESCRIPTION Declares elements in a class that should be exposed via the getters and setters.  Properties are defined with a series of attributes, these being the more frequent  nonatomic and retain methods. Creates simplified getters and setters, making retrieving and setting values of an  object very simple.  Getters and Setters use a method called an accessor. An accessor is a method for getting or  setting the value of an instance variable. An accessor that gets the instance variable's value is  called a getter; an accessor that sets the instance variable's value is called a setter. A setter's  name should start with set and be followed by a capitalized version of the instance variable's  name. If the instance variable is named myVar, the setter should be named setMyVar. The  setter should take one parameter: the new value to be assigned to the instance variable.  A getter should have the same name as the instance variable. If the instance variable   is named myVar, the getter should be named myVar.  This will not cause you or the   compiler any confusion, because variable names and method names are used in   completely different contexts.   An action  IBAction  on the other hand is basically a method defined within your code that  is called when an event takes place. Objects such as Buttons and Switches can trigger actions  when a user interacts with an event, such as touching objects on the screen:  - IBAction displayName: id sender {   NSString *Welcome = [[NSString alloc] initWithFormat:@"Hello       %@",userName.text];   lblOutput.text = Welcome;   lblOutput.textColor = [UIColor blueColor]; }  You will notice that our function declaration contains a sender parameter with the type  declared as id. We describe these in the table below:  DIRECTIVE Sender  id  DESCRIPTION This is basically a generic type of object that is used when we don't know the type of  object that we will be working with. This enables you to write code that does not tie itself to a specific type of class.  [ 153 ]   Designing Application Interfaces using MVC  Time for action – declaring input field as a property of View  Controller If we wanted to declare the userName instance of the UITextField, we would do it as follows:  1.  Declare it as a property in the header file of our View Controller as shown below:   2.  We will then need to use the @synthesize directive in the implementation file of our   @property  retain, nonatomic  NSString *userName;  View Controller class, to create the getters and setters as shown below: @synthesize userName;    3.  Once we have added these lines, we are then able to retrieve the value from our   userName text property by using: theUserName = userName.text;     4.  If we wanted to assign something to this object, we can do so as follows:    userName.text = @"Joe Bloggs";  What just happened? In this section, we looked at the steps required in declaring and using outlets to access or  change the contents of form fields within the view. We then looked at the two important  Objective-C directives: @property and @synthesize that need to be declared before   we are able to communicate with the form controls to retrieve or set their values.  In the next section, we will start to create a view-based application to ask the user for their  favourite color and then display this back to the user.  Creating a view-based application template   Whenever you create a View-based application project using Xcode, you will notice that it  contains and automatically creates a single view-controller for you.  In previous chapters, we have made use of this template many times, but you may not have  a clear understanding of the full inner workings under the hood. In the following section, we  will be diving into the details and take a look at how everything hangs together to make your  application work.  The project we will be creating will be a simple application that will present the user with a   UITextField  textbox for typing in some text and a  UIButton  button which will handle  the processing. We will also be including a  UILabel  label control which will be updated  based on the information the user enters into the textbox control.  [ 154 ]   Chapter 5  Time for Action – creating the FavoriteColor application Before we can proceed and create our FavoriteColor project, to refresh your memory, to refresh your memory,  you can refer to the section Creating your first iPhone application which we covered in  Chapter 2, Introducing the Xcode 4 Workspace:  1.  Launch Xcode from the  Xcode4 Applications folder. 2.  Choose Create a new Xcode project, or File  New Project. 3.  Select the View-based Application template from the list of available templates. 4.  Select iPhone from under the Device Family drop-down. 5.  Click on the Next button to proceed to the next step in the wizard. 6.  Enter in FavoriteColor and then click on the Next button to proceed to the next step   in the wizard.  7.  Specify the location where you would like to save your project. 8.  Click on the Save button to continue and display the Xcode workspace environment.  Once our project has been created, you will be presented with the Xcode interface along  with all files that the project template created for you displayed within the Project Navigator  window pane.  In this section, we will start to add the components required to build our application user  interface that will ask the user for their favourite color. To refresh your memory, you can  refer to the section Adding Controls to your User Interface which we covered in Chapter 3,  Working with the Interface Builder:  1.  From the Object Library, select and drag a  UILabel  control to the view and   position the control at the top within our view. We will need to click on the Object  Attributes tab and label our control What is your Favorite Color? by setting the  text property under the Label section. Resize the control accordingly so that all of  the text is displayed.  2.  Next, we will need to add a  UITextField  control which will accept the  information entered by the user. From the Object Library, select and drag a  UITextField control and place it directly under our label control which we   created in the previous step.  [ 155 ]   Designing Application Interfaces using MVC  3.  We now need to add another  UILabel  Label control which will be used to display  the user's favourite color when the button is pressed. From the Object Library, select  and drag a  UILabel  Label control and place this under the  UITextField   control which you created earlier on. We will need to click on the Object  Attributes tab and label our control Your Favorite Color is: Your Color by setting  the text property under the Label section. Resize the control accordingly so that  all of the text is displayed.  4.  Our final step is to add a  UIButton  Round Rect Button control to our view.  Modify the Object Attributes of the Round Rect Button control and set its  title to read Click to see your Color.  If you have followed the steps correctly, your view should look something like the screenshot  below. If it doesn't look quite the same, feel free to adjust yours:  What just happened? In this section, we looked at how to create a view-based application and add the controls  to our View Controller. We looked at how to go about adding a UILabel Control which will  be used to display our question, and a UITextField control which will accept the input.  We added another UILabel control which will display what the user entered, and finally a  UIButton control which will handle the processing to display a message back to the user,  Your Favorite Color is:, and their entered color.  Time for action – binding our Controls using Outlets and Actions Our final step will be to bind our control objects to our View Controller and connect these via  outlets and actions. We covered this in the section Making our Components work together in  Chapter 3, Working with the Interface Builder:  [ 156 ]   1.  Once you have created your outlets within your   FavoriteColorViewController.h interface file, it should look something like  this. What we are doing here is basically letting our View Controller be aware of  what controls we will be dealing with: import    Chapter 5  @interface FavoriteColorViewController : UIViewController {   UITextField *txtColor;   IBOutlet UILabel *lblColor; }  @property  nonatomic, retain  IBOutlet UITextField *txtColor;  @end  2.  Our next step is to create the action event in our   FavoriteColorViewController.m implementation file. But we first need to  synthesize our properties so that we can use them within our view controller.  If we don't declare these, we will receive warning  messages which could result in unexpected results  occurring in our application. It is also good to declare  these as we are able to deallocate the memory used by  these objects in our dealloc method.  import "FavoriteColorViewController.h"  @implementation FavoriteColorViewController @synthesize txtColor, lblColor;  3.  Next, we declare our  IBAction  ChosenColor method which will be responsible method which will be responsible   for displaying the user's chosen color. What we are doing here is declaring an  NSString object ChosenColor which contains a friendly message and the color  that was entered. We then assign this to the text property of our  UILabel  lblColor control. The  code snippet below shows the ChosenColor action event which will do just that: -  IBAction ChosenColor: id sender {   NSString *ChosenColor = [[NSString alloc] initWithFormat:@"Your       Favorite Color is %@",txtColor.text];   lblColor.text = ChosenColor; }  [ 157 ]   Designing Application Interfaces using MVC  4.  Our final step is to release the memory used by the view control objects which we  declared. Xcode 4 creates these for you automatically when you declare the outlets  in your FavoriteColorViewController.h interface file: -  void dealloc {   [txtColor release];   [lblColor release];   [super dealloc]; }   The screenshot below shows our Favorite color application running within the iOS simulator  with the output displaying the user's favorite color:  As you can see from the output shown above, we can create applications to communicate  with the user and respond to what has been entered.  What just happened? In this section, we looked at how we are able to bind our control objects to our view  controller using outlets and actions. We also added some code to our interface and  implementation files to build the application, and then declared an action event  ChosenColor. This method is responsible for displaying the user's chosen color. In our  final steps, we released the memory used by our view-controller objects via our dealloc  method. In the next section, we will look at how we can implement Table views when space  is a restriction within the view.  [ 15 ]   Chapter 5  Implementing Table Views Table Views make use of the UITableView class and are the main interface elements that  are used to display lists and hierarchical data on the iPhone. Some examples of where Table  Views are used on the iPhone are: the Settings, Clock, Contact, and Notes. These applications  all use Tables Views as their main interface element.  Table Views represent their data in rows and sections. A row is defined as an individual item  which is stored in the table view. Rows can be grouped into sections and each section can  contain both a header and footer.  Table view Controllers can be used to display data from a data source and can also be  configured to update the data when editing the table view.  Time for action – creating a Table view application Before we can proceed and create our TableViewExample project, to refresh your to refresh your  memory, you can refer to the section Creating your first iPhone Application which we  covered in Chapter 2, Introducing the Xcode 4 Workspace:  1.  Launch Xcode from the  Xcode4 Applications folder. 2.  Choose Create a new Xcode project, or File  New Project. 3.  Select the Navigation-based Application template from the list of available templates:  [ 15 ]   Designing Application Interfaces using MVC  4.  Select iPhone from under the Device Family drop-down. 5.  Specify the location where you would like to save your project. 6.  Click on the Save button to continue and display the Xcode workspace environment. 7.  Specify the location where you would like to save your project. 8.  Click on the Save button to continue and display the Xcode workspace environment.  Once our project has been created, you will be presented with the Xcode interface   along with all files that the project template created for you displayed within the Project  Navigator window pane. You will notice that the Wizard created the following files which   are described below:  COMPONENT NAME RootViewController.h  RootViewContoller.m  RootViewController.xib  DESCRIPTION Interface header file which inherits from the  UITableViewController object class and where  declaration of the variables is done. The implementation file which contains the methods  pertaining to how the Table View Control operates and  functions. This is the user interface file which contains the Table-View  Control added by default.  The screenshot below displays the default table view control that Xcode creates for you  when you create a Navigation-based application. The data is represented in rows, much like a  spreadsheet and they can be grouped under section headings. They also can contain footers  for each section:  We are now ready to start creating our sample application to add elements into our Table  View Controller. We need to create an instance variable which will be used to store our   table contents:  [ 160 ]   Chapter 5  1.  Open the RootViewController.h interface file, located within the Classes   folder of your project and add the following code declaration: import   @interface RootViewController : UITableViewController {   NSArray *arrVegetables; } @end  2.  Now that we have declared our arrVegetables array, we can start to add the   elements to it. Open the RootViewController.m implementation file, located  within the Classes folder of your project and locate the viewDidLoad method  and add the following code: -  void viewDidLoad {   [super viewDidLoad];   self.title = @"Vegetables";   arrVegetables=[[NSArray       alloc]initWithObjects:@"Celery",@"Capsicum",@"Potato",      @"Peas",@"Brocolli",@"Carrots",@"Cabbage",nil]; }  3.  We now need to edit the method tableView:numberOfRowsInSection to  inform the Table View, how many rows of data it will need to display. We do this  by returning the size of our vegetables array object, as shown in the code snippet  below: -  NSInteger tableView: UITableView * tableView     numberOfRowsInSection: NSInteger section {   return [arrVegetables count]; }  4.  Our next step is to update the tableView:cellForRowAtIndexPath method.  We only need to implement the writing of the cell contents as most of the code  is already done for us. All that we need to do is set the text for each cell using the  data from our array. We do this by looking at the current row within our Table View  and retrieve the array index location from our arrVegetables array by using the row  index of the cell:    Customize the appearance of table view cells. - UITableViewCell * tableView: UITableView * tableView     cellForRowAtIndexPath: NSIndexPath * indexPath{     static NSString *CellIdentifier = @"Cell";     UITableViewCell *cell = [tableView         dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier:CellIdentifier];        if  cell == nil {   cell=[[[UITableViewCell   [ 161 ]   Designing Application Interfaces using MVC      alloc]initWithStyle:UITableViewCellStyleDefault       reuseIdentifier:CellIdentifier]autorelease];   }      Configure our Table View Cell   cell.textLabel.text=[arrVegetables objectAtIndex:indexPath.row];   cell.textLabel.text = vegetables;   return cell; }  5.  We are now ready to build and compile our TableViewExample application.  The screenshot below shows our TableViewExample displaying a list of Vegetables  populated from our array to our Table View running within the iOS simulator:  What just happened? In this section, we created a table view navigation-based application to allow us to represent  our data in a list. We then created and initialized an array that was used to store the list of  vegetables that will be used as the datasource to populate the table view. Next, we used the  numberOfRowsInSection method of the tableView class to determine how many rows  would need to be displayed within the table by using the count property of the array. In our  last part, we called the cellForRowAtIndexPath method to update the table header and  then cycled through every item within our arrVegetables array and outputted this at   each row.  [ 162 ]   Grouping row items into sections Table Views also give us the ability to group rows into sections. So for our next example, we  will learn how this can be done. Grouping your rows into sections can be very useful when  displaying sets of information relating to a particular type. For example, if you want to group  country regions or breed of dogs, this can be very useful.  Chapter 5  Time for action – grouping row items in our TableViewExample  application In our example, we will be grouping our previous example of vegetables into two groups,  Organic and Non Organic:  1.  Open our previously created TableViewExample application. 2.  Open and modify the RootViewController.h interface file to include two   additional arrays which will be used to hold our Organic and Non Organic items.  Modify your RootViewController.h file as shown in the code snippet below: import    @interface RootViewController : UITableViewController {   NSArray *arrOrganic;   NSArray *arrNonOrganic; } @end  3.  Next, modify the RootViewController.m implementation file. We need to   update the viewDidLoad method to include the following code snippet as shown  below: -  void viewDidLoad {    [super viewDidLoad];      self.title = @"Vegetables";   arrOrganic=[[NSArray       alloc]initWithObjects:@"Celery",@"Capsicum",@"Brocolli",      @"Cabbage",nil];   arrNonOrganic=[[NSArray       alloc]initWithObjects:@"Potato",@"Peas",@"Carrots",nil]; }  [ 163 ]   Designing Application Interfaces using MVC  4.  Next, update the method tableView:numberOfRowsInSection to automatically   determine how many rows will be displayed within each section. We use the  switch statement and return the number of items in our array for each: -  NSInteger tableView: UITableView * tableView numberOfRowsInSect ion: NSInteger section {   switch  section    {     case 0:        return [arrOrganic count];       break;     case 1:       return [arrNonOrganic count];       break;     default:       return 0;       break;   } }  5.  We then need to update our cellForRowAtIndexPath method to use the    correct array when you are populating the table view cells. This is shown in the   code snippet below: -  UITableViewCell * tableView: UITableView * tableView cellForRow AtIndexPath: NSIndexPath * indexPath {      static NSString *CellIdentifier = @"Cell";   UITableViewCell *cell = [tableView       dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier:CellIdentifier];   if  cell == nil  {     cell = [[[UITableViewCell alloc]         initWithStyle:UITableViewCellStyleDefault         reuseIdentifier:CellIdentifier] autorelease];   }   NSString *vegetables;      switch  indexPath.section    {     case 0:       vegetables = [arrOrganic objectAtIndex:indexPath.row];       break;     case 1:       vegetables = [arrNonOrganic objectAtIndex:indexPath.row];  [ 164 ]   Chapter 5        break;   }      Configure the cell.   cell.textLabel.text=vegetables;   return cell; }  6.  In order to ensure that all of our sections are displayed in our Table View, we    need to update our numberOfSectionsInTableView method to ensure that it  returns the correct number of sections. Modify this method as shown in the code  snippet below:    Customize the number of sections in the table view. -  NSInteger numberOfSectionsInTableView: UITableView * tableView  {    return 2;    the number of sections our view contains }  7.  We now need to implement the titleForHeaderInSection method which will   be used to display the title text above each section: - NSString * tableView: UITableView * tableView     titleForHeaderInSection: NSInteger section {   switch  section    {     case 0:       return @"Organic";       break;     case 1:       return @"Non Organic";       break;     default:       return nil;       break;   } }  [ 165 ]   Designing Application Interfaces using MVC  8.  We are nearly there; we just need to update our style for our Table View control. We  can't modify this through code as this is a read-only property and prevents us from  doing so, so we need to modify this using Interface Builder. The screenshot below  shows how this can be done:  9.  The above screenshot shows the Object Attributes screen. In order to set our style  so that it displays our sections as groups, we need to set the Style property under  the Table View section to show Grouped and change the Separator to display as  Single Line.  10. We are now ready to Compile, Build and Run our modified TableViewExample   application.  The screenshot below shows our modified TableViewExample application running within  the iOS simulator and displaying a list of Vegetables populated from our array to our Table  View and broken down into the two separate sections of Organic and Non Organic using our  style which we applied to our Table View Control:  [ 166 ]   Chapter 5  What just happened? In the above section, we created two simple projects to write details to our Table View  control, and break the items up into groups. We first created two arrays which will be used  to hold our list of Organic and Non Organic vegetables. We then created an array for each  of our sections which will be displayed to our Table View control. Next, we needed to check  to see which section is being requested and then return the total number of rows to be  displayed within the section. We use the break statement to prevent the section from falling  through to the other parts within our switch statement. If we had excluded our break  statement from the first part, we would have returned the Non Organic array count.  As you can see, by adding some minimal code to the RootViewController.m  implementation file, we can create sophisticated applications that look professional   and are easy to use.  [ 167 ]   Designing Application Interfaces using MVC  Understanding Navigation-based applications Navigation-based applications  as you just saw in the previous section  are a great tool for  displaying information within lists and allowing the user to choose from the list. However,  you will find as you start creating your own applications that Tables are rarely used on their  own and are used in conjunction with a navigation controller to allow a user to drill down  through multiple views of data, with the ability to navigate back and forth.  You may have seen, or used some navigation applications on the iPhone. A good example  of where this is used is the Contacts application, where you can select from a group of  individuals, then drill down to a specific person, and then view personal information   about the person. There are also controllers which allow the user to navigate back to   the previous level:  The implementation of the Navigation controller is pretty simple as you saw when you created  the two TableViewExample applications. You are probably wondering What happens when  a new view is displayed? Well, the navigation controller does what is known as "push" its  view controller onto the stack. What this means is that a new instance of the controller is  instantiated and added to the stack, and then the previous controller gets pushed further  down the stack. A better visual representation which would help you understand this could   be to think of a stack as a set of plates being placed on top of each other.  [ 16 ]   Chapter 5  When the user decides it's time to return back to the previous screen, the navigation  controller "pops" the current view off the stack which results in this being unloaded. The  previous view controller then moves to the top of the stack and then this becomes active  again, hence allowing the user to navigate onto another item.  Using Switches, Sliders, Segmented Controls, and Web Views In the next section, we will be making use of the different types of controls available on the  iPhone. We will be creating a simple application which will utilise each of these types and  hopefully give you an insight into the power of each of these controls. But, first let us learn  about them:          Switches: Switches are used in most desktop applications and are often displayed  as something being "active" or "inactive" either by checking or unchecking a check  box, or by choosing from a list of radio buttons. On the iPhone, Apple provides you  with similar controls, the Switches and Segmented controls Switches  UISwitch   are represented as a simple ON OFF UI element, and return a Boolean value of TRUE   or FALSE. Sliders: Sliders  UISlider  are a convenient control used to visually display a  starting point within a range of values. You may have seen this control used within  the iPod player on the iPhone, where you can increase or decrease the audible  volume or move to a point within a song. Segmented Controls: Segmented  UISegmentedControl  controls present a  linear line of buttons and are sometimes referred to as button bars, with a single  button being active within the bar. These types of controls are frequently used to  switch between different views within an application; these could be anything from  configuration to a page of results.  If you wanted to determine the currently selected button within a segmented  control, this is done via the selectedSegmentIndex, which returns the number   of the button chosen  starting at 0 up to X . Web Views: Web Views  UIWebView  provide you with advanced features that allow  you to present HTML, load web pages, and also incorporate pinching and zooming  capabilities. Web Views offer support to display a wide range of file formats, as   listed below:            HTML and CSS Files Microsoft Word Documents Microsoft Excel Spreadsheets Apple's Keynote Presentations Apple's Numbers Spreadsheet  [ 16 ]   Designing Application Interfaces using MVC        Apple's Pages Documents PDF Files PowerPoint Presentations  These files can be added as a resource file to your project and then displayed within the   web view.  Time for action – creating the SwitchesSlidersSegments project Before you can proceed and create your SwitchesSlidersSegments project, to refresh  your memory, you can refer to the section Creating your first iPhone application which we  covered in Chapter 2, Introducing the Xcode 4 Workspace:  1.  Launch Xcode from the  Xcode4 Applications folder. 2.  Choose Create a new Xcode project, or File  New Project. 3.  Select the View-based Application template from the list of available templates. 4.  Select iPhone from under the Device Family drop-down. 5.  Specify the location where you would like to save your project. 6.  Click on the Save button to continue and display the Xcode workspace environment. 7.  Specify the location where you would like to save your project. 8.  Click on the Save button to continue and display the Xcode workspace environment.  Once our project has been created, you will be presented with the Xcode interface along  with all the files that the project template created for you displayed within the Project  Navigator window pane.  In this section, we will start to add the components required to build our application   user interface that will show how we can use switches, slider, and web view controls to  display a web page within our view. To refresh your memory, you can refer to the section  Adding Controls to your User Interface which we covered in Chapter 3, Working with the  Interface Builder:  1.  From the Object Library, select and drag a  UILabel  label control to the view  and position it at the top within our view. You will need to click on the Object  Attributes tab and label the control Choose your color below: by setting the  text property under the Label section. Resize the control accordingly so that   all of the text is displayed.  [ 170 ]   Chapter 5  2.  Next, from the Object Library, select and drag a  UISegmentedControl  control  and drag it to the view. From the Object Attributes tab, ensure that under the  view section, the Mode has been set to read Scale to Fill.  3.  Now we need to add another  UILabel  Label Control which will be used to   display the color chosen by our segmented control. From the Object Library, select  and drag a  UILabel  control and place this under our segmented control object.  Click on the Object Attributes tab and label the control You Chose: Color by  setting the text property under the Label section. Resize the control accordingly  so that all of the text is displayed.  4.  We now need to add our  UISwitch  Switch component to our view. From the   Object Library, select and drag a  UISwitch  control and place this under our You  Chose: Color label control object.  5.  Now we need to add another  UILabel  Label Control which will be used to   display the status of our switch object. From the Object Library, select and drag a   UILabel  control and place this under our UISwitch control object. Click on  the Object Attributes tab and label our control Switch is: Status by setting the  text property under the Label section. Resize the control accordingly so that all of  the text is displayed.  6.  Our next step is to add a  UISlider  slider control which will be responsible for  displaying the current value of our slider out to our label control. From the Object  Library, select and drag a  UISlider  control and place this directly under our  Switch is: Status label control object.  7.  We now need to add a  UILabel  Label control which will be used to display the  value of where our slider object is up to. From the Object Library, select and drag a   UILabel  control and place this under our UISlider control object. Click on the  Object Attributes tab and label our control Slider value: SliderValue by setting  the text property under the Label section. Resize the control accordingly so that  all of the text is displayed.  8.  Our final part will be to add our Web View  UIWebView  control which will be used   to display our web page. From the Object Library, select and drag a  UIWebView   control and place this under our  UILabel  control object. Resize the control  accordingly so that all of the text is displayed.  [ 171 ]   Designing Application Interfaces using MVC  If you have followed the steps correctly, your view should look something like the screenshot  below. If it doesn't look quite the same, feel free to adjust yours:  The screenshot above shows you how you are able to increase and or decrease the   number of segments that the control can have by using the Segments increment, and the  segment names can be changed by using the Segment drop-down from within the Objects  Inspector pane.  What just happened? In this section, we looked at how to add and make use of each of the controls available  on the iPhone. We added a UISegmentedControl which allowed the user to make their  selection from a list of colors. We then added a  UILabel  control to display the color  chosen by the user. We then added a  UISwitch  control to determine if the switch is ON or  OFF. Next, we added a  UISlider  control to be used to update the label to show its current  slider value. Finally, we added a Web View control which was used to display the contents of  a web page.  [ 172 ]   Chapter 5  Time for action – binding our Controls using Outlets and Actions Our final step will be to bind our control objects to our View Controller and connecting  these via outlets and actions. We covered this in the section Making our Components work  together in Chapter 3, Working with the Interface Builder:  1.  Once you have created your outlets within your   SwitchesSlidersSegmentsViewController.h interface file, it should look  something like this. What we are doing here is basically letting our View Controller  know what controls we will be dealing with: import    @interface SwitchesSlidersSegmentsViewController :  UIViewController {    IBOutlet UISegmentedControl *colorChoice;   IBOutlet UISwitch  *toggleSwitch;   IBOutlet UIWebView *ourWebView;   IBOutlet UILabel   *toggleValue;   IBOutlet UILabel   *chosenColor;   IBOutlet UILabel   *sliderValue;   IBOutlet UISlider  *ourSlider; }  @property  nonatomic, retain  IBOutlet UILabel  *sliderValue; @property  nonatomic, retain  IBOutlet UISlider *ourSlider; @property  nonatomic, retain  IBOutlet UISegmentedControl  *colorChoice; @property  nonatomic, retain  IBOutlet UISwitch *toggleSwitch; @property  nonatomic, retain  IBOutlet UILabel  *toggleValue; @property  nonatomic, retain  IBOutlet UILabel  *chosenColor;  @end  2.  Our next step is to create the action event in our   SwitchesSlidersSegmentsViewController.m implementation file,   but we first need to synthesize our properties so we can use them within   our view controller.  [ 173 ]   Designing Application Interfaces using MVC  If we don't declare these, we will receive warning messages which could  result in unexpected results occurring in our application. It is also good  to declare these as we are able to deallocate the memory used by these  objects in our dealloc method.  import "SwitchesSlidersSegmentsViewController.h"  @implementation SwitchesSlidersSegmentsViewController @synthesize ourSlider,colorChoice,toggleSwitch,sliderValue,     toggleValue,chosenColor; -  IBAction getSwitchValue: id sender {    Determines the status of our switch   if  [toggleSwitch isOn] {     toggleValue.text=@"Switch is: ON";   } else {     toggleValue.text=@"Switch is: OFF";   } } -  IBAction getSliderValue: id sender {    Gets the current value from our slider control and     displays it to our label.   sliderValue.text=[[NSString alloc]initWithFormat:@"Slider value:       %1.2f",ourSlider.value]; }    Determines what colour has been selected, then changes the     background colour of our label. -  IBAction getColor: id sender {    Get the currently selected item from our Segmented Control   switch  colorChoice.selectedSegmentIndex     {     case 0:       chosenColor.backgroundColor=[UIColor redColor];       break;     case 1:       chosenColor.backgroundColor=[UIColor greenColor];       break;     case 2:       chosenColor.backgroundColor=[UIColor blueColor];       break;     case 3:       chosenColor.backgroundColor=[UIColor yellowColor];  [ 174 ]   Chapter 5        break;     case 4:       chosenColor.backgroundColor=[UIColor cyanColor];       break;     default:       chosenColor.backgroundColor=[UIColor redColor];       break;   }   chosenColor.text=[[NSString alloc]initWithFormat:@"You Chose:       %@",[colorChoice       titleForSegmentAtIndex:colorChoice.selectedSegmentIndex]]; }  3.  Next, add the necessary code to our viewDidLoad method which will be   responsible for making our view work. We need to add the highlighted code   into our viewDidLoad event which will do just that: -  void viewDidLoad {   NSURL *appleUrl;   appleUrl=[[NSURL alloc]initWithString:@"http:  www.apple.com "];   [ourWebView loadRequest:[NSURLRequest requestWithURL:  appleUrl]];   [super viewDidLoad]; }  4.  Our final step is to release the memory used by the view control objects which we  declared. Xcode 4 creates these for you automatically when you declare the outlets  in your SwitchesSlidersSegmentsViewController.h interface file: -  void dealloc {   [toggleSwitch release];   [colorChoice release];   [ourWebView release];   [sliderValue release];   [toggleValue release];   [chosenColor release];   [ourSlider release];   [super dealloc]; }   [ 175 ]   Designing Application Interfaces using MVC  The screenshot below displays our application running within the iOS simulator, with each of  the controls showing their output:  What just happened? In this section, we added the program logic into our  SwitchesSlidersSegmentsViewController.m implementation file to determine the  current state of our switch object. We use the isOn property to determine the state our  switch is in. If it is ON, we return the text Switch is: ON, otherwise, if it is OFF, we return the  text Switch is: OFF. We then determine the current value of our slider control object. This is  defined as using the value method of ourSlider control. Once we have obtained this, we  output the text to our SliderValue label.  In our next step, we need to find out the index of our colorChoice segmented control.  If you remember, we mentioned that this control starts from 0 to Total_No. We use the  colorChoice.selectedSegmentIndex method to derive this. Once we have got this  information, we can set the background color of our chosenColor label control.  [ 176 ]   Chapter 5  In our final step, we create an instance of the NSURL class which will be used to store the  URL address for the Apple website. We then create an NSURLRequest object that we pass  to the web view control when the view is loaded. We finally pass our appleURL to the  requestWithURL method of our Web View control, which handles the displaying of the  web page.  Creating an application to scroll through large content Scrolling views can become very handy when space is limited within the view which you  are working on. By using an instance of the UIScrollView class, you can add controls and  interface elements to allow these to fit within the physical boundaries of the iPhone.  We will create a very basic scrolling view application to show how to implement this control.  To enable scrolling within the view, we need to define a property called contentSize,  which will be used to set the area of the content that needs to be scrolled both horizontally  and vertically..  Time for action – creating the ScrollingViews project Before we can proceed and create our ScrollingViews project, to refresh your memory,  you can refer to the section Creating your first iPhone application which we covered in  Chapter 2, Introducing the Xcode 4 Workspace:  1.  Launch Xcode from the  Xcode4 Applications folder. 2.  Choose Create a new Xcode project, or File  New Project. 3.  Select the View-based Application template from the list of available templates. 4.  Select iPhone from under the Device Family drop-down. 5.  Specify the location where you would like to save your project. 6.  Click on the Save button to continue and display the Xcode workspace environment. 7.  Specify the location where you would like to save your project. 8.  Click on the Save button to continue and display the Xcode workspace environment.  Once our project has been created, you will be presented with the Xcode interface along  with all files that the project template created for you displayed within the Project Navigator  window pane.  [ 177 ]   Designing Application Interfaces using MVC  Now we need to add the controls to our View Controller. We will be adding a   UIScrollView  Scroll view Control which will be used as the container to handle the  scrolling. We will also be creating six  UILabel  label controls which will be placed within  the UIScrollView:  1.  From the Object Library, select and drag a  UILabel  label control to the view  and position it at the top within our view. You will need to click on the Object  Attributes tab and label our control Our Scrolling View Example by setting the  text property under the Label section. Resize the control accordingly so that all   of the text is displayed.  2.  Next, from the Object Library, select and drag a  UIScrollView  control and drag  it to the view. From the Object Attributes tab, ensure that from under the view  section, the Mode has been set to read Scale to Fill.  3.  Now we need to add the  UILabel  Label Controls to our UIScrollView. From   the Object Library, select and drag a  UILabel  control to the UIScrollview  and position the control at the top within our Scroll view. Click on the Object  Attributes tab and label our control This is our Label 1 by setting the text  property under the Label section. Resize the control accordingly so that all of the  text is displayed.  4.  Repeat the above step, to add the remaining five  UILabel  label controls,   positioning them apart from each other and setting each of their text properties   to read This is our Label No where No is the label number.  If you have followed the steps correctly, your view should look something like the screenshot  below. If it doesn't look quite the same, feel free to adjust yours:  [ 17 ]   Chapter 5  What just happened? In this section, we looked at how we can use scrolling views to handle our view when space  becomes very limited. We used the UIScrollview class and added some label controls to  show some of the basic features of scrolling within the view. In the next section, we will look  at how we can bind the control to enable scrolling within the view.  Time for action – binding our Controls using Outlets and Actions Our final steps will be to bind our control objects to our View Controller and connecting  these via outlets and actions. We covered this in the section Making our Components work  together in Chapter 3, Introducing Interface Builder:  1.  Once you have created your outlets within your   ScrollingViewsViewController.h interface file, it should look something  like this. What we are doing here is basically letting our View Controller know what  controls we will be dealing with: import    @interface ScrollingViewsViewController : UIViewController {   IBOutlet UIScrollView *ourScroller; } @property  nonatomic, retain  IBOutlet UIScrollView *ourScroller;  @end  2.  Our next step is to create the action event in our   ScrollingViewsViewController.m implementation file, but we first need   to synthesize our properties so we can use them within our view controller.  If we don't declare these, we will receive warning messages  which could result in unexpected results occurring in our  application. It is also good to declare these as we are able  to deallocate the memory used by these objects in our  dealloc method.  import "ScrollingViewsViewController.h"  @implementation ScrollingViewsViewController @synthesize ourScroller;  [ 17 ]   Designing Application Interfaces using MVC  3.  Our next step is to add the necessary code to our viewDidLoad method which will  be responsible for making our view work. We need to add the highlighted code into  our viewDidLoad event which will do just that: -  void viewDidLoad {   ourScroller.contentSize=CGSizeMake 200,500 ;   [super viewDidLoad]; }  4.  Our final step is to release the memory used by our view control objects which we  have declared. Xcode 4 creates these for you automatically when you declare the  outlets in your ScrollingViewsViewController.h interface file: -  void dealloc {   [ourScroller release];   [super dealloc]; }  The screenshot below shows our ScrollingViews application running within the iOS  simulator and displaying the scrollable content:  [ 10 ]   Chapter 5  What just happened? In this section, we declared some code within our viewDidLoad method to set the size  of the content that will be scrolled up and down. Next, we set the region size to scroll  horizontally and vertically. The CGSizeMake  ,   function contains a  width and a height property. We have told our scroll view  ourScroller  to scroll   up 200 pixels horizontally and 500 pixels vertically.  Understanding Pickers These types of controls implement the  UIPickerView  classes and are a unique feature  on the iPhone and they present a series of multi-value options using a spinning interface— more like a rotating slot machine. The control comprises of segments which are referred to  as components, and displays rows of values that the user can choose from. This control is  frequently used on the iPhone when you need to set the date and or time.  Date Pickers The Date Picker  UIDatePicker  control implements the UIDatePicker class, and allows  the user to specify a date. The control returns a date object of type NSDate.  In the example which will follow, we will get the user to select a date and then display  this chosen value to a  UILabel  control. The NSDateFormatter object allows you to  customize the output of how you would like your date to look. The table below shows you  the different types of format which are available to you:  DATE FORMAT MMMM d YYYY hh mm ss a  DESCRIPTION Displays the full name of the month. Displays the day of the month, with no leading zero. Displays the full four-digit year. Displays a two-digit hour  with leading zero if required . Displays the minutes with two digits. Displays the seconds with two digits. Displays a.m. or p.m.  [ 11 ]   Designing Application Interfaces using MVC  There may be times when you want to display your date picker in a mode other than default.  Fortunately, the Date Picker can be customized to work in four different modes which are  explained below:  MODE Date and Time Time Date Timer  DESCRIPTION This option provides the ability to choose both a date and a time. Displays only time values. Displays only date Values. This option displays a clock-like interface for choosing duration period.  Time for action – creating the Date Picker project Before we can proceed and create our DatePickersExample project, to refresh your  memory, you can refer to the section Creating your first iPhone application which we   covered in Chapter 2, Introducing the Xcode 4 Workspace:  1.  Launch Xcode from the  Xcode4 Applications folder. 2.  Choose Create a new Xcode project, or File  New Project. 3.  Select the View-based Application template from the list of available templates. 4.  Select iPhone from under the Device Family drop-down. 5.

Once our project has been created, you will be presented with the Xcode interface along  with all the files that the project template created for you displayed within the Project  Navigator window pane.  Now we need to add the controls to our View Controller. We will be adding a   UIDatePicker  control which the user can select the date from, as well as   creating a  UILabel  label control which will be used to display the date selected:  1.  From the Object Library, select and drag a  UIDatePicker  control to the view   and position the control at the top within our view.  2.  We now need to add a  UILabel  Label control. From the Object Library, select  and drag a  UILabel  Label control and place this under the  UIDatePicker   control. We will need to click on the Object Attributes tab and label our control Date  Chosen: theDate by setting the text property under the Label section. Resize the  control accordingly so that all of the text is displayed.  [ 12 ]   If you have followed the steps correctly, your view should look something like the screenshot  below. If it doesn't look quite the same, feel free to adjust yours:  Chapter 5  What just happened? In this section, we created a simple application that used the UIDatePicker control to  allow the user to select a date and then display the chosen date to our label control Date  Chosen: theDate. In the next section, we will look at how to bind the UIDatePicker  control to handle the displaying of the chosen date.  Time for action – binding our Controls using Outlets and Actions Our final steps will be to bind our control objects to our View Controller and connecting  these via outlets and actions. We covered this in the section Making our Components work  together in Chapter 3, Introducing Interface Builder:  1.  Once you have created your outlets within your   DatePickersExampleViewController.h interface file, it should look something  like this. What we are doing here is basically letting our View Controller know what  controls we will be dealing with: import    @interface DatePickersExampleViewController : UIViewController   {  [ 13 ]   Designing Application Interfaces using MVC    UIDatePicker *theDate;   UILabel *ourLabel; } @property  nonatomic, retain  IBOutlet UIDatePicker *theDate; @property  nonatomic, retain  IBOutlet UILabel *ourLabel;  @end  2.  Our next step is to create the action event in our   DatePickersExampleViewController.m implementation file, but we first   need to synthesize our properties so we can use then within our view controller.  If we don't declare these, we will receive warning messages which  could result in unexpected results occurring in our application.  It is also good to declare these as we are able to deallocate the  memory used by these objects in our dealloc method.  import "DatePickersExampleViewController.h"  @implementation DatePickersExampleViewController @synthesize theDate, ourLabel;  3.  Next, we declare our  IBAction  getDate method which will be responsible for  displaying the selected date to our Label control object. The code snippet below  shows the getDate action event which will do just that:  -  IBAction getDate: id sender {   NSString *dateChosen;   NSDateFormatter *dateFormat;      dateFormat=[[NSDateFormatter alloc] init];   [dateFormat setDateFormat:@"MMMM d, yyyy hh:mm:ssa"];      dateChosen=[[NSString alloc] initWithFormat:@"Date Chosen:        %@\n",[dateFormat stringFromDate:[sender date]]];       ourLabel.text=dateChosen;   ourLabel.textColor=[UIColor blueColor]; }  [ 14 ]   4.  Our final step is to release the memory used by our view control objects which we  declared. Xcode 4 creates these for you automatically when you declare the outlets  in your DatePickersExampleViewController.h interface file:  Chapter 5  -  void dealloc {   [theDate release];   [ourLabel release];   [super dealloc]; }  The screenshot below shows our DatePickersExample application running within the iOS  simulator and displaying the UIDatePicker control with a date selected and displayed:  What just happened? In this section, we created an action method getDate that will be responsible for displaying  the selected date from our UIDatePicker control. Within this function, we needed to  specify the date format to use by using the NSDateFormatter object and apply this to the  date returned by the sender object. We then finally output the date to our label control and  set the foreground color to be Blue using the UIColor object.  [ 15 ]   Designing Application Interfaces using MVC Custom Pickers As mentioned previously, we will be implementing a custom picker example later on in  this chapter and making use of the  UIPickerView  object. You will notice that when you  initially use this object, it starts off with a basic spinning view and all that we need to do  is provide it with the data to display and describe how it should be displayed by setting its  DataSource and delegate properties to point to our View Controller.  Time for Action – creating the Custom Picker project Before we can proceed and create our CustomPickers project, to refresh your memory,  you can refer to the section Creating your first iPhone application which we covered in  Chapter 2, Introducing the Xcode 4 Workspace:  1.  Launch Xcode from the  Xcode4 Applications folder. 2.  Choose Create a new Xcode project, or File  New Project. 3.  Select the View-based Application template from the list of available templates. 4.  Select iPhone from under the Device Family drop-down. 5.  Specify the location where you would like to save your project. 6.  Click on the Save button to continue and display the Xcode workspace environment. 7.  Specify the location where you would like to save your project. 8.  Click on the Save button to continue and display the Xcode workspace environment.  Once our project has been created, you will be presented with the Xcode interface along  with all the files that the project template created for you displayed within the Project  Navigator window pane.  Now we need to add the controls to our View Controller. We will be adding a   UIPickerView  control which the user can use to select the animal and associated sound,  as well as create a  UILabel  label control which will be used to display the date selected:  1.  From the Object Library, select and drag a  UIPickerView  control to the view   and position the control at the top within our view.  2.  We now need to add a  UILabel  Label control which will be used to display the   animal selected from our Picker View. From the Object Library, select and drag a   UILabel  Label control and place this under the  UIPickerView  control.  [ 16 ]   3.  Next, click on the Object Attributes tab and label the control You Matched:  YouSelection by setting the text property under the Label section. Resize the  control accordingly so that all of the text is displayed.  If you have followed the steps correctly, your view should look something like the screenshot  below. If it doesn't look quite the same, feel free to adjust yours:  Chapter 5  4.  Next, we need to connect our UIPickerView object control to the dataSource   and delegate Objects. This is to conform to the UIPickerViewDataSource  and UIPickerViewDelegate protocols and we will need to modify our  CustomPickersViewController.h interface class so that our picker   can use the methods of the UIPickerView class.  What just happened? In this section, we created a simple application to use the UIPickerView control which  will be used to display a list of animals and the noises that they make. We also added a  UILabel control to our view which will be used to show the correct association between the  animal and the noise. Next, we looked at how to connect our UIPIckerView control to the  datasource that will be used to display our information. In the next section, we will look at  how to go about populating our control.   [ 17 ]   Designing Application Interfaces using MVC  Time for action – binding our Controls using Outlets and Actions Our final steps will be to bind our control objects to our View Controller and connecting  these via outlets and actions. We covered this in the section Making our Components work  together in Chapter 3, Working with the Interface Builder:  1.  Create the necessary outlets within your CustomPickersViewController.h  interface file. Once you have done this, it should look something like this. You will  notice that we have additional classes of our UIViewController class; this is why  we had to link our UIPickerView up to our Datasource and Delegate objects. We  are also creating two array objects which will hold our animal types and the noises  that they make:  import    @interface CustomPickersViewController : UIViewController        {    NSArray *animalType;   NSArray *animalNoise;   UILabel *matchResult; } @property  nonatomic, retain  IBOutlet UILabel *matchResult;  @end  2.  Next, create the action event in our CustomPickersViewController.m   implementation file, but we first need to synthesize our properties so that we   can use them within our view controller.  If we don't declare these, we will receive warning messages  which could result in unexpected results occurring in our  application. It is also good to declare these as we are able to  deallocate the memory used by these objects in our dealloc  method.  import "CustomPickersViewController.h"  @implementation CustomPickersViewController @synthesize matchResult;  3.  Our next step is to add the necessary code to our viewDidLoad method which   will be responsible for making our custom picker control work. We need to add the  highlighted code to our viewDidLoad event which will do just that:  -  void viewDidLoad {   animalType=[[NSArray   [ 1 ]   Chapter 5      alloc]initWithObjects:@"Dog",@"Cat",@"Pig",@"Mouse",              @"Snake",nil];    animalNoise=[[NSArray        alloc]initWithObjects:@"Sssss",@"Squeak",@"Oink",@"Meow",      @"Woof",nil];    [super viewDidLoad]; }  4.  Our next step is to declare the following method calls to our  UIPickerView    control object:  -  NSInteger numberOfComponentsInPickerView:              UIPickerView * pickerView {    return 2;    determines how many sections our picker will             be using.  } -  NSInteger pickerView: UIPickerView * pickerView numberOfRows             InComponent: NSInteger component {    if  component == 0  {     return [animalType count];   } else {     return [animalNoise count];   } } - NSString * pickerView: UIPickerView * pickerView titleForRow:            NSInteger row forComponent: NSInteger component  {   if  component == 0  {     return [animalType objectAtIndex:row];   } else {     return [animalNoise objectAtIndex:row];    } }  5.  Our next step is to declare our  void  pickerView method which will be   responsible for displaying the selected animal type and the noise that each makes   to our Label control object. The code snippet below shows the pickerView method  which will do just that:  -  void pickerView: UIPickerView * pickerView didSelectRow:              NSInteger row inComponent: NSInteger component {       NSString *matchedType;        int selectedType;   int selectedNoise;   int matchedNoise;  [ 1 ]   Designing Application Interfaces using MVC    selectedType  = [pickerView selectedRowInComponent:0];   selectedNoise = [pickerView selectedRowInComponent:1];      matchedNoise =  [animalNoise count]-1 -[pickerView        selectedRowInComponent:1];       if  selectedType == matchedNoise  {     matchedType=[[NSString alloc] initWithFormat:@"You are   correct, a         %@ does go '%@'!",        [animalType objectAtIndex:selectedType],       [animalNoise objectAtIndex:selectedNoise]];   } else {     matchType=[[NSString alloc] initWithFormat:@"You are   incorrect, a         %@ does not go '%@'!",        [animalType objectAtIndex:selectedType],       [animalNoise objectAtIndex:selectedNoise]];   }      matchResult.text = matchType;   matchResult.textColor=[UIColor redColor];        [matchType release]; }  6.  Our final step is to release the memory used by our view control objects which we  have declared. Xcode 4 creates these for you automatically when you declare the  outlets in your CustomPickersViewController.h interface file:  -  void dealloc {   [animalType release];   [animalNoise release];   [super dealloc]; }  [ 10 ]   The screenshot below shows our CustomPickers example application running within the  iOS simulator and displaying the selected animal and the associated noise that it makes:  Chapter 5  What just happened? In this section, we set up two array objects that will be used to hold the animal types and  the sounds that they make. Next, we set up the number of sections that our custom picker  control will have, as well as the number of rows for each section based on the number of  items within each of the arrays. This information is then populated into each section.  Next, we defined three integers  selectedType, selectedNoise, and matchedNoise . These  will be used to hold what has been currently selected by the user, using the formula below:  matchedNoise =  [animalNoise count] - 1   - [pickerView     selectedRowInComponent:1];  [ 11 ]   Designing Application Interfaces using MVC  What this formula does is determine how many animalNoise items we have in our array,  and then minuses one from it  as arrays are zero based . We then determine the element  position which the user has selected within the array. Next, we do a comparison and if the  animalType which has been selected matches the position in our animalNoise array, we  display the message You are correct; otherwise, we display You are incorrect along with the  chosen animal type and the associated sound that they make. We then write this out to our   UILabel  control and set the foreground text color to Red. We then release the object  when we are done.  Handling basic user input and output The iPhone provides us with many different ways in which we can display information to  the user, as well as the different ways in which we can collect this information. In the next  section, we will build a simple application, making use of the following controls. First, let  us learn about the basic controls available for collecting information and displaying this  information to the user.  Button Controls One of the most common interactions you will have when developing your iOS applications,  is responding to a user request when they touch on the  UIButton  button control. You  have used buttons in previous chapter exercises, these are elements of a view that respond  to an event that the user triggers from within the user interface by usually using the "Touch  Up Inside" event which indicates that the user has pressed and released this button. This  then triggers action  IBAction  event which fires off the associated code attached to the  action.  Text Fields Text Fields  UITextField  provide the ability to accept input from the user. This can be  information requesting their name or address information. Using the various different  keyboard layouts that the iOS SDK provides you enables you to constrain the type of input  allowable.  Text Fields are very similar to Buttons in the sense that they also have the ability to allow you  to respond to events while the user is entering in information, but are mainly used to read  information from these fields by using the controls text property.  Text Views The Text View  UITextView  control is very similar to the Text Field, except that the Text  View control presents a scrollable and editable block of text and gives the user the ability to  either read or modify the contents. These types of controls are mainly used when more than  a few words of input are required.  [ 12 ]   Chapter 5  Text Views don't provide any support for automatically reducing the size of the font like you  can do with Text Fields. They also don't provide support for clearing the text, other than  through programmatically setting the text property. Also, if you try to apply a style to this  control, all text will contain the same style. Apple recommends that if you need to handle  your text differently, you should use the UIWebView control as an alternative.  Labels Labels  UILabel  are very useful elements and are used to display strings within the view  by setting their text property. Label controls contain a wide range of additional properties  which control how the contents of the label will look, such as the Font and size of the text,  the alignment, and setting the background and foreground color.  Using Text Fields, Text Views, and Buttons You have already made use of the Text Fields and Button controls in previous chapter  examples, but we have never touched upon the use of TextViews up until now. We will  start by creating a very simple application that will show how to use each of these controls.  Our application will contain three  UITextField  TextField input boxes, a  UIButton   button control which will process the input fields, and a  UITextView  control which will  be used to output the contents.  Time for action – creating application with Text fields, Text  Views, and Buttons Before we can proceed and create our TextViewsandButtons project, to refresh your  memory, you can refer to the section Creating your first iPhone application which we covered  in Chapter 2, Introducing the Xcode 4 Workspace:  1.  Launch Xcode from the  Xcode4 Applications folder. 2.  Choose Create a new Xcode project, or File  New Project. 3.  Select the View-based Application template from the list of available templates. 4.  Select iPhone from under the Device Family drop-down. 5.  Specify the location where you would like to save your project. 6.  Click on the Save button to continue and display the Xcode workspace environment. 7.  Specify the location where you would like to save your project. 8.  Click on the Save button to continue and display the Xcode workspace environment.  [ 13 ]   Designing Application Interfaces using MVC  Once our project has been created, you will be presented with the Xcode interface along  with all files that the project template created for you displayed within the Project Navigator  window pane.  Now we need to add the controls to our View Controller. We will be adding a series of   UILabel  label controls which will be used display each of the labels as well as the  associated  UITextField  textboxes which will be used to gather the information.  We will also be adding a  UIButton  control which will handle the processing, and finally,  we will be adding a TextView control which will be used to display the output of the fields  entered by the user:  1.  From the Object Library, select and drag a  UILabel  control to the view and   position the control at the top within our view. We will need to click on the Object  Attributes tab and label our control Enter your Name: by setting the text  property under the Label section. Resize the control accordingly so that all of the  text is displayed.  2.  Next, we will need to add a  UITextField  control which will be accepting   the information entered by the user. From the Object Library, select and drag a  UITextField control and place it directly under the label control which we   created in the previous step.  3.  Repeat the steps above and add the  UILabel  labels and  UITextFields  Text  Fields for adding the following: Enter Your Gender and Enter Your Job. Ensure that  you leave enough space between each object.  4.  Our next step is to add a  UIButton  Round Rect Button control to our view.   Modify the Object Attributes of the Round Rect Button control and set its title to  read Generate the Text View. Don't forget to resize the control so that all of the   text can be read easily.  5.  We now need to add another  UILabel  Label control which will be used as a   heading placeholder for the TextView control. From the Object Library, select and  drag a  UILabel  Label control and place this under the  UIButton  control  which you created earlier on. We will need to click on the Object Attributes  tab and label our control Data contents output below: by setting the text property  under the Label section. Resize the control accordingly so that all of the text is  displayed.  6.  Our final step is to add a  UITextView  control to our view. Adjust the size to how   large or small you would like the control to be.  If you have followed the steps correctly, your view should look something like the screenshot  below. If it doesn't look quite the same, feel free to adjust yours:  [ 14 ]   Chapter 5  What just happened? In this section, we looked at how to create a simple application to use a number of iPhone  controls to handle input and display this information into a TextView control. The   TextView control is a fantastic control as it supports text coloring and multiple lines, which  are great for displaying information about people. In the next section, we look at how to add  the program logic to make our application work.  Time for action – binding our Controls using Outlets and Actions Our final steps will be to bind our control objects to our View Controller and connect these  via Outlets and Actions. We covered this in the section Making our Components work  together in Chapter 3, Working with the Interface Builder:  1.  Once you have created your outlets within your   TextViewsandButtonsViewController.h interface file, it should look  something like this. What we are doing here is basically letting our View   Controller know what controls we will be dealing with:  import    @interface TextViewsandButtonsViewController : UIViewController   {    IBOutlet UITextField *txtName;   IBOutlet UITextField *txtGender;   IBOutlet UITextField *txtJob;  [ 15 ]   Designing Application Interfaces using MVC    IBOutlet UITextView  *txtTextView; } @property  nonatomic, retain  IBOutlet UITextField *txtGender; @property  nonatomic, retain  IBOutlet UITextField *txtName; @property  nonatomic, retain  IBOutlet UITextField *txtJob; @property  nonatomic, retain  IBOutlet UITextView *txtTextView;  @end  2.  Our next step is to create the action event in our   TextViewsandButtonsViewController.m implementation file; but we first need  to synthesize our properties so that we can use them within our view controller.  If we don't declare these, we will receive warning messages which  could result in unexpected results occurring in our application. It is  also good to declare these as we are able to deallocate the memory  used by these objects in our dealloc method.  import "TextViewsandButtonsViewController.h"  @implementation TextViewsandButtonsViewController @synthesize txtGender, txtName, txtJob, txtTextView;  3.  Next, we declare our  IBAction  generateTextView method which will be   responsible for displaying the contents of each of our text fields to the Text View  Control. The text view control is a great control as it supports the MultiLine feature  which allows text to be formatted nicely. The code snippet below shows the  generateTextView action event which will do just that:  -  IBAction generateTextView: id sender {   NSString *TextView = [[NSString alloc] initWithFormat:@"Name:        %@\nGender: %@\nJob: %@\n",txtName.text,txtGender.text,      txtJob.text ];       txtTextView.text=TextView;   txtTextView.textColor=[UIColor redColor]; }   4.  Our final step is to release the memory used by the view control objects which we  declared. Xcode 4 creates these for you automatically when you declare the outlets  in your TextViewsandButtonsViewController.h interface file:  -  void dealloc {   [txtName release];   [txtGender release];  [ 16 ]   Chapter 5    [txtJob release];   [txtTextView release];   [super dealloc]; }   The following screenshot shows our TextViewandButtons example application running  within the iOS simulator and displaying the entered information from each of the form  controls within the Textview control:  What just happened? In this section, we looked at how to create the necessary outlets to our controls within our  TextViewsandButtonsViewController.h interface file to make our View Controller  aware of what controls we will be dealing with.  Next, we declared an action generateTextView method that is responsible for displaying  the contents of each of our text fields to the Text View Control. This control is a great  control as it supports the MultiLine feature which allows text to be formatted nicely.  Finally, we declared an NSString object TextView which contains each of our form fields  nicely separated by a new line and the data associated with each control. We then assign  this to the text property of our  UITextView  txtTextView control and then set the  foreground text color to be red.  [ 17 ]   Designing Application Interfaces using MVC  Have a go hero – modifying the Table View example Now that you have a good working knowledge of Table Views and know how to go about  adding entries and sections, the task will be to modify our Table View example sections  project to include a list of Organic and Non-Organic fruits. These will also need to be   grouped into their appropriate sections:  1.  Create two new objects that will be used to store each of our different types of   fruits. You can refer to the section Implementing Table Views located in this chapter.  2.  Next, implement two new arrays that will be used to hold our Organic and   Non-Organic fruits. You can refer to the section Implementing Table Views   located in this chapter.  3.  Next, locate the numberOfRowsInSection method and create two new case  statements that will be used to handle our new array objects. You can refer to   the section Implementing Table Views located in this chapter.  4.  Next, locate the cellForRowAtIndexPath method and create two new case   statements for our two new array objects. You can refer to the section Grouping   our Row items into Sections located in this chapter.  5.  Next, locate the numberOfSectionsInTableView method and update the number of  sections to handle the additional sections. You can refer to the section Grouping our  Row items into Sections located in this chapter.  Next, we need to locate the titleForHeaderInSection method and add the headers  for Organic and Non-Organic fruits. You can refer to the section Grouping our Row  items into Sections located in this chapter.  6.   7.  Once you are satisfied that everything has been completed, you can Compile, Build   and Run the application.  Once you have implemented the above, you will have a fully customized application that will  display Organic and Non-Organic Vegetables and Fruits.  Pop quiz – Table Views   repositioning Controls  1.  What method of the tableView should you update to initialise how many rows a   section would contain?  a.  cellForRowAtIndexPath b.  numberOfRowsInSection  [ 1 ]   2.

All of the above  Identity Inspector  a.  b.  Object Attributes Inspector c.  Size Inspector  a.  Single Line b.  Grouped c.  All of the above  3.    If you wanted to reposition each of the controls within the view, what section of the  Object Properties would you need to change?  4.  What option would you need to set to make your table view appear as grouped?  Summary  In this chapter, we had some insight into what design patterns are and their importance  when developing iPhone applications that use the Model-View-Controller  MVC  application  design, and how Xcode and Interface Builder implement MVC.  We also took a look at the different types of templates, the View-Based template and the  Navigation-based template and created some simple applications to highlight each of these.  We also used some of the different controls which we hadn't got round to using in previous  chapters. We looked at how to use Switches, Sliders, Segmented Controls, Scrolling View,  and Web Views. We also learned how to use the various Pickers, as well as creating our own  custom-built picker control using the UIPickerView control to handle multiple selections.  We finished up the chapter by looking into how to handle basic user input and output as well  as learning how to use the Text Field, Text View, and Button control objects.  We have learned about the various layers of MVC, the design patterns, and the importance  of using the Model-View-Controller when creating iPhone applications, through using Table  Views, Switches, Segmented Controls, and custom pickers. We are now ready to start focusing  on how to get the user's attention through the use of the different notification methods.  In the next chapter, we will be taking a look into interacting with the user through the  various notification methods of generating Alerts, and using Action Sheets. We will also   be looking into how to handle alerts using sound and vibrations.  [ 1 ]    6  Displaying Notification Messages  In this chapter, we will be focusing on the different methods in which we can  make our applications communicate and grab the user's attention. You may,  for instance, want to notify the user that an error has occurred, or that the user  will need to wait while information is being retrieved or saved. The iPhone provides developers with many ways in which they can add  informative messages to their applications to alert the user. We will be looking  at the various types of notification methods, ranging from alerts, activity  indicators, audio sounds, and vibrations. We will be taking a look at these in more detail through each of the examples,  which we will be building throughout this chapter.  In this chapter, we will:          Explore and use the different notification methods Learn how to generate alerts to notify the user Learn how to go about using action sheets to associate with views Handle alerts via sounds and vibrations  We have got quite a bit to cover, so let's get started.  Exploring the notification methods  You will have noticed by now, that applications on the iPhone are user-centric, meaning that  they don't operate without a user interface and don't perform any background operations.   Displaying Notification Messages  These types of applications enable users to work with data, play games, or communicate  with other users. Despite these, at some point an application will need to communicate with  the user. This can be as simple as a warning message, or providing feedback or even asking  the user to provide some information.  The iPhone and Cocoa-Touch use three special methods to gain your attention and are  explained below:  CLASS UIAlertView  UIActionSheet  DESCRIPTION This class creates a simple modal alert window that presents the  user with a message and a few options. Modal elements require the user to interact with them before  they can proceed. These types of elements are displayed  layered   on top of other windows and block the underlying objects until  the user responds to one of the actions presented. These types of classes are similar to the UIAlertView class, except  that they can be associated with a given view, tab bar, or toolbar  and become animated when it appears on the screen. Action  Sheets do not have an associated message property; they contain  a single title property.  System Sound Services This enables playback and vibration and supports various  file formats  CAF, AIF, and WAV Files  and makes use of the formats  CAF, AIF, and WAV Files  and makes use of the   CAF, AIF, and WAV Files  and makes use of the  AudioToolBox framework.  Generating alerts  There is no doubt that you will need to incorporate alerts into your applications. These can  be very useful to inform the user of when the application is running, and can be a simple  message such as memory running low, or that an application or internal error has occurred.  We can notify the user in a number of ways using the UIAlertView class, and it can be used  to display a simple modal message or gather information from the user.  Time for action – creating the GetUsersAttention application Before we can proceed with creating our GetUsersAttention application, we must first  launch the Xcode development environment. If you need to refresh your memory on how Xcode development environment. If you need to refresh your memory on how  development environment. If you need to refresh your memory on how  to go about creating a new Xcode project, you can refer to the section Creating the Project in  Chapter 3, Introducing Interface Builder:  [ 202 ]   Chapter 6  1.  Select the View-based application template from the project template dialog box. 2.  Ensure that you have selected iPhone from under the Device Family dropdown, as   the type of view to create.  3.  Next, you will need to provide a name for your project. 4.  Enter GetUsersAttention and then choose a location where you would like to save   the project.  Once your project has been created, you will be presented with the Xcode interface, along  with the project files that the template created for you within the Project Navigator Window.  What just happened? In this section, we looked at the steps involved in creating a View-based application for our  GetUsersAttention application. In the next section, we will take a look at how we can add  the AudioToolbox Framework into our project to incorporate sound..  Time for action – adding the AudioToolbox Framework to our  application Now that we have created our project, we need to add the AudioToolbox Framework to  our project. This is an important framework which will provide us the ability to play sound  and vibrate the phone. It is similar to the MediaPlayer Framework that we used in previous  chapters, but only supports a limited number of audio file formats.  To add the new frameworks or additional frameworks into your project, select the Project  Navigator Group, and then follow these simple steps as outlined below:  1.  Select your Project within the Project Navigator Window. 2.  Then select your project target from under the TARGETS group. 3.  Select the Build Phases tab. 4.  Expand the Link Library with Libraries disclosure triangle. 5.  Then finally, use the + button to add the library that you want to add; if you want to  remove a framework, highlight it from the group and click on the - button. You can  also search for the framework if you can't find it in the list shown.  [ 203 ]   Displaying Notification Messages  If you are still confused on how to go about adding these frameworks, refer to the following  image, which highlights what parts you need to select  highlighted by a red rectangle :  What just happened? In the above section, we looked at how we are able to add frameworks to our application.  We looked at the differences between the MediaPlayer and AudioToolbox frameworks, and  the limitations of the two.  Adding frameworks to your application allows you to extend your application and utilise  those features in your application to avoid reinventing the wheel. When you add frameworks  to your application, the system loads them into memory as needed and shares the one copy  of the resource among all applications whenever possible.  Now that we have added the AudioToolbox.framework to our project, our next step is to  start creating our user interface. In the next section, we will be taking a look at how we start In the next section, we will be taking a look at how we start  to build our user interface and create events.  Pop quiz – Frameworks  1.  Which framework allows you to vibrate the phone and play sound?  a.  MediaPlayer b.  AudioToolbox c.  CoreAudio  [ 204 ]   2.  Which framework allows for playing a limited number of file formats?

Summary d.  Build Phases  Building our user interface User interfaces provide a great way to communicate with the user in order to either  obtain information or to display notifications. A good interface is one that provides a good  consistent flow throughout your application as you navigate from screen to screen. This  involves considering the screen size of your view. In the next section, we look at how to add  some controls to our view to build our interface.  To obtain further information about what constitutes a good user interface,  Apple provides these iOS Human Interface Guidelines which can be obtained  at the following location: http:  developer.apple.com library  ios documentation userexperience conceptual mobilehig  MobileHIG.pdf.  Time for action – adding controls to our View We will be adding five button  UIButton  controls which will be handling our actions to  display alerts and Action Sheets, playing sounds, and vibrating the iPhone.  1.  From the Object Library, select and drag a  UIButton  Round Rect Button control  onto our view. Modify the Object Attributes of the Round Rect Button control and  set its title to read "Show Activity Indicator".  2.  From the Object Library, select and drag a  UIButton  Round Rect Button control  onto our view. Modify the Object Attributes of the Round Rect Button control and  set its title to read "Display Alert Dialog".  [ 205 ]   Displaying Notification Messages  3.  From the Object Library, select and drag a  UIButton  Round Rect Button control  onto our view. Modify the Object Attributes of the Round Rect Button control and  set its title to read "Display Action Sheet".  4.  From the Object Library, select and drag a  UIButton  Round Rect Button control  onto our view. Modify the Object Attributes of the Round Rect Button control and  set its title to read "Play Alert Sound".  5.  From the Object Library, select and drag a  UIButton  Round Rect Button control  onto our view. Modify the Object Attributes of the Round Rect Button control and  set its title to read "Vibrate iPhone".  If you have followed everything correctly, your view should look something like the following  screenshot. If it doesn't look quite the same, feel free to adjust yours:  What just happened? In the above section, we looked at how we are able to use the Object Library to add controls  to our view and customize their properties in order to build our user interface. In the next  section, we will take a look at how to create events to respond to button events.  [ 206 ]   Chapter 6  Creating events Now that we have created our user interface, we need to create the events that will respond  when we click on each of the buttons. If you need to refresh your memory on how to go  about this, you can refer to the section Making our Components work together in Chapter 3,  Introducing Interface Builder.  We first need to create an instance of our UIAlertView class, called baseAlert, which will  be used by our Show Activity indicator event and will be used to dismiss the activity after a  period of time has lapsed.  Open the GetUsersAttentionViewController.h interface file a highlighted code as shown in the code snippet below:  interface file and add the following   import    @interface GetUsersAttentionViewController : UIViewController      {     UIAlertView *baseAlert; } @end  We could have declared this within our GetUsersAttentionViewController.m  implementation file, but I prefer to declare it in this class as it can be referenced throughout  your application.  You will notice from the code snippet above that we have made reference to two delegate  protocols within our GetUsersAttentionViewController.h interface file; this enables  us to capture and respond to the button event presses used by our Action Sheet and Alert  Views. This will become apparent when we start adding the code events for our Alert Views  and Action Sheets.  Time for action – implementing the Show Activity Indicator  method When you are performing tasks which are taking a period of time, you will want to provide  the user with some form of notification. For tasks for which we are not sure how long it will  take, we can use the UIActivityIndicatorView class, which provides us with and is  represented as an animated spinner graphic.  [ 207 ]   Displaying Notification Messages  The default size of the Activity indicator is a 21-pixel square, but can be changed to 36-pixels  by using the UIActivityIndicatorViewStyleWhiteLarge style. In this section, we will  look at how to go about implementing this class, combined with the UIAlertView control:  1.  Open the GetUsersAttentionViewController.m implementation file.  2.  In the action event which you created for the Show Activity Indicator button, add   the following code:     Displays our progress indicator with a message -  IBAction showProgress: id sender {       initialize our Alert View window without any buttons initialize our Alert View window without any buttons  our Alert View window without any buttons   baseAlert=[[[UIAlertView alloc]initWithTitle:@"Please     wait,\ndownloading updates….." message:nil delegate:self     cancelButtonTitle:nil otherButtonTitles:nil] autorelease];       Display our Progress Activity view   [baseAlert show];         create and add the UIActivity Indicator   UIActivityIndicatorView     *activityIndicator=[[UIActivityIndicatorView     alloc]initWithActivityIndicatorStyle:UIActivityIndicatorViewStyl eWhiteLarge];   activityIndicator.center=CGPointMake baseAlert.bounds.size.width         2.0f,baseAlert.bounds.size.height-40.0f ;       initialize to tell our activity to start animating.   [activityIndicator startAnimating];   [baseAlert addSubview:activityIndicator];   [activityIndicator release];         automatically close our window after 3 seconds has passed.   [self performSelector:@selector showProgressDismiss        withObject:nil afterDelay:3.0f]; }  3.  Next, we need to create an event to dismiss the progress indicator. Create the   following showProgressDismiss event and add the following code:     Delegate to dismiss our Activity indicator after the number of     seconds has passed. -  void  showProgressDismiss {   [baseAlert dismissWithClickedButtonIndex:0 animated:NO];     }  [ 20 ]   Chapter 6  What just happened? In the above section, we looked at how we can use the UIAlertView alert class and the  UIActivityIndicatorView classes to provide the ability to perform animation within  our view. We also took a look at using the startAnimating method to start animating our  activity indicator.  Next, we declared and instantiated an instance of our UIAlertView dialog and then  declared and instantiated an instance of the UIActivityIndicator class and positioned  this to be centred within our alert dialog.  We then made a call to the startAnimating method, which will display the activity indicator  and cause the activity indicator graphic to start animating within our alert window.  After we have added this to our alert window view, we then need to release our  activityindicator object once it has been added to the alert view, and then set up a delay  to dismiss our activity view after a period of three seconds has lapsed, by calling the  showProgressDismiss method.  You can call the stopAnimating method to stop the activity view from  animating, but you will need to remember to set the hideWhenStopped  property if you want to permanently hide the activity view.  Finally we created our showProgressDismiss method to dismiss the activity indicator after  a number of specified seconds lapsed by our showProgress event when the number of  specified seconds has lapsed within the afterDelay property.  When using alert dialogs that don't contain any buttons, these don't properly call back to the  delegate and therefore don't auto-dismiss correctly, as we have seen in our example, so we  need to manually call the dismissWithClickedButtonIndex:animated: method which  will close our alert dialog and stop our activity view from animating.  Have a go hero – adding a second activity indicator Now that you have a good working knowledge of how to go about creating activity indicators  and using these within your application, the task will be to add a secondary activity indicator.  This will need to display a message after the downloading updates message stating that the  updates are being finalized:   1.  You will need to create another instance of the activity indicator You can refer to the   section Implementing the Show Activity Indicator located in this chapter.  2.  Next, you will need to add the activity indicator to the base class view. You can refer   to the section Implementing the Show Activity Indicator located in this chapter.  [ 20 ]   Displaying Notification Messages  3.  Finally, set up a delay and create a new method to dismiss the activity indicator after   a delay of five seconds has passed. You can refer to the section Implementing the  Show Activity Indicator located in this chapter.  Once you have that working, you will have mastered how to create an application that  contains more than one form of notification to grab the user's attention. This lets the user  know that updates are being finalized..  Pop quiz – Activity Indicators  1.  What method of the activityIndicator allows you to cease animation permanently?  2.  What method starts animation of the activityIndicator?  3.  When using the stopAnimating method of the activityIndicator, what method should   you use to permanently hide the activityview?  a.  hideWhenStopped b.  startAnimating stopAnimating c.   a.  stopAnimating b.  startAnimating  release  a.  b.  stopAnimating c.  hideWhenStopped  Time for action – implementing the Display Alert Dialog method Our next step is to implement our displayAlertDialog method. This method will be  responsible for displaying an alert message to the user when the Display Alert Dialog is  pressed. The user will be able to respond to the buttons displayed, which will dismiss   the dialog:  1.  Open the GetUsersAttentionViewController.m implementation file. 2.  In the action event which you created for the Display Alert Dialog button, add the   following code:    Handles of the setting up and displaying of our Alert View     Dialog -  IBAction displayAlertDialog: id sender {         Declare an instance of our Alert View dialog  [ 210 ]   Chapter 6    UIAlertView *dialog;         Initialise our Alert View Window with options   dialog =[[UIAlertView alloc] initWithTitle:@"Alert Message"      message:@"Have I got your attention" delegate:self       cancelButtonTitle:@"Cancel" otherButtonTitles:@"OK",nil];         display our dialog and free the memory allocated by our       dialog box   [dialog show];   [dialog release]; }  What just happened? In the above section, we looked at how we can use the UIAlertView alert class to display  a series of buttons and display a message based on the button pressed. We started by  declaring and instantiating an instance of the UIAlertView class with a variable dialog.  We then initialise our alert view to display the required buttons which we would like to have  displayed and then display the dialog and release the memory used.  You will notice when we declared our UIAlertView class, it comprised of a number of  parameters that are associated with this control. These are explained below:  ALERT  PARAMETERS initWithTitle  message  delegate  cancelButtonTitle OtherButtonTitles  DESCRIPTION Initializes the view and sets the title that will be displayed at the top  of the alert dialog box. This property sets the string that will appear within the content area  of the alert dialog box. Contains the object that will serve as the delegate to the alert.  If this is set to nil, then no actions will be performed when the user  dismisses the alert. This sets the string shown in the default button for the alert. Adds additional buttons to the sheet that are delimited by commas  as shown: otherButtonTitles:@"Out to Lunch",@"Back in 5 Minutes",@"Gone  Fishing".  Responding to Alert Dialog Button presses In order for us to be able to capture the button that the user has pressed, we use the  clickedButtonIndex method of the alertView property. This provides the button index  of the pressed button and starts from 0. In the following code snippet, we look at how we  are able to capture and respond to the actions when the user presses each of the buttons.  [ 211 ]   Displaying Notification Messages  To get started, open the GetUsersAttentionViewController.m implementation file  and create the following delegate function underneath the displayAlertDialog method:     Responds to the options within our Alert View Dialog - void alertView: UIAlertView * alertView     clickedButtonAtIndex: NSInteger buttonIndex {      String will be used to hold the text chosen for the button       pressed.   NSString *buttonText;          Determine what button has been selected.   switch  buttonIndex    {     case 0:    User clicked on Cancel button       buttonText=@"You clicked on the 'Cancel' button";         break;     case 1:    User clicked on the OK button       buttonText=@"You clicked on the 'OK' button";         break;     default:    Handle invalid button presses.       buttonText=@"Invalid button pressed.";       }               Initialise our Alert Window   UIAlertView *dialog=[[UIAlertView alloc] initWithTitle:@"Alert       Message" message:buttonText delegate:nil cancelButtonTitle:@"OK"       otherButtonTitles:nil,nil];       display our dialog and free the memory allocated by our dialog       box   [dialog show];   [dialog release];   }  In the above code snippet, we declared a delegate method which handles the button presses  and retrieves the index of the button which was pressed. We declare an NSString variable  buttonText, which will be used to store the title text to be displayed by our UIAlertView.  In order to determine the index of the button which was pressed, we perform a switch  statement and then set up the buttonText variable with the associated text. Finally, we  declare and instantiate a UIAlertView object, which will be used to display the greeting  for the button which was pressed. We then display the dialog and then finally release the  memory used.  [ 212 ]   Chapter 6  If we wanted to retrieve the selected button using its text property, we would do so as  shown in the following code snippet:  NSString *buttonTitle=[actionSheet buttonTitleAtIndex:buttonIndex]; if  [buttonTitle isEqualToString:@"OK"]  {   buttonText=@"You clicked on the 'OK' button"; }  Finally, we looked at another way in which we can derive what button has been pressed.  We declare an object NSString buttonTitle, which retrieves the text label for the button  pressed on the action sheet. We then use the isEqualToString method to perform   the comparison.  Have a go hero – adding additional buttons and creating the events I will let you put into practice what you have just learnt.  Our application needs some additional buttons to be added to our Alert Dialog, and also  needs to have the necessary code created to display the associated messages based on the  button pressed. One way to do this would be as follows:  1.  Locate the displayAlertDialog method 2.  Add the necessary buttons to create within the otherButtonTitles property,   separated by commas  3.  Locate the alertView: UIAlertView *  method 4.  Add the necessary buttonText messages within the switch statement based on   the buttonIndex of the button  Once you have that working, you will have extended your application to handle   multiple buttons.  Pop quiz – Alert Dialogs and Button Indexes  1.  What property would you modify to allow for additional buttons?  a.  InitWithTitle b.  cancelButtonTitles c.  otherButtonTitles  [ 213 ]   Displaying Notification Messages  2.  What is the purpose of the destructive button?  a.  Sets the string to be shown in the default button for the alert. b.  c.  The title of the option that will result in the information being lost.  Initializes the sheet with the specified title string.  Using Action Sheets to associate with a view  Action sheets are very similar to alerts in how they are initialized, and how the user responds  to decisions. However, action sheets can be associated within a given view, tab bar, or  toolbar and are animated when they become associated with the view onscreen. Action  sheets also provide a separate button which is displayed as bright-red to alert the user to  potential deletion of information.  Time for action – implementing the Display Action Sheet method Action sheets provide the user with a variety of options to choose from. For instance, if a  user was sending an SMS and there was a problem with it being sent, an action sheet will  pop up asking the user if they want to Try again or Dismiss:  1.  Open the GetUsersAttentionViewController.m implementation file. 2.  In the action event which you created for the Display Action Sheet button, add the   following code:    Displays our Action Sheet  -  IBAction displayActionSheet: id sender {         Define an instance of our Action Sheet   UIActionSheet *actionSheet;          Initialise our Action Sheet with options   actionSheet=[[UIActionSheet alloc]initWithTitle:@"Available       Actions" delegate:self cancelButtonTitle:@"Cancel"     destructiveButtonTitle:@"Close" otherButtonTitles:@"Open         File",@"Print",@"Email", nil];         Set our Action Sheet Style and then display it to our view   actionSheet.actionSheetStyle=UIBarStyleBlackTranslucent;   [actionSheet showInView:self.view]; }  [ 214 ]   Chapter 6  What just happened? In this section, we added some code that will be called when the button Display Action  Sheet is pressed. What this code is doing is declaring and instantiating an object actionSheet  based on the UIActionSheet class.  We then initialise our action sheet to display the required buttons which we would like to  have displayed and then apply the action sheet style, then display the action sheet into the  current view controllers view by using the showInView:self.view method.  You will notice when we declare our action sheet, that it comprises of a number of  parameters associated with this control, which are explained below:  ACTIONSHEET PARAMETERS initWithTitle delegate  cancelButtonTitle destructiveButtonTitle  OtherButtonTitles  DESCRIPTION Initializes the sheet with the specified title string. Contains the object that will serve as the delegate to the sheet.  If this is set to nil, the sheet will be displayed, but pressing a  button will have no effect except dismissing the sheet. This sets the string shown in the default button for the alert. The title of the option that will result in information being lost.  This button is represented in bright red. However, if this is set  to nil, then no destructive button will be displayed. Adds additional buttons to the sheet that are delimited by  commas as shown:   otherButtonTitles:@"Item 1",@"Item 2",@"Item 3".  As of iPhone OS 3.0, action sheets can include up to seven buttons while  maintaining the standard layout. If you happen to exceed this, the display will  automatically change into a scrolling table view control, with the ability to add as  many options as you need.  Responding to Action Sheet Button presses In order for us to be able to capture the button that the user has pressed we use the  clickedButtonIndex method of the actionSheet property. This provides the button  index of the pressed button and starts from 0. In the following code snippet, we look at   how we are able to capture and respond to the actions when the user presses each of   the buttons.  [ 215 ]   Displaying Notification Messages  Create the following delegate function located under the displayActionSheet method:     Delegate which handles the processing of the option buttons selected - void actionSheet: UIActionSheet * actionSheet     clickedButtonAtIndex: NSInteger buttonIndex {      String will be used to hold the text chosen for the button       pressed.   NSString *buttonText;           Determine what button has been selected.   switch  buttonIndex    {     case 0:    We selected the Close button       buttonText=@"You clicked on the 'Close' button";        break;     case 1:    We selected the Open File button       buttonText=@"You clicked on the 'Open File' button";       break;     case 2:    We selected the Print button       buttonText=@"You clicked on the 'Print' button";       break;     case 3:    We selected the Email button       buttonText=@"You clicked on the 'Email' button";       break;     case 4:    We selected the Cancel button       buttonText=@"You clicked on the 'Cancel' button";       break;     default:    Handle invalid button presses.       buttonText=@"Invalid button pressed.";       }      Initialise our Alert Window   UIAlertView *dialog=[[UIAlertView alloc] initWithTitle:@"Alert       Message" message:buttonText delegate:nil cancelButtonTitle:@"OK"       otherButtonTitles:nil,nil];         display our dialog and free the memory allocated by our dialog       box   [dialog show];   [dialog release]; }  In the above code snippet, we declare a delegate method which handles the button presses  and retrieves the index of the button which was pressed based on the order in which they  were added. We declare an NSString variable buttonText which will be used to store the  title text to display by our UIAlertView. In order to determine the index of the button  which was pressed, we perform a switch statement and then set up the buttonText variable  with the associated text. Finally, we declare and instantiate a UIAlertView object which  will be used to display the greeting for the button which was pressed. We then display the  dialog and then finally release the memory used.  [ 216 ]   Chapter 6  Just in the same way as we did for alerts, if you want to retrieve the selected button using its  text property, we would do so as shown in the following code snippet:  NSString *buttonTitle=[actionSheet buttonTitleAtIndex:buttonIndex]; if  [buttonTitle isEqualToString:@"Close"]  {   buttonText=@"You clicked on the 'Close' button"; }  In the above code snippet, we looked at an alternative way by which we can derive what  button has been pressed. We declared an object NSString buttonTitle, which retrieves the  text label for the button pressed on the action sheet. We then used the isEqualToString  method to perform the comparison..  Customizing an Action Sheet Action sheets can take on numerous different user interface  UI  styles which are derived  from the UIBarStyle class and can be applied to the actionSheetStyle property as  demonstrated below:  actionSheet.actionSheetstyle=UIBarStyleBlackTranslucent;  This code renders the action sheet in a translucent black style. If you wanted to inherit the  style of the views toolbar provided to which you have applied a style, you could use the  UIActionSheetStyleAutomatic or if you preferred to go for a more solid-black classy  finish, you could use and apply the UIActionSheetStyleBlackOpaque style:  Time for action – handling alerts via sounds and vibrations Before we can play any sound or perform vibrations on our iPhone, we must first import the  AudioToolBox library so that we can make use of its properties and methods:  1.  Open the GetUsersAttentionViewController.m implementation file and add   the following highlighted code as shown in the code snippet below: import "GetUsersAttentionViewController.h" import "AudioToolBox AudioToolBox.h" @implementation GetUsersAttentionViewController  [ 217 ]   Displaying Notification Messages  2.  Our next step is to implement our playAlertSound method. This method will be   responsible for playing a short 30 second sound when the Play Alert Sound button is  pressed. In the action event which you created for the In the action event which you created for the Play Alert Sound button, add  the following code:    Plays an Alert Sound -  IBAction playAlertSound: id sender {   SystemSoundID soundID;   NSString *soundFile = [[NSBundle       mainBundle]pathForResource:@"Teleport" ofType:@"wav"];   AudioServicesCreateSystemSoundID  CFURLRef [NSURL       fileURLWithPath:soundFile],&soundID ;   AudioServicesPlaySystemSound soundID ;                                               }  3.  Our next step is to implement our vibratePhone method. This method will   be responsible for making our phone vibrate when the Vibrate iPhone button is  pressed. Enabling the ability to provide feedback via vibration is a very simple and  painless technique and all that is required is to pass a System Sound ID value to the  AudioServicesPlaySystemSound method as we will see in a minute.  4.  In the action event which you created for the Vibrate iPhone button, add the   following highlighted code: -  IBAction vibratePhone: id sender {   AudioServicesPlaySystemSound  kSystemSoundID_Vibrate ; }  Now that we have finally created the necessary methods within our application to  enable us to play sounds and vibrations, our next step is to build our application, as  shown below.  5.  We are now ready to build and compile our GetUsersAttention application.   The screenshot below shows the output from each of the buttons when they   are pressed:  [ 21 ]   Chapter 6  So there you have it. We have explored five different ways in which we can communicate  effectively with the user. By implementing these methods into your own applications, you  will not only make your application more user-friendly, but it will also look more professional.  What just happened? In the above section, we looked at how to implement sounds and vibrations in our  application to grab the user's attention. In order for that to happen, we declared a clared a  variable called SoundID which will be used to refer to the sound file. Next, we declared  an NSString soundFile variable which will contain the path to the sound file location by  using the NSBundle class method mainBundle which corresponds to the directory location  where the sound file Teleport.wav is located and use the ofType method to identify the  type of sound file we want to play.  Once we have defined our path, we use the AudioServicesCreateSystemSoundID  function to create a SystemSoundID that will be used to actually play the file.  This function takes the following two parameters: CFURLRef and fileURLWithPath. The  CFURLRef parameter points to the location where the file is kept. The second parameter is  a pointer to the SystemSoundID class that will be used to store the memory address of the  file. The fileURLWithPath method returns an NSURL object which is what our CFURLRef  is expecting.  [ 21 ]   Displaying Notification Messages  Once we have set up our SoundID properly, all that is required is to play the sound which  is achieved by passing the SoundID variable to the AudioServicesPlaySystemSound  method.  We finally passed the kSystemSoundID_Vibrate constant variable to our  AudioServicesPlaySystemSound method to allow our device to handle   vibrations which have been defined within the AudioToolBox.h header file.  Have a go hero – adding Action Sheet items   changing appearance I will let you practice what you have just learnt in this chapter.  Our GetUsersAttention application needs to be enhanced. We need to add some  additional buttons and change the appearance of our action sheet. One way to do this   would be as follows:  1.  Within our displayActionSheet method, modify the otherButtonTitles   property to include the additional button titles  2.  Modify the actionSheet: UIActionSheet * actionSheet method, and add   the additional button indexes to the switch statement  3.  Compile and execute the application and check to ensure that the relevant button   text appears when the buttons are pressed  Once you have made the relevant changes, you will experience how easy it is to modify  action sheets to change their appearance and to allow for additional items to be displayed.  Pop quiz – sounds and vibrations  1.  When changing the appearance of an action sheet, which method do you use?  2.  When changing the appearance of an action sheet, what class does it derive from?  a.  actionsheet b.  actionSheetRibbon c.  actionSheetStyle  a.  UIFont b.  UIAlertView c.  UIBarStyle  3.  What method do you use to vibrate the iPhone?  a.  AudioPlaySystemSound b.  PlaySystemSound c.  AudioServicesPlaySystemSound [ 220 ]   Chapter 6  Summary  In this chapter, we learned about the different types of notification methods and modal  dialogs which we can use to communicate effectively with the user.   We also learned how to go about using alerts and Action sheets and how to set the UI  appearance of the Action Sheet using its various styles.  We finally looked at the two non-visual means by which we can communicate with the user  by using sounds and vibrations using the AudioToolBox framework. Simply by using this  framework, you make your applications more exciting and easily add short playing sounds  and vibrate the iPhone.  Now that we have learned about the various ways in which you can communicate with  the user, through alerts and action sheets, and sounds and vibration; we are ready to start  focusing on how to handle the iPhone MultiTouch Architecture and learn how we can  detect swipes, taps, pinches, and shaking. We will also be looking into the new iPhone 4  orientations by using the gyroscope feature. All of this will be covered in the next chapter.  [ 221 ]    7  Exploring the MultiTouch Interface  The Apple iOS device's primary interface with which you communicate is  its large Multi-Touch display. Since there is no physical keyboard attached,  everything is done via the screen to allow you to interact with your applications  in a more natural way. Any object can be moved around the screen, zoomed in  and out, and scrolled up and down using simple gestures. In this chapter, we will see how easy it is to incorporate both single-touch  and multi-touch support into our applications, to handle device taps, swipes,  pinches, as well as responding to shake motions, before finally learning about  the accelerometer and the gyroscope, and how to handle the situation when  your iOS device orientation has changed.  In this chapter, we will be covering the following topics:              Explore the iOS MultiTouch Architecture Learn how to detect taps, swipes, and pinches Learn how to use the built-in shake gesture Explore the new features of the Accelerometer and Gyroscope Learn how to handle and sense device orientation Learn how to detect when a device has been tilted  We will be taking a look at these in more detail through each of the examples which we will  be building throughout this chapter.  We have got quite a bit to cover, so let's get started.   Exploring the MultiTouch Interface  Introducing the MultiTouch architecture  The MultiTouch gesture architecture is based on the concept of a responder chain. When  the user performs an action, for instance, tapping or swiping the screen, the system will  proceed to generate instances of the UIEvent class to indicate that some user interaction  has occurred and then the chain responder objects are given a chance to respond.  In order for you to gain a better understanding of how the responder chain events are  handled, the screenshot below will explain what happens when each of the events are fired.  Each of the UIEvent events which get created represents a distinctive gesture which is  currently being processed with each of the UIEvents received containing the parts that  make up the gesture. Gestures such as a simple finger movement across the screen, a swipe,  or a tap are all instances of the UITouch class:  As you will see from the image above, each of the responder chains are made up of   a series of linked responder objects, each of these being an implementation of the  UIResponder class.  By looking at the diagram, you will notice that it sort of resembles the view hierarchy,   which means that it starts at the lowest subview before making its way all the way up  through the hierarchy.  The first link in the chain is known as the first responder and is executed first. If for some  reason, this cannot respond to the event, it gets bubbled up to the next responder in the  chain and then tries to process the event. This process continues until there are no more  responders to process and then proceeds to the applications UIWindow instance before  finally finishing up at the applications UIApplication instance which then gets a chance   to handle the event.  [ 224 ]   Chapter 7  It is not unusual for an event to pass all the way up through the chain without  getting any responses. This does not cause any problems and ensures that the  process starts and ends correctly.  Before you can start to use MultiTouch events within your application, you need to insert  the code into the responder chain by inserting and implementing any of the four UITouch  events which are part of the UIResponder class.  The UIView and UIViewController classes are all part of the UIResponder class as they  can respond to and handle events within the view. By implementing any of the methods  below, you are then able to override the methods used by your view or view controller:  MOTION EVENT METHODS  -  void touchesBegan: NSSet * touches withEvent: UIEvent * event  -  void touchesMoved: NSSet * touches withEvent: UIEvent * event  -  void touchesEnded: NSSet * touches withEvent: UIEvent * event  -  void touchesCancelled: NSSet * touches withEvent: UIEvent * event   The screenshot below shows you each of the events that get executed when your view or  view controller receives a touch:  [ 225 ]   Exploring the MultiTouch Interface  Each of the UITouch touches that get received has a phase, location, the view in which the  touch occurred, a timestamp and a count of the number of taps that occurred. In the table  below, we explain what happens when each of the touch phases are fired:  UITOUCH PHASE EVENTS UITouchPhaseBegan   UITouchPhaseMoved   DESCRIPTION Occurs at the beginning of the touch life cycle when the user  has touched an area of the iPhone screen. Occurs when the user has moves their finger or fingers around  the screen of the iPhone.  UITouchPhaseCancelled  UITouchPhaseStationary  Occurs when the user has paused on an area of the screen. UITouchPhaseEnd  Occurs when the user has removed their fingers from the  screen of the iPhone. Occurs when the iOS device determines that something has  happened and needs to abort the gesture. An example of this  can be due to a system interruption caused when you are  receiving an incoming phone call, or when an application or  window view is no longer active.  Detecting taps The iPhone is equipped to keep track of taps that occur when the user taps on an area of the  screen and delivers this as a single tap event to the UIResponder event chain with the count  of the number of taps that have occurred. Just like with mouse clicks, the iPhone can receive  and handle both single or double taps.  Time for action – creating the TapExample project Before we can proceed, we first need to create the TapExample project. To refresh your To refresh your  memory, you can refer to the section Creating your first iPhone application which we covered  in Chapter 2, Introducing the Xcode 4 Workspace:  1.	 Launch Xcode from the  Xcode4 Applications folder. 2.	 Choose Create a new Xcode project, or File  New Project. 3.	 You will be prompted to choose a project type and template. 4.	 From the Project Template Dialog, select the View-based Application project type. 5.	 Ensure that you have selected iPhone from the Device Family drop-down as the type   of View to create.  6.	 Click on the Next button to proceed to the next step.  [ 226 ]   Chapter 7  7.	 Specify a name for the project which you want to create. 8.	 Enter TapExample and then click on the Next button to proceed to the next step in  the wizard. You will then be asked to choose a location where you would like to save  the project.  Once our project has been created, you will be presented with the Xcode interface, along  with the project files that the template has created for you within the Project Navigator  Window.  Our next step is to concentrate and start to build our user interface. We will be keeping this  example simple and will be adding just one control which will display how many taps have  occurred when the user taps on the view:  1.	 From the Object Library, select and drag a  UILabel  label control and drag it onto   the view.  2.	 Modify the Object Attributes of the label control, and set the title to read Tap Count: 3.	 Adjust the Tap Count: label font size to be Helvetica 24.0  If you have followed everything correctly, your view should look something like the  screenshot below. Feel free to adjust yours accordingly:  [ 227 ]   Exploring the MultiTouch Interface  What just happened? In the above section, we looked at the steps involved in creating a View-based application  for our TapExample application. We then looked at the steps involved in building our user  interface by using the Label control from the Object Library and modifying some of the  properties associated with the control to set the size of the label. In the next section, we will  take a look at how we can bind the label control to an event, and set the background color of  the view depending on the total number of taps made.  Time for action – binding our Controls Now that we have created a user interface, we need to create the events so that we can  update this label to show how many taps have occurred. If you need to refresh your memory  on how to go about this, you can refer to the section Making our components work together  which we covered in Chapter 3, Working with the Interface Builder:  1.	 Open the TapExampleViewController.h interface file located within the   Classes folder of your project and add the following code: import    @interface TapExampleViewController : UIViewController {   UILabel *tapCountLabel; } @property  nonatomic, retain  IBOutlet UILabel *tapCountLabel;  @end  2.	 We now need to open our TapExampleViewController.m implementation file,   located within the Classes folder of our project so that we can synthesize our  properties to be able to use them.  If we don't declare these, we will receive compiler warning  messages which can result in unexpected results occurring in  our application and can even make our application terminate  unexpectedly which will not be too pleasing to our users.  import "TapExampleViewController.h"  @implementation TapExampleViewController @synthesize tapCountLabel;  [ 22 ]   3.	 Our next step is to implement the touchesBegan:touches method as we need   Chapter 7  to declare a UITouch variable *touch that will be used to retrieve the touch events.  We then need to construct our labelOutput string to show how many times the  user tapped, and then based on the number of taps made, we set the background  color of our view. With the TapExampleViewController.m implementation file open, create the  following event as shown in the code snippet below: -  void  touchesBegan: NSSet * touches withEvent: UIEvent * event    {   NSString *labelOutput;   UITouch *touch = [[event allTouches] anyObject];   labelOutput = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"You tapped %i       times.",[touch tapCount]];   tapCountLabel.text=labelOutput;   switch  [touch tapCount]    {     case 1:       self.view.backgroundColor=[UIColor redColor];       break;     case 2:       self.view.backgroundColor=[UIColor greenColor];       break;     case 3:       self.view.backgroundColor=[UIColor blueColor];       break;     case 4:       self.view.backgroundColor=[UIColor yellowColor];       break;     case 5:       self.view.backgroundColor=[UIColor orangeColor];       break;     default:       self.view.backgroundColor=[UIColor redColor];       break;   } }  4.	 Our final step is to release the memory used by the view controller objects which  we have declared. Xcode creates these for you automatically when you declare the  outlets in your TapExampleViewController.h interface file, located within the  Classes folder of your project: -  void dealloc {   [tapCount release];   [super dealloc]; }  [ 22 ]   Exploring the MultiTouch Interface  5.	 We are now ready to build and compile our TapExample application. The screenshot   below shows the output for the number of taps that have been pressed:  So there you have it; we have successfully created a simple, yet effective application  which can respond to user taps. By implementing any of the four touch events into your  application, you can respond to each accordingly.  What just happened? What we just covered in the section above were the steps involved in hooking up our  tapCountLabel control to the touches event method of the view controller. This enabled  us to determine the number of times the view was tapped. This was handled by the  implementation of the touchesBegan:touches method. Based on the total number of  taps made, the application then updated the labelOutput control to display how many times  the user tapped the view and also changed the background color.  [ 230 ]   Chapter 7  Have a go hero – modify the program to change background I will let you put into practice what you have just learnt.  Our application needs an addition made to the code to change the background color to purple  whenever the number of taps made exceeds 10. One way to do this would be as follows:  1.  Create another case item inside the switch statement. 2.   Initilalise the backgroundColor method of the view to change its background  color to Purple which is derived from the UIColor class. Include a break statement after the added code to avoid this from falling through  into any other case statements you have.  3.   4.  Compile, Build and Run the application.  Once you have that working, you will have customized the application to change the  background color based on the number of taps exceeding 10.  Pop quiz – tap counts  1.  Which method allows you to determine the number of taps made?  2.  What method determines when a touch has been performed?  tapCount touchCount  a.  b.  c.  getCount  a.  b.  c.   touchesMoved touchesCancelled touchesBegan  Detecting swipes Up to now, you have looked at the tap gesture of the iPhone and have learned how to handle  and respond to the events. You may have noticed while working with the tap gesture that it  only requires one UIResponder method. When dealing with swipes and the swipe gesture,  this is more involved and the responder lasts longer.  The swipe gesture starts with the touchesBegan:touches:withEvent method when it  detects that a finger or fingers have first touched the screen. The responder will then call a  series of touchesMoved:touches:withEvent method calls when the user proceeds to  move their fingers across the screen. The method touchesEnded:touches:withEvent is  called when the responder realizes that the user has removed their finger or fingers from   the screen.  [ 231 ]   Exploring the MultiTouch Interface  Time for action – creating the SwipeExample project To learn a bit more about how we go about handling and using the Swipe gesture, let's  proceed and create a View-based application:  1.	 Launch Xcode from the  Xcode4 Applications folder. 2.	 Choose Create a new Xcode project, or File  New Project. 3.	 You will be prompted to choose a project type and template. 4.	 From the Project Template Dialog, select the View-based Application project type. 5.	 Ensure that you have selected iPhone from the Device Family drop-down as the type   of View to create.  6.	 Click on the Next button to proceed to the next step. 7.	 Specify a name for the project which you want to create. 8.	 Enter SwipeExample and then click on the Next button to proceed to the next step  in the wizard. You will then be asked to choose a location where you would like to  save the project.  Once your project has been created, you will be presented with the Xcode interface, along  with the project files that the template created for you within the Project Navigator Window.  We are now ready to start implementing the code to detect and handle when a swipe has  occurred, by following these simple steps:  1.	 Open the SwipeExampleViewController.h implementation file, located within   the Classes folder of your project and add the following code:  import    define minGestureLength  25    The Minimum length to denote a   swipe.  length.  define allowableVariance 5     The variance of 5 pixels in   define delayFactor       3     Define our delay factor  @interface SwipeExampleViewController : UIViewController {   CGPoint currentStartingPoint; }  @end  [ 232 ]   Chapter 7  2.	 Next, open the SwipeExampleViewController.m implementation file located  within the Classes folder of your project so that we can start to use these within  our application. We need to locate the viewDidLoad method and add the following  highlighted code:    Implement viewDidLoad to do additional setup after loading the     view, typically from a nib. -  void viewDidLoad {   [super viewDidLoad];   self.view.backgroundColor=[UIColor blackColor]; }  3.	 Our next step is to create the touchesBegan:withEvent method and enter in the   following code: - void touchesBegan: NSSet * touches withEvent: UIEvent * event {   UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject];   currentStartingPoint = [touch locationInView:self.view]; }  4.	 Next, we create the touchesMoved:withEvent method, which will be used to  handle the swipe and work out how far the user has travelled within the view to  make it validate that a swipe has taken place. Enter in the following code: - void touchesMoved: NSSet * touches withEvent: UIEvent * event{   UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject];   CGPoint currentPosition = [touch locationInView:self.view];           Calculate how far the user's finger has moved both  horizontally       and vertically from its starting position.    CGFloat deltaX = fabsf currentStartingPoint.x - currentPosition. x ;   CGFloat deltaY = fabsf currentStartingPoint.y - currentPosition. y ;         Check to see if we are currently doing a Horizontal Swipe   if deltaX >= minGestureLength && deltaY <= allowableVariance {        Horizontal Swipe detected, so set our background color to  Red        reset the background color to black after our delay of 3         seconds have passed.     self.view.backgroundColor = [UIColor redColor];     [self performSelector:@selector resetBackground  withObject: nil         afterDelay:delayFactor];   }  [ 233 ]   Exploring the MultiTouch Interface       Check to see if we are currently doing a Vertical Swipe   else if deltaY >= minGestureLength && deltaX <=  allowableVariance {        Vertical Swipe Detected.     self.view.backgroundColor=[UIColor blueColor];        [self performSelector:@selector resetBackground          withObject:nil afterDelay:10];     [self performSelector:@selector resetBackground  withObject: nil         afterDelay:delayFactor];   } }     Handles resetting the background - void resetBackground {   self.view.backgroundColor=[UIColor blackColor]; }  We have finally made it and now we are ready to Compile, Build and Run our SwipeExample  application. The screenshot below shows the output when the application is run, and when  the user swipes in the horizontal direction and vertical direction:  [ 234 ]   Chapter 7  What just happened? What we covered in this section were the steps involved to create our SwipeExample.  We define a number of variables that will be used to determine how far the user moved  within the view in order to be counted as a swipe. We declare the minimum gesture length  and an allowable variance variable range to be either five pixels above or below. We then  located and modified the viewDidLoad event method to set and initialize the background  color of the view to black when the application is loaded. Next, we declared a call to the  touchesBegan method to obtain the current starting point when the user first places their  finger or fingers onto the iOS screen and then declared an instance variable touch which  is used to grab the position of the location within the view and then calculate how far the  user's finger has moved since its last starting position.  We then determine if the swipe was a horizontal action or a vertical action and then set the  view background colors accordingly and implement a timer to reset the background back  to black by calling the resetBackground method after a number of seconds have passed,  which is handled by the afterDelay property.  The function fabsf   is from the standard C math library that returns the  absolute value of a float.  Have a go hero – adjust the delayFactor and change the background I will let you put into practice what you have just learnt.  What we need to do here is modify our SwipeExample application to change the delay  factor before resetting the background. Instead of setting this back to black, we need to  allow it to cycle through a number of colors. One way to do this would be as follows:  1.   In the SwipeExampleViewController.h interface file, change the delayFactor  variable to another value. This can be anything that you like.  2.  Locate the resetBackground method inside the   SwipeExampleViewController.m implementation file, and create a series of  self.view.backgroundColor statements, and set the background color for  each.  Once you have completed this task, Compile, Build and Run the application.  [ 235 ]   Exploring the MultiTouch Interface  Pop quiz – tracking and identifying swipes  1.   In order to receive events of the UIEventTypeMotion, what event method must  the view or view-controller override?  a.  motionEnded.  b.  motionCancelled.  c.  motionBegan.  d.  All of the above  a.  UIResponder. b.  UIKit. c.  UIApplication.   2.  What is always the last responder in an iOS applications responder change?  Detecting pinches So far, we have looked at how we can detect when a user taps and swipes on the iPhone  device. There is still one more MultiTouch gesture that we need to cover, that being the  two-finger pinch. A pinch is basically when two fingers are placed on the iOS device and  then moved apart or brought closer together to simulate a zoom-in or zoom-out feature.  Apple uses this feature in many of its applications: Safari web browser, Maps, and resizing of  various images which you take with your iPhone camera or download from the internet.  Time for action – creating the PinchExample project To learn a bit more about how we go about handling and setting up the pinch gesture, let's  proceed and create a View-based application:  1.  Launch Xcode from the  Xcode4 Applications folder. 2.	 Choose Create a new Xcode project, or File  New Project. 3.	 You will be prompted to choose a project type and template. 4.	 From the Project Template Dialog, select the View-based Application project type. 5.	 Ensure that you have selected iPhone from the Device Family drop-down as the type   of View to create.  6.	 Click on the Next button to proceed to the next step. 7.	 Specify a name for the project that you want to create.  [ 236 ]   Chapter 7  8.	 Enter PinchExample and then click on the Next button to proceed to the next step in  the wizard. You will then be asked to choose a location where you would like to save  the project.  Once our project has been created, you will be presented with the Xcode interface, along  with the project files that the template has created for you within the Project Navigator  Window. We are now ready to start implementing the code that will be used to detect and  handle when a pinch has occurred, by following these simple steps:  1.	 Open the PinchExampleViewController.h interface file, located within the   Classes folder of your project and add the following code:  import    @interface PinchExampleViewController : UIViewController {   UIView *ourBox; }  @end  2.	 Next, open the PinchExampleViewController.m implementation file, located   within the Classes folder of your project and add the following code:     Implement viewDidLoad to do additional setup after loading              the view, typically from a nib.  -  void viewDidLoad {      [super viewDidLoad];         initialise and create our Box    float boxSize = 100.0;   CGRect ourBoxRect = CGRectMake 100,150,boxSize,boxSize ;   ourBox = [[UIView alloc] initWithFrame:ourBoxRect];   ourBox.backgroundColor = [UIColor greenColor];         we need to tell our object that we want to be able to               handle multiple touches    ourBox.multipleTouchEnabled = YES;         initialise our view background color and then add the box                to the view.    self.view.backgroundColor = [UIColor blackColor];   [self.view addSubview:ourBox]; }  [ 237 ]   Exploring the MultiTouch Interface  3.	 Next, we need to create the distanceBetweenPoints method within the   PinchExampleViewController.m implementation file and add the following  code:     Calculate the distance between the two points CGFloat distanceBetweenPoints CGPoint pt1, CGPoint pt2  {   CGFloat distance;   CGFloat xDifferenceSquared = pow pt1.x - pt2.x, 2 ;   CGFloat yDifferenceSquared = pow pt1.y - pt2.y, 2 ;   distance = sqrt xDifferenceSquared + yDifferenceSquared ;   return distance; }  4.	 Next, create the transformWithScale method within the   PinchExampleViewController.m implementation file and add the following  code:  CGAffineTransform transformWithScale CGAffineTransform             oldTransform, UITouch *touch1, UITouch *touch2  {    CGPoint touch1Location = [touch1 locationInView:nil];   CGPoint touch1PreviousLocation = [touch1        previousLocationInView:nil];    CGPoint touch2Location = [touch2 locationInView:nil];   CGPoint touch2PreviousLocation = [touch2        previousLocationInView:nil];          Get distance between points   CGFloat distance =        distanceBetweenPoints touch1Location,touch2Location ;    CGFloat prevDistance =        distanceBetweenPoints touch1PreviousLocation,       touch2PreviousLocation ;          Figure out the new scale ratio   CGFloat scaleRatio = distance   prevDistance;   CGAffineTransform newTransform =        CGAffineTransformScale oldTransform, scaleRatio, scaleRatio ;          Return result   return newTransform; }  [ 23 ]   Chapter 7  5.	 Next, create the transformWithRotation method within the   PinchExampleViewController.m implementation file and add the   following code:  CGAffineTransform transformWithRotation CGAffineTransform      oldTransform, UITouch *touch, UIView *view, id superview  {    CGPoint pt1 = [touch locationInView:superview];   CGPoint pt2 = [touch previousLocationInView:superview];   CGPoint center = view.center;   CGFloat angle1 = atan2  center.y - pt2.y, center.x - pt2.x  ;   CGFloat angle2 = atan2  center.y - pt1.y, center.x - pt1.x  ;        CGAffineTransform newTransform =        CGAffineTransformRotate oldTransform, angle2-angle1 ;            Return result   return newTransform; }  6.	 Next, create the touchesMoved method within the   PinchExampleViewController.m implementation file and add the following  highlighted code:  -  void touchesMoved: NSSet * touches withEvent: UIEvent   * event {      if  [[event touchesForView:ourBox] count] == 1    {     UITouch *touch = [[[event touchesForView:ourBox]               allObjects] objectAtIndex:0];      ourBox.transform =          transformWithRotation ourBox.transform,touch,ourBox,self.view ;    }      if  [[event touchesForView:ourBox] count] == 2    {     UITouch *touch1 = [[[event touchesForView:ourBox]               allObjects] objectAtIndex:0];      UITouch *touch2 = [[[event touchesForView:ourBox]               allObjects] objectAtIndex:1];      ourBox.transform = transformWithScale ourBox.transform,               touch1, touch2 ;    } }  [ 23 ]   Exploring the MultiTouch Interface  7.	 Our final step is to release the memory used by our view controller objects which   we declared in our PinchExampleViewController.h interface file. Add the  following highlighted code as shown below to your dealloc method:  -  void dealloc {   [ourBox release];   [super dealloc]; }  We have finally made it and now we are ready to Compile, Build and Run our PinchExample  application. The screenshot below shows the output when the application is run, and when  the user resizes the image.  So there you have it; by using the Core Graphics library and implementing some methods,  you can make your application incorporate the ability to support MultiTouch features.  To resize the image from within the iPhone Simulator, hold down the Control  + Option buttons and then use your mouse to stretch the image.  [ 240 ]   What just happened? What we covered in this section were the steps involved in creating our SwipeExample.  We declared an instance UIView variable ourBox which will be eventually placed in our  view. Next, we declared an instance CGRect variable ourBoxRect which is used to define our  rectangle. We then allocated the memory for our box, set the background color and then set  this up to handle and use multitouch events. We then proceeded to set the background color  of our view and then added our box as a subview to the current view controller.  Chapter 7  The algorithm to calculate distance between two points is made freely available  on the Wikipedia website at the following location: http:  en.wikipedia. org wiki Distance.  After adding the box to the view, we need to determine the touch locations of the two  points. We make use of our distanceBetweenPoints function to calculate the distance  of the previous location, and then work out the scale ratio portion of our box image that we  need to redraw back to the view. Next, we work out the touch location positions which are  derived from the UITouch class as well as determining the angle to which the object needs  to be rotated within the view. We use the CGAffineTransformRotate function which  is part of the Xcode CoreGraphics library to transform the object within the view. Next,  we need to determine if we are handling a single touch and if this is the case we just want  to call and rotate our box object within the view. However, if we have determined that we  are handling more than a single touch, we need to call our function to scale the image and  redraw it to the view, before finally releasing the memory used by the dealloc method.  Have a go hero – handling more than two fingers I will let you put into practice what you have just learnt.  Our application needs to be modified to cater for more than two fingers being placed down  on the view at any given time. We need to incorporate into our application the ability for the  box to be moved around the screen while it is being rotated. One way to do this would be   as follows:  1.   In the touchesMoved method, add another event type to check if the number of  touches are 3.  Declare another touch3 instance of the UITouch class.  2.  3.  Use the CGPoint class to determine the location of the two points and then   reposition the box object within the view.  Once you have that working, you will have a more user-friendly application which will allow  the user to resize, rotate, and move the object around the view.  [ 241 ]   Exploring the MultiTouch Interface  Pop quiz – pinches and transformations  1.  When identifying pinches, how many instances of the UITouch method are   allowed?  a.  one b.  c.   three two  2.  What method allows you to Rotate an object?  a.  CGAffineTransform. b.   transformWithRotation.  3.  What method allows you to Scale your object?  a.  CGAffineTransformScale. b.  transformWithScale.  Detecting shakes When the iPhone device is shaken, the system makes use of the accelerometer and then  interprets the accelerometer data to see if it is a shake instruction.  If this has been determined to be a shake gesture, the system creates a UIEvent object  which represents this gesture and then sends the object to the currently active application  for processing.  Using the shake gesture on the iPhone is a lot simpler to use than touch events. Events  are still generated when a motion starts or stops and it is even possible for you to track  individual motions as you would do with touch events.  In order to make your applications incorporate and handle the iOS shake gesture, this can be  easily accomplished by implementing the following three methods as shown in the   table below:  METHOD motionBegan:motion:withEvent: motionEnded:motion:withEvent:  motionCancelled:motion: withEvent:  DESCRIPTION This method is called when a motion event begins. This method is called when a motion event has  ended. This method is called if the system thinks that the  motion is not a shake. Shakes are determined to  be approximately a second or so in length.  [ 242 ]   Motion events were first introduced in the iOS 3.0 SDK, with shaking  motions currently being interpreted as gestures which then move on  to become motion events.  Chapter 7  Time for action – creating the ShakeExample project To learn a bit more about how we go about handling and setting up the shake gesture, let's  proceed and create a View-based application:  1.	 Launch Xcode from the  Xcode4 Applications folder. 2.	 Choose Create a new Xcode project, or File  New Project. 3.	 You will be prompted to choose a project type and template. 4.

Enter ShakeExample and then click on the Next button to proceed to the next step   in the wizard. You will then be asked to choose a location where you would like to  save the project.  Once our project has been created, we will be presented with the Xcode interface, along  with the project files that the template has created for you within the Project Navigator  Window.   We are now ready to start implementing the code that will be used to detect when a shake  has occurred on the iOS device, by following these simple steps:  1.	 Next, open the ShakeExampleViewController.m implementation file, located   within the Classes folder of your project and add the following code as shown  below:     Implement viewDidLoad to do additional setup after loading   the view, typically from a nib.  -  void viewDidLoad {   [super viewDidLoad];   self.view.backgroundColor=[UIColor greenColor]; }  [ 243 ]   Exploring the MultiTouch Interface  2.	 Next, in order for our view or view controller to start receiving motion events of  the UIEventTypeMotion type, we need to make our view or view controller the  first responder in the UIResponder responder chain and this must override one or  more of the three UIResponder motion event methods which are shown below:  a.  -  void motionBegan: UIEventSubtype motion   withEvent: UIEvent * event   b.  -  void motionEnded: UIEventSubtype motion   withEvent: UIEvent * event   c.  -  void motionCancelled: UIEventSubtype motion   withEvent: UIEvent * event   For the purpose of this example, we will be just overriding the motionEnded:motion: withEvent which will show an alert message when the shake gesture ends.  3.	 Next, we need to allow our view controller to support and start receiving motion  events. With the ShakeExampleViewController.m implementation file still open,  add the following code snippet above the viewDidAppear method:  -  BOOL canBecomeFirstResponder {   return YES; }  - void viewDidAppear: BOOL animated {      [self becomeFirstResponder];   [super viewDidAppear:animated]; }  What just happened What we covered in this section were the steps involved in creating our ShakeExample. We  initialized our view background color to green in the viewDidLoad event to indicate that  no shake has occurred yet. Next, we needed to make our view controller the first responder  in the UIResponder responder chain by overriding the motionEnded:motion:withEvent  which will show an alert message when the shake gesture ends. Finally, we needed to add  a method inside the viewDidAppear method in the ShakeExampleViewController. m implementation file to allow our view or view controller to be able to support the motion  events. If we don't include this, none of the motion events will fire and our application will  not behave as we have designed it to.  [ 244 ]   Chapter 7  Time for action – implementing the motionBegan, motionEnded,  and motionCancelled methods We are now ready to start implementing the code that will be used to detect when a shake  has occurred on the iOS device. We will learn about the various motion methods and how to  implement these by following these simple steps:  1.	 To begin, open the ShakeExampleViewController.m implementation file,  located within the Classes folder of your project and add the following code:  -  void motionBegan: UIEventSubtype motion withEvent: UIEvent   * event {    if  event.type == UIEventTypeMotion && event.subtype ==   UIEventSubtypeMotionShake     {     self.view.backgroundColor=[UIColor yellowColor];     NSLog @"Device has been shaken" ;   } }  Next, we need to implement the code to handle when the motion has ended.  Unfortunately, it is not possible to track individual motions as you can do with touch  events.  2.	 Add the following code to our ShakeExampleViewController.m    implementation file:  * event {  -  void motionEnded: UIEventSubtype motion withEvent: UIEvent       if  event.type == UIEventTypeMotion && event.subtype ==   UIEventSubtypeMotionShake     {        Declare an instance of our Alert View dialog     UIAlertView *dialog;         Initialise our Alert View Window with options     dialog =[[UIAlertView alloc] initWithTitle:@"Device has   been         shaken" message:@"I was asleep, now i'm awake.        Press OK to reset" delegate:self cancelButtonTitle:nil         otherButtonTitles:@"OK",nil];              display our dialog and free the memory allocated by our   dialog         box      [dialog show];  [ 245 ]   Exploring the MultiTouch Interface      [dialog release];   } }    Responds to the options within our Alert View Dialog - void alertView: UIAlertView * alertView clickedButtonAtIndex:   NSInteger buttonIndex  {      String will be used to hold the text chosen for the button        pressed.  buttonIndex];    NSString *buttonTitle=[alertView buttonTitleAtIndex:    if  [buttonTitle isEqualToString:@"OK"]      {       self.view.backgroundColor=[UIColor greenColor];       NSLog @"Device has stopped shaking" ;     } }  Next we need to implement the motionCancelled event. This event is called  when the system thinks that the type of motion is not a shake.  3.	 Add the following code to our ShakeExampleViewController.m implementation   file:  -  void motionCancelled: UIEventSubtype motion   withEvent: UIEvent * event  {   self.view.backgroundColor=[UIColor blackColor];   NSLog @"Device shake has been cancelled" ; }  We have finally made it and now we are ready to Compile, Build and Run our ShakeExample  application. Given that you have typed in everything correctly, your code should compile  without any issues.  If all compiles well, your application should resemble something like what is shown in the  screenshot below showing the output when the device has been shaken and when it has  not. You will notice that where we have told our application to log those events, these  appear in the output window:  [ 246 ]   Chapter 7  So there you have it. In just a few simple steps, you can make your application shake-aware  and you can create some fantastic applications using this feature.  What just happened? In this section, we looked into the various methods that we can use to detect when a motion  happens on the iOS device. We looked at how to implement the motionBegan method  and set the background color to yellow when the iOS device has detected that a shake has  occurred.  When the device determines that the motion has stopped, the motionEnded method is  called and that is where we can detect what type of event happened. In this case, we then  declare and instantiate our instance of the UIAlertView class and display a message to the  user, alerting them that the shake has ended.  The method motionCancelled is called if the system thinks that the motion is not a  shake. Shakes are determined to be approximately a second or so in length. It then calls the  motionEnded method and sets the background color of our view controller to black.   [ 247 ]   Exploring the MultiTouch Interface  Have a go hero – modifying the ShakeExample application I will let you put into practice what you have just learnt.  What we need to do for this example is to expand and modify the message that comes up  when the device has been shaken to allow the user to choose from a number of options.  The first button will say Sleep, and the second one Awake. We want to be able to store the  chosen response value selected by the user and when Awake is pressed, we have a message  which says I was awake, now I am asleep, and vice-versa. One way to do this would be   as follows:  1.  Modify the otherButtonTitles property in the UIAlertView in the   2.  3.   motionEnded method.  Add the Awake and Sleep button titles. In the alertView: UIAlertView  method, create separate if statements for  both scenarios.  4.  Create another UIAlertView class variable in the above method with the   associated text.  5.  Once you have done this, Compile, Build and Run your application.  Once you have that working, you will have a more user-friendly application which lets the  user choose between two different responses and have the associated text display.

[ 24 ]   Chapter 7  Exploring the Accelerometer Gyroscope  So far you have been focusing on how to detect when a user performs taps, swipes, pinches  and how to detect device shakes. We now move on to the really exciting stuff, not that what  you have already covered is not exciting, but the iPhone's accelerometer is much more  powerful than you think and is capable of giving you live data for all three dimensions   of the  x, y, and z  axes when the phone is tilted.  The iPhone's accelerometer data is delivered via the UIAccelerometer class and the  delegate accelerometer:didAccelerate method which provides you with the data for  each of the three axes, each being of UIAcceleration class. Each of the values returned  has a range between -1 and +1 with 0 being the middle centre point. When the device is  moved or tilted, these values increase or decrease.  The iPhone 4 adds another sensor: a three-axis gyroscope, and when combining  the gyroscope with the accelerometer, this gives the iPhone 4 six axes on  which it can operate and was designed to make the iPhone 4 more sensitive,  responsive, and powerful for gaming.  Understanding the Core Motion Framework The Core Motion Framework is a system framework which obtains motion data from sensors  on the iPhone device. The application can then use these values. Handling of the sensor data  is handled within the Core Motion's own thread and it detects the motion events for the  accelerometer and the gyroscope  which is currently only available on the iPhone 4 :  [ 24 ]   Exploring the MultiTouch Interface  The table below describes each of the components which make up the Core Motion  framework:  CORE MOTION CLASSES CMMotionManager  DESCRIPTION This class defines a manager class which encapsulates  measurements of motion data.   CMDeviceMotion  CMAccelerometerData This class records measurement of device acceleration  and gathers data from the accelerometer for each of its  three axes. This captures device-motion data from both the  Accelerometer and Gyroscope. This is contained as part of the CMDeviceMotion  class and contains properties which give different  measurements of attitude, including the following: roll,  pitch, and yaw. This class records the devices rate of rotation along its  three spatial axes from the gyroscope.  CMGyroData  CMAttitude  The iPhone Simulator does not support the Accelerometer and Gyroscope  features, so in the event that you want to run the examples shown in this  chapter, you will need to deploy them to your iPhone device.  Sensing orientation In order to determine which way the iPhone device is facing, you can get this information by  using the UIDevice class and then using its orientation property.  By registering the UIDeviceOrientationDidChangeNotification notification method  of the UIDevice class, you are not only told when the iPhone has been rotated between the  Portrait and Landscape views, but also if the phone is in the facing up or facing down view.  We will be taking a look at these in more detail when we create our sample application for  this section.  Time for action – creating the OrientationExample project We will now proceed with creating our OrientationExample project which will show how  to determine when the device orientation changes:  1.  Launch Xcode from the  Xcode4 Applications folder. 2.  Choose Create a new Xcode project, or File  New Project.  [ 250 ]   Chapter 7  3.  You will be prompted to choose a project type and template. 4.  From the Project Template Dialog, select the View-based Application project type. 5.  Ensure that you have selected iPhone from the Device Family dropdown as the type   of View to create.  6.  Click on the Next button to proceed to the next step. 7.  Specify a name for the project which you want to create. 8.  Enter OrientationExample and then click on the Next button to proceed to the next  step in the wizard. You will then be asked to choose a location where you would like  to save the project.  Once our project has been created, you will be presented with the Xcode interface, along  with the project files that the template created for you within the Project Navigator Window:  9..  Open the OrientationExampleViewController.m implementation file, located  within the Classes folder of your project and locate the viewDidLoad method and  add the following code:     Implement viewDidLoad to do additional setup after loading   the view, typically from a nib.  -  void viewDidLoad {   [[UIDevice        currentDevice]beginGeneratingDeviceOrientationNotifications];       [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter]        addObserver:self selector:@selector hasOrientationChanged:        name:@”UIDeviceOrientationDidChangeNotification”       object:nil];    [super viewDidLoad]; }  10.  Next, we need to implement the method which will be responsible for handling   when changes in orientation have been detected. Add the following code:  -  void hasOrientationChanged: NSNotification * notification {   UIDeviceOrientation currentOrientation;   currentOrientation = [[UIDevice currentDevice] orientation];      switch  currentOrientation  {     case UIDeviceOrientationFaceUp:       self.view.backgroundColor = [UIColor brownColor];       break;     case UIDeviceOrientationFaceDown:  [ 251 ]   Exploring the MultiTouch Interface        self.view.backgroundColor = [UIColor magentaColor];       break;     case UIDeviceOrientationPortrait:       self.view.backgroundColor = [UIColor blueColor];       break;     case UIDeviceOrientationPortraitUpsideDown:        self.view.backgroundColor = [UIColor greenColor];       break;     case UIDeviceOrientationLandscapeLeft:         self.view.backgroundColor = [UIColor redColor];       break;     case UIDeviceOrientationLandscapeRight:        self.view.backgroundColor = [UIColor purpleColor];        break;     default:          Handle cases where orientation fails       self.view.backgroundColor = [UIColor blackColor];       break;   } }  We have finally made it and now we are ready to Compile, Build and Run our  OrientationExample application. Given that you have typed in everything correctly, your  code should compile without any issues. Try changing the different views of orientation by  pressing the Command + Left Arrow and Command + Right arrow if you are running this  within the iPhone simulator:  [ 252 ]   Chapter 7  So there you have it; in just a few simple steps, you can make your applications determine  and respond to a device when its view orientation has changed.  What just happened? What we covered in this section were the steps involved in to creating our  OrientationExample project. We began by telling our iPhone device to start generating  notifications for each of the changes in orientation and then set up an observer to the  UIDeviceOrientationDidChangeNotification notification class which is fired each  time the device changes its orientation. Next, we determine the current orientation that our  phone is in by using deriving this from the UIDeviceOrientation class. We then proceed  and determine what the current orientation is by using a case statement and then change  the background color of our view.  Have a go hero – modify the OrientationExample application I will let you put into practice what you have just learnt.  Our application needs be modified slightly to allow it to only change the color when the  device is in Portrait and Landscape Left. One way to do this would be as follows:  1.  Modify the hasOrientationChanged method in the   OrientationExampleViewController.m implementation file.  2.  Comment out cases where they do not equal UIDeviceOrientationPortrait   and UIDeviceOrientationLandscape.  3.  Once you have done this, Compile, Build and Run your application.  Once you have that working, you will have an application that provides interaction with the  user when the device is in Portrait and Landscape.  Pop quiz – sensing orientation  1.  What class determines the current orientation of the iOS device?  a.  UIDevice b.  UIOrientation c.  UIDeviceOrientation  2.  What method needs to be initialized to allow for device orientation notifications?  a. UIDeviceCurrentDevice b. beginGeneratingDeviceOrientationNotifications  [ 253 ]   Exploring the MultiTouch Interface  Detecting device tilting In this example, we will be looking at how to derive the values from our Accelerometer and  Gyroscope and set the background color of our view as well as setting the background to  fade in and out from transparent to opaque when the device is tilted.  By using the Accelerometer and Gyroscope, you will be able to create some great  applications; from car games to flight simulators. You will have a reasonable amount of  understanding on how to go about implementing both of these in your own applications  after having gone through the next section.  Time for action – creating the AccelGyroExample project We will now proceed with creating our AccelGyroExample project which will show how to  determine and handle the accelerometer and gyroscope features:  1.  Launch Xcode from the  Xcode4 Applications folder. 2.  Choose Create a new Xcode project, or File  New Project. 3.  You will be prompted to choose a project type and template. 4.  From the Project Template Dialog, select the View-based Application project type. 5.  Ensure that you have selected iPhone from the Device Family drop-down as the type   of View to create.  6.  Click on the Next button to proceed to the next step. 7.  Specify a name for the project which you want to create. 8.  Enter AccelGyroExample and then click on the Next button to proceed to the next  step in the wizard. You will then be asked to choose a location where you would like  to save the project.  Once your project has been created, you will be presented with the Xcode interface, along  with the project files that the template created for you within the Project Navigator Window.  Before we can start using the Accelerometer and Gyroscope features of the iPhone, we need  to add an important framework to our project to enable us to use the accelerometer, so let’s  do that now by following these steps:  In the project navigator, select and highlight your project.  1.  2.  Select and click on your Target. 3.  Select the Build Phases tab.  [ 254 ]   4.  Open the Link Binaries With Libraries expander. 5.  Click the + button. 6.  Select the CoreMotion.Framework framework from the list. 7.  Click Add:  Chapter 7  Now that you have added the CoreMotion.Framework into your project, you need to import  the code into the View Controller which will be responsible for handling the motion:  1.  Open the AccelGyroExampleViewController.h implementation file, located   within the Classes folder of your project and add the following code. You will  notice that we have also included the CoreMotion CoreMotion.h interface file  so that we can make use of the methods that this class contains:  import   import    @interface AccelGyroExampleViewController : UIViewController    {    CMMotionManager *motionManager; }  @property  nonatomic, retain  CMMotionManager *motionManager;  @end  [ 255 ]   Exploring the MultiTouch Interface  2.  Next, we need to create a property object which will enable us to  reference the instance variable motionManager from within our  AccelGyroExampleViewController.m implementation file: import “AccelGyroExampleViewController.h”  @implementation AccelGyroExampleViewController  @synthesize motionManager;  3.  Next, open the AccelGyroExampleViewController.m implementation file,  located within the Classes folder of your project and add the following code as  shown in the code snippet below:    Handle processing of the Accelerometer  - void handleAcceleration: UIAccelerometer * accelerometer     didAccelerate: UIAcceleration * acceleration {   UIAccelerationValue xAxes;   UIAccelerationValue yAxes;   UIAccelerationValue zAxes;      xAxes = acceleration.x;      yAxes = acceleration.y;   zAxes = acceleration.z;      if  xAxes > 0.5  {        Check to see if we are Moving Right     self.view.backgroundColor = [UIColor purpleColor];    } else if  xAxes < -0.5  {    Check to see if we are Moving Left     self.view.backgroundColor = [UIColor redColor];   } else if  yAxes > 0.5  {     Check to see if we are Upside  Down.     self.view.backgroundColor = [UIColor yellowColor];    } else if  yAxes < -0.5  {    Check to see if we are Standing  Up.     self.view.backgroundColor = [UIColor blueColor];   } else if  zAxes > 0.5  {     Check to see if we are Facing Up.     self.view.backgroundColor = [UIColor magentaColor];    } else if  zAxes < -0.5  {    Check to see if we are Facing  Down.     self.view.backgroundColor = [UIColor greenColor];   }   double value = fabs xAxes ;   if  value > 1.0  { value = 1.0;}   self.view.alpha = value; }    Handles rotation of the Gyroscope -  void doGyroRotation: CMRotationRate rotation {   double value =   [ 256 ]   Chapter 7       fabs rotation.x +fabs rotation.y +fabs rotation.z   8.0;   if  value > 1.0  { value = 1.0;}   self.view.alpha = value; }  4.  Next, open the AccelGyroExampleViewController.m implementation file,  located within the Classes folder of your project and locate the viewDidLoad  method and add the following code:    Checks to see if Gyroscope is available on the device -  BOOL  isGyroscopeAvailable { ifdef __IPHONE_4_0   CMMotionManager *gyroManager = [[CMMotionManager alloc] init];     gyroManager.gyroUpdateInterval = 1.0 60.0;   BOOL gyroAvailable = gyroManager.gyroAvailable;   [gyroManager release];   return gyroAvailable; else   return NO; endif }  5.  We now need to add some code to our viewDidLoad method. With the   AccelGyroExampleViewController.m still open, locate the viewDidLoad and  add the following code: -  void viewDidLoad {     Set up our accelerometer interval and delegate   UIAccelerometer *accelerometer =[UIAccelerometer          sharedAccelerometer];   accelerometer.updateInterval = 0.5;   accelerometer.delegate = self;             Check to see if the device supports the Gyroscope feature   if  [self isGyroscopeAvailable] == YES  {     motionManager = [[CMMotionManager alloc] init];     [motionManager      startGyroUpdatesToQueue:[NSOperationQueue currentQueue]      withHandler:^ CMGyroData *gyroData, NSError *error       {       [self doGyroRotation:gyroData.rotationRate];     }];   }   else {    Device does not support the gyroscope feature  [ 257 ]   Exploring the MultiTouch Interface      NSLog @”No Gyroscope detected. Upgrade to an iPhone 4.” ;     [motionManager release];   }   self.view.backgroundColor = [UIColor magentaColor];    [super viewDidLoad]; }  6..  Our final step is to release the memory used by our view controller objects which   we declared in our AccelGyroExampleViewController.h interface file, located  within the Classes folder of your project. Add the following highlighted code as  shown in the code snippet below to your dealloc method: -  void dealloc {   [motionManager release];   [super dealloc]; }  7.  We have finally made it to the end of the chapter and now we are ready to Compile,   Build and Run our AccelGyroExample application.  Since the iOS Simulator does not support the accelerometer and Gyroscope  features, you will need to deploy this example to your iPhone device in order  to see this working.  The screenshot below shows how the iPhone responds to changes on its three axes when  the iPhone is tilted. Under normal gravity, each of these values will be between -1 and +1  with a value of 0 being the middle centre point. Moving the phone in a rapid motion will  increase these values:  [ 25 ]   Chapter 7  What just happened? What we have done in this section is implement the UIAccelerometerDelegate  protocol so that we can use this within our AccelGyroExampleViewController. m implementation file. We then declare an instance CMMotionManager variable  motionManager which will enable us to use the accelerometer and gyroscope  features. We then need to synthesize our property which we declared within our  AccelGyroExampleViewController.h interface file. If we don’t declare this, we will  receive warning error messages which can cause unexpected application errors. We have  also mentioned this in previous chapters as this is common practice to release the memory  used by these objects once you have finished using them.  Next, we declare our methods which will handle the accelerometer and the gyroscope  features. In the first part, we declare a delegate to the UIAccelerometer class, and then  derive the values for the x, y, and z axes, which will be used to determine the current   device orientation; then we set the background color accordingly. As a final step, we set   the background alpha property from transparent to opaque depending on whether the   value is within the range 0.0 to 1.0, where 0.0 represents totally transparent, and 1.0  represents opaque.  When you set the alpha property of a view, it only affects the current view and  does not affect any of its embedded subviews. The fabs function is a C C++  library function which returns the absolute value of X.  In our next step, we determine by using the Ifdef __IPHONE_4_0 directive if the device  currently in use is an iPhone 4. If this is the case, it then checks to see if the device supports  the gyroscope feature and a Boolean status YES is returned; otherwise NO is returned.  Next, we set up our UIAccelerometer delegate and update the interval to be twice per  second in order to request updates. We then make a call to our isGyroscopeAvailable  function to check to see if the gyroscope feature is supported. We then set up a call to the  startGyroUpdatesToQueue function and add a handler to call our doGryroRotation  function which then updates the alpha blend color of our view. If no gyroscope feature is  supported, this is logged out to the debug window.  To start receiving and handling rotation-rate data for the gyroscope feature, you  need to create an instance of the CMMotionManager class and call one of the  following methods to it.  [ 25 ]   Exploring the MultiTouch Interface  The following table explains each of the method calls relating to the CMMotionManager  class:  CMMotionManager Methods startGyroUpdates  startGyroUpdatesToQueue: withHandler  stopGyroUpdates  Summary  DESCRIPTION When this method is called, Core Motion kicks in and  continuously updates the gyroData property of the  CMMotionManager class with the latest measurement  of activity.  Before calling this method, you need to ensure that you  have set the update interval of the gyroUpdateInterval  property. When this method is called, it creates an  NSOperationQueue event which queues the  gyroscope event which then fires when the update  interval has been reached, then calls the function and  passes it the latest gyroscope data. This method turns off the core motion sensors and stops  all updates of motion data. It is a good idea to always stop  gyro updates as this will save battery power.   In this chapter, we learned about the MultiTouch Architecture and how to go about detecting  taps, swipes, pinching and device shaking and tilting. We also looked into one of the new  features which come as part of the iPhone 4, that being the Gyroscope feature.  Now that we have learned about the various ways in which we can handle and respond to  device Multi-Touch features, we are ready to learn how to debug projects and explore the  new debugging feature improvements and code analysis to help you eliminate bugs within  your applications.  In the next chapter, we will be taking a look into how to go about Debugging your Xcode  Projects, and taking a look at the new and improved debugger, as well as learning how to go  about creating a new debugging project. We will also look at how we can use Fix-It to correct  syntax errors and code as you type. We will also learn about breakpoints, and how to define  schemes within your project workspace, as well as using static analysis to show code flow.  [ 260 ]     Debugging Xcode Projects  In this chapter, we will look at how we go about debugging our projects  through the use of the various debugging tools that Xcode provides. We will look at the following methods to debug code:      Fix-it, which corrects code as you type and provides you with some   great coding alternatives Static Analysis, which shows you potential coding errors, that is,   memory leaks and dead or unreachable code  In this chapter, we will be covering the following topics:            Introducing the new and improved debugger Creating, running, and debugging projects Setting up project schemes using the Scheme Editor Navigating through threads and stacks within the Debugger Finding potential coding errors by using Fix-it and the Static Analyzer  We have got quite a bit to cover, so let's get started.  Introducing the new and improved Debugger  The Xcode Debugger is a collection of sophisticated tools that allows you to monitor your  application as it runs, and provides you with information about the current state of the  program line by line.   Debugging Xcode Projects  This has been fully integrated into the Xcode 4 workspace environment and any errors or  issues will be automatically displayed within the Project Navigator. Through effectively using  the Debugger, it will give insights into how your code is performing and, most importantly,  helpful pointers to where it may be going wrong.  The following screenshot shows the various parts of the Xcode Debugger:  The Xcode Debugger contains a console pane, which is used to log output messages as well  as variables, and a register pane, which can display the values of variables on the stack, as  well as the methods.  The Xcode Debugger window consists of the following parts; these are explained in greater  detail in the following sections.  Debugger toolbar The Debugger toolbar consists of a number of items for you to be able to step into your  code line by line to determine where an error has occurred. This also enables you to check  the value of a particular variable to ensure that it is being assigned a value correctly. These  options become available when your execution stops at a breakpoint within your code.  [ 262 ]   The screenshot below displays the debugging toolbar which becomes available when your  project is in debugging mode:  Chapter 8  Stack trace panel The Stack Panel window enables you to look at each file running within the stack. This view is  particularly useful if your code stops at a breakpoint, and you want to see a list of all threads  that were running up to the point the program halted.  The screenshot below displays the stack trace panel toolbar, displaying all of the associated  threads that your application is running when a breakpoint has been encountered within  your code:  Disassembly view The Disassembly window enables you to trace through a stack dump within your program  logic to determine where the crash occurred. You are also able to examine program variables  and registers of all files within your project.  [ 263 ]   Debugging Xcode Projects  The screenshot below displays the Xcode Disassembly view whenever your program causes a  crash, due to a piece of faulty code that has been detected within your code:  Code Editor window The Code Editor window shown below is where you start to provide the instructions to build  your application. This editor is where you can navigate to other files within your workspace,  as well as enabling you to debug your projects:  [ 264 ]   Console output window The console output window as shown below displays all compiler messages as well as any  messages logged using the NSLog function:  Chapter 8  You can specify the type of output the console displays by using the pop up menu in the   top-left corner of the console pane. The descriptions of each of these types are given below:  CONSOLE OUTPUT TYPES All Output  Debugger Output Target Output  DESCRIPTION Displays both Target and Debugger Output. This is the default  view for this window. Only displays output information relating to the Debugger. Only displays output information relating to the Target.  The following screenshot displays a list of all the variables and registers that are currently  used by your application:  [ 265 ]   Debugging Xcode Projects  You are able to specify which items you would like to display by using the pop up menu item  within the variables pane. A description of each of these types is given below:  VARIABLES PANE TYPES Auto Local All  DESCRIPTION Displays a listing of all recently accessed variables. Displays only locally accessible variables. Displays both Variables and Registers. This is the default view for  this window.  The default setting for both of these views is All or All Output. Don't worry; we will be using  these when we start to debug our sample application in the section Running and Debugging  the Project.  Creating a new debugging project  Before you can start to use the Debugger, you will need to create an application to debug.  We will create a small simple application, which will highlight this. The program will set the  background color of the view to red and display some text in the console view window.  Time for action – creating the DebuggingExample project Before we can proceed, we first need to create the DebuggingExample project. To refresh To refresh  your memory, you can refer to the section Creating your first iPhone application which we  covered in Chapter 2, Introducing the Xcode 4 Workspace:  1.  Launch Xcode from the  Xcode4 Applications folder. 2.  Choose Create a new Xcode project, or File  New Project. 3.  You will be prompted to choose a project type and template. 4.  From the Project Template Dialog, select the View-based Application project type. 5.  Ensure that you have selected iPhone from the Device Family drop-down as the type   of View to create.  6.  Click on the Next button to proceed to the next step. 7.  Specify a name for the project that you want to create. 8.  Enter DebuggingExample and then click on the Next button to proceed to the next   step in the wizard. You will then be asked to choose a location where you would like  to save the project.  [ 266 ]   Chapter 8  Once our project has been created, you will be presented with the Xcode interface, along  with the project files that the template created for you within the Project Navigator window.  We now need to implement the code, which will be used to set the background color of our  view, as well as being able to log messages out to the Debugger console window:  1.  Next, open the DebuggingExampleViewController.m implementation file.  2.  Then scroll down and locate the viewDidLoad method, and enter the following   code snippet:     Implement viewDidLoad to do additional setup after loading     the view, typically from a nib. -  void viewDidLoad {   [super viewDidLoad];    NSLog @"Hello, welcome to XCode 4!" ;      int x = 42;   float y = 150.00;   NSLog @"Value of x = %i, Value of y = %f", x, y ;        self.view.backgroundColor = [UIColor redColor];   NSLog @"Value of 100 divided by 0 = %i",  100   0  ;   }   What just happened? In the above section, we looked at the steps involved in creating our Debugging example  project. We then inserted some code in our viewDidLoad method and declared two  variables int and float and assigned each a value, before logging messages and the values   of these variables out to our Debugger Console Output window using the NSLog method.  We then proceeded to set the background color of our view to be red using the UIColor  class, before finally logging the value of what 100 divided by 0 is  which as we know will give  us a runtime error . In the next part, we will look at how we are able to Build and Run   our application.  [ 267 ]   Debugging Xcode Projects  Running and debugging the project  Now you are ready to Build and Run your application. Click on the Run button within the  Xcode 4 IDE, or select the Product  Run DebuggingExample.  You will notice that when you build the application, there is an immediate problem and the  build fails. The following screenshot shows the Build Log results tab with the resultant error,  as well as the line of code that the compiler has found to be causing the problem:  For more information on the Debugger, refer to the Apple Developer Documentation at:  http:  developer.apple.com library mac documentation toolslanguages  conceptual xcode4userguide debugging debugging.html.  Handling errors No software application is ever perfect. There will be times when you will need to revisit  the code to correct a coding problem, or to change the way the code is performing due to a  change in user requirements. Xcode provides you with the tools to make your life easier, and  prevent coding issues from happening. There are three common forms of error, which we  will see in the following sections.  [ 26 ]   Chapter 8  Runtime errors These types of error cause your program to stop executing. It can be caused by an unhandled  exception due to an out of memory issue, or if you are writing some data to a database, you  may have exceeded the allowable size that the field can handle.  In most cases, you will receive an error message, but in some cases your application will  likely crash or hang.  Syntax errors These types of errors are the most obvious, simply because your program will not compile   and therefore won't run  until all of them are fixed. Generally, syntax errors come from  typographical errors.  The Objective-C compiler in Xcode is case-sensitive, which means that UIcolor and UIColor  are treated differently. For example, in Objective-C, the compiler can understand the following:  self.view.backgroundColor = [UIColor redColor];  But if you type in:  self.view.backgroundColor = [UIColor redcolor];  The compiler will call it a syntax error, because you've specified language-specific  syntax   that it can't recognize. Whilst this may be a small error to you, it is phenomenal to the  computer. Even forgetting the semicolon at the end of that line would give you a syntax   error. Syntax errors are very easy to identify, since the compiler recognizes them on its own.  Logic errors These types of errors occur when you have created a piece of code logic which is not  performing correctly and producing the correct results. It is worth mentioning here, that the  program will do what you tell it to do, the classic catch phrase, Garbage-In-Garbage-Out  GIGO .  A classic example of a logic error would be when you are dividing a value by zero, but not  checking to see if the denominator is zero first. During the building phase of your project,  Xcode will bring your attention to this error, but will still go ahead and build and run   the application:  [ 26 ]   Debugging Xcode Projects  As you can see from the previous screenshot, Xcode has cleverly detected that the piece of  code within the NSLog statement can potentially cause your application to stop executing  and crash your application. A better approach would be to store these values in separate  variables and check to see if the value is greater than zero prior to executing the statement.  Using Fix-it to correct code as you type When your target is set to use the LLVM compiler, a new feature called Fix-it scans your  source code as you type. Fix-it marks syntax errors and misspelt words with a red line at the  position where the error was located and a red exclamation mark symbol is placed within the  gutter area of your project workspace.  Time for action – setting up the LLVM compiler To set up your project to use the LLVM Compiler, you will need to adjust the settings for your  project workspace by following these simple steps:  1.  In the project navigator, select and highlight your project. 2.  Select and click on your Target. 3.  Select the Build Settings tab. 4.  Scroll down to the C C++ Compiler Version. 5.  Select the LLVM compiler 2.0 option from the list.  The following screenshot shows you how to go about setting the project target to use the  LLVM 2.0 Compiler:  [ 270 ]   Chapter 8  Now that you have changed the default compiler to use the LLVM Compiler 2.0, your project  will start to use and compile all code using this new version.  Take for example, the following piece of code as shown in the screenshot below where we  are setting the background color of our view to red.  We have obviously mistakenly forgotten to add a semicolon to the end of our method and  the LLVM compiler has detected this for us and has provided us with some suggestions. To  accept one of the proposed changes given by the compiler, click on the item and watch your  code update automatically. Clicking on the symbols located in the gutter bar displays an error  message describing the possible syntax error and in some cases offers to repair this for you  automatically:  What just happened? In the above section, we looked at the steps required to configure our project to use the  LLVM 2.0 Compiler. We also took a look at the use of Fix-it to correct coding pitfalls when  typing directly into the Xcode 4 IDE.  As you can see, Fix-it is a great tool for finding and fixing your code on-the-fly and is a great  companion to the rigorous testing performed by the static analyzer tool, which will walk  through thousands of potential code paths, looking for places where code, while perfectly  valid, could potentially cause unexpected results.  Some of the common programming pitfalls are due to allocating memory that is never  released, improperly constructed code loops, or case statements that have not properly  been assigned a default value, resulting in them never falling into a condition.   For more information on Fix-it, please refer to the Apple Developer  Documentation at: http:  developer.apple.com library  mac documentation toolslanguages conceptual  xcode4userguide debugging debugging.html.  [ 271 ]   Debugging Xcode Projects  Debugging with breakpoints Although you can use the Debugger to pause execution of your program at any time and  view the state of the running code, it's usually helpful to set breakpoints before running   your executable so you can stop at known points and view the values of variables in your  source code.  A breakpoint is basically just an instruction in code that tells the application to "stop" when  the breakpoint is reached, and the execution of the program pauses, waiting for further  instructions as to what to do next. During this phase, you have the opportunity to either  inspect the current values of any of the properties, or step through the code.  Adding a breakpoint is easy and is done by following these simple steps:  1.  Click within the grey gutter area to the left of the code editor using your mouse. 2.  You will notice that a blue arrow appears at the line which you have selected:  Removing Breakpoints are a breeze too and can be done as follows:  1.  Right-click on the breakpoint arrow. 2.  Then select Delete Breakpoint from the list of options or simply drag it off from the   gutter area:  The Breakpoints menu includes a variety of other useful debugging options, which are  explained below:    Edit Breakpoint: Several options can be set for each breakpoint, such as setting the  number of times to pass through the breakpoint before it is triggered, or specifying  a conditional breakpoint.  [ 272 ]   There is also an option of having it perform an action, such as logging a message to the  Debugger console window, or executing a shell command, or even playing a sound:  Chapter 8      Disable Breakpoint: This sets the color of the breakpoint to more of a washed out  transparent blue. The breakpoint will still be displayed within the gutter bar, but will  no longer be active and your program will not stop at this location. Reveal in Breakpoint Navigator: This will display a list of all breakpoints  with   this option set  within the Breakpoint Navigator pane. It displays the module   name, function, and line number at which the breakpoint occurs as shown in   the screenshot below:  Using NSLog to track changing properties There are times when you want to place your own form of debugging into your projects.  These could be, for instance, to check on the status of a variable or to check why an event   is not firing inside your code. This is where the NSLog function comes in.  Any statements that you log using the NSLog function will be echoed out to the Xcode's  Debugger Console window, which appears when you build and run your application. The  console window can be displayed by pressing the Command + Shift + R key combinations.  [ 273 ]   The NSLog function takes an NSString argument that can optionally contain what are  called string format specifiers. The table below provides a list of some of these types:  Debugging Xcode Projects  STRING FORMAT SPECIFIER %@  %d %f %c %s %x  DESCRIPTION An Objective-C   object using the description or  descriptionWithLocale : results. Displays the result as a signed integer  32-bit . Displays the result as a floating point value. Displays the result as an unsigned character. Displays the result as a null-terminated character string array. Displays the result as an unsigned hexadecimal value.  The table above only lists the most commonly used string formats.  If you are interested in seeing the full list, you can access these at:  http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Printf.  The NSlog function takes a variable number of arguments which are inserted into the string  at the location of the specifiers, which is quite similar to the printf   function as found within  the Standard C library.  The string format specifier is basically displayed as a percent  %  symbol, which is then  followed by one or two characters indicating the type of the variable that will be displayed.  Consider the following code snippet below. It has been written using the C-Notation:   int   x = 42;  float y = 150.00  printf "%s","Hello, welcome to XCode 4!" ;  NSLog @"Hello, welcome to XCode 4!" ;  NSLog @"Value of x = %i, Value of y = %f", x, y ;  When you Build and Run the above code output, the text is logged out to the Xcode  Debugger output window as shown in the screenshot below:  [ 274 ]   Chapter 8  It is worth mentioning that the NSLog function is merely a means of logging output to the window  when you want to see if an event is being fired or the value of a variable. It is highly recommended  that prior to releasing your product for distribution, you remove or comment out all references made  to NSLog from within your project as this will end up writing out to the filesystem, and will take up  unnecessary space on the user iOS device.  Exploring the new Debugger  Given the flexibility of the Xcode Developer Tools you have come to expect, there are several  ways to use the debugging features within the Xcode development environment. You have  several ways in which you can debug your projects. These are listed below:        The Code Editor The Debugger window The Console view  Debugging features in the Code Editor The debugging features only apply to the code editor within the Xcode development  workspace. If you set breakpoints in your code, you will see the Debugger toolbar when   your program stops at the breakpoint in your code. The screenshot below shows the  Debugger toolbar:  The Debugger toolbar is context-sensitive, which means that it will only be visible while you  are in the middle of debugging. When your debugging session completes, the normal Code  Editor Toolbar is restored. The buttons on the debugging toolbar enable you to:              Open or close the Debugger area window Pause or resume execution of your code Step over a method Step into a method Step out of the current method See exception and other messages, such as the current method name and the  executing threads  [ 275 ]   Debugging Xcode Projects  It is worth mentioning that if you hold down the Option or Option + Shift  buttons when clicking on the step over or step into controls, this will provide  you with different ways in which you can step through your code. You can step through your code using the assembly language instructions view,  instead of by statements; or if you prefer, you can step directly into the currently  active thread.  The Activity Viewer Progress window We touched on this briefly in Chapter 2, Introducing the Xcode 4 workspace, so this section will  just be a refresher in case you may have forgotten. Basically, the Activity Viewer  or Progress  window  shows you the progress of tasks which are currently executing. These tasks may fall  along the lines of building your project, or you may be using the Static Analysis feature to  analyze your project for syntax or code errors.  The Activity Viewer can also show you any compiler warnings or syntax errors and any  information relating to project builds:  Defining a scheme for project builds using the Scheme Editor Schemes are not new to Xcode 4; they have existed since the release of Xcode 3. In previous  releases of Xcode, you had to configure each of the items separately when setting an active  target, a build configuration, and an executable. This posed many issues as all of these were  linked to one another. This is where Schemes come in.  Schemes can be thought of as separate configurations, meaning that you can create  a scheme to specify which targets to build, what configuration build to use, and what  executable environment to use when the product specified by the target is launched.  This could be if you wanted to target a specific iOS version, or if you wanted to have the  application launch within the simulator.  [ 276 ]   Chapter 8  Time for action – using the Scheme Editor to define a Scheme In Xcode 4, whenever you open an existing Xcode project, or create a new one, Xcode 4  automatically creates a default scheme for you. This scheme allows you to either test your  application within the iOS Simulator or have it deployed to an iOS device. Additional schemes  can be created, and in this section we will see how this can be done:  1.  To select a scheme, you can use the Scheme popup menu, which is located in the   upper-left corner of the Xcode workspace:  2.  In order to create a new scheme, choose the New Scheme… option. Alternatively, if  you wanted to edit the active scheme, you would choose the Edit Active Scheme…  menu option. These options are also available under the Product menu bar.  Each scheme can be set to do a specific task; for instance, you may have a scheme to do a  Debug build, and one to handle the Release or Distribution. Various types of build options  are available for building, testing, running, profiling  using instruments , and archiving   your products.  There is no limit on the number of schemes that you can define. However, only one scheme  can be active at a time.  3.  Schemes can also be managed by choosing the Manage Schemes… option from the   popup menu, or similarly from the Product menu.  You can specify whether schemes should be stored per project, in which case it will be made  available to every workspace that includes that project; or be stored within the workspace  environment it's currently in.  [ 277 ]   Debugging Xcode Projects  The following screenshot shows you how you can go about customizing the active scheme:  You can specify the type of Build Configuration to use, the type of Debugger, and the   current working directory to use. You can also choose to have your product run at a   higher resolution. This enables you to simulate your application running at different   display resolutions.  What just happened? In this section, we looked at how we are able to define and manage schemes in Xcode 4  using the Scheme Editor. We also looked at the ways in which we can use the Scheme   Editor to define a separate scheme for Debug, Release, and Distribution.  Viewing the Static Analysis results There may be times when you want to examine the syntax of your code for bugs. This is  where the Static Analyzer comes in. It was first introduced in Xcode 3, which opened and  displayed the build results within a new window. Xcode 4 lets you perform the analysis,  examine the results, and apply the fixes to your source files all within the Xcode 4 workspace.  [ 27 ]   Chapter 8  Time for action – running the Static Analyzer To run the Static Analyzer, follow these simple steps:  1.  Select your project from the project Navigator. 2.  From the Product menu, select Analyze or alternatively, hold down the Command + I   key combinations:  When the analyzer finishes checking your code for problems, the issues navigator opens  automatically showing you a list of issues that were found with your project as shown in the  following screenshot:  Clicking on an issue within this view will open the file in question, and display the problem  which has been marked with a blue triangle. Clicking on this triangle will display the faulty  flow of logic that has been identified and detected by the analyzer.  [ 27 ]   Debugging Xcode Projects  What just happened? In this section, we looked at how we can use the Static Analyzer to validate our program to  ensure that it is free from problems and how we are able to use the Issues Navigator to jump  directly into the code file at the location where the faulty code that was causing the issue  was found.   Time for action – configuring your project to perform automatic  Static Analysis Xcode offers you an option to automatically analyze your code whenever your project is  built. In this section, we will look at how we can configure our project by following these  simple steps.  To set up your project to use the Static Analyzer, you will need to adjust the settings for your  project workspace as shown below:  1.  In the project navigator, select and highlight your project. 2.  Select and click on your target. 3.  Select the Build Settings tab. 4.  Scroll down to the Run Static Analyzer. 5.  Select the Yes option from the list. The default option is  from the list. The default option is No.  Now that you have changed the default compiler to use the Static Analyzer, your project will  start to use this when you compile and build your application:  [ 20 ]   Chapter 8  You have successfully updated the build configuration for your project. Now when you build  your application, it will also run the Static Analyzer.  What just happened? In this section, we looked at how we are able to configure a project to perform automatic  static analysis when the project is built, by following simple steps to modify the configuration  of the project build.  Time for action – Detecting a memory leak Memory leaks are a very serious type of bug that the static analyzer can help you discover. As  you can see in the following screenshot, the analyzer has detected a potential memory leak  for the instance of NSString.  If your project does not release objects which have been declared from memory, you are  opening the doors to some serious issues which can affect your application, and make it run  out of memory very quickly which may result in your application crashing. We will take a look  at an example and add some code to our project to show you how memory leaks occur:  1.  Firstly, open the file main.m located within the Supporting Files folder of your   project, and add the following code as shown in the snippet below:    ----------------------------------------------------------    Example: Potential Memory Leak    ---------------------------------------------------------- void performMemoryleak   {   NSString *obj = [[NSString alloc] init];       [obj doubleValue];     Add this to prevent memory leaks.     [obj release];  }  [ 21 ]   Debugging Xcode Projects  You will notice that when the Static Analyzer ran through our project, it picked up some  serious issues with the code which resulted in it flagging that a potential memory leak is  being performed. The blue arrows in the screenshot below show the program flow of the  object that is being allocated memory and it has been determined that the object has not  been freed:  What just happened? In the above code example, we declared a variable object obj of type NSString and  allocated memory to this object. We then called the doubleValue method on this object,  before finally exiting the function. Since we are not using garbage collection to release this  object from the stack, it will result in a serious case of memory leakage.  Time for action – detecting an instance of an uninitialized  variable Another type of common error made by developers is variables which have not been  initialized upon being declared. Fortunately, the Static Analyzer can also catch these types   of bugs.  To demonstrate how the Static Analyzer helps detect instances of uninitialized variables, we  will use the following code:  1.  Open the file main.m located within the Supporting Files folder of    your project.  2.  Enter the following piece of code as shown in the snippet below:     ----------------------------------------------------------    Example: Uninitialized Variable being declared    ---------------------------------------------------------- int setReturnValue int _varX  {   int number;      if  _varX > 100    [ 22 ]   Chapter 8    {     number = _varX * 2;   }   else if  _varX == 100    {     number = _varX - 50;   }    return number; }  In the following screenshot, you will notice that the static analyzer has flagged the variable  number as a potential error. This is due to the fact that the variable  was uninitialized  and is  returned with some random value. This is due to the fact that the number was not initialized  upon declaration.  If the if-else clause fails due to the value of _varX resulting in a negative value, the variable  number will remain unassigned, resulting in your application producing unexpected   random results.  You will also notice that the analyzer provides additional detail when you click on the  message bubbles and displays the control-flow  as shown by the blue arrows , and a set   of events that give a full diagnosis of the bug. Many of the issues that are reported by the  Static Analyzer tool have this information, and this makes analysis and fixing of these errors   much easier:  What just happened? In the above section, we looked at how we can use the power of the Static Analyzer to detect  variables which have not yet been initialized within our application. We also looked at how  the static analyzer uses control-flows  highlighted by the blue arrows  to show the execution  path of your code. This helps prevent unexpected results from happening within code that  should execute, but doesn't.  [ 23 ]   Debugging Xcode Projects  Viewing the Issues Navigator During the building of your application, the compiler checks your code to ensure that it is  syntactically correct and that no errors exist. However, if the compiler finds any problems  during the building of your project, the issues navigator window opens and displays all  potential errors and warnings that were found.  The issues navigator can be changed to show problems broken down By File or By Type.   If you select any of the errors or warning messages that are  displayed within the list,   they will automatically display within the source code editor at the line where the error   was discovered.   The following screenshot displays potential errors that were found within the project. This  list can be broken down to display by File or By File Type:  Viewing the Program Build log The Build log contains a history of all project builds that are contained within your project  workspace. This list contains all warnings and error messages that were found during each  stage of the project build process, and contains the date and timestamp. When you   select one of the project builds in the build log, the results are displayed within the   editor window area.  Double-clicking on a warning or error message will open the source file and jump to the line  containing the error. The build log window can display the results in a compact normal view   default  as shown in the screenshot below, or in a more verbose type  full build  form, as  shown in the second screenshot.  [ 24 ]   The screenshot shown below displays the Build Log in Compact View. This view is more of a  condensed view, which unlike the verbose mode view, shows minimal information:  Chapter 8  The screenshot below displays the Build Log in the verbose view, which provides us with a bit  more information about the types of errors we are receiving. It provides the module name,  line number s , and the piece of code which is potentially causing the problem:  [ 25 ]   Debugging Xcode Projects  Understanding and using code completion Code completion makes your development experience a lot easier by having Xcode   provide you with suggestions when you have entered enough letters for Xcode to make a  reasonable guess as to what you are intending to type and it will then display the suggestion  as dimmed text.  The following screenshot displays a list of inline suggestions for completing the symbol name  that is being entered, as well as a list of all its possibilities. If there is no common prefix, code  completion shows the dotted underline up to the next uppercase letter in the symbol:  Time for action – working with code completion To accept the auto completion suggestion, follow these simple steps:  1.  Press the Tab key and the code will be inserted just as if you had typed in the    whole thing.  2.  Press Return to accept the entire auto completion suggestion. You will notice from   the screenshot below that Xcode is smart enough to work out what you intended to  type in. As soon as you get to a point in each line, it will display an autocompleted  version of the code:  [ 26 ]   Chapter 8  A Quick Help popup is also available from code completion, even when the Quick Help  inspector is not open. Hover over the code completion option you're interested in until a  question mark icon appears:  3.  Click the question mark or use the Command + Shift + Control + ? keyboard short-cut   to display the Quick-Help for the method.  4.  When you have finished, click on the Done button in the Quick Help popup to cancel   the operation:  5.  Press the Tab key to accept only the sub-word or Return to accept the entire   suggestion. Xcode will even try to complete method names, variables that you have  declared, as well as anything else related to the project that it might recognize.  If you look at the example where we type in the CGRectMake method, Xcode displays an  auto completed version of the code as shown in the screenshot below:     6.  Press Control + Space bar to toggle the completion suggestion on or off. That is,  if the inline suggestion and list are being displayed, pressing Control + Space bar  cancels the code completion operation. If there is no suggestion displayed, place  the cursor at the end of a partially typed symbol and press Control + Space bar to get  completion suggestions.  [ 27 ]   Debugging Xcode Projects  In Xcode 4, pressing the Esc key cancels the operation and pressing the Delete  key always deletes the preceding character.  What just happened? In this section, we looked at how we can use the code completion features of the Xcode  4 IDE to enable developers to be more productive. The editor is intelligent enough to  somehow work out what the developer is trying to do and therefore provides a list of  suggestions for the developer to choose from.  Time for action – stopping Xcode from alerting you to problems If for some reason you would like to stop Xcode from alerting you and correcting your code  for you, you can turn off this feature by following these simple steps:  1.  Click on the Xcode menu item or alternatively, press the Command + , key. 2.  Next, select the Preferences menu option. 3.  Then click on the Text Editing Page. 4.  Locate the Code Completion section. 5.  Check or Uncheck the Suggest Completions while typing option.  The screenshot below shows the Xcode Preferences page and the Code Completion section  highlighted by a red rectangle to show how to turn this feature on off:  [ 2 ]   Chapter 8  As you can see from the above screenshot, you can also stop Xcode from automatically  adding the closing brace. Various other options are also made available to hide or show line  numbers and code folding.  What just happened? In this section, we looked at how we can configure the Xcode preferences to turn features on  and off and how we would like the IDE to alert the developer to problems. We also looked at  how we can turn code completion on and off, as well as looking at some of the other options  made available on this tab, for instance, displaying line numbers within the code editor and  code folding.  Navigating through threads and stacks in the Debugger Whenever you pause execution of your code or the running code stops at a breakpoint  located within your code, Xcode opens the debug navigator window, and displays the  threads that were running when program execution halted.  Under each of the threads is the program stack at that point in the program execution.   Select a stack frame to see the corresponding source file in the source editor or  disassembled object code. At the bottom of the debug navigator window is a slider   control. This controls how much stack information the Threads and Stacks navigator   is to display within the window:  [ 2 ]   Debugging Xcode Projects  Located at the left end of the slider control is a feature to display only the top frame threads  of each stack. The option at the right end of the control bar shows all stack frames. The  button towards the last left of the slider control displays all active threads or only those  threads that have your code in them, as opposed to only including the system library code.  Have a go hero – Static Analyzer and debugging features Now that you have a good working knowledge of the debugging features within  Xcode, your task will be to apply some breakpoints and use the static analyzer on your  GetUsersAttention example that we created in Chapter 6, Displaying notification messages:  1.  Open Xcode 4 and load the GetUsersAttention example program. 2.  Modify the scheme to ensure that the option to run the Static Analyzer has been set   when the application is run. You can refer to the section Configuring your project to  perform automatic Static Analysis located in this chapter.  3.  Next, place a breakpoint in the function that handles the displaying of when the  activity indicator button is pressed. You can refer to the section Debugging with  Breakpoints located in this chapter.  4.  Run the application and analyse the results of any errors or warnings reported by   5.   the static analyser. You can refer to the section Viewing the Issues Navigator located  in this chapter.  Next, click on the button to display the activity indicator. When your application  stops at the breakpoint, use the step over and step into buttons. You can refer to the  section Debugging features in the Code Editor located in this chapter.  6.  Familiarise yourself with the Stack Trace Panel, Disassembly View, and Variables  Pane to see what types of information are being displayed. You can refer to the  section Introducing the New and Improved Debugger located in this chapter.  7.  Once you have familiarised yourself with the information that has been displayed,   click on the Resume button located within the debugging toolbar to resume  execution of the application. You can refer to the section Debugging features in the  Code Editor located in this chapter.  8.  Close down the iOS simulator and return back to the Xcode IDE. 9.  Remove all breakpoints that you have added to the code. You can refer to the   section Debugging with Breakpoints located in this chapter.  Once you have followed the above steps correctly, you would have successfully set up your  project to use the Static Analyzer, setting breakpoints within your code as well as using the  debugging features within the Xcode IDE.

We looked at how we can use Fix-it to  correct code as we type, Static Analysis which showed us potential coding errors, that is,  Memory leaks, Dead code, or unreachable code, as well as using the Debugger to navigate  through threads and stacks within our project. You will see that by using these two great  companion tools, Fix-it and the static analyzer, you will ensure that your code is free from  bugs long before your users find them.  We have learned about the various debugging features that Xcode offers. We looked at how  we can go about detecting and preventing our application from giving unexpected errors.  We are now ready to move on to and learn about Source Code Management  SCM  with the  Version Editor.  In the next chapter, we will learn about the Source Code Management  SCM  features of  Xcode, by creating, configuring, and adding items to new and existing code repositories. We  will also talk about the Version Editor and how we are able to compare different versions of a  file side-by-side, all within the Xcode IDE.  We will also learn about the Track Blame feature of the version editor to check past check-ins  of files to see which person made the last revision, and finally we will learn how to use Git  and Subversion to manage multiple projects.  [ 22 ]     Source Code Management with the  Version Editor  In this chapter, we will focus on the new features of the Xcode Version Editor  that has been integrated directly within the Xcode 4 IDE and provides you  with an easy way to manage your source code. By using this tool, it allows  you to travel back through your revisions to compare previous changes made  throughout the life cycle of the file.  In this chapter, we will be covering the following topics:                Introducing the new Xcode Version Editor Introduction to Subversion Learning how to create and configure Repositories in Xcode Learning how to add items into an existing Repository Learning how to compare different versions of a file using the Version Editor Learning how to use the Track Blame feature to check on past source code check-ins Learning how to use both Subversion and Git to manage multiple projects  We have got quite a bit to cover, so let's get started.   Source Code Management with the Version Editor  Introducing the new Version Editor  The new Version editor in Xcode 4 makes it easy to see any two versions of your source   code, side by side, all within the IDE. By having the Version editor integrated directly into   the IDE development environment, it sets a different direction in the way we think of   source-control management.  The Version Editor provides you with a comparison view of each of your files within the  repository to what is stored locally via a timeline. Dragging the slider in the middle of this  timeline enables you to travel back in time through your project, thus comparing any two  versions of the same file.  The Version editor can also show you a detailed log of past events, and track blame for past  check-ins. You don't need to worry about anything else as all of the complex source code  management  SCM  commands are managed for you behind the scenes. It is even possible  to manage multiple projects within a single Xcode 4 workspace, one project managed in  Subversion, and the other in Git, with all being updated for you automatically.  In the screenshot on the following page, are displayed the contents of a local revision of   the file showing the piece of code that has been added, but has not yet been checked into  Source-Control:  [ 24 ]   The next section of the image shown in the following screenshot shows the version of the  file that is within source-control being compared with a local version of the file. It also  displays the various options available to you when in this mode; that is, Comparison view,  Blame mode, and Log mode:  Chapter 9     The Project Navigator contains badges, which are for SCM and pertain to Subversion and  repositories. If you need to refresh your memory on what these status codes mean, you  can refer to the section which we covered in Chapter 2, Introducing the Xcode 4 Workspace  under the section Listing files in a project.  [ 25 ]   Source Code Management with the Version Editor  Introducing Subversion You may be asking yourself? What is Subversion? Subversion is a version control system, that Subversion is a version control system, that  handles keeping track of the changes made to a file and who made the changes. While the  use of version control is not limited to source code files  I could use version control to keep  track of the changes I make to the articles and book chapters I write , the primary users of  version control are software developers.  Version control is especially helpful on large projects with multiple developers. Each  developer can add code to a file, and the version control system records the code each  developer added along with their name. Even if you're working on a project by yourself,  version control can help you. If you've ever mistakenly saved a file and wished you could  go back to the way the file was before you saved it, you'll appreciate version control. With  version control, you can go back to an older version of a file.  You may have worked with and used other version control software such as Microsoft Visual  Source-Safe, Tortoise SVN, or Concurrent Versions System  CVS , which is a popular version , which is a popular version  Concurrent Versions System  CVS , which is a popular version control system.  Apart from the ones mentioned above, the use of Subversion has several other   advantages too:        Subversion can handle the renaming of files. Subversion can track the changes made to directories. Subversion handles atomic commits. Atomic commits allow you to commit changes  in multiple files while making sure all the changes get committed.  Installing a local Subversion server In this section, we are going to look at how we go about installing the server components  onto the same computer, as you will be using for development. In the real world, this will  not be the case as you will be connecting to another computer  so as to avoid an unexpected  system crash , which will be periodically backed up . But for the purposes of learning, this is  the easiest way.  Firstly, we will check the current version of Subversion that you currently have on your Mac  computer. This is to confirm that you are using the latest version of the software. Open a  Terminal window session and type svn –-version:  $ svn –-version  You should eventually see the following text appear on your screen:  svn, version 1.6.5  r38866     compiled Jun 24 2010, 17:16:45  [ 26 ]   Copyright  C  2000-2009 CollabNet.  Subversion is open source software, see http:  subversion.tigris.org   This product includes software developed by CollabNet      http:  www.Collab.Net  .  The following repository access  RA  modules are available:  Chapter 9  * ra_neon : Module for accessing a repository via WebDAV protocol using     Neon.  * ra_svn : Module for accessing a repository using the svn network     protocol.  * ra_local : Module for accessing a repository on local disk.    - handles 'http' scheme    - handles 'https' scheme    - handles 'svn' scheme    - handles 'file' scheme  $  In the unlikely event that you don't happen to see the above displayed on your screen, you  will have to download and install the Subversion software onto your computer. You can  obtain the binary distributions from the following location http:  subversion.apache. org packages.html and then choose the Mac OS X option from the top section of the  main page. From the list of available options, select openCollabNet, make your selection  between Universal Subversion 1.6.16 Binaries for Leopard  Mac OS X 10.5  or Universal  Subversion 1.6.16 Binaries for Snow Leopard  Mac OS X 10.6  depending on your system.  It is a requirement that before downloading either version, you will need to sign-up and  register your details. This process is completely free.  Creating a repository Once you have installed the Subversion software, you will be able to create your repository.  We will be creating a single repository for this chapter and then look at how we can use  Xcode and Subversion and Git to manage multiple projects.  Before we start to look at how we create a repository, it is worthwhile to mention the types  of repositories that Subversion supports. Subversion enables you to create two types of  repositories: Local and Remote. These are explained in the table below:  [ 27 ]   Source Code Management with the Version Editor  REPOSITORY TYPES Local Repositories  Remote repositories  DESCRIPTION These types of repositories reside on your computer and will only be used  by you. These allow other people to access the repository and check out the files  in the repository from their computers.  Subversion is a complex, powerful, and sophisticated product that you can configure and  use in many ways. We will be covering the essential areas of Subversion to get you started. If  you want to learn more about Subversion, I would thoroughly recommend reading the free  online book Version Control with Subversion that can be accessed at http:  svnbook. red-bean.com .  Even though Subversion is included with the installation of Xcode 4, it is possible to install   a local version of Subversion manually. In the next section, we will look at how this can   be done.  In this chapter, we will be covering local repositories. Apple  provides documentation on their developer site that shows you  how to set up remote Subversion repositories at the following  location http:  developer.apple.com .  Time for action – setting up a local Subversion repository In this section, we will be looking at how we can use the command line to set up a  Subversion repository. We will now start to create a repository, that will be used to house  our project revisions:  1.	  In your documents folder, create two folders: Master_Projects and Working_Copy  by following the commands below: cd ~ Documents  mkdir –p Repositories Master_Projects  mkdir –p Repositories Working_Copy  2.	 Next, we will use one of the examples from a previous chapter. Locate the project  TapExample from Chapter 7, Exploring the MultiTouch Interface and copy it to the  Master_Projects folder.  3.	 Open the Terminal utility application using Shift + Command + U. At the command   prompt, type in the following command to create a subversion repository: svnadmin create ~ Documents Repositories svn  [ 2 ]   Chapter 9  4.	 Our next step is to use the verify command to ensure that our command which we   executed above has successfully created our Subversion repository to house our  projects. At the command prompt, enter in the following command: svnadmin verify ~ Documents Repositories svn     * Verified revision 0.  Notice that when you run the above command, it displays revision 0. This is because we  have not created any revisions or imported any content.  When creating Subversion repositories, it is common to create three top- level folders, called branches, tags, and trunk, below the repository name.  The trunk folder holds the main folder structure, while the branches and  tags hold the information that is contained within your revision history  that you assign to specific folders within a revision by giving them friendly  easy to identify names.  What just happened? In this section, we looked at how to manually create the Subversion repositories using   the command line tool svnadmin. We then verified to ensure that our repository got  created. In the next section, we will look at how we can use Xcode to configure our  subversion repository.  This folder structure, that we just created, contains the configuration files that are required  for the repository and the database files that are used by the Subversion server to manage  and handle the project revisions.  [ 2 ]   Source Code Management with the Version Editor  Never make changes directly into this folder. This could corrupt the  database that holds all of your code history and there is no way to  get this back. It is best to leave this up to Subversion and Xcode to  automatically handle for you.  Configuring the repository in Xcode In this section, we will look at the necessary steps into what is involved with setting up and  configuring a source code repository using Subversion within Xcode 4. We will be creating  the necessary branches for each section to ensure that it has been configured correctly.  Time for action – configuring the Subversion repository Now that you have successfully created a Subversion repository, it is time for us to add our  project to source code management:  1.	 Launch Xcode from the  Xcode4 Applications folder. 2.	 Select Organizer from the Window menu or press Shift + Command + 2. 3.	 Click on the Add  +  button and then select Add Repository… to create a new   repository. This will bring up the Add a Repository dialog window from where you  specify the name of the repository configuration that you would like to create. 4.	 Enter in a suitable name for the repository. I have chosen GS SVN Repository. 5.	  In the Location box, type the location of the repository, which we created   previously. This will need to be in URI format, which is the folder location.   Enter in: file:   users stevendaniel documents repositories svn.  6.	 Make sure that you select Subversion as the type of repository to set up.  [ 300 ]   7.	 Click Next once you have filled in all of the fields:  Chapter 9  One thing that you will notice when filling in the location field, is that a green light is  displayed. What Xcode is doing is testing the configuration to ensure that it can connect  properly to the repository and confirms that you have a valid connection.  [ 301 ]   Source Code Management with the Version Editor  Our next step is to add the branches, tags, and trunk folders. However, since we are   creating a Subversion repository, this is not a mandatory step to add a project to a  Subversion repository:  I would personally recommend creating these folders, as this will make your life easier later  on should you decide to branch out your code. An example of this could be, say, that you  currently have a Mac OS X application, and then later on you decide that you want to create  an iPhone iPad application.  You could in theory use the same Subversion repository and create three separate branches:  one for Mac OS X, iPhone, and finally one for iPad. Creating these folders now for branches,  tags, and trunk will not do any harm.  What just happened? In this section we looked at how we can use Xcode to configure our subversion repository  that we created in the previous section. We provided the Name, Location, and Type of  repository to configure. We also specified the folder names to create for the Trunk, Branches,  and Tags. In the next section, we will look at how we go about adding an existing project into  our repository using Xcode 4.  [ 302 ]   Chapter 9  Adding items to an existing repository In this section, we will look at the necessary steps involved in how we go about adding an  existing project and its accompanying files into source control using Subversion and Xcode 4.  Time for action – adding our TapExample project to the  repository Now that we have configured and set up our SCM repository, Xcode is aware of this, and we  can start to proceed with importing our TapExample example project:  1.	 Click on the Import button as shown in the screenshot below, and use the file  browser to navigate to the Master_Projects folder and select the TapExample  example project:  2.	 Once you have successfully navigated to the Master_Projects folder and selected   the TapExample project, click on the Import button.  3.	 This will display a popup dialog box where you must submit a descriptive message   before proceeding to have your project added to Subversion.  [ 303 ]   Source Code Management with the Version Editor  I usually tend to add a fairly descriptive message along with my initials and date that the  project was added to the repository:  Once you have clicked on the Import button, Xcode will begin to start importing your project.  Since this is being imported into a local repository, this process will complete very quickly:  Now that the project has successfully been added into Subversion, it is safe to delete the  version located within the Master_Projects folder. You will notice that when you import  your project into the Subversion Repository, it creates a project revision number along with  the name of the user who added the project and the associated comment. This is located  within the middle windowpane of the SCM Organizer window.  [ 304 ]   Chapter 9  If you decide to add the branches, tags, and trunk folders to your project folder, it is  important that you move the files from within the project folder to the trunk folder.  What just happened? In this section, we looked at how we are able to use Xcode to add items into a previously  configured repository, which we did in the previous section. We imported our TapExample  project into this repository and provided a comment entry. In the next section, we will look  at how we can check-out a working copy of an existing project from the repository.  Getting a working copy of the project out of the repository In this section, we will look at how we go about checking out the project from the repository  so that we have a version that we can work with and apply the necessary changes, then  check these changes back into the repository.  Time for action – checking out the project from the repository We will look at two different ways in which we can check-out and get a working copy of a  project within an Xcode repository.  The first and easiest option is to:  1.	 Select the Connect to a repository option from the Welcome to Xcode screen:  [ 305 ]   Source Code Management with the Version Editor  2.	 When this option is selected, it will display the Checkout or Clone dialog where you  will need to specify the file location where your repository is located. This is shown  in the screenshot below:  3.	 Click on the Next button to proceed to the next screen, which will display the  file browser window and allow you to specify the folder location to where you  would like to checkout your project. I have decided to checkout this project to the  Working_Copy folder location:  [ 306 ]   4.	 Once you have selected your folder location, click on the Checkout button. This  will create a Subversion-managed copy of the TapExample project folder and its  contents in the Working_Copy folder or the folder which you have specified.  5.	 Once Xcode has successfully completed checking out the project, you will see the   message box displayed as shown in the screenshot below. Click on the Open button  to have the project open within the Xcode environment:  Chapter 9  The second option to check-out the project is to click on the CheckOut button located within  the SCM Repository organizer window, as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 307 ]   Source Code Management with the Version Editor  This will display the same dialogs as shown in the previous screenshots and allow you to  specify the folder to checkout your project to.  What just happened? In this section, we looked at how we are able to use Xcode to connect to an existing  repository to check out the master copy of our project and have it save to another folder  location on disk, prior to having it opening directly within the Xcode IDE. In the next section,  we will look at how we are able to use the Source Control menu within the Xcode 4 IDE, to  commit, merge, or update our changes.  Xcode source-control features and file statuses The screenshot below displays the file statuses, which have been modified, added, or  deleted from a Subversion repository. These badges propagate up to the highest container   so you can see the source control status of the whole project workspace:  The Source Control Management  SCM  menu shown below is where you can Add, Update,  Merge, and Commit your changes made to your project into your repository. In the section  below, each of these main options are explained:  [ 30 ]   Chapter 9  Whenever you make changes to a file within your project, these are changed and stored  locally and are not included as part of the source code control repository. Before you can  add those changes to the repository, you must first commit changes made to the file. Saving  changes to a file is not the same as committing it into the repository.  In order to see what files have been modified since the last checkout from the repository,  look for the M badge next to the filename within the Project navigator. Any new files which  are added to your project will have an A badge beside their name. Any files that are not  under source control will have a question mark badge.  When you choose the Commit… option from the Source Control menu, a confirmation dialog  is displayed that you can use to make sure that the changes which you are committing are  what you intended.  [ 30 ]   Source Code Management with the Version Editor  Within this comparison view, any changes that you make to the file locally can be compared  with any previous version stored within the repository. Only those files that you select will be  added into the repository. In order to proceed committing your changes, a comment must be  provided before this can happen. Any last minute changes to the file can also be applied and  are saved back into your project.  Make sure that the comment you provide is informative enough, so that anyone else using  the repository can see what changes were actually done to the file. If the changes made to  the file was a bug fix, provide the ID. If the change was an enhancement, provide the change  request number:  The Merge facility helps you to reconcile different branches and allows you to merge the  code in a separate branch back into the main branch, or when you want to combine the   code in any two branches to reconcile differences between the branches.  The Update or Pull commands update your working copy from the repository when two  or more people are working on the same project. From time to time, you will need to  synchronize your working copy with changes made in the local or remote repository.  When using Git, you can use the Pull command or the Update command in Subversion   to do so.  [ 310 ]   Chapter 9  If you are using a remote or local Git repository and you want to share your work with the  other members of your team, you can use the Push command to push your files back to   the repository.  Before you can perform a Push, you will need to save and commit any changes made to your  project files and then execute the Pull command to reconcile any differences between your  version and the one stored within the repository, before finally selecting the Push command.  Comparing different versions of a file side-by-side There may be times when you want to compare a file which you are working on with another  one located within the repository. It could be that someone else in your team may have  applied some changes to one of the code modules within your project and it is causing some  issues and you need to determine what the previous change was.  This is where the version editor comes in and it is particularly useful to find out what has  been changed and why. In order to compare any two versions of the same file under source  control, select the file from within the Project Navigator window and then click on the Show  the Version editor button and Comparison View button, as shown in the screenshot below:  [ 311 ]   Source Code Management with the Version Editor  Use the jump bar underneath each of the editor panes to select the version of the file to  compare with the one in the other pane. It is possible to select any committed version  of that file from any revision within the repository and merge the code changes from the  version editor for the revision being viewed directly into the current working copy of the file.  Using Timeline to select and compare revisions Another great feature of the Version editor which you will find very useful is the ability to  select any revision within the repository to compare with the working copy of the file. This  can be very useful if you want to track what changes have been made to this file. However,  there is a much simpler way to achieve this and we will take a look at this in the section  Using Track Blame to check past check-ins:  In order to use the version timeline to choose file versions to compare, click on the Timeline  icon in the center column to display a visual timeline of all repository revision versions.  [ 312 ]   Chapter 9  Use the sliders to control which version of the file should be displayed in each windowpane;  you can use the Up and Down arrow keys to cycle through the available versions. Versions  are listed in chronological order, with a line for each version. Newer versions of the file are   at the bottom of the timeline.  Each major division within the timeline group's revisions is submitted within a twenty-four  hour period. As you reach each version in the timeline, additional information for that  version is displayed in an annotation. When you find the version you want, click the left   or right indicator triangle to display that version in the corresponding editor pane.  Using Track Blame to check past check-ins The Version editor also includes a feature called Blame mode. In Blame mode, the current  revision of the file is displayed along with the last revision that modified each line of the  file and it is even possible to see which person is responsible for submitting the last change  made to the last revision of the line of code:  [ 313 ]   Source Code Management with the Version Editor  To display the Blame Mode screen, click on the Blame button, which is shown in the  screenshot above. Each log entry is aligned with the line where the change was made.  The log entry includes the name of the person who committed the change, the date it was  committed, and the ID of the committed record. Next to the entry is an arrow button which,  when clicked will open the file and let you see the change associated with it.  Using Log Mode to list all revisions chronologically One other great feature that the Version editor comes with is the ability to review all  revisions on a file. Each change made to each file is listed individually in chronological order  and displays the name of the person who committed the change, the date, the ID of the  commit, and the commit comments. Clicking on the arrow next to the log entry will open   the file and allow you to see what changes were made to the file:  [ 314 ]   Using the Repository Organizer to keep track of your files Another way in which we are able to keep track of all revision changes made to our projects  contained within the repository, is to use the Repository Organizer.  This can be accessed from the Window  Organizer option or by clicking on the Organizer  button from within the Xcode IDE:  Chapter 9  As you can see from the above screenshot it shows you all revisions made to the project,  with the most recent revision located at the top of the hierarchy. It also displays the total  number of files that were modified and the time the change was made. If you expand the  revision node, you are able to see what files are contained within this release.  [ 315 ]   Source Code Management with the Version Editor  Clicking on the View Changes button will display the version editor in a read-only  comparison view to show you what was changed:  When the version editor comparison view is displayed, you can decide to view the files in  the repository which have been modified in either File View or Flat View. In File View, all files  are displayed and broken down in a tree-like structure, and each of the files that have been  modified are located within their respective folder s , as shown in the above screenshot.  In Flat View, as the name suggests, all project files are displayed in a flat one-dimensional  view enabling you to select each of the files and see their associated changes within each   of the file panes. You can see this in the screenshot below:  [ 316 ]   Chapter 9  Using Git to manage multiple projects  When working on a software project, it can be very useful to use source control management   SCM  to keep track of changes made to code. When using an SCM system, it saves multiple  versions of each file on disk, storing metadata about each version of each file in a location,  that is known as the SCM repository. Xcode supports two SCM systems: Subversion and Git.  When using Subversion, it is always better to have this stored on a remote computer   which is backed up on a daily basis, but it can be stored locally as we have seen in the  examples above.  Git on the other hand, can be purely used as a local repository, or like Subversion, can be  installed as a Git server on a remote machine in order to share your files amongst your team  members. Xcode provides a consistent user interface and workflow for users who use either  Subversion or Git.  [ 317 ]   Source Code Management with the Version Editor  Time for action – creating a new Xcode project using Git Before we can proceed, we first need to create the UsingGitExample project. ToTo refresh  your memory, you can refer to the section which we covered in Chapter 2, Introducing the  Xcode 4 Workspace under the section Creating your first iPhone application:  1.

In this section, we looked at how we can use Xcode to create a new project using Git to  manage multiple projects and having this added automatically for us under Source-Control.  As you can see, creating Git projects is much easier than creating Subversion projects and  as you begin to start using them you will come to understand why it is the preferred choice  of many developers and is highly recommended by Apple. In the next section, we will look  at how we are able to use the Organizer screen to assign address book information for each  person and are able to examine changes made to files when they have been committed back  into the repository.  [ 31 ]   Chapter 9  Time for action – assigning address book identities within the  organizer Now that we have created our project, we will look at how we can assign address book  information to the person who committed each version listed into the repository and let   you examine the changes made to each of the files at each commit:  1.	 Open the Repository Organizer. 2.	 Select our UsingGitExample repository in the navigation pane of the    repositories organizer:  [ 31 ]   Source Code Management with the Version Editor  3.	 Click on the icon next to the commit ID number:  4.	 Fill in the information about the person who executed the commit. If the person  is in your address book, you can click on the Choose Card… button and select the  person's card in your address book. If your address book has an associated picture,   it will also be displayed.  5.	 To see what changes were committed for this release or to see what changes were   made on a specific file, click the View Changes button.  [ 320 ]   Chapter 9  What just happened? In this section, we looked at how we can add information applying to the user that  committed the changes to the Git Repository. Comparing Subversion and Git, you can  obviously see why Git is the perfect way to go when creating your projects. While Subversion  is good, it was designed to replace Concurrent Versions System  or CVS  to save and retrieve  multiple versions of source code.  Git on the other hand is a distributed version control system, that was designed to handle  everything from small to very large projects, and was designed for speed and efficiency.  If you are interested in reading up on and learning more about Git, please  check out the provided links: http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki  Git_ software  and http:  git-scm.com   Have a go hero – adding a project to a Subversion repository Now you have a good knowledge of Subversion and understand how it all works, and are  familiar with how to go about creating a repository. The task that you will be performing will  be to add the MoviePlayer example, that we created in Chapter 4, Working with the Xcode  Frameworks to a repository:  1.  Load up the Xcode 4 Organizer 2.  Next, locate the MoviePlayer project and then import this into the repository. 3.  Provide a descriptive message for your project prior to importing. 4.  Once the project has been imported, verify that you can see theMoviePlayer   folder added to the navigational pane, under the repository to which you imported.  5.  Exit from the Organizer window to return back to the Xcode IDE.  Once you have followed the above steps correctly, you would have successfully added a  project into an SVN Repository..

We also spent some time looking at how we can use the Xcode Version Editor to compare  different versions of the same source file and the Track Blame feature to check on what  changes were made by other developers, before finishing up learning how we can use  Subversion and Git together to manage multiple projects.  Now that we have learned about the features and capabilities of the Version Editor, how   to manage source code repositories, and gained some insight into what Subversion and   Git are, we are now ready to get stuck in and focus on how we can use Xcode Instruments   to track down memory leaks and how we can profile our application to ensure that it is  running smoothly.  In the next chapter, we will be taking a look into how to go about Making your applications  run smoothly, and taking a look at the new features that come with Instruments, and how to  track down iPhone graphics performance using OpenGL ES.  [ 323 ]    10  Making your Applications   Run Smoothly  In this chapter, we will focus on how we can effectively use Instruments within  our applications to track down memory leaks and bottlenecks within our  applications. These types of issues could potentially cause our application to  crash on the user's iOS device. We will take a look into each of the different types of built-in instruments,  that come as part of the Instruments application and how we can use the  Leaks instruments to help track down and determine where memory leaks are  happening within our code. We will look at how we can configure instruments  to display data differently within the trace document that is being reported.  In this chapter, we will be covering the following topics:            Introducing the Instruments environment Learning how to add and profile against different instrument sets Learning how to track down and fix memory leaks Introducing other components of the Instruments family Introducing the new Instruments that are included with Xcode 4  We have got quite a bit to cover, so let's get started.   Making your Applications Run Smoothly  Introducing Instruments  The Instruments application is a powerful tool that enables you to collect information about  the performance of your application over time. Instruments lets you gather information  based on a variety of different types of data and view them side by side at the same time.  This lets you spot trends that would be hard to spot otherwise and this can be used to see  code running by your program along with the corresponding memory usage.  The instruments application includes a standard library, that you can use to examine various  aspects of your code. You can configure instruments to gather data about the same process  or about different processes on the system.  Each instrument collects and displays different types of information relating to file access,  memory usage  leaks and allocation , and so forth. As you can see from the screenshot  below, it shows the Instruments application profiling against our InstrumentsExample,  using a number of different types of instruments to monitor how much memory is being  allocated but not freed, what parts are causing memory leaks, number of disk reads and  writes, and how much memory is being consumed:  The information in the table below outlines each feature of the Instruments application, and  provides a description about what each part covers:  [ 326 ]   Chapter 10  INSTRUMENTS FEATURE Instruments Pane  Track Pane  Detail Pane  Extended Detail Pane  Navigation Bar  DESCRIPTION This section lists all of the instruments which have been added for  those that you want to profile against. New instruments can be added  by selecting and then dragging each one from the instruments library  into this pane. Items within this pane can also be deleted. This section displays a graphical summary of the data returned by the  current instruments. Each instrument has its own track, which provides  a chart of the data that is collected by that instrument. The information  within this pane is read-only. This section shows the details of the data collected by each of the  instruments. It displays the set of events gathered and is used to  create the graphical view in the track pane. Depending on the type of  instrument, information that is represented within this pane can be  customized to represent the data differently. This section shows you detailed information about the item that is  currently selected in the Detail pane. This pane displays the complete  stack trace, timestamp, and other instrument-specific data gathered for  the given event. This shows you where you are and the steps you took to get there. It  includes two menus—the active instrument menu and the detail view  menu. You can click on the entries within the navigation bar to select  the active instrument and the level and type of information in the   detail view.   The instruments trace document toolbar allows you to add and control instruments, open  view, and configure the track pane:  In the table below, an explanation is given for each of the different controls on the toolbar:  TOOLBAR ITEM Pause Resume Button  Record Stop Button  Loop Button  DESCRIPTION Pauses the gathering of trace data during a recording. Selecting this  option does not actually stop the recording; it just simply stops the  instruments from gathering data while a recording is in progress.  When the pause button has been pressed, in the track pane, it will  show a gap in the trace data to highlight this. Starts or stops the recording process. You use this button to begin  gathering trace data for your application. Enables you to set whether the recorder should loop during  playback to repeat the recorded steps continuously. This can be  useful if you want to gather multiple runs for a given set of steps.  [ 327 ]   Making your Applications Run Smoothly  TOOLBAR ITEM Target Menu  Inspection Range Control  Time Run Control  View Control  Library Button Search Field  DESCRIPTION Selects the trace target for the document. This is the process for  which data is gathered. This enables you to select a time range in the track pane. When this  has been set, the instruments display only the data collected within  the specified time period. Using the buttons with this control enable  you to set the start and ending points of the inspection range and to  clear the current range. Shows the time elapsed by the current document trace. If the trace  document contains multiple data runs associated with it, you can  use the arrow controls to choose which run data you want to display  in the track pane. Hides or shows the Instruments Pane, Detail Pane, and Extended  View Pane. This control makes it easier to only focus on the area in  which you are interested.  Hides or shows the instrument library window. This option filters information within the Detail pane, based on a  search term that you enter.  The Instruments application comes as part of the Xcode 4 Tools installation and can be found  located within the   Developer Applications folder; where   is the  installation folder where Xcode 4 is installed on your system.  Tracking down and fixing memory leaks One common use for Instruments is to detect memory leaks within an application. A  memory leak occurs when memory is allocated by an application, but is never released.   One of the instruments that come with the Instruments application is the leak detector,  called Leaks.  This nifty instrument tracks all memory that is allocated by the application and tracks all of  the pointers made to that memory location. So how does the Leak Instrument know when a  leak has happened? Well, this occurs when the application no longer has a valid pointer to  the memory it has allocated and the Leak instrument knows that the application can never  free the memory.  An application can use too much memory by never freeing the memory that  it allocates, even after it no longer needs it. You can use the Static Analyzer  to detect for potential memory leaks, or the Object Allocations instrument  to detect this.  [ 32 ]   Chapter 10  To show the use of the Leaks Instrument, we will create an example application in Xcode  to show how to purposely leak memory. There are many ways in which you can start the  Instruments application; you can run Instruments and then have it launch the iPhone  application, or you can use the tools under the Product menu from within Xcode.   Let's start by creating our sample application.  Time for action – creating the InstrumentsExample project Before we proceed with creating our InstrumentsExample project, we must first launch  the Xcode development environment. This can be located in the  Xcode4 Applications  folder. Alternatively, you can use spotlight to search for Xcode by typing Xcode into the  search box window.  1.	 Choose Create a new Xcode project, or File  New Project 2.	 Select the View-based Application template from the list of available templates 3.	 Click on the Next button to proceed to the next step in the wizard 4.	 Enter in InstrumentsExample as the name of the Product to create 5.	 Select iPhone from under the Device Family dropdown 6.	 Click on the Next button to proceed to the next step in the wizard 7.	 Specify the location where you would like to save your project 8.	 Ensure that the Create local git repository for this project is unchecked from under   the Source Control section  9.	 Click on the Create button to continue and display the Xcode workspace environment:  [ 32 ]   Making your Applications Run Smoothly  We now need to start implementing the code, that will be used to perform our   Memory Leak.  Open the InstrumentsExampleViewController.m implementation file, then scroll  down and locate the viewDidLoad method, and enter in the following code snippet:     Implement viewDidLoad to do additional setup after loading      the view, typically from a nib. -  void viewDidLoad {   [super viewDidLoad];      NSLog @"Starting...." ;       Loop for 5000 times   for  int i = 1; i <= 5000; i++ {     NSString *MemStatus = [[NSString alloc]initWithFormat:@"Memory         Leaking...."];     NSLog @"Value of i: - %i and status - %@", i, MemStatus ;   }      NSLog @"Completed..." ; }  What just happened? In this section, we created a simple project within Xcode and allocated 5,000 strings inside  a loop to demonstrate ways of how memory leaks can happen. We then implemented some  code within our viewDidLoad method. What this code does is that it allocates memory  for a new string MemStatus each time through the loop, and lets the pointer to each string  that we allocate go out of scope as we progress through the loop. In the next section, we will  Build, Run, and Profile our InstrumentsExample application using the Leaks instrument.  Time for action – running and Profiling the project We are now ready to Build and Run our application. To run the instruments application from  within the Xcode environment, you can either use the Command + P option or the Build For  Profiling option under the Build For menu. You can access this using the keyboard shortcut  Shift + Command + P:  [ 330 ]   Chapter 10  Once this option has been selected, you will eventually see the Instruments application  window display on your screen. This is shown in the screenshot below:  [ 331 ]   Making your Applications Run Smoothly  The table below gives an overview of each of the templates that are available and required  for iPhone development:  INSTRUMENT TEMPLATE Blank Template  Allocations  Activity Monitor Leaks Zombies Time Profiler Automation Threads  File Activity  DESCRIPTION Creates an empty trace document to which you can add your own  combinations of instruments. Monitors memory and object-allocation patterns within your  program. Monitors overall CPU, memory, disk, and network activity. Detects memory leaks within your application.  Measures memory usage and detection of over-released objects. Performs low-overhead time-based sampling of one or all processes. Automates User interface tests within your application. Analyzes thread state transitions within a process, including running  and terminated threads, thread state, and associated back traces. Monitors an application's interaction with the file system.  The type of Instrument that we want to use for this example is the Leaks Instrument. Select  the Leaks option and then click on the Profile button to proceed to load the Instruments  Trace Document window and start profiling our InstrumentsExample application.   When running the Instruments application, you can't use the Xcode  gdb debugger at the same time. Any breakpoints that have been set  within the application will be ignored and no output is written out to  the debug console.  You will notice that after a number of seconds have passed, you will see a red spike appear  which tells us that our application contains a leak and represents the 5,000 strings which  we have allocated. You can stop the application from profiling by clicking on the red record  button. Since the Instruments application has detected that our application contains leaks, it  knows exactly where in our application we have allocated the memory that was leaked:  [ 332 ]   Chapter 10  The Extended Detail portion of the Instruments window shows a color-coded stack trace.  Each of the colors within this view indicate which library each method belongs to, and our  InstrumentsExample code is highlighted in purple, with the methods highlighted in a black- grey color and we are able to see the method which allocated and leaked the memory.   [ 333 ]   Making your Applications Run Smoothly  If you double-click on the InstrumentsExample:viewDidLoad method within the list, it  will open up the code module, and point you to the section where the leaked occurred:  As you can see from the screenshot above, the Instruments application has cleverly  highlighted the line within the module where the leak has occurred and has provided us   with the amount of processing time that this has taken up. The value can be changed to  View as Percentage or View as Value. The default option for this view is View as Default.   What just happened? In this section, we looked at how to run and profile our example project using the  Instruments application to help track down, locate, and fix memory leaks within our  application, using the Leaks instrument. We looked at the different views available within  the Instruments application, which displays a color-coded stack trace to indicate which  library each method belongs to, with the color-code of purple indicating our code. We then  saw that if we clicked on a method viewDidLoad, it would take us directly into the code  module, and section where the leaked occurred, with the line highlighted. Through the use  of instruments, this helps highlight bottle-necks within our code, that could eventually make  our application crash on the user's iOS device.  [ 334 ]   Chapter 10  Adding and configuring Instruments  The instruments application comes with a wide-range of built-in instruments to make  your job easier by using them to gather data from one or more processes. Most of these  instruments require little configuration to use and are simply added to your trace document  to start gathering trace data. We will look at how we add and configure instruments into an  existing trace document.  Using the Instruments Library The instruments library displays all instruments that you can use and add to your trace  document. The library contains all of the built-in instruments that come with the installation  of Xcode 4, as well as any custom instruments that you have already created. To open the  Instruments window, click on the Library button from within your trace document window  or choose Window  Library from the menu bar. Alternatively, you can use the Command + L  keyboard shortcut:  [ 335 ]   Making your Applications Run Smoothly  As you can see from the above screenshot, the Instruments Library list contains a massive  number of instruments, that can grow over time especially when you start adding your own  custom built instruments. The library list provides several options for organizing and finding  the instrument that you are looking for by using the different view modes.  View modes help you to decide the amount of information that should be displayed at any  one time and the amount of space you want that instrument group to occupy. In the table  below, we describe the following view modes supported by the Instruments Library:  VIEW MODE TYPES View Icons View Icons and Labels View Icons and Descriptions  View Small Icons and Labels  DESCRIPTION This setting displays only the icon representing each instrument. This setting displays the icon with the name of the instrument. This setting displays the icon, name, and full description of each of  the instruments This setting displays the name of the instrument with a small  version of its icon.  In addition to setting the view mode of the Instruments Library, Instruments can be  organized into groups that make it easier to identify which instrument relates to which  group. This is shown in the screenshot above.  Locating an Instrument within the Library There are two ways to locate an instrument within the Instrument Library. One common  way is to use the group selection criteria controls, which are located at the top of the Library  window and can be used to select one or more groups to limit the amount of instruments  that are displayed within the Library window.  [ 336 ]   If you drag the split bar between the pop-up menu and the instrument pane downwards,  you will notice that the pop-up menu changes from a single selection to an outline   view, so that you can select multiple groups by holding down the Command + Shift key  combinations and then selecting the desired groups to display with your mouse as shown   in the screenshot below:  Chapter 10  [ 337 ]   Making your Applications Run Smoothly  Another way to filter the contents of the Instruments Library window is to use the search  field, that is located at the bottom of the Library window. By using this search field, you  can quickly narrow down and display only those instruments that have the search keyword  within their name, description, category, list, or keywords. In the screenshot below, all  instruments that contain the search string file are displayed:  [ 33 ]   Chapter 10  Adding and removing Instruments There will be times when you want to trace your application against other instruments  within the Instruments library. This could be when you want to check to see how your  application is performing on the device and how much battery is being consumed by   your application.  You can add as many instruments as you like to your trace document, but be aware that  not all instruments included in the library are capable of tracking a wide range of system  processes, as you will find that some can only track a single process. But to get around   this, you can add multiple instances of the instrument, and assign each one to a different  process. By doing it this way, you gather similar information for multiple programs   running simultaneously.  To add an instrument to the trace document, select the instrument from the Instrument  library and then drag it either to the Instruments pane or directly onto the track pane of   your trace document as shown in the screenshot below:  To remove an instrument from the trace document, select the instrument that you would  like to remove from the Instruments pane and then press the Delete key on your keyboard.   [ 33 ]   Making your Applications Run Smoothly  You will then receive a confirmation message. Click on the OK button to proceed:  In the next section, we will look at how we go about configuring an instrument that you have  added to your trace document.  Configuring an Instrument You will find that most of the instruments that you add to your trace document are ready  to use, out of the box. However, some instruments can be configured using the Instruments  Inspector and this varies depending on the type of instrument that is being configured. You  will notice that most instruments will contain options for configuring the contents of the  track pane, while only a small handful contain additional functionality for determining   what type of information is gathered by the instrument.  [ 340 ]   To configure an instrument, select the instrument from the Instruments pane and then click  on the Inspector icon, which is located to the right of the instrument. This is shown in the  screenshot below:  Chapter 10  When the Instrument Inspector icon is clicked, it displays the inspector configuration   dialog next to the instrument name. To dismiss the inspector, click on the close button  highlighted by an X. You can use the Command + I and File  Get Info commands to close   this window also.  Depending on the type of instrument that is being configured, they can either be configured  before, during, or after the data within your trace document has been recorded.  The Zoom control can be found in most of the inspector controls for those instruments which  you configure. This feature controls the magnification of the trace data that is displayed  within the track pane and adjusts the height of the instrument within the track pane.  Alternatively, you can use the View  Decrease Deck Size and View  Increase Deck Size  menu options to do the same thing.  [ 341 ]   Making your Applications Run Smoothly  Other components of the Instruments family explained There are other instruments which come with the Instruments application, apart from  tracking down Memory Leaks and Allocation Objects. Although not every instrument works  with iPhone applications, the list of Instruments pertaining to each type is explained in the  table below:  INSTRUMENT TYPE Activity Monitor  PLATFORM TYPE iPhone  Simulator  Allocations   iPhone  Simulator  DESCRIPTION Correlates the system workload with the virtual  memory size. This can be used to take snapshots of the heap as  apps perform their tasks. If taken at two different  points in time, it can be used to identify situations  where memory is being lost, not leaked. The test case would be to take a snapshot,  do something in the app, and then undo that  something, returning the state of the app to its  prior point. If the memory allocated in the heap is  the same, no worries. It's a simple and repeatable  test scenario of performing a task, and returning  the app to its state prior to performing the task. Used to automate user interface tests in your iOS  application. Measures the number of Core Animation frames  per second in a process running on an iOS device  through visual hints that help you understand  how content is rendered on the screen. Correlates the overall system workload with the  work being done specifically by your application. Displays diagnostics information regarding the  amount of energy being used on the device for  GPU Activity, Display brightness, Sleep Wake,  Bluetooth, WiFi, and GPS. Examines file usage patterns in the system by  monitoring when files open, close, read, and  write operations to files. It also monitors changes  in the file system itself relating to permission and  owner changes. This instrument looks for situations where  memory has been allocated, but is no longer able  to be used. These memory leaks can lead to the  application crashing or being shut down.   [ 342 ]  Automation  iPhone  Simulator  Core Animation  iPhone  CPU Sampler  iPhone  Simulator  Energy  Diagnostics  iPhone  File Activity  Simulator  Leaks   iPhone  Simulator   INSTRUMENT TYPE OpenGL ES Driver  PLATFORM TYPE iPhone  System Usage  iPhone  Threads  Simulator  Time Profiler  iPhone  Simulator  Zombies  Simulator  Chapter 10  DESCRIPTION Determines how efficiently you are using Open GL  and the GPU on iOS devices. Records calls to functions that operate on files  within a process on the iOS device. Analyzes state transitions within a process,  including both running and terminating threads,  thread state, and associated back traces. Performs low-overhead time-based sampling of  one or all processes. The Zombies instrument keeps an empty or 'dead'  object alive  in a sense  in place of objects that  have already been released. These 'dead' objects  are later accessed by the faulty application logic  and halt execution of the app without crashing.  The 'zombie' objects receive the call and point the  instrument to the exact location where the app  would normally crash.  New Instruments in Xcode 4  The instruments application that comes with Xcode contains a wide range of built-in  instruments to make your job easier and to gather and display data for one or more  processes. In Xcode 4, a collection of new instruments has been added and these are  explained below.  Automated Testing The Automation instrument allows you to automate user interface tests of your iOS  application that are guided by your test scripts which exercise the user interface elements   of your application, allowing you to log the results for your analysis at a later time.  As you can see that using this fantastic Automation instrument, can simulate the many user  actions supported by the devices that support multitasking and are running iOS 4.0 or later.  Any test scripts that you create can be run on the iOS device or within the iOS simulator  without any modifications being made to your scripts.  Performance and Power Analysis The Performance and Power Analysis Instrument allows you to collect performance data and  track the power usage of your application through the use of the Time Profiler and Energy  Diagnostics Instruments for iOS.  [ 343 ]   Making your Applications Run Smoothly  Time Profiler The Time Profiler Instrument illustrates how much time is being spent in each code segment.  This allows developers to prioritize which bit of logic needs to be refactored prior to release.  Although this can be run using the iOS Simulator, it is recommended to run this on the iOS  devices, as the performance will vary greatly between the two.  Energy Diagnosis The Energy Diagnostics instrument is the most exciting tool that Apple gave to developers.  This instrument will help you identify optimum use of the iOS device resources by enabling  you to test your application as close to real world scenarios as possible. The data that is  collected can later be analyzed to see how much of the device's battery life each function  consumes and it will tell the developer how long each of the device's various components   are used.  If you need to know the user's location, it will tell you which devices were turned on and for  how long. GPS is a resource hog and consumes much of the device's battery life. Turning off  location services once a location has been obtained is ideal.  Tracking iPhone graphics performance using OpenGL ES Driver The OpenGL ES Driver instrument queries the GPU  Graphics Processing Unit  driver on an  iOS device to sample OpenGL statistics for a given single process. This instrument helps you  determine how efficiently your device is using OpenGL and the GPU on your device.  The GPU hardware comes with two components: Tiler and Renderer. The scene is tiled and  then it is rendered. Both the Tiler and Renderer components often work on different scenes  and the utilization of each component can reach up to 100%.  Using both the Tiler and Renderer utilization can be helpful in determining where  bottlenecks exist. Low renderer utilization might mean that the process is stuck waiting   for tiling, which would suggest decreasing the complexity of the scene that is being   drawn. A low tiler and renderer utilization can suggest a CPU bottleneck somewhere   else in the application.

[ 344 ]   Chapter 10  Have a go hero – adding Instruments to your project Now you have a good working knowledge of the Xcode Instruments and how to go about  using these to profile your project. The task will be to profile our MoviePlayer example  that we created in Chapter 4, Working with the Xcode Frameworks and add the Activity  Monitor and Thread instruments to monitor each process:  1.  Open Xcode 4 and load the MoviePlayer example program. 2.  Start profiling the MoviePlayer example, which will launch the Instruments   application. You can refer to the section Running and Profiling the Project located   in this chapter.  3.  Locate and add the Blank template from theTrace Templates or Existing    Document dialog.  4.  From the Instruments Library, add the Activity Monitor to the Instruments Pane. You   can refer to the section Adding and Removing Instruments located in this chapter. 5.  Next, drag the Threads instrument to the instruments Pane. You can refer to the   section Adding and Removing Instruments located in this chapter.  6.  Start profiling the MoviePlayer application. You can refer to the section Running   and Profiling the Project located in this chapter.  7.  You will notice that your application will compile and run within the iOS simulator,  and then profile your application, monitoring the Activity and Threads being used.  8.  Exit from the Instruments application to return back to the Xcode IDE.  Once you have followed the above steps correctly, you would have successfully added  instruments to a blank template, as well as successfully profiling an existing application.

All of the above  Summary  In this chapter, we focused on the new features of the Xcode Instruments application and  how we can use this brilliant tool to ensure that our application runs smoothly, and that it is  free from memory leaks and bottlenecks to avoid having our application crash on the users'  iOS device.  We took a look into each of the different types of built-in instruments that come as part of  the instruments application, in particular the Leaks instrument to help to track down and  determine where memory leaks are occurring within the code in our applications. We ended  the chapter by looking at how we can configure instruments to represent data differently  within the trace document.  Now that we have learned about the power and features of the different types of  instruments that are included with Xcode 4, we are ready to embark on our final   chapter, Building, Packaging, and Distributing your application.  In this chapter, we will be taking a look at how to create Build configurations for Debugging  stage to Release and learn how to go about obtaining provisioning profiles for Testing and  Submission and how to register devices to be used for testing. Finally, we will look at the  steps involved in making our application ready for submission to the Apple AppStore and   join the other thousands of developers out there.  [ 346 ]   11  Distributing your Application  Well done for making it to the final chapter of this book. This is where you start  to submit your application to the Apple App Store and share your creation with  the rest of the community. So, you've finally done it. You have successfully built your application and   now you are ready to release it to the rest of the world. All you now need   to do is decide how to deploy it and market it. In this chapter, we will look at  step-by-step instructions on how to go about submitting your application to   the Apple App Store.  In this chapter, we will be covering the following topics:                How to create the different build configurations for debug and release Setting up your profile for testing and submitting of apps Setting up your iPhone development team and certificate Creating application IDs and how to register iOS devices for testing Conforming to the iPhone Human Interface Guidelines How to price your app and avoid it being rejected How to market and promote your application  We have got quite a bit to cover, so let's get started.   Distributing your Application  Build configurations – debug to release  Since the beginning of this book, the default build configuration that we have been dealing  with has been the Debug Build Configuration. The screenshot below shows the currently  active build configuration within the Xcode workspace toolbar:  When the Debug configuration is selected, it causes your application to be compiled along  with the debug symbols. On the other hand, when the Release configuration is selected,  this removes the debug symbols and also carries out some optimization of the code during  compilation. You can also create custom build configurations using the Manage Schemes…  option as shown above. As a refresher, you can refer to Chapter 8, Debugging your   Xcode Projects.  The iPhone Developer Program The iPhone Developer Program provides you with a means of being able to share your  applications with the rest of the iOS community. In order for you to test, submit, or give your  apps to your friends to test, you will need to join up with the iPhone Developer Program.  To sign up, you will need to go to http:  developer.apple.com programs ios and  then click on the Enroll Now button to proceed.  [ 34 ]   For most developers wanting to release their applications to the App Store, they can simply  sign up for the Standard program, that costs US$99, or US$299 for Enterprise users. Prices  vary depending on which path you want to take—either register as an Individual Company  or Enterprise Developer.

This enables you or the people within your  organisation to log into the iOS Developer portal website to test apps on the iOS devices they  are being deployed to, add additional iOS devices to the account to be used for testing, and  so on.  [ 34 ]   Distributing your Application  Time for action – setting up the team In order to set up your team for iPhone development, follow these steps:  1.  Log into the iOS Developer Portal website and click on the Member Center link  which is located right at the top. This will then display the Developer Program  Resources page, which is shown below:  2.  Next, click on the iTunes Connect button as highlighted in the screenshot above.  This will display the iTunes Connect page where you have the ability to check on  various things like Sales and Trends as well as Manage your In App Purchases:  [ 350 ]   Chapter 11  3.  Click on the Manage Users button to add yourself or the people within your  organization who will be able to log into the iOS Developer Program Portal,   test apps on iOS devices, add iOS devices to the account for testing, and so on:  [ 351 ]   Distributing your Application  4.  Select the iTunes Connect User option as highlighted above. This will bring   up the Add New User option pane from where you can add a new user as  highlighted below:  5.  The list above shows a list of any existing users, that you have set up previously,   along with their details and Roles that they have been set up with and have access  to. To continue, click on the Add New User button:  6.  Fill in the Personal details for the person that you will be adding to your   development team. Once all details have been filled in, click the Continue button.   In the next step, we will need to assign which roles the user will take on:  [ 352 ]   Chapter 11  7.  Select from one of the four options as shown in the screenshot above, and click on the  Continue button to proceed to the final step in the wizard where we will be assigning  the relevant notification types and territories that will be assigned to the user:  [ 353 ]   Distributing your Application  8.  Once you have finished specifying the different types of notification methods for  each territory, click on the Save Changes button. The new user account will then   be created, and a confirmation e-mail will be sent to the user's account for them   to activate their account.  What just happened? In this section, we looked at how to go about setting up our iOS development team, and   how to go about creating and assigning roles to users, as well as which user roles are allowed  to log into the iOS Developer portal to manage users, view sales or trends, payments and  financial reports, or that have the ability to add new devices in order to test apps on the  iOS devices. We ended the section by looking at how we can assign the different types of  notification methods for each territory to each user.  The table below explains each of the different types of notifications that are shown in the  screenshot above.  NOTIFICATION App Status Contract  Financial Report  Payment  DESCRIPTION Provides e-mail alerts with app status updates. Provides e-mail alerts with contract status updates  for example, contract  expiration warnings  or if iTunes needs more contract information. Provides e-mail alerts when finance reports are available for download on  iTunes Connect. Provides e-mail alerts when payment s  to your bank are returned.  Getting an iOS development certificate The first steps that are required before we can start to generate our iOS development  certificate, and registering the iOS devices that will be used for both, development and  distribution, will be to generate a Certificate Request file. This file will enable you to request  the development certificate that will be used for code signing your application.  Time for action – generating a Certificate Request In this section, we will be taking a look at the steps involved in generating an iOS  development certificate. This certificate is encrypted and serves as your digital identification  and you must sign your app using this certificate before you can run and test any applications  that you develop on your iOS device.  [ 354 ]   Chapter 11  In order to generate a certificate request for iOS development, you must first generate  a Certificate Signing Request  CSR  using the pre-installed Mac OS X Keychain Access  application following these steps:  1.  To begin, launch the Keychain Access application located within your     Applications Utilities folder, or which can be accessed via the Keychain  Access  Certificate Assistant menu and selecting the Request a Certificate From   a Certificate Authority… option:  2.  Next, we need to provide some information before the certificate can be    generated. Enter the required information as shown in the screenshot below,  ensuring that you have selected the Saved to disk and the Let me specify key   pair information options:  [ 355 ]   Distributing your Application  3.  Once all information has been filled out, click on the Continue button. You will be  asked to specify a name for the certificate; accept the default suggested name and  click on the Save button:  4.  At this point, the certificate is being created at the location specified. You will be   asked to specify the Key Size and Algorithm to use. Accept the default bits of 2048  and the RSA Algorithm and then click on the Continue button. Click on Done when  the final screen appears:  [ 356 ]   Chapter 11  What just happened? In this section, we looked at the steps involved in generating a certificate and how we   can specify the type of Key pair to use for both development and distribution by using   the Keychain Access Application. The Keychain Access Application is a great utility for The Keychain Access Application is a great utility for  generating certificate requests that you can then send to Apple later to request the iOS  development certificates.  Time for action – getting the certificate Once a certificate request has been generated you will need to use it to request what is  called A Development Certificate from Apple. This development certificate will be used for  code signing your applications in order to deploy your applications onto the real device.  To generate a development request, follow these steps:  1.  Sign in to the iOS Developer Program at http:  developer.apple.com  devcenter ios and click on the iOS Provisioning Portal which is located on   the right-hand side of the page:  [ 357 ]   Distributing your Application  2.  You will then see the Welcome to the iPhone Provisioning Portal page appear.   Click on the Certificates tab, which is located on the left-hand side of the panel and  then click on the Development tab. The Current Development Certificates window  appears allowing you to request a certificate:  3.  Click on the Request Certificate button; the Create iOS Development Certificate   screen appears.  4.  Click on the Choose File button and then select the certificate request file that you   created in the previous section. Click on the Submit button once done:  At the point, you should see that the provisioning profile will be showing Pending  issuance status. This is shown in the screenshot below:  [ 35 ]   Chapter 11  5.  After a few seconds, the page will refresh  if this does not happen, click on the   Refresh button within your browser  and the certificate will be ready and you will be  able to download it. Once it is downloaded, double-click the file to install it within  the Keychain Access application, as shown in the screenshot below:  What just happened? In this section, we covered how to go about obtaining an iOS Development Certificate that  you need to code-sign and deploy your applications to a real iOS device. The certificate that The certificate that  is installed within the Keychain Access application contains the public and private key pairs.  [ 35 ]   Distributing your Application  Next, we looked at how we can use the iOS Provisioning Portal to create a certificate for  development by using the keychain file that we created in the section Getting an iOS  Development Certificate. Finally we looked at how to download and install the certificate  within our Keychain Access application.  Registering devices for testing Before you can start to test your iOS applications on your devices for distribution and testing,  you will need to register the devices to support your mobile provisioning profile. To do this,  you will need the unique device identifier  UDID  for each of those devices.  Once you have obtained the device identifiers, you will need to obtain each of the users'  devices in the same way you obtained your own.  Time for action – registering devices In this section, we will look at how to register our iOS device so that we will be able to test  the applications that we develop. You can register up to 100 iOS devices for you to test your  applications on. To register each device, follow these simple steps:  1.  First, we need to obtain the 40-character identifier that uniquely identifies your iOS   device. To do this, connect your device to your Mac and launch Xcode. Select the  WindowOrganizer menu item to launch the organizer application.  2.  The screenshot below shows the Organizer window and the identifier of the   currently connected iOS device. Copy this UDID identifier and save it somewhere,   as we will be using this in the next part:  [ 360 ]   3.  Log back into the Apple iOS Developer Center page and click on the iOS Provisioning   Portal link on the right-hand side of the page.  4.  Next, from the iOS Provisioning Portal page, click on the Devices tab, then click on  the Manage tab and then click on the Add Devices button. The screenshot below  shows you a listing of all iOS devices that have been registered:  Chapter 11  5.  The next step is to enter a suitable and meaningful name for each of the devices  that will be used for testing. Provide the Device Name and UDID for the Device ID  into each appropriate box and then click on the Submit button to save your changes:  [ 361 ]   Distributing your Application  Clicking on the + button will allow you to add additional devices at once. Upon clicking on  the Submit button, you will have successfully registered each of the devices you provided.  You will need to go through the same process if you intend to deploy to additional devices.  What just happened? In this section, we looked at what is involved in registering devices to be used within iOS  development within Xcode. We looked at how to register new devices using their UDIDs   Unique Device Identifier  that will be added to the iOS Provisioning Portal profile so that   it can later be deployed to only those devices that have been specified.  In the next section, we will be taking a look at how to go about creating the Application IDs  and development certificates so that we can use these to deploy applications to test on our  iOS devices.  Creating application IDs Each IOS application that you create must have a unique application ID that identifies   itself. The App ID is part of the provisioning profile and identifies an app or a suite of   related applications. It is used when your applications communicate with the iOS   hardware accessories and the Apple Push Notification service and when sharing data  between your applications.  Time for action – creating the application ID In the following steps, we will take a look at how to create an application ID:  1.  Log back into the Apple iOS Developer Center page and click on the iOS Provisioning   Portal link on the right-hand side of the page.  2.  Next, from the iOS Provisioning Portal page, click on the App IDs tab, then click on   the New App ID button:  [ 362 ]   Chapter 11  3.  You will then be asked to create an App ID for your application. This App ID is a   series of characters, which will be used to uniquely identify any application, that you  create on your iPhone. It is only necessary to create an App ID once per application.  If you are implementing iAds within your applications, then the App ID must be  unique. Provide a friendly name for your Application ID and then click on the  Continue button.  4.  Next, you will need to provide a description that will be used to identify your   application and then click on the Generate New for the Bundle Seed ID  App ID  Prefix . Ensure that you provide a suitable name for your Bundle Identifier    App ID Suffix .  [ 363 ]   Distributing your Application  5.  Once all details have been filled in, click on the Submit button:  In the screenshot below, you should now see the newly created App ID that you created in  the previous step, together with those you may have previously created:  What just happened? In this section, we looked at how we can use the iOS Provisioning Portal to create the App to create the App  IDs that will be used when we start to distribute our App to the App Store. This enables you  to associate an individual App ID to each iOS application that you develop and is particularly  useful when communicating with the iOS device hardware accessories and the Apple Push  Notifications especially when sharing data between suites of applications that you develop.  We then looked at how to create the Bundle Seed ID and Bundle Identifier for our App which  needs to be unique. When creating the Bundle Identifier, Apple recommends using the  reverse-domain style  for example, com.DomainName.AppName .  [ 364 ]   Creating a Provisioning Profile In this section, we will look at how we go about creating a Provisioning Profile so that your  application can be installed onto a real iOS device. Creating provisioning profiles gives you  the ability to assign team members who are authorized to install and test an application on  their iOS devices. When it is installed, it contains the iOS Development Certificates for each  team member, as well as the UDID  Unique Device Identifier  and the App ID.  Chapter 11  Time for action – creating the profile In order to create a provisioning profile, follow the simple steps below:  1.  In the iPhone Provisioning Profile, click on the Provisioning tab and then click on the   New Profile button:  2.  Once the New Profile button has been clicked, the provisioning profile screen   appears which is shown in the screenshot below. This screen allows you to associate  one or more development certificates with one or more devices, using the App ID  so that you can install your signed iOS applications onto a real iOS device. From this  screen, enter in MyApplications as the Profile Name, ensuring that you select all  certificates that you would like to associate with this provisioning.  3.  Select MyFirstApp as the App ID to use.  [ 365 ]   Distributing your Application  4.  Finally, check all the devices that you would like to provision and then click on the   Submit button once finished:  You can choose to register additional devices using the iOS Provisioning Portal  by clicking on the Devices tab and then follow the steps outlined in section  Registering devices for testing located within this document.  At this point, the provisioning profile will be shown as pending approval status. This is shown  in the screenshot below:  [ 366 ]   Chapter 11  After a few seconds, you should see that the status changes from Pending to Active. If this  does not happen, you may need to refresh your browser. At this point, you will be able to  download your mobile provisioning file:  Click on the Download button to download your provisioning certificate profile. You will  notice that when you download the mobile provisioning file, the file will be named as  MyApplications.mobileprovision.  [ 367 ]   Distributing your Application  What just happened? In this section, we looked at how to create a provisioning profile certificate so that a signed  iOS application can be deployed to a real iOS device to see how it will perform in a real  environment. We then saw how we can associate a development certificate with one or  more devices using an Application  App ID  and Unique Device Identifier  UDID . To end the  section, we learned how to download our mobile provisioning certificate. In the next section,  we will look at how to deploy an application to an iOS device using this certificate.  Using the Provisional Profile to install an App on an iOS device Now that we have generated our Development Certificate and have created our Provisioning  Profiles, the final thing that we need to do is create a version of our application that can be  deployed onto an iOS device. What we are going to do for this example is create a simple  Open GL ES application. We won't be doing any coding as this application will run and show   a multi-colored box bouncing up and down the screen.  Time for action – creating and deploying the app to an iOS  device Before we proceed with creating our MyFirstApp project, we must first launch the Xcode  development environment. This can be located in the  Developer Applications folder.  Alternatively, you can use the spotlight to search for Xcode by typing Xcode into the search  box window:  1.

The next step that we need to do is add the Mobile Provisioning profile that we  created in the previous sections of this chapter. Open the Organizer Window by  pressing Shift + Command + 2:  11.  Click on the Import button and select the file MyApplications.mobileprovision.  [ 36 ]   Distributing your Application  12.  Next, we need to associate our distribution certificate and provisioning profile with  the build. From the Build Settings tab, select the Code Signing section, select Any  iOS SDK, and choose your certificate from the drop-down list. Your certificate will  be in bold, with your provisioning profile in gray. Without a valid certificate, you  cannot deploy or upload your applications to the App Store:  [ 370 ]   13.  Next, display the Info tab so that you can specify the bundle identifier for your  application. This bundle identifier needs to be the same as the App ID you used   to register with the Developer Portal:  Chapter 11  [ 371 ]   Distributing your Application  14.  Now you can create an entitlements.plist. This file provides the code signing  for the application. Choose File  New  New File  Code Signing and then select  the Entitlements option:  15.  Click on the Next button to proceed to the next step and save the file. Most people  name the entitlement file Entitlements.plist for ease of use. This file is saved to the  root folder of your application. This file has one property called get-task-allow and  has the Boolean value of this property set to YES.  16.  Change your Active Configuration to Release and Run your application to see if all  works well. You will be asked to grant access to the certificate. Click Always Allow:  [ 372 ]   Chapter 11  What just happened? In this section, we created a simple OpenGL ES application and added our previously created  Mobile Provisioning Profile that we created from the iOS Provisioning Portal. We also looked  at how we go about Code Signing our application and creating an Entitlements.plist  file in order for us to be able to deploy the project out to an iOS device.  Getting a Distribution Certificate for your app Before you can submit your application for Distribution, you will need to create a   Distribution Certificate. This certificate enables the person responsible for submitting the  final applications to the iTunes store, and is referred to as the Team agent. In order for the  Team agent to submit any solutions, they must have an approved iOS Distribution Certificate.  The section below, explains how to obtain this certificate.  Time for action – getting the Distribution Certificate In order to obtain the iOS Distribution Certificate for your application, follow these   simple steps:  1.  Log in to the iOS Provisioning Portal and click on the Certificates tab, which is   located on the left-hand side of the panel and then click on the Distribution tab.   The Current Distribution Certificate window appears, allowing you to request   a certificate:  [ 373 ]   Distributing your Application  screen appears.  2.  Click on the Request Certificate button. The Create iOS Distribution Certificate   3.  Click on the Choose File button and then select the certificate request file that you  created in the previous section. Click on the Submit button once done. At this point,  the provisioning profile will be shown as Pending Issuance status. This is shown in  the screenshot below:  4.  Our next step is to refresh the page and after a few seconds, the certificate will   be ready and you will be able to download it. Once the certificate is downloaded,  double-click on it to install it in the Keychain Access application as shown in the  screenshot below:  [ 374 ]   Chapter 11  What just happened? In the above section, we looked at how to request and obtain a distribution certificate  in order to deploy our apps to the App Store. We looked at how we can use the iOS  Provisioning Portal to create our distribution certificate from our Keychain which we created  in the section Getting an iOS Development Certificate. Finally, we looked at how to download  and install the certificate within our Keychain Access application.  Archiving and submitting Apps using Xcode 4 Before archiving your application, ensure that the binary is self-contained. What this means  is that, if the binary relies on any static libraries, it ensures that those libraries are part of  the application binary by setting the Skip Install build setting to Yes within the Build Settings  section of the target that builds and archives the application:  Our next step is to make sure the Archive action of the scheme has the appropriate  destination set for the type of application to archive. Ensure that the Destination has been  set to use iOS Device, and the Build Configuration has been set to use the Release scheme:  [ 375 ]   Distributing your Application  Before submitting an application to the App Store, or shareing it with others, you create  an application archive which will enable you to share your application archive with other  developers and testers, or distribute it to users. Select the Product  Archive option from  the Xcode menu and it will begin to create the application archive. Eventually, the archives  organizer window will be displayed:  In order to have your application considered for inclusion on the Apple App store, you must  submit the archive to iTunes Connect. This is to ensure that your application archive passes  the essential iTunes Connect validation tests. Xcode can validate this for you before you  submit it:  [ 376 ]   Chapter 11  For more information on other ways of distributing your applications  check out the provided link made available through the Apple Developer  Connection website at: http:  developer.apple.com library  mac documentation ToolsLanguages Conceptual  Xcode4UserGuide Introduction Introduction.html.  iOS Human Interface Guidelines When you begin creating iOS applications, it is important to keep in mind and follow the  iOS Human Interface Guidelines document that Apple provides. This document describes  the guidelines and principles that help you design a consistent user interface and user  experience for your iOS app.  This document provides you with the guidelines needed for developing applications that run  efficiently and effectively on the iOS platform. This involves considering the screen size of  your window, the memory limitations, and the ease of use.  Other areas are covered to ensure the consistency of your application as you navigate from  screen to screen, as well as principles for developing good user interfaces. This document  also includes information on how to go about providing status updates when the network is  down, or other feedback, through using messages if an error occurred or if a field cannot be  left blank.  There is also information relating to the proper use and appearance of views and controls for  Navigation and Toolbars, Alerts, Table Views, Buttons, and icons, as well as the creation of  custom icons and images.  To obtain further information about what these guidelines consist of, it is  worthwhile checking out the iOS Human Interface Guidelines document at  the following location: http:  developer.apple.com library  ios documentation userexperience conceptual  mobilehig MobileHIG.pdf.  Testing your application Before submitting your application for approval to the Apple App Store, you need to ensure  that it works properly and is free from problems. The iOS simulator is a good place to start,  and although not everything can be tested within the simulator, it proves a good starting  point. Whilst your application may run perfectly within the simulator, problems may still exist  when it has been deployed to the iOS device; it is always best to deploy it to a real iOS device  running the latest OS 4.x.  [ 377 ]   Distributing your Application  You can also make use of the Instruments application to ensure that no memory leaks exist  within your application and avoid having your app crash on the user's device. If your app  crashes, it could also prevent your application from being successfully approved and being  displayed on the App Store by Apple.  Preparing your App for submission through iTunes Connect When you have tested your application to ensure that it all works and is free from problems  and you have set up all of your accounts, you will want to start uploading your application   to the App Store. Please bear in mind that only a release version of your application can   be uploaded.  First, log into iTunes Connect and then click on the Manage Your Applications button as  shown in the screenshot below:  Click on the Add New App link to begin adding your application to the App Store as shown in  the screenshot below:  Next, we need to enter the Application details for the application we are uploading. Enter  the Application details, and then click on the Continue button to proceed to the next step.  The SKU Number is a unique identifier that you create for your app:  [ 37 ]   Chapter 11  In the next step, we specify the availability date and pricing tier for when the application  should be made available for download:  [ 37 ]   Distributing your Application  There are up to 85 pricing tiers to choose from, including an option for selling your  application for free. The screenshot below shows a small snapshot of the pricing matrix   that Apple provides:  On clicking on the Continue button, you will be directed to the Metadata screen, where you  are required to fill in the information pertaining to your application. The fields in that screen  along with their description are listed in the table below:   SCREEN FIELD Version Number Description  Primary Category  Secondary Category  Optional  Keywords  Copyright  Contact Email Address  Support URL  App URL  Optional   Review Notes  Optional   DESCRIPTION This can be anything that you like. It is preferable to start at 1.0. The Application Description that can contain up to 4,000  characters. These contain up to 20 different categories to choose from,  including Games, Entertainment, Business, Books, and so on. You can choose from a Secondary Category.  These help return results faster when a customer is searching  for an application within iTunes. The name of the person or entity that owns the exclusive rights  to the app, preceded by the year the rights were obtained  for  example, "2011 GenieSoft Studios" . An e-mail address where users can contact you if there are  problems with your app.  A URL that provides support for the app you are adding. This  will be visible to customers on the App Store. A URL with information about the app you are adding. If  provided, this will be visible to customers on the App Store. Additional information about your app and or your in-app  purchases. Review Notes cannot be longer than 4,000 bytes.  [ 30 ]   When Apple released their iOS 3.0 release, they included a rating scheme that allowed  parents to control which applications their children could download. This screen is  compulsory and you must complete this before you can submit your application. The age  limit will change depending on how you go about rating your application. Ensure that you  rate this correctly as Apple uses this information during their internal process and reviews  how you score your application:  Chapter 11  Avoiding rejection of your App As with any application, there are many reasons why your application may be rejected by  Apple and can be as simple as the application crashes or does not conform to the iOS Human  Interface Guidelines. The list below outlines the various possibilities to watch out for to avoid  your application being rejected:            Application does not run on the latest iOS. Application fails to comply with the guidelines outlined in the iOS Human   Interface Guidelines. Has a similarity to existing features found in iOS applications. Functionality does not work as outlined. Application crashes on the iOS device.  [ 31 ]   Distributing your Application          Differences between your application icons, that is, large and small icons   are different. Failure to inform the user through messages, that is, Network Unavailable or if an  error has occurred. Collecting of personal user data without receiving their permission. The use of Apple's private APIs  such as the built-in text-to-speech functionality   is strictly prohibited. If they determine that your application makes use of such  functionality, it will be rejected immediately.  If you are interested in learning more about the different ways in which Apple  can reject your application, you can check out the following link provided which  breaks down each of these into the various categories: http:  developer. apple.com appstore resources approval guidelines.html.  Pricing your app How much you should charge for your application is a tough question for all developers and  companies selling their applications on the App Store. One of the tactics that I have found  that many developers have seemed to adopt is to start selling their application at $6.99  and then, shortly after release, they temporarily drop the price by a couple of dollars, or  sometimes offer 50-80% off the price for a limited time.  By reducing the price, this will create a surefire sale, encouraging people to purchase before  the limited time expires which can also increase the number of sales for your Application  within the iTunes App Store hence getting into the top 10 or even to number 1.  Adding your App to iTunes Connect This section shows you how you can upload your application. Before this can happen, you  will need to provide the iTunes artwork and application icon and have a screenshot of the  application. Apple prefers that you create all artwork in the PNG file format. The final images  should be 72 pixels per inch with no transparency or layers.  The artwork to be used as the main artwork for your application should be 512x512 pixels  in size and exported in PNG file format, and must be named as iTunesArtwork, with no file  extension present.  The icon used to distinguish your application on the iOS device will need to be 57x57 pixels,  with no transparency or layers. To help identify your applications icon image, it is best to  save this file as icon.png. Prior to iOS4, iPhone app icons were 57x57-pixel PNG files. For   the iPhone 4's retina display, you need one that's double that size: 114x114 pixels.  [ 32 ]   Chapter 11  For more information on creating high resolution icons, check out the Apple  Developer Documentation at: http:  developer.apple.com  library ios documentation xcode conceptual iphone_ development 115-Configuring_Applications configuring_ applications.html.  As well as providing the iTunes artwork, you also need to provide up to four additional  screenshots to show the different parts of the application each of 320x460 pixels in size,   in order to allow the image to fit on your screen when you view the image via an iOS  device or the App Store. Within iOS4 and the new iPhone 4's retina display, you can create  application graphics that look sharp and crisp on the new retina display. You will need to new retina display. You will need to  create high-resolution versions of your application images. These are double the size    width x height  of the original images, and are named imageName@2x.png.  For more information on creating high resolution images, you can check  out the Apple Developer Documentation at: http:  developer. apple.com library ios documentation 2DDrawing  Conceptual DrawingPrintingiOS SupportingHiResScreens  SupportingHiResScreens.html.  Time for action – uploading the application icon and  screenshot images In the section below, we will take a look at how we can upload the application icon and  screenshot images for our application. You will only need to add the ones highlighted by   a red rectangle. To upload the images and icon files, follow these simple steps:  1.  First, we need to add the icon image that will be used on the App Store. This is a This is a   large version of your app icon that will be used on the App Store. It must be at least  72 DPI and a minimum of 512x512 pixels  it cannot be scaled up . It must be flat  artwork without rounded corners.  2.  Navigate to the iTunes Connect page under the section Uploads and click on the   Choose File button as shown under the Large 512x512 icon section heading..  3.  Next, we need to add the iPhone screenshots and these must be .jpeg, .jpg, .tif,   .tiff, or .png files, that is 960x640, 960x600, 640x960, 640x920, 480x320, 480x300,  320x480 or 320x460 pixels, at least 72 DPI, and in the RGB color space. Apple  recommends that you include at least three screenshots with a maximum of five.  [ 33 ]   Distributing your Application  Screenshots.  4.  Click on the Choose File button, located under the iPhone and iPod touch   5.  Finally, this option is purely for iPad development  which this book does not cover ,   basically for iPad screenshots. These must be .jpeg, .jpg, .tif, .tiff, or .png files, that is  1024x768, 1024x748, 768x1024 or 768x1004 pixels, at least 72 DPI, and in the RGB  color space. If you wanted to add iPad screenshots, click on the Choose File button,  located under the iPad Screenshots section:  6.  Once you have finished providing this information, click on the Save button to   submit your changes.  What just happened? In this section, we looked at the steps involved in uploading the images and icons for our  application and learned about the different types of acceptable file formats expected by  Apple, the resolution that these images need to be in, as well as the recommended number  of images that Apple expects you to submit.  Apple takes up to a week to review your application before it appears on the App Store. You  will receive numerous e-mails from Apple when your application changes state.  Using iTunes Connect to manage your Apps The iTunes Connect application is a fantastic tool, which you use to upload and manage your  application in the Apple App Store. By using iTunes Connect, you can achieve the following,  as described below:    Manage and upload your applications to the App Store  [ 34 ]   Chapter 11                Assess sales trends for each of your applications Review your contracts, tax, and banking information Download financial reports The ability to manage your users, for example, iTunes Connect Users or   General Users Include an internal Application Store from within your application, which allows you  to sell optional content for your app Request promotional codes to enable people that you know to get free copies of  your applications Contact Apple support with any questions that you may have  You will only be able to upload a release version of your application to  iTunes Connect and the App Store.  The screenshot below shows the iTunes Connect tool which you can use to upload and  manage your applications within the App Store:  [ 35 ]   Distributing your Application  Once you have logged into iTunes Connect, it is a good idea to ensure that your banking  detail information is correct and up-to-date. Since you are selling something, you want  to ensure that you are receiving the funds and getting paid. After you have validated and  ensured that all of your banking information is up-to-date, you will need to set up accounts  for those people in your company who will need access to iTunes Connect.  The iTunes Connect website allows three different user types that can be set up to enable  access to iTunes Connect, in addition to the original person who set up the account  this is  sometimes referred to as a Legal Account :  The Admin account has the right to view, add, and delete additional accounts as well  as managing the whole iTunes Connect environment The Finance accounts give the user access to all financial reports and contracts, as  well as tax and banking information, and sales trend report modules The Technical Account allows the user to manage applications and manage the   user modules  Marketing and promoting your app So, you have submitted and installed your application on the Apple App Store, and you  are really excited to tell the world about your latest creation. Although you can make a lot  of money from selling your application, you must also be willing to put in a bit of effort to  promote your application.  In order to sell any piece of software, using the traditional ways is always the most effective.  Some of the ways are explained below:  Using the Apple's iTunes Connect to monitor manage sales Make use of websites, brochures, and flyers Networking at social gatherings Advertise in computer magazines, for example, Mac User Update your application and change your price often Creating and making use of application promotional codes to give to your testers  Using one or more of the items shown above, can help you gain an interest in your  application and drive sales of your application.                    [ 36 ]   iOS Developer Documentation The Xcode development suite is a good place to start, and contains a great wealth of  information for developing on iOS devices.

[ 37 ]   Distributing your Application  Have a go hero – creating App IDs and submitting your App Now that you have a good working knowledge on how to go about creating an application  ID for your application, the task will be to build a deployable version of your application and  send it to some of your closest friends to have them test it on their iOS devices. When you  are confident that the application is good enough to be published, submit it to the iTunes  Connect App Store:  1.  You will need to build a full release version of your application. You can refer to the   section Build Configurations – debug to release located within this chapter.  2.  Next, you will need to obtain each person's UDID and add this to your provisioning   profile. You can refer to the section s  Registering Devices for Testing, Creating  Application IDs and Creating a Provisioning Profile, again all located within   this chapter.  3.  When you are satisfied that the application is free from bugs and are ready to   submit your application to the Apple App Store, you will need to create and obtain  a Distribution Certificate. For help on this area, refer to the section Getting a  Distribution Certificate for your app.  Once you have a working application, you will have mastered how to create application IDs  for your application as well as know how to create Provisioning profiles and distribution  certificates for submission to iTunes Connect and the Apple App Store.
