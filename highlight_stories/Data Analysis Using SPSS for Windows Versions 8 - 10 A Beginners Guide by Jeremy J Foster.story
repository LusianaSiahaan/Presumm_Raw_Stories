You have some data and some questions such as ‘How do I get a frequency table, an average, or a histogram?’. The book gives you the answers, explaining the commands you need, and showing you the output the commands provide. It is not a text in statistical analysis; I have assumed that the person who comes to SPSS is likely to know, at least in general terms, what statistical analysis they want to do. What they do not know is how to get SPSS to do it for them!  The book is intended for the individual student or researcher who has access  to  a  PC  with  SPSS  for  Windows  installed;  moving  between  the computer and the written explanation is the only way to develop skill in using the program. A set of hypothetical data is used in explaining how to obtain the results you want from SPSS. Do please carry out the various examples and exercises: it is only by having hands-on practice that you will develop an understanding of the way SPSS works, and become its master.  SPSS  is  very  efﬁcient,  but  it  is  complicated.  Do  not  become  dis- couraged  if  at  ﬁrst  you  ﬁnd  it  confusing:  we  all  do!  Once  you  have mastered  the  general  principles,  you  will  soon  ﬁnd  that  it  is  compar- atively  straightforward  to  obtain  the  results  you  want.  And  remember that when you are able to drive SPSS, you have enormous power at your disposal.  Jeremy J.

USING THE DISK  A  disk  is  provided  with  this  book.  It  contains  a  number  of  ﬁles  which illustrate the analyses described.  There are three main types of ﬁle within SPSS: data ﬁles which contain the data to be analysed, syntax ﬁles which contain the commands telling SPSS  which  analyses  to  perform  on  the  data,  and  output  ﬁles  which contain the results of applying the commands to the data.  Data ﬁles on the disk  There are a number of data ﬁles on the disk, each ending in the ﬁlename extension  .sav.  These  ﬁles  can  only  be  opened  when  SPSS  is  running, using  the  File  Open  Data  procedure  described  in  section  5.10.  They cannot be listed or printed except within SPSS.  The data described in chapter 4 and section 5.1 is in ﬁle salesq.sav. The ﬁle  salesq2.sav  comprises  the  same  data  as  salesq.sav,  but  after  the Compute and Recode operations described in sections 12.2 and 12.6 have been run. There are two additional variables, totatt and custrc, added to the  data.  The  ﬁle  jfch16.sav  contains  the  data  used  in  section  16.13  to explain how to carry out an analysis of variance with two within-subjects variables. The data ﬁle jfch20.sav contains the data used in chapter 20 on factor analysis.  Syntax ﬁles  Syntax  ﬁles,  which  contain  the  commands  you  have  chosen  and  are described  in  chapter  8,  end  with  the  ﬁlename  extension  .sps.  How  to open syntax ﬁles within SPSS is explained in section 8.6. Syntax ﬁles are text ﬁles, and can be opened in a word processor for inspection, editing and printing.  The syntax used in each chapter from 9 onward to analyse the data in  the ﬁle salesq.sav has been saved in the ﬁle jfsyntax.sps.  Some of the example analyses use a different data ﬁle from salesq.sav. The syntax to carry out the within-subjects analysis of variance described in  section  16.13  is  in  the  ﬁle  jf16syn.sps.  It  analyses  the  data  in  the  ﬁle   xvi  USING THE DISK  jfch16.sav. The syntax used to carry out the factor analyses described in chapter 20 is saved in the ﬁle jf20syn.sps. It analyses the data in the ﬁle jfch20.sav.  Note that if you want to run any of these syntax ﬁles, the appropriate data ﬁle must have been opened in SPSS. At the top of each syntax ﬁle there is a comment line which states the data ﬁle needed. Comment lines begin with an asterisk and end in a full stop  period , and the syntax ﬁles contain  a  number  of  comment  lines  which  explain  what  the  syntax does.  It is possible to run a syntax ﬁle without having the appropriate data ﬁle  open,  so  long  as  the  syntax  ﬁle  contains  the  command  to  open  the data ﬁle. An example is provided in the ﬁle openf.sps, which is otherwise identical to the ﬁle jf16syn.sps. It contains the lines  GET  EXECUTE  FILE='A:\jfch16.sav'.  These two commands instruct SPSS to open the data ﬁle jfch16.sav which is on the disk. Before trying to run the ﬁle openf.sps, you would have to make  sure  a  ﬂoppy  disk  containing  the  data  ﬁle  jfch16.sav  in  the  root directory is in the disk drive, drive a: If the ﬁle jfch16.sav is on a CD, you would need to have the CD in the CD drive. This drive may be drive D, but depending on the way your system is conﬁgured, the CD drive may have a different name: it could be drive E or some other letter.  You can ﬁnd out which letter is used to denote the CD drive if you use Windows Explorer to list the directories and drives on your system.  Whichever is the  letter  for  your  CD  drive,  note  that  you  will  have  to  edit  the  ﬁle jf16syn.sps so that the line shown above is changed to  GET  EXECUTE  FILE='D:\jfch16.sav'.  with  the  letter  D  altered   if  necessary   to  correspond  with  the  letter which your system uses to refer to the CD drive.  If you want the syntax to be printed in the output, as in the examples given  in  the  book,  you  need  to  go  to  the  Edit   Options   Viewer  as described  in  section  7.1  and  check  the  Display  Commands  in  Log option.  Output ﬁles  A major beneﬁt of using syntax ﬁles is that the output can be created by running  the  syntax  without  having  to  select  the  commands  from  the menu system. Since running the syntax ﬁles provided will generate the outputs illustrated, the disk does not include all the output ﬁles used in the book. But two examples are provided.   USING THE DISK  xvii  The ﬁle ﬁg7_7.spo contains the output illustrated in Fig 7.7, which is obtained  by  running  the  Frequencies  procedure  on  the  variable  cust  in the data ﬁle salesq.sav. Output ﬁles ending in .spo are generated by the Output Viewer, and these .spo ﬁles can only be opened within SPSS as explained in section 7.6.  An  alternative  to  the  Output  Viewer  is  the  Draft  Viewer,  which produces  output  less  neatly  formatted.  Files  produced  in  Draft  Viewer are saved with the ﬁlename ending in .rtf. On the CD, the ﬁle ﬁg7_7df.rtf is,  like  the  ﬁle  ﬁg7_7.spo,  produced  by  running  the  Frequencies  proce- dure on the variable cust.  By opening both of these output ﬁles you will be able to see how the formats of the Output Viewer and the Draft Viewer differ. Draft Viewer ﬁles ending in .rtf can be opened in a word processor. But inserting the contents  of  an  Output  Viewer  .spo  ﬁle  into  a  word  processor  is  more difﬁcult, as is explained in section 7.12.  It  is  possible,  as  described  in  section  5.12,  to  import  into  SPSS  data which has been prepared in a spreadsheet. To provide the opportunity to practise  this,  two  Excel  version  4  ﬁles  are  included  on  the  disk.  Both contain a small spreadsheet of data: the ﬁrst column is the respondent’s identiﬁcation  number   id ,  the  second  column  is  age,  the  third  is  sex  coded  as  1  or  2 ,  the  fourth  is  a  measure  of  performance   perf .  In  ﬁle import1.xls  the  names  of  the  variables  are  given  in  the  ﬁrst  row  of  the table. File import2.xls is the same, but variable names are not included.  Files contained on the disk c Data ﬁles  salesq.sav salesq2.sav jfch16.sav jfch20.sav c Syntax ﬁles  jfsyntax.sps jf16syn.sps jf20syn.sps openf.sps c Output ﬁles ﬁg7_7.spo ﬁg7_7df.rtf  c Spreadsheet ﬁles  import1.xls import2.xls                 1  AIMS OF THIS BOOK  Summary  1.1.  c This book is based on versions 8, 9 and 10 of SPSS for Windows. c The  main  differences  between  the  versions  are  described  in  section  c Before starting to use SPSS, read chapters 3 to 8.  1.1 Versions of SPSS for Windows  This  book  is  designed  to  teach  you  how  to  use  SPSS  for  Windows, versions  8,  9  or  10.   To  ﬁnd  which  version  you  have,  use  the  Help  About entry of the menu when you have SPSS running.  The descrip- tions of how to drive the package refer to versions 9 and 10, but version 8 is very similar: the major differences are listed in section 1.1.1, and if you are using version 8 you should refer to that section regularly.  Version 10 operates in the same way as version 9, but some improve- ments  have  been  made  to  the  Data  Editor,  which  is  the  screen  shown when  you  are  entering  the  data  to  be  analysed.  They  are  explained  in section 3.9.  The original edition of this book was written for SPSS PC1, a DOS- based  predecessor  of  SPSS  for  Windows.  SPSS  for  Windows  imple- mented a much simpler interface so that it became much easier to learn how  to  drive  the  system.  With  the  introduction  of  the  Windows  95 operating system, new versions of SPSS were produced. The most recent version  is  number  10,  which  like  versions  7,  8  and  9  operates  under Windows 95 98. Those familiar with the now obselete version 6, which ran  under  Windows  3.x,  will  ﬁnd  that  the  Windows  95 98  versions appear  rather  different;  but,  assuming  you  are  familiar  with  Windows 95 98, there should be little difﬁculty in making the upgrade: most of the procedures  are  unchanged,  it  is  the  interface  that  has  been  updated.  In some areas, especially creating, viewing and editing graphs, and produc- ing neat tables of output, the improvements are more pronounced. The   2  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  appropriate chapters in this book show you how to use these improved facilities.  1.1.1 For users of SPSS version 8  The major differences between versions 8 and 9 are: 1 Version  9  has  a  menu  entry  Analyze.  In  version  8  it  was  entitled  Statistics.  2 Version  9  has  under  the  Analyze  menu  the  submenus  Reports  and Descriptive Statistics. In version 8 the entries in these submenus were together under the submenu Summarize.  3 Version  9  has  under  GLM  an  entry  entitled  GLM  Univariate.  In  version 8 it was GLM General Factorial.  4 Version  9  has  an  entry  OLAP  Cubes.  In  version  8  it  was  called  Layered Reports.  1.2 How to use this book  This book is intended to show you how to operate SPSS for Windows so that  you  can  analyse  data  which  you  want  analysed.  The  fact  that  you are reading it means that you are thinking of using SPSS for Windows, and  are  probably  aware  that  SPSS  is  a  set  of  programs  that  allows  you rapidly to analyse huge amounts of data, and that it lets you carry out in a few moments statistical analysis that would be impractical without the aid of a computer.  This is not a book on statistics. Although there are now a number of books  which  combine  teaching  statistics  with  teaching  SPSS,  this  one assumes you know the analyses you want, if not how to obtain them. I have taken the view that learning statistics and SPSS together is risking overload, and that it is easier for the student to learn them one after the other. If you need a simple text on basic statistics, there are a number of excellent ones available  e.g. Hinton, 1995 . There is a brief account of the basic  principles  of  statistical  analysis  and  various  statistical  procedures in  chapter  2,  but  this  is  intended  as  a  refresher  rather  than  a  statistics course for beginners. Sections 8 and 9 in chapter 2 are intended to help you decide which analysis you require.  This book covers most of the facilities offered by the Base module of SPSS for Windows and some of the more advanced procedures which are provided  by  optional  extra  modules.  I  have  structured  the  text  by considering the questions that the user asks, moving from the simpler to the more complex procedures.  Manuals are often written the other way round;  they  explain  the  various  commands  one  after  the  other,  giving you the answer before you understand the question.   Even the Base modules of SPSS offer you a very wide range of options when analysing your data. Saying that this book covers the facilities of the Base module, does not mean that I have attempted to describe every   AIMS OF THIS BOOK  3  possible feature. There are thousands of different options which one can choose, and many of these can be explored at leisure once the basic mode of driving the package is understood. As in the previous editions, I have tried to explain the structure of the system and describe very fully how beginners  can  obtain  the  analyses  they  are  likely  to  require.  Once  you have gained the fundamental skills, you can explore further facilities for yourself.  This book assumes you are sitting in front of a PC that either has SPSS for Windows installed on it or is connected into a network that makes the package  available  to  you.  The  Windows  environment  has  become  so dominant in the PC world, that I have assumed that the reader is already familiar with it and with how to operate the mouse by pointing, clicking the  mouse  button,  double-clicking   clicking  twice  in  rapid  succession  and click dragging, which means you press the mouse button and while it is depressed move the mouse.  The  ﬁrst  part  of  the  book  deals  with  general  issues  that  are  essential before  you  can  use  SPSS  effectively.  Chapter  2  is  a  summary  of  the principles of statistical analysis and can be skipped if you feel conﬁdent about  what  you  want  to  do  and  why.  In  explaining  how  to  use  the package, I employ a set of hypothetical data, described in section 4.3, and referred to as salesq.  You  need  to  acquire  some  basic  information  before  you  begin  to  use the  package.  I  strongly  urge  you  to  read  chapters  3  to  8  before  doing anything else.  Chapters  14–20  deal  with  various  types  of  statistical  analysis,  and provide  an  explanation  of  how  to  obtain  them  and  how  to  read  the printout. For this edition, all the examples have been re-analysed using SPSS for Windows version 9.  1.3 Conventions used in the printing of this book Pressing the Enter key  also known as the Return key  is shown as ¿.  The Alt and Ctrl keys are rather like shift keys in that they modify the meaning of pressing an ordinary key if that key is pressed while Alt or Ctrl  is  depressed.  When  you  need  to  press  two  keys  together,  for example  the  Alt  and  E  keys,  press  down  the  Alt  key  and  while  it  is depressed tap the E key, then release the Alt key. This is shown in the text as  Alt+E,  but  remember  it  does  not  mean  that  you  press  the  Alt  key followed by the E key, and certainly does not mean that you press the 1 key: the Alt key must be held down when you press the E key.  1.4 Using ﬂoppy disks  Once  installed,  the  various  programs  that  make  up  SPSS  are  stored  on the  hard  disk  in  their  own  directory.  It  is  perfectly  feasible  to  store  the   4  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  data that you want analysed and the results of the analysis on the hard disk, but hard disks can ‘crash’  i.e. fail  so whatever is stored on them is lost.  Furthermore,  if  you  store  your  ﬁles  on  the  hard  disk  they  are  not portable. But when stored on a ﬂoppy, they can be taken to any PC that has SPSS for Windows installed on it, and used on that machine. So you are not tied to one PC, and can make copies of your data and command ﬁles  so  that  you  have  a  back  up  copy  in  case  disaster  strikes  and  your ﬂoppy  gets  damaged.  I  shall  assume  that  you  have  a  formatted  ﬂoppy disk for storing your data, commands and the results of your analyses. As any computer user  knows, ALWAYS keep at least one copy of your work  on  a  ﬂoppy  –  and  if  it  is  really  important  keep  two  copies  in separate locations, so if one burns down you still have your ﬁles!   2  THE BASICS OF STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  Summary  This chapter provides a rapid revision of basic statistics.  c Descriptive statistics are used to describe sets of data. c Inferential statistics are used in generalizing from a sample to a wider  population and in testing hypotheses.  c Some variables are continuous, others are categorical or discrete. c There are four types of measurement scale: nominal, ordinal  rank ,  c The  type  of  scale  determines  which  type  of  statistical  analysis  is  interval and ratio.  appropriate.  c If scores on two or more variables come from the same respondents,  you are dealing with related  within-subjects  comparisons.  c If  the  scores  being  compared  were  obtained  from  different  respon-  dents, use independent groups  between-subjects  procedures.  c Directional   one-tailed   hypotheses  predict  the  direction  of  any  observed difference in scores.  c Ensure  you  understand  how  to  interpret  the  outcome  of  a  sig-  c Use Figure 2.3 at the end of this chapter to help select the appropriate  niﬁcance test.  test.  The main body of this book assumes that the user knows the statistical analyses that are needed, and describes the procedures for getting SPSS to provide particular statistics and apply speciﬁc statistical tests. The aim of  this  chapter  is  to  remind  readers  of  the  principles  of  statistical analysis,  so  that  they  can  decide  which  statistics  they  need  for  their particular  sets  of  data.  It  is  not  intended  as  a  substitute  for  a  text  on statistics,  but  should  be  seen  rather  as  an  aide-memoire  for  those  who have  temporarily  forgotten  what  the  various  statistical  procedures  are used for.   6  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  2.1 Fundamental deﬁnitions  2.1.1 Population and sample  A population is an entire set of objects or people, such as the residents of France or Australian nine-year olds. A sample is a subset of a population, and  in  the  majority  of  research  analysis  one  works  with  a  sample  of  a population.  Usually  one  hopes  to  generalize  from  the  sample  to  the population, as in opinion polls where perhaps 1000 people are asked for their  opinion,  the  results  obtained  from  this  sample  are  generalized  to the  whole  voting  population  of  the  country,  and  statements  are  made about the popularity of political parties in the country as a whole.  Whether  it  is  valid  to  generalize  from  the  sample  to  the  population depends upon the size of the sample and whether it is representative of the population: does it have the same characteristics as the population of which it is a subset?  2.1.2 Descriptive and inferential statistics  Descriptive  statistics  are  used  to  describe  and  summarize  sets  of  data. They answer questions such as ‘What was the average age of the patients who were admitted to the local hospital with a heart attack in the last six months?’.  Inferential statistics are used in generalizing from a sample to a wider population, and in testing hypotheses, i.e. deciding whether the data is consistent with the research prediction.  2.1.3 Scales of measurement  N O M I N A L S C A L E S are where the numbers are used merely as a label. For example, we may code sex of respondent as 1 or 2, with 1 meaning male and 2 meaning female. The size of the numbers is meaningless, and 2 is not bigger or better than 1  we could just as easily have used 1 to indicate female and 2 to indicate male .  Bear  in  mind  that  SPSS  will  happily  give  the  mean  of  a  variable measured on a nominal scale even though this is meaningless. There are examples  in  the  scientiﬁc  literature  of  eminent  researchers  making  this mistake  and  reporting  that  the  mean  score  on  sex  was  1.5.  With nominally-scaled  data  such  as  sex,  where  respondents  are  1,  2  or  3  representing sex unknown , the mean of the scores is literally nonsense. But SPSS does not know that; it only knows there is a set of ﬁgures, so it does not object when it is asked for the mean even if it is not appropriate to  do  so.  It  is  the  user’s  responsibility  to  look  at  the  results  of  the analyses intelligently!  O R D I N A L   R A N K    S C A L E S have some correspondence between the size of  the  numbers  and  the  magnitude  of  the  quality  represented  by  the numbers. A common ordinal scale is position in a race. One knows that   THE BASICS OF STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  7  the  person  who  came  ﬁrst   position  1   was  faster  than  the  person  who came  second   position  2 ,  who  was  in  turn  faster  than  the  person  who came  third   position  3 .  But  the  numbers  1,  2  and  3  do  not  tell  you anything about the size of the differences between the three people. The winner,  number  1,  may  have  been  well  ahead  of  numbers  2  and  3,  or number  1  may  have  just  beaten  number  2  with  number  3  trailing  far behind.  are  where  the  numbers  represent  the  magnitude  of I N T E RVA L S C A L E S the  differences.  A  frequently-cited  example  is  the  Celsius  temperature scale, where the difference between 20 and 30 degrees is the same as the difference between 30 and 40 degrees. But note that the Celsius scale is not a ratio scale: something with a temperature of 40 degrees is not twice as hot as something with a temperature of 20 degrees.  R AT I O S C A L E S are where there is a true zero point and the ratio of the numbers  reﬂects  the  ratios  of  the  attribute  measured.  For  example,  an object 30 cm long is twice the length of an object 15 cm long.  The  type  of  scale  used  in  measuring  a  variable  relates  to  other attributes  one  needs  to  bear  in  mind.  Some  variables,  such  as  age,  are continuous in that they can at least theoretically take any value between the lowest and highest points on the scale. They contrast with categorical or discrete variables which can only take a limited number of values. An example of a categorical variable is sex, since there are only two possible values.  Similarly, one can distinguish between different types of data: quanti- tative  data  is  the  result  of  measuring  some  variable  on  an  ordinal, interval  or  ratio  scale  whereas  categorical  or  frequency  data  involves categorizing  things  and  counting  how  many  cases  there  are  in  each category. Many of the statistical procedures which apply to quantitative data cannot be used meaningfully with frequency data, and you need to decide which type of data you have before starting statistical analysis.  2.1.4 Parametric and non-parametric data and tests  The distinction between types of scale is important, as the type of scale determines  which  type  of  statistical  analysis  is  appropriate.  In  order  to use the parametric statistical tests, one should have used an interval or ratio scale of measurement. If the data is measured on an ordinal scale, use non-parametric tests. For nominal or categorical scales, some of the non-parametric tests, such as chi-square, are appropriate.  2.1.5 Dependent and independent variables  In experiments, the experimenter manipulates the independent variable, and measures any consequential alterations in the dependent variable. If the experiment has been designed and carried out properly, it is assumed   8  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  that the changes in the dependent variable are the results of the changes in the independent variable.  The  distinction  between  dependent  and  independent  variables  is  not restricted to experiments. When correlational studies are performed, one also has a dependent variable and independent variables. For example, there  has  been  a  considerable  amount  of  research  into  the  factors associated  with  students’  success  and  failure  at  their  courses.  This research  has  correlated  students’  study  habits  and  personality  to  their course  grades;  the  grades  form  the  dependent  variable  and  the  study habits and personality are independent variables.  2.1.6 Within-subjects and between-subjects comparisons  If  scores  on  two  or  more  variables  come  from  the  same  respondents, comparing  the  scores  involves  related   within-subjects   comparisons.  If the  scores  being  compared  were  obtained  from  different  respondents, they are compared using independent groups  between-subjects  proce- dures.  In  some  studies,  both  related  and  independent  comparisons  are needed. For example, one might have data on men and women’s ability to  drive  when  they  have  had  no  alcohol  and  when  they  have  had  a certain amount of alcohol. If one used the same people in the no-alcohol and  the  with-alcohol  conditions,  alcohol  would  be  a  related-subjects variable,  while  sex  of  course  is  an  independent-groups   between- subjects  variable.  Different  statistical  tests  are  appropriate  for  within-subjects  and between-subjects comparisons, and it is important to ensure one is using the proper test for the data being analysed.  2.2 Measures of central tendency: mode, median, mean  Given  a  set  of  scores  or  readings,  one  usually  requires  a  single  ﬁgure which indicates the ‘typical’ value of the set. There are three alternative ﬁgures one can use: mode, median and mean. Table 2.1 shows the scores of  22  respondents  on  an  attitude-scale  question,  where  the  possible responses were coded as 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5.  The mode is the most frequently occurring value, in this instance 4. The median is the value that divides the distribution of scores in half: 50% of the scores fall below the median and 50% fall above it. When the scores  are  in  ascending  order,  if  there  is  an  odd  number  of  scores,  the median is the middle score. If there is an even number of scores, average the two middle scores. In Table 2.1, there are 22 scores, so the median is obtained by taking the average of the 11th and 12th scores; in Table 2.1 these are both 4, so the median is 4.  The  arithmetic  mean is  obtained  by  totalling  the  scores  and  dividing the sum by the number of scores. In Table 2.1, the total of the scores is 75, and the mean is therefore 75 22 5 3.41.

We need to be able to express the variation within a set of scores as well as the central value  mode, median or mean  of the set. Table  2.2  shows  the  number  of  customers  visited  by  male  and  female sales personnel.  2.3.2 Range; interquartile range  The range of a set of scores is simply the difference between the highest and lowest scores. So for the males in Table 2.2, the range is 83 2 28 5 55 and for females the range is 79 2 33 5 46. Range gives an indication of the spread of the scores, but of course it depends completely on just two ﬁgures from the whole set, the highest and the lowest. One very low or very high score will produce a large increase in the range, and this might be quite misleading.  One alternative measure is the interquartile range. As mentioned earlier, the median is that score which divides the set into two halves, with half the scores falling below the median and half the scores falling above it. The  median  is  the  50th  percentile,  which  means  50%  of  the  scores  fall   10  2 3 4 8 9 10 12 13 17 21  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  Table 2.2 Customers visited by male and female personnel  Males  Females  Respondent number  Number of visits  Respondent number  Number of visits  46 48 83 28 41 76 30 68 38 39  1 6 7 11 14 15 16 18 19 20 22  43 72 42 39 33 36 79 48 58 60 40  below  it.  We  can  also  have  a  25th  percentile,  which  is  the  score  below which 25% of the scores fall, a 75th percentile, a 90th percentile etc. The interquartile  range  is  the  difference  between  the  25th  and  75th  percen- tiles. The values of interquartile range for the two sets of data shown in Table  2.2  are  34  for  males  and  21  for  females.  The  semi-interquartile range is the interquartile range divided by 2.  Unlike  the  range,  the  interquartile  range  is  not  affected  by  a  single score which is much greater or much less than the others. But it does use only two ﬁgures from the set to express the variability in the set, and so ignores most of the numbers.  2.3.3 Variance and standard deviation  A better measure of variation would be one that used all the numbers in the set, not just two of them. This problem is tackled by looking at the mean of the set of scores, and taking the difference between each score and  the  mean.  If  one  adds  these  deviations  from  the  mean,  the  total  is zero: so this ﬁgure is not going to be very helpful as an indication of the variation in the set of scores! The way round this is to square each of the deviations,  which  gets  rid  of  all  the  negative  numbers,  and  then  add them up to obtain a sum of squared deviations. In order to get an idea of the variation in the set, it is sensible to take the average of the squared deviations.  If  n is  the  number  of  values  in  the  set,  then  the  sum  of  the squared  deviations  divided  by  n is  known  as  the  variance of  the  set  of scores.   Note: If you are using data from a sample as an estimate of a wider population,  then  divide  by  n 2 1  to  obtain  a  better  estimate  of  the population variance.   The  square  root  of  the  variance  is  the  standard  deviation,  and  is  the  number used to express the variation in the set of scores.   THE BASICS OF STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  11  2.4 Frequency distributions  2.4.1 Histograms and barcharts  A frequency distribution shows the number of times each score occurs in the set of scores under examination. Figure 2.1 shows as a histogram the frequency distribution of the scores in Table 2.1.  Histograms  and  barcharts  are  graphical  displays  of  the  frequency distribution of the scores. A histogram is used for a continuous variable, and  a  barchart  for  a  categorical  variable.  In  a  barchart  the  bars  are separated  to  indicate  that  they  represent  different  categories.  In  SPSS, any category which is empty  has a frequency of zero  will not be shown in a barchart.  A frequency distribution can be symmetrical or skewed. Figure 2.1 is skewed  –  the  scores  tend  to  be  piled  up  at  one  end  of  the  scale.  If  a distribution  is  roughly  symmetrical,  the  mean  can  be  used  as  the measure  of  central  tendency,  but  if  it  is  skewed  the  median  should  be used rather than the mean. A normal distribution, which is symmetrical, has  a  skewness  statistic  of  zero.  Kurtosis  measures  the  extent  to  which observations are clustered in the tails.

A  perfect  normal  curve  is  symmetrical,  with  the ‘middle’ being equal to the mean. The skewness is zero and the kurtosis statistic is also zero.   12  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  0.5  0.4  0.3  0.2  0.1  y c n e u q e r f   e v  i t a l e R  0  –4   –2  0   x value  2   4  Figure 2.2 The normal distribution curve  One  can  measure  off  the  horizontal  axis  in  standard  deviations   sd  from  the  mean.  Very  nearly  all  the  distribution  lies  between  23 sd  and 13 sd from the mean. Tables of the normal curve, found in most statistics texts,  give  the  proportion  of  the  curve  falling  above  and  below  any position  on  the  horizontal  axis.  From  such  tables,  it  is  easy  to  ﬁnd  the proportion of the curve between any two points on the horizontal axis.  2.4.3 z scores  When a series of scores is transformed so that it has a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 1.00, the scores are known as z scores. The beneﬁt of a z score is that it tells you where that score lies relative to the mean: a negative z indicates that the score is below the mean, and a positive one that  it  is  above  the  mean.  From  normal  curve  tables,  one  can  ﬁnd  just where any z score stands in relation to the population. For example a z score of 11.50 has 5.9% of the distribution above and 94.1% below it, so this means that someone who has a z score of 11.5 has surpassed 94.1% of the population. If you want to compare scores from different tests, you can do so if you express the scores in z units.  2.5 Standard error and conﬁdence limits  Inferential statistics involve estimating the characteristics of a population from the data obtained from a sample of that population. For example, one uses the mean of the sample to estimate the population mean. If one took  a  large  set  of  samples  from  the  population,  the  means  of  the samples  would  form  a  normal  distribution.  The  standard  deviation  of that distribution is given by taking the standard deviation of the sample   THE BASICS OF STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  13  and dividing it by the square root of n, the number in the sample. This is the standard error.  The  standard  error  allows  one  to  state  the  probability  that  the  true mean of the population is within speciﬁed limits. From the properties of the normal distribution, it can be deduced that there is a 95% probability that  the  true  mean  of  the  population  is  within  plus  or  minus  approx- imately 2 standard errors of the sample mean. Suppose you have taken a sample of 100 subjects from a population and found that the mean of the sample is 50, and the standard deviation is 15. The standard error is 1.5  15   square  root  of  100 .  One  can  conclude  that  the  true  mean  of  the population  has  a  95%  probability  of  being  within  the  limits  50  6 two standard errors 5 50 6 3, i.e. between 47 and 53. So the 95% conﬁdence interval  means  that  there  is  a  95%  probability  that  the  true  mean  is between the limits speciﬁed.  2.6 Statistical signiﬁcance and testing hypotheses  2.6.1 Statistical signiﬁcance of the difference between means  The data in Table 2.3 shows the number of customers visited by the sales personnel  of  two  employers   labelled  2  and  3 .  The  question  that  the  Table 2.3 Customer visits by sales personnel from two employers  Employer 2  Employer 3  Respondent number  Number of visits  Respondent number  Number of visits  2 5 8 11 14 15 20 21  46 71 28 39 33 36 60 39  4 6 10 13 16 19  83 72 76 68 79 58  Mean:  44.00  Mean:  72.67  researcher  asks  is:  is  there  a  statistically  signiﬁcant  difference  between the mean number of visits of the two groups of sales personnel?  In Table 2.3, employer group 2 has the smaller mean, and so you might wish  to  conclude  that  these  people  made  fewer  visits.  But  look  at respondent number 5 in employer group 2 and respondent 19 in group 3: the group 3 member has a smaller score than the group 2 member. So if you took just those two scores, you could not say that group 2 had the lower score.  If there were no difference between the two groups, their mean scores would be the ‘same’. This does not imply, of course, that they would be   14  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  identical,  because  responses  almost  always  show  some  variance   varia- bility . This random, unexplained variation is due to chance. For exam- ple,  the  variation  in  the  scores  for  employer  group  2  in  Table  2.3  is variation due to chance. The mean for respondents 2, 5, 8 and 11 in group 2  is  46  and  the  mean  for  respondents  14,  15,  20  and  21  from  the  same group  is  42.  The  difference  between  these  two  means  is  simply  due  to chance,  random  variation.  It  arises  even  though  both  these  subgroups come  from  one  ‘population’   the  complete  set  of  scores  given  by employer group 2 respondents .  Our question now is: is the difference between the means of group 2 and  group  3  also  simply  due  to  chance?  If  the  difference  between  the means of group 2 and group 3 is the result of chance, then groups 2 and 3 are samples from the same ‘population’, just as respondents 2–11 and 14–21 of employer group 2 are samples from one population.  To decide whether groups 2 and 3 are samples from one population or are ‘really’ different and come from different populations, one applies a test of statistical signiﬁcance. The signiﬁcance tests let you estimate how likely  it  is  that  the  data  from  the  separate  groups  of  respondents  come from  one  population.  If  it  is  unlikely  that  they  came  from  the  same population, you can conclude that they didn’t, and that they came from separate populations.  In  the  signiﬁcance  testing  of  differences  we  look  at  the  difference between the sets of scores and compare it with the amount of variation in the  scores  which  arises  from  chance.  If  the  chance  variation  is  likely  to have produced the difference between the groups, we say the difference is  non-signiﬁcant,  which  means  the  difference  probably  did  arise  from chance  variation.  We  have  to  conclude  there  is  no  ‘real’  or  statistically signiﬁcant  difference  between  the  groups,  and  they  are  both  from  the same underlying population.  2.6.2 Signiﬁcance level  If the difference between two groups is likely to have arisen from chance variation  in  the  scores,  we  conclude  there  is  no  real  ‘signiﬁcant’  differ- ence  between  them.  On  the  other  hand,  if  the  difference  between  the groups is unlikely to have been brought about by the chance variation in scores,  we  conclude  there  is  a  real,  statistically  signiﬁcant  difference between the groups.  But  what  do  we  mean  by  likely?  It  is  conventional  to  use  the  5% probability level  also referred to as alpha-level : what does this mean? If there  is  a  5%   usually  written  as  0.05   or  smaller  probability  that  the difference between the groups arose from chance variation, we conclude it did not arise from chance and that there is a ‘real’ difference. If there is more than 5%  0.05  probability that the difference arose from chance, we conclude the difference is not a real one.   THE BASICS OF STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  15  You may well ask why we use 5%; and the answer is that it is merely  convention. We could use 10%  0.10 , 1%  0.01 , 0.5%  0.005 .  2.6.3 Type I and type II errors  A  signiﬁcance  test  allows  us  to  say  how  likely  it  is  that  the  difference between scores of groups of respondents was due to chance. If there is a 5% or smaller probability that the difference is due to chance variation, we conclude that it was not caused by chance. But we can never be sure: there is always a possibility that the difference we ﬁnd was due to chance even  when  we  conclude  that  it  was  not.  Conversely,  we  may  ﬁnd  a difference  and  conclude  that  it  is  not  signiﬁcant   that  it  was  due  to random  or  chance  variability  in  the  scores   when  in  fact  it  was  a  ‘real’ difference.  So  there  are  two  types  of  error  we  may  make.  These  are referred to as type I and type II errors.  A type I error occurs when we reject a null hypothesis when it is true, i.e. we say there is a ‘real’ difference between the groups when in fact the difference is not ‘real’. The probability that we shall make a type I error is  given  by  the  signiﬁcance  level  we  use.  With  an  alpha  or  signiﬁcance level of 5%, on 5% of occasions we are likely to make a type I error and say the groups differ when they do not.  We can reduce the probability of making a type I error by using a more stringent level of signiﬁcance: 1%, say, rather than 5%. But as we reduce the chances of making a type I error, we increase the likelihood that we shall  make  a  type  II  error,  and  say  there  is  no  difference  between  the groups when there is one.  2.6.4 Directional  one-tailed  and non-directional  two-tailed  hypotheses  Referring  back  to  Table  2.3,  the  aim  of  the  study  was  to  test  the hypothesis that there is a difference between the scores of the two groups of  respondents.   The  null  hypothesis  is  that  there  is  no  difference between the scores of the two groups.   Note  that  the  hypothesis  is  that  there  is  a  difference.  It  does  not say employer group 3 will score higher or lower than group 2, merely that group  3  and  group  2  will  differ.  This  is  a  non-directional  or  two-tailed hypothesis: group 3 could score less than group 2 or group 3 could score more than group 2.  If we had stated the hypothesis that group 2 will score less than group 3  i.e. if we predict the direction of the difference between the groups , then we would have had a directional or one-tail hypothesis. Similarly, if our  hypothesis  were  that  group  2  would  score  more  than  group  3,  this would also be a directional hypothesis since we would still be predicting the direction of the difference between the groups.  The distinction between directional and non-directional hypotheses is important  when  applying  signiﬁcance  tests.  Most  SPSS  printouts  show the  non-directional   two-tailed   probability  of  the  calculated  statistic.  If   16  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  you have stated a directional hypothesis before examining the data, you can  use  the  one-tailed  probabilities,  which  are  the  two-tailed  probabili- ties divided by 2.  2.7 Interpreting the outcome of a signiﬁcance test  Understanding  what  a  signiﬁcance  test  tells  you  is  the  most  important part  of  statistical  analysis:  doing  all  the  proper  tests  and  getting  the correct answers is no good if you then misunderstand what the outcome means! Unfortunately, in the drive to do the computations, some inves- tigators  forget  that  the  interpretation  is  the  rationale  for  the  whole procedure. So try to remember some basic principles:  1  2  3  If  the  test  tells  you  the  difference  between  groups  is  not  signiﬁcant, you  must  conclude  there  is  no  difference,  even  though  the  mean scores are not identical. If  the  difference  between  groups  is  statistically  signiﬁcant,  this  does not necessarily mean that it is practically meaningful or signiﬁcant in the  everyday  sense.  For  example,  in  a  study  of  people’s  ability  to remember car licence plates, one group’s score remained the same on two  test  occasions  so  the  increase  was  0,  whereas  another  group’s score  increased  from  3.22  to  3.42,  an  increase  of  0.20;  the  difference was  statistically  signiﬁcant.  But  it  is  a  subjective  judgement,  not  a statistical one, as to whether the increase of 0.20 for the second group has any practical importance. If you are analysing the results of an experiment, remember that the assumption behind the experimental method is that one can conclude that signiﬁcant changes in the dependent variable are caused by the changes in the independent variable. But the validity of this assump- tion  depends  on  one’s  having  used  a  properly  designed  and  con- trolled experiment: ﬁnding a signiﬁcant difference between group A and group B does not mean you can necessarily conclude the differ- ence  was  due  to  the  changes  in  the  independent  variable.  If  the experiment  was  confounded,  and  the  different  groups  differed  sys- tematically on another variable in addition to the independent varia- ble, no clear explanation of the differences in the dependent variable can be given. The statistical signiﬁcance of the result does not by itself give  grounds  for  concluding  that  the  independent  variable  brought about the changes in the dependent variable.  4 Avoid the temptation to take the level of signiﬁcance as an index of the magnitude of the experimental effect. By convention one usually uses the 5% signiﬁcance level, but one can use a more stringent one, and ﬁnd that a difference between groups is signiﬁcant not only at 5% but also at 1% or 0.1%. Even eminent researchers have been known to argue that a difference signiﬁcant at 1% is somehow more ‘real’ than   THE BASICS OF STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  17  one signiﬁcant at 5%. This is not a valid interpretation. If the result of your  analysis  is  signiﬁcant  at  the  level  you  are  using   usually  5% , just accept that and do not give in to the temptation to conclude that a difference signiﬁcant at 1% is ‘better’.  2.8 Parametric and non-parametric tests  Parametric  signiﬁcance  tests  rest  upon  assumptions  that  the  data  has certain characteristics. The assumptions for using parametric tests are as follows.  1 Observations  are  drawn  from  a  population  with  a  normal  distribu- tion.   Note  that  the  population  is  normally  distributed,  not  neces- sarily the sample of scores taken from it.   2 The sets of data being compared have approximately equal variances.  This is referred to as homogeneity of variance.  If the groups are of 5 n2 , then this assumption is not so important. If the equal size  n1 groups being compared have an n of 10 or less, it is acceptable for the variance  of  one  group  to  be  up  to  three  times  as  large  as  that  of another. With larger groups, you can still use the parametric tests if one group has a variance double that of another.  3 The data is measured on an interval or ratio scale.  If  the  data  does  not  meet  these  assumptions,  you  can  convert  the  data into  a  non-parametric  form  and  then  apply  one  of  the  non-parametric tests.  The  commonest  way  of  converting  data  into  a  form  for  non- parametric analysis is to rank it.  2.9 Selecting the appropriate test  When  analysing  data  it  is  vital  that  you  use  the  appropriate  form  of signiﬁcance test. To decide which test is the appropriate one, you have to be able to answer a number of questions:  1 Does the data consist of frequency counts? 2 Are you looking for a difference between sets of scores or a relation-  3 Are  you  using  data  from  different  sets  of  people  or  different  data  ship between sets of scores?  obtained from the same people?  4 How many sets of scores are you analysing? 5 Are the dependent variables measured on an ordinal scale or are they measured  on  an  interval  or  ratio  scale?   Is  a  non-parametric  or  a parametric test appropriate?   When you have answers to all these questions, you can use Figure 2.3 to help you identify the analysis you need. But the questions are not always   18  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  easy  to  answer!  If  you  feel  you  need  some  help,  try  Exercise  2.1  which will give you some practice.  Exercise 2.1  1 A recent survey asked a group of men whether they thought ‘adult’ ﬁlms should be shown uncut on TV. Data was reported for different age groups, and 75 men under 60 said ‘yes’ while 35 said ‘no’. For those over 60, 30 said ‘yes’ and 50 said ‘no’. Which type of analysis is needed? Jones wanted to know whether people remembered more from a weather forecast which they heard on the radio or from one they saw on the television. She had two sets of respondents: one watched a TV forecast and the other listened to it on radio. She then gave all the participants a test to see how much they remembered. Which type of analysis is needed?  2  4  3 King carried out research into the effects of playing computer games on sporting performance. She measured 50 people’s skill at kicking a football at a target, asked them to play a computer game for three hours, and then measured their football kicking skill again. Which type of analysis is needed? Lovell was also interested in the effects of computer game playing on football kicking accuracy. He used two age groups: boys aged 10 and boys aged 15. In each age group, he had two subgroups. One of the subgroups was assessed for kicking accuracy, played a computer game for three hours and was assessed again. The other subgroup was assessed, then spent three hours having normal lessons and was assessed for kicking skill. Which type of analysis is needed?  5 Mycroft wanted to know whether managers who report high levels of  stress at work drink more. He asked 50 managers to answer a questionnaire which gives a score on stress level between 10 and 100, and also to record how much they drank during a two-week period. Which type of analysis is needed?  6 Harris investigated whether children from large families did less well  at tests of reading than children from small families. He obtained reading test scores from 500 children and also found out how many brothers and sisters each child had. Which type of analysis is needed?   THE BASICS OF STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  19  Answers to Exercise 2.1  1 The two-sample chi-square test is used with nominal  frequency  data where subjects are assigned to categories on two variables, so is the appropriate one here. It is concerned with answering the question: is there a relationship between the two categorical variables  age and response ‘yes’ or ‘no’ in the example ? Jones has data from two groups of respondents, and the data  scores on a memory test  are measured on an ordinal or possibly an interval scale. So she needs a test to compare two sets of scores and would use the independent t-test or the Mann–Whitney test.  2  3 King has two sets of scores and a variable measured on an interval scale. The two sets of scores were obtained from the same people, so a within-subjects t-test would be the ﬁrst choice. Note that this study as described uses a very weak experimental design, and even if the two sets of scores were found to be signiﬁcantly different, this would not show that the computer game affected football kicking performance. There needs to be a control group to see whether football performance alters even when people do not play a computer game. Lovell’s study is an improvement on that of King because a control group was used. The table of data would look like this:  4  Performance measured at  Pretest  Post-test  Age group  Condition  10 10  15 15  computer game no computer game  computer game no computer game  There are two between-subjects factors – age and whether or not a computer game was played – and one within-subjects variable: test condition, which has two levels  pretest and post-test . So this requires an analysis of variance.  5 Mycroft’s study was concerned with establishing whether there is an  association between stress and drinking. He would calculate the correlation between the two sets of scores.  6 Harris’ study demonstrates the way in which alternative methods of  analysis can be appropriate for answering a research question. He could see whether there is an association between number of siblings and reading attainment by correlating these two variables. Alternatively, he might set the data out in a table like this:   20  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  Mean reading performance  Number of siblings 0 1 2 3 4 or more  There are ﬁve means to compare, so a one-way analysis of variance would then be appropriate.

SPSS  is  a  suite  of  computer  programs,  which  has  been  developed  over many years. The original SPSS and SPSSx were only available on main- frame  computers.  The  Windows  PC  version  is  now  one  of  the  most widely-used  programs  of  its  type  in  the  world.  There  are  various versions,  the  current  one  being  number  10;  the  underlying  program remains the same but the menu organization does tend to alter from one version to another, and each version has some additional facilities. This book deals with versions 8 to 10, which operate under the Windows 95 or 98 environment.   STARTING OUT  23  All users will have the Base system of whichever version of SPSS they have  available.  In  addition,  one  can  purchase  extra  modules  which provide additional analytic procedures, and some of the more commonly used ones are described in this book.  Even the Base system consists of a large set of programs, but the user does  not  need  to  know  much  about  the  actual  SPSS  programs;  the important  thing  is  learning  to  drive  rather  than  learning  how  the  car works! It is, however, important to understand the general characteristics of the structure of the package and the ﬁles that are used and created by it.  Like  earlier  versions,  SPSS  for  Windows  consists  of  a  number  of components. First, there are the programs making up the package itself; these  read  the  data,  carry  out  the  analysis  and  produce  a  ﬁle  of  the results. The normal user needs to know little about these programs, just as  a  driver  needs  to  know  little  about  the  structure  of  the  internal combustion  engine  or  the  physical  characteristics  of  a  differential.  Sec- ond, there are the numbers that the user wants analysed, and these have to be entered into a data window and saved as a data ﬁle. Third, there are the commands which tell the package which analyses the user wants performed on the data. Fourth, there are the results of the analysis.  Entering  the  data,  providing  the  instructions  on  which  analyses  to perform, and examining the output can all be carried out on screen, with the data, commands and results being available in separate windows at the same time.  Figure 3.1 indicates the way in which the ﬁles are organized.  In this book  it  is  assumed  the  data  and  command  ﬁles  are  stored  on  a  ﬂoppy disk,  and  that  one  of  the  output  ﬁles,  the  .spo  ﬁle  is  also  sent  to  the ﬂoppy disk.  Essentially, SPSS itself sits on the hard disk. In order to use it you must provide it with data to be analysed, which is entered into a table presented on the screen and is then stored in a data ﬁle which has the ﬁlename extension .sav. When you want the data to be analysed, you have to tell SPSS which analysis you want done by issuing commands. The  commands  can  be  entered  by  selecting  from  the  Window  menus, and they can be pasted into a syntax window and stored in a syntax ﬁle. It  is  not  essential  to  save  one’s  commands  in  a  ﬁle,  but  I  strongly  urge you to do so.  When  SPSS  for  Windows  runs,  it  either  reacts  to  the  commands selected  from  the  menus  directly  and  applies  them  to  the  data  in  the table or it reads the commands from the syntax window and responds to them by applying them to the data.  When  it  is  running,  SPSS  for  Windows  creates  two  output  ﬁles.  One holds  the  results  of  the  analysis  it  has  performed  and  is  put  into  a window on the screen initially entitled Output1. You will almost always want  to  save  this  ﬁle,  and  it  will  be  saved  with  the  ﬁlename  extension .spo or .rtf, depending on whether you use the Output Viewer or Draft Output. For most purposes, the Output Viewer is to be recommended.   24  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  The  other  output  ﬁle  is  named  SPSS.jnl.  It  records  a  list  of  the commands  which  SPSS  carries  out  and  is  stored  in  the  windows temp directory  on  the  hard  disk.  Every  time  you  use  SPSS  for  Windows,  the record of the commands you use is added to the end of the .jnl ﬁle, so over a series of sessions it can become very lengthy. You can turn off the process of recording the journal ﬁle, or you can ask the system to record only  the  .jnl  ﬁle  for  the  current  session,  overwriting  any  previous version. You  can  also  have  the  .jnl  ﬁle  stored  on  the  ﬂoppy  disk  rather than the hard disk. To do any of these, you use Edit  Options: the way to achieve these alterations to the way the .jnl ﬁle is saved will be clear once you have experience of using SPSS for Windows.  3.2 Naming ﬁles  SPSS will automatically give data ﬁles the extension .sav, output ﬁles the extension  .spo,  syntax  ﬁles  the  extension  .sps.  When  you  are  doing  a number of analyses on a set of data it is very easy to lose track of all the ﬁles  you  create  on  the  way.  I  have  found  it  helpful  to  save  the  ﬁles created in each SPSS session using names which indicate the date when they  were  created.  So,  for  example,  if  you  are  working  on  September 15th,  save  the  syntax  ﬁle  with  the  name  sep15.sps,  the  output  ﬁle  with the name sep15.spo. Then when you come back later and have to ﬁnd a particular  ﬁle  on  a  crowded  disk,  at  least  you  know  that  the  syntax stored in sep15.sps produced the output stored in sep15.spo. In addition, you will know that the ﬁles named sep15.sps and sep15.spo are a pair and different from those named sep20.sps and sep20.spo. Another worthwhile tip  is  to  be  sure  to  keep  all  the  ﬁles  referring  to  one  set  of  data  in  one directory, separate from the ﬁles referring to another set of data.  SPSS program files  Working data file  .jnl file  .spo file  Syntax command .sys file  Data .sav file  Copy of output .spo file  Figure 3.1 Diagram of the structure of SPSS for Windows ﬁles  One  note  of  warning:  do  ensure  that  you  keep  the  correct  ﬁlename extensions  for  the  type  of  ﬁle  you  are  saving.  So  all  syntax  ﬁles  must   STARTING OUT  25  have  the  extension  .sps,  all  data  ﬁles  the  extension  .sav  and  all  output ﬁles  the  extension  .spo.  If  you  fail  to  do  this  you  will  have  a  chaotic situation, have great difﬁculties ﬁnding the ﬁles you want and may well lose vital ﬁles altogether.  3.3 Essential terminology for all SPSS users  You  need  to  appreciate  some  of  the  terminology  that  is  used  when explaining how the package operates.  T H E C A S E When  you  approach  SPSS,  you  have  some  data  to  be  ana- lysed,  and  this  is  in  the  form  of  responses  or  scores  from  a  number  of different respondents. A respondent may be a person or an organization such  as  a  hospital  ward  or  a  school.   You  might  be  dealing  with  the records  of  number  of  patients  treated  over  a  given  period  or  the  exam successes of each of 200 schools, for example.  Each respondent is known as a case, and the results from one case  respondent  form one line in the data ﬁle. In SPSS for Windows, the data from one case forms one row in a table.  VA R I A B L E S A N D L E V E L S You  will  have  a  number  of  items  of  data  from each  case,  such  as  the  respondent’s  age,  sex,  income,  score  on  an intelligence test, number of heart attacks, etc. Each of these is a score on a  variable  age,  sex,  income,  etc. .  Each  variable  has  to  have  a  name, which cannot be more than eight characters long and must not contain a space.  So you could name a variable intell, but not intelligence since the full  word  has  more  than  eight  letters.  And  you  cannot  call  a  variable score 1, as that contains a space; you would have to use score1 or score_1 as  the  name.   In  SPSS  for  Windows  variables  are  automatically  named var00001,  var00002,  etc.  until  you  rename  them   which  you  should always do .  When you tell SPSS to analyse the data from the data ﬁle, you have to tell  it  which  variables  to  analyse  by  indicating  their  names.  So  if  you have  a  variable  which  indicates  the  respondent’s  gender,  you  might name this variable sex. Then when you want to analyse the responses on this variable  for example, to ﬁnd out how many respondents were male and how many female , you have to tell SPSS to analyse the variable sex, i.e. you use the name that has been given to that variable.  It is important to be clear about the difference between variables and levels  of  a  variable.  The  variable  is  whatever  aspect  of  the  respondent you  have  measured:  age,  sex,  number  of  times  admitted  to  hospital, intention to vote for a particular party, etc. The levels are the number of alternative  values  that  the  score  on  the  variable  can  take.  For  example there are two levels of the variable sex: male and female. Age can have many levels; if you record the age in years, it can vary from 0 to about   26  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  105, so there would be 106 levels. Usually, age is put into categories such as 0–20, 21–40, 41–60, over 60 and in this particular case this gives four levels of the age variable.  It is quite simple to enter the actual ages into SPSS and then have the program code the values into a smaller number of categories, using the Recode procedure described in chapter 12.   S Y S T E M M I S S I N G A N D U S E R - D E F I N E D M I S S I N G VA L U E S You  need  to appreciate  the  concept  of  the  system-missing  value,  and  how  it  differs from  a  user-deﬁned  missing  value.  When  you  enter  data  into  the  Data Editor table, if you leave empty one of the cells in a column or a row that contains data, the empty cell will be ﬁlled with a full-stop  period . This cell will be detected as containing no data, and SPSS for Windows will give  it  the  ‘system  missing’  value.  So  the  system-missing  value  is automatically inserted when a number is expected but none is provided by the data.  But  when  some  respondents  have  not  answered  all  the  questions asked, or have failed to provide a measure on one of the variables, it is sensible  for reasons that will become clear later  to record a no-response by entering a particular number. So one might record male as 1, female as 2 and then use 3 to indicate that the person failed to indicate their sex. The value of 3 on the variable sex would then be a user-deﬁned ‘missing value’. Of course one has to tell SPSS that this value does represent ‘no response’: how to do this is explained in section 5.6.  When choosing a number to represent ‘data missing’, it is essential to use  a  number  that  cannot  be  a  genuine  value  for  that  variable.  If  one wanted to deﬁne a missing value for age, for example, one would use a number that could not possibly be genuine, such as 21 or 150.  I D E N T I F I C AT I O N N U M B E R S A N D C A S E N U M B E R S When  entering  data from a set of respondents, it is always worth inserting a variable, which you  might  call  ID,  that  represents  the  identiﬁcation  number  of  the respondent. You  can  then  readily  ﬁnd  the  data  for  any  respondent  you need, and check the entries against the original record of the responses. This identiﬁcation number has to be entered as a ‘score’ on the variable ID, just like any other.  But  SPSS  also  assigns  its  own  identiﬁcation  number  to  each  case, numbering  each  case  sequentially  as  it  reads  the  data  ﬁle.  This  is  the $casenum variable, which you may see listed when you ask for informa- tion  about  the  variables  in  the  data  ﬁle.  The  ﬁrst  case  in  the  data  ﬁle, which may have any user-deﬁned identiﬁcation number you wish, will have the $casenum of 1, the next one will have $casenum 2 and so on. Do not  rely  on  $casenum  for  identifying  cases  in  the  data  ﬁle,  as  it  can change if you put the cases into a different order. Use an ID variable as well!   STARTING OUT  27  P RO C E D U R E S When SPSS analyses data, it applies a procedure: for exam- ple,  that  part  of  SPSS  which  calculates  a  correlation  coefﬁcient  is  one procedure,  the  part  which  reports  the  average  score  on  a  variable  is another. Most of this book is concerned with explaining how you decide which  procedure  you  want  in  order  to  achieve  a  particular  type  of analysis, and how you run that procedure on your data.  3.4 What you need to run SPSS for Windows  Assuming  SPSS  for  Windows  is  installed  on  your  hard  disk,  there  are seven things you need to know in order to use it:  1 how to get to the SPSS programs; 2 how to create and save a ﬁle of data to be analysed; 3 which analyses you want done; 4 how to obtain the commands  procedures  which do those analyses; 5 how to get SPSS to apply the commands to the data ﬁle; 6 how to save the contents of the output  .spo  ﬁle on the ﬂoppy disk; 7 how to save the commands in a syntax ﬁle.  These requirements are covered in the following chapters. To begin, how do you get into SPSS for Windows  and how do you get out of it ?  3.5 Getting to SPSS for Windows  From  the  windows  desktop,  double-click  on  the  SPSS  icon.  If  you  are presented with a window asking you ‘What would you like to do?’, click on the cancel button in the window. If you are using version 9, you will be presented with the screen shown in Figure 3.2 or something very like it: the exact details vary according to the version of SPSS you are using. If you are using version 10, the Data Editor is very similar, and is shown in  Figure  3.4.  The  table  shown  in  Figure  3.4  is  a  tabbed  page  labelled Data  View.  There  is  another  tabbed  page  available,  labelled  Variable View.  The  facilities  provided  by  this  Variable  View  are  described  in section  3.9.  The  next  subsections  of  this  chapter  describe  the  use  of windows  and  dialogue  boxes;  if  you  are  familiar  with  using  these,  go straight to section 3.9.  3.6 The components of a window  The title bar of a window is at the top and includes the window’s title. At the left edge there is a control-menu box, and clicking on this will open the  control  menu  which  can  also  be  opened  using  Alt  followed  by Spacebar on the keyboard. The control-menu entries allow you to restore   28  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  Figure 3.2 The screen when SPSS for Windows version 8 is started  a  window  to  its  previous  size,  move  it  via  the  keyboard,  alter  its  size, reduce  it  to  an  icon,  enlarge  it  to  its  maximum  size  or  close  the application.  At the right edge of the title bar there are the minimize, maximize and close  buttons  which  allow  you  to  reduce  the  window  to  an  icon  or enlarge it to its largest possible size. You can alter the size of a window more precisely by placing the mouse pointer in the bottom right corner and  use  the  click drag  technique  to  reduce  or  increase  the  size  of  the window. The position of a window on the screen can be altered by click  dragging the title bar.  The menu bar, below the title bar, includes a number of menu headings  such  as  File,  Edit .  Each  menu  can  be  opened  by  moving  the  mouse cursor  over  it  and  clicking  the  left  mouse  button,  or  by  using  the keyboard:  while  holding  down  the  Alt  key  press  the  letter  key  corre- sponding to the underlined letter in the menu’s title. To select one of the entries in the selected menu, put the mouse cursor over it and click the mouse,  or  type  in  the  underlined  letter  of  the  entry  name  which  is underlined  you do not press Alt for submenu entries . A menu is closed by moving the pointer so it is outside it and clicking the mouse button. Some windows in SPSS for Windows have a tool bar which contains command buttons with an icon rather than a verbal label to indicate their function.   STARTING OUT  29  The scroll bars are used to reveal information that is outside the limits of  the  window. You  can  scroll  the  information  by  clicking  on  the  scroll arrows at the end of the scroll bar, click on the space between the scroll box  which shows which part of the ﬁle is being shown in the window  and  the  arrows,  point  at  the  scroll  arrow  and  hold  the  mouse  button down, or by click dragging the scroll box to position the window where you want it to be in the ﬁle.  3.7 The components of a dialogue box  Examples  of  dialogue  boxes  are  illustrated  in  Figure  3.3.  Dialogue  boxes are presented when you have to enter information about the task to be performed.  They  have  a  number  of  components.  Right-clicking  the mouse  while  the  cursor  is  over  one  of  the  components  provides  brief explanations of its purpose.  Scroll  bars are  provided  down  the  side  and   when  needed   along  the bottom  when  a  window  or  a  drop-down  list  box  cannot  show  all  the information available.  Text boxes are areas where you type in text from the keyboard. Move the pointer into the text box, and an insertion point  ﬂashing vertical bar  appears. Anchor the insertion point by clicking the mouse, and then type in material.  List boxes display a list of options; if there are more options than can be shown, the box has scroll bars which you use to scroll the list. To select one of the options, click on it: it will be highlighted. To select a number of adjacent  items,  use  the  click drag  technique  to  highlight  the  set  of options you want. To select a number of non-adjacent items, hold down Ctrl while you click on each one you wish to select.  Drop-down  list  boxes show  a  selected  option,  but  if  you  click  on  the down-pointing  arrow,  a  list  of  alternatives  will  be  revealed.  You  can select one of these by clicking on it.  Check  boxes are  small  squares  adjacent  to  a  label  indicating  their function. By clicking on them, you either delete or insert a tick into the box.  If  there  is  a  tick,  the  option  is  in  force;  if  the  box  has  no  tick,  it  is not.  Command buttons are labelled rectangular areas which you click on to initiate  an  action  or  to  reveal  another  dialogue  box.  Those  buttons  not available at the present time are dimmed.  Dialogue boxes in SPSS for Windows contain a Help button; clicking on  this  will  open  a  window  showing  information  about  the  topic  with which the dialogue box is concerned.  Option buttons  sometimes known as radio buttons, these are circular  are organized in sets. The members of a set are exclusive: if you click on one of them, any other previously selected one will be deselected, since only one of the set can be operative at any one time.   30  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  Figure 3.3 Examples of dialogue boxes  3.8 Using the keyboard if there is no mouse  I N T H E W I N D O W S  c To move to the menu bar, press Alt or the F10 key. c To move along the menu bar, use the left or right arrow keys. c To open and to move down a menu, use the down arrow key.

If you are using version 10, the Data Editor shown in Figure 3.4 is presented. The bottom left shows that there are two tabbed pages, Data View and Variable View, with the Data View being  the  one  shown  initially.  The  alternative  views  are  selected  by clicking on the appropriate tab or you can invoke Variable View from the Data View by double-clicking a variable name in a column heading.  In Variable View, each row of the table displays information on one of the variables,  showing  the  variable  name,  type,  width,  value  labels,  etc. These values can be changed by clicking in the relevant cell, which calls up  the  dialogue  box  which  would  be  obtained  if  you  used  the  Data  Deﬁne  Variable  menu.   Data  is  entered  into  the  Data  Editor  either  by typing it in or by opening a ﬁle of data that has previously been saved on a disk.  The  Help  menu  provides  access  to  information  which  can  assist  you use  SPSS  for  Windows;  further  information  on  Help  is  given  in  section 3.11 later in this chapter.  The  bottom  line  of  the  window,  the  Information  area,  presents  mes- sages indicating what the package is doing. When ﬁrst started, it reads ‘SPSS Processor is ready’.  The icon button bar below the menu bar allows many operations to be carried  out  by  pressing  the  appropriate  icon  button.  The  buttons  differ according to the type of window. To see what each button does, put the mouse cursor over it; a description of the button’s function is presented   32  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  Figure 3.4 The Data Editor of SPSS version 10  and also appears in the information area at the bottom of the screen. The meaning of many of these buttons will only become clear when you have had some experience with the package.  The Data Editor window is a table with columns headed var and rows labelled 1, 2, etc. When needed, scroll bars are provided down the right side  and  along  the  bottom,  so  one  can  move  the  contents  of  the  ﬁle within the window to reveal parts of it not otherwise visible.  T H E O U T P U T W I N D O W When  SPSS  performs  some  action,  the  Data Editor is replaced by an output window, which will initially be entitled Output1  –  SPSS  Viewer  or  Draft1  –  SPSS  Draft  Viewer,  depending  on which  type  of  output  the  system  is  set  up  to  generate.  The  Output Viewer provides much neater formatting than the Draft Viewer, and the examples  shown  in  this  book  use  it  rather  than  the  Draft  Viewer.  The Output  Viewer  window  is  shown  in  Figure  3.5,  which  shows  that  it consists  of  two  panels.  The  one  on  the  right  is  where  output  is  placed, while the one on the left is an outline view on the contents of the right- hand  pane.  The  width  of  the  outline  panel  can  be  altered  by  using  the click drag  technique  on  the  bar  separating  the  two  panels.  To  go  to  a particular  part  of  the  output,  click  on  its  entry  in  the  outline.  You  can move  the  contents  of  the  output  by  moving  the  corresponding  item  in the outline.                STARTING OUT  33  It is simple to open more clean output windows, by using File  New. This is often useful so that you have separate output windows for each analysis that you carry out.  Figure 3.5 Example of the Output Viewer  S Y N TA X W I N D O W If  you  paste  syntax   commands  telling  the T H E package the analysis you want it to perform , as I shall recommend you to  do,  it  will  be  pasted  into  a  syntax  window;  an  example  is  shown  in Figure 3.6. The most important button to locate is Run, the one with the right-pointing arrow. It runs the command in which the cursor is located at the time the button is pressed.  A C T I V E A N D D E S I G N AT E D W I N D O W S When  using  SPSS  for  Windows, you  can  have  a  number  of  output  windows  and  a  number  of  syntax windows  on  the  screen  simultaneously.   No  syntax  window  is  shown when  the  package  ﬁrst  begins,  but  they  are  used  for  recording  the commands you use in analysing the data.  For the moment, assume you have two output windows open. One of these is the one that will receive the results of the analysis you are performing, and this is known as the designated window. It is identiﬁed by having a ! in the information area on the bottom line.  The  active window  is  the  one  that  is  currently  on  view.  This  may  or may  not  be  the  designated  window:  if  there  is  no  exclamation  mark  in the  information  area,  the  window  is  not  designated. You  can  make  the   34  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  window  currently on the screen the designated one by clicking the red exclamation mark in the icon bar. The exclamation mark will then appear in the information area at the bottom of the window to show this is the designated window.  Figure 3.6 Example of a syntax window  As  different  windows  are  viewed,  the  other  windows  are  closed  and form a set of buttons in the taskbar along the bottom of the screen. To see any window, click on its button or open the Window entry in the menu bar and click on the name of the window you want.  3.10 Leaving SPSS for Windows  To  leave  the  package,  have  the  Data  Editor  on  the  screen,  and  either double click on the control box at the left edge of the window title bar, or select  File  Exit  In either case you will be asked whether you wish to save the ﬁles that are at present in use: the data ﬁle, output ﬁles, and any syntax ﬁles.   STARTING OUT  35  3.11 On-screen help for SPSS for Windows  In addition to the Help system described here, right-clicking the mouse can provide brief explanations of the components of a dialogue box or a table in the Output Viewer. You will also ﬁnd that a right-click can open menus  in  the  Data  Editor  when  the  cursor  is  over  the  column  or  row headings. It is worth investigating the effects of right-clicking; you may ﬁnd it provides a useful short-cut for some facilities that you frequently use.  Selecting  Help  from  the  menu  bar  provides  access  to  a  number  of types of help. Help  Topics presents a display with a number of tabbed pages   Contents,  Index,  Find,  Ask  me .  The  Contents  gives  a  series  of chapters on major topics such as saving ﬁles, and also allows you to run the on-screen tutorials which can also be requested from the Help menu directly.  If  you  want  an  explanation  of  a  particular  word,  select  Index; this invites you to enter a word, and will show a list of relevant topics, assuming  there  are  some.  You  can  select  a  topic  and  press  the  Display button  to  see  the  help  information.  Since  the  person  asking  a  question often  does  not  know  where  to  ﬁnd  the  answer,  the  Ask  Me  facility  is probably  going  to  be  one  of  the  most  used  alternatives.  It  also  has  its own entry in the Help menu.  The Help  Statistics Coach is designed to help you decide what type  of analysis you need for any particular problem.  The  Help   Syntax  Guide  gives  you  the  details  of  the  SPSS  language commands’ syntax. The syntax is really meaningful only when you are familiar with the way SPSS commands are structured. To a beginner, it is likely to be bafﬂing; but if you follow the advice given in this book and always paste syntax into a syntax window, you will begin to see how the syntax is structured and then be able to make some sense of the help on the syntax.  All  the  dialogue  boxes  have  a  Help  button;  clicking  it  opens  a  Help window, in which information about the operation of SPSS is displayed. The  information  presented  will  be  relevant  to  that  part  of  the  package you were in when you requested help. So clicking on the Help button in the  Frequencies  dialogue  box  will  present  information  about  the  Fre- quencies  command.  The  syntax  information  mentioned  in  the  previous paragraph  can  also  be  accessed  from  the  Help  button  of  the  Dialogue boxes, which provides a window with a Syntax button.  3.12 Copying parts of Help  The  Help  window  has  a  menu  bar  which  includes  Print  and  Options entries. Under the Options you are offered the facility to Annotate, Copy, Print  topic.  The  Copy  option  allows  you  to  copy  the  Help  window’s contents and they can then be pasted into a word processor ﬁle.   36  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  3.13 Seeing a list of all the ﬁles on your ﬂoppy disk  Select File  Open, navigate up the directory structure until the Look In textbox contains drive a:, open the drop-down list for Files of Type and select the option All Files  *.* . All the ﬁles on the ﬂoppy will be shown in the ﬁle list, and you can scroll down it using the scroll bar.   4  CRUCIAL PRELIMINARIES  Summary  operates.  c Decide  before  you  get  to  the  computer  what  you  want  to  ﬁnd  out,  which statistical analyses you wish to apply.  c The  data  described  in  section  4.3  is  used  to  explain  how  SPSS  c It is usually more convenient to use numerical coding of all variables  rather than have string variables.  4.1 Know what you want to ﬁnd out  SPSS  provides  the  opportunity  to  carry  out  a  wide  range  of  statistical procedures very rapidly and with little effort. The danger is that because it offers such power, the researcher is tempted to comb the data: ‘Let’s do a  factor  analysis multiple  regression 100  t-tests  .  .  .  and  see  what happens’.  It  must  be  emphasized  that  there  are  real  dangers  in  this  approach. First,  there  is  the  statistical  problem  of  interpreting  signiﬁcance  levels when one has done a series of signiﬁcance tests after the data has been given  a  preliminary  examination.  Practically,  there  is  a  risk  that  you obtain masses of output which overwhelm your ability to interpret and understand  them:  faced  with  a  4-inch  pile  of  listing  paper,  many researchers,  after  the  ﬁrst  ﬂush  of  enthusiasm,  have  regretted  their unrestrained proliferation of analyses!  SPSS offers the facility for obtaining plots and test statistics which may be unfamiliar to you. Do be very wary of obtaining analyses which you do not understand. If you have never heard of Lilliefors, you will only confuse yourself by being presented with it. Decide before you get to the computer what you want to ﬁnd out, which statistical analyses you wish to apply. The power of the program is not a substitute for clear thinking. Without  a  deﬁnite  idea  of  what  you  are  looking  for  and  how  to  ﬁnd  it you are likely to generate confusion rather than understanding. Section 2.9  is  intended  to  help  you  decide  which  analyses  you  need,  and   38  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  therefore  which  SPSS  procedures  you  require,  in  order  to  obtain  the results you want from your data.  4.2 How to ﬁnd answers to questions you are asking  H O W M A N Y R E S P O N D E N T S G AV E T H AT R E S P O N S E ? In  many  types  of investigation,  the  investigator  wants  to  know  how  many respondents gave a particular answer or response. For example, how many cases in the data ﬁle were female, how many were female and under 40 years of age?  Answers  to  this  kind  of  question  are  provided  if  you  use  the Descriptive Statistics  Frequencies procedure  chapter 14 .  You may want to obtain a table showing the number of cases that had certain  scores  on  one  variable,  subdivided  according  to  their  scores  on another  variable.  For  example,  suppose  you  want  a  table  showing  the number of males and females coming from the North and the South. This type  of  table  is  provided  by  Descriptive  Statistics   Crosstabs   section 14.4  and by the Tables procedure  chapter 21 .  Having  produced  a  table  showing  the  number  of  people  of  each  sex coming from each part of the country, you might ask whether there is a signiﬁcant  relationship  between  these  two  factors:  do  proportionally more men than women come from the North? To see whether this type of relationship  exists  with  frequency  data,  you  need  the  chi-square  test, which  can  be  obtained  within  the  Descriptive  Statistics   Crosstabs procedure  section 14.5 .  H O W A R E T H E S C O R E S D I S T R I B U T E D ? W H AT A R E T H E P E R C E N T I L E S C O R E S ? If you want to see how the scores are distributed  perhaps to see whether they  form  a  normal  distribution   or  discover  the  percentile  scores,  use Descriptive Statistics  Explore  chapter 9 .  AV E R A G E S :  W H AT A R E T H E M E A N S A N D M E D I A N S ? You  may  want  to know  what  was  the  average  score  on  a  certain  variable:  what,  for example, was the average age of all the cases in the data ﬁle? This data can be found by using Descriptive Statistics  Descriptives  chapter 15 . Note carefully that if you want the means of subgroups of respondents, such  as  the  average  age  of  males  and  then  of  females,  you  need  the Descriptive  Statistics   Means  procedure   section  15.3 .  Tables  showing these statistics can also be obtained using the Tables procedure  chapter 21 .  AV E R A G E S : W H AT A R E T H E M E A N S F O R S U B G RO U P S O F R E S P O N D E N T S ? If you  want  the  average  score  of  subgroups  of  respondents,  such  as  the average age of men and of women, or the average income of people aged below 40 and the average income of people aged over 40, then you need the  Descriptive  Statistics   Means  procedure   section  15.3   or  the  Tables procedure  chapter 21 .   CRUCIAL PRELIMINARIES  39  I S T H E R E A S I G N I F I C A N T D I F F E R E N C E B E T W E E N S C O R E S ? A large part of statistical  analysis  is  involved  with  evaluating  the  differences  between sets of scores, and determining whether they are statistically signiﬁcant. The  concept  of  statistical  signiﬁcance  is  summarized  in  Chapter  2,  and identifying  the  particular  test  for  a  speciﬁc  question  is  explained  in section  2.9.  Chapter  16  covers  the  t-test  and  analysis  of  variance  for comparing means of sets of scores.  I S T H E R E A S I G N I F I C A N T D I F F E R E N C E B E T W E E N N O N - PA R A M E T R I C S C O R E S ? If  you  need  to  use  non-parametric  analysis,  the  Nonparametric  Tests procedure   chapter  18   offers  a  number  of  tests  including  the  Kruskal– Wallis, Mann–Whitney and others.  A R E T W O S E T S O F S C O R E S C O R R E L AT E D ? As  scores  on  one  variable increase, do scores on another variable increase or decrease? This type of question  is  asking  whether  there  is  a  correlation  between  the  scores  on the  two  variables,  and  is  answered  by  using  the  Correlation  procedure  chapter 17 . Rank correlations are also obtained from Correlation. If you have to rank the data, you use Transform  Rank Cases  chapter 11 .  H O W W E L L C A N I P R E D I C T O N E S C O R E F RO M R E S P O N D E N T S ’  OT H E R S C O R E S ? You may want to investigate whether responses on test1 and scores on test2 predict scores on test3, and this is a problem in multiple regression, which is dealt with using the Regression procedure  chapter 17 .  H O W D O I A N A LY S E S U B G RO U P S O F R E S P O N D E N T S S E PA R AT E LY ? You will frequently want to analyse the data for just some of the respondents: perhaps compare the scores on test1 and test2 only for people aged over 40, for example. To do this, you have to tell SPSS which subgroups you want to select, and then which analysis you wish to be carried out. You can use Data  Select If or Data  Split File  chapter 13 .  H O W C A N I C A L C U L AT E ‘ N E W ’  S C O R E S ,  S U C H A S E A C H R E S P O N D E N T ’ S AV E R A G E O N A N U M B E R O F VA R I A B L E S ? You  will  often  ﬁnd  that  you want  to  obtain  a  ‘new’  score  from  the  data  provided  by  your  respon- dents. Suppose, for example, that you have scores on test1 and test2; you might want to ﬁnd the average of these two scores for each respondent. To do this, use the Transform  Compute procedure  chapter 12 .  H O W D O I achieved using the Data  Sort Cases procedure  chapter 11 .

Suppose you have asked your respondents to indicate their age in years, and you ﬁnd that their ages vary from 16 to 85. To make the data more manageable, you might   40  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  decide  that  you  would  like  the  respondents  grouped  into  different  age groups of 16–35 years, 36–55 years, 56 and above. This can be achieved using the Transform  Recode procedure  chapter 12 .  To  transform  scores  into  ranks,  use  Transform   Rank  Cases   chapter  11 .  H O W D O I O B TA I N G R A P H S ? The graphing facilities for SPSS for Win- dows  versions  9  and  10  are  considerably  more  sophisticated  than  for previous  versions,  and  allow  you  to  create  barcharts,  histograms,  box plots, line graphs, area charts and pie charts, using the Graphs procedure  chapter 10 .  H O W D O I G E T A N E AT TA B L E O F T H E R E S U LT S ? The  output  which appears  in  the  Output  Viewer  is  neatly  formatted  as  tables,  so  long  as you are using the Viewer and not the Draft Viewer. You can also transfer your output to a word-processor and edit it there  section 7.8 , although this is not so easy as it was with earlier versions of SPSS.  I H AV E DATA I N D I F F E R E N T F I L E S –  H O W D O I M E R G E T H E M I N TO O N E ? The procedures needed are covered in chapter 6.  4.3 The data used in this book  The data ﬁle is simply the stored record of the numbers  data  which are to  be  analysed.  The  way  you  create  a  ﬁle  of  your  data  is  described  in chapter 5. In explaining how to create, store and use a ﬁle of data, it is helpful  to  have  an  example  to  refer  to,  and  I  shall  be  using  the  data described here.  Imagine that we have carried out a piece of research in which we gave a  questionnaire  to  each  of  a  group  of  22  salespeople.  They  were employed by three different employers, and the respondents were asked their sex, the name of their employer, the area of the country they work in   either  North  or  South ,  and  then  three  questions  intended  to  reveal their attitude towards their job. Each of these questions  numbers 5–7 in Figure 4.1  invited a response on a scale from 1 to 5. The questionnaire also asked the number of customers each salesperson had visited during the previous month, the total sales for the previous month, the sales for the  current  month,  and  the  date  the  respondents  started  working  for their  company.  Figure  4.1  shows  an  example  of  a  completed  ques- tionnaire from one respondent, and in all there are 22 questionnaires like this.  When  encoding  these  responses  for  SPSS,  all  the  responses  were encoded as numbers. Although the respondents indicated whether they are  male  or  female,  the  answers  were  expressed  as  a  number,  with  1 representing  male  and  2  representing  female.  Similarly,  each  employer   CRUCIAL PRELIMINARIES  41  Figure 4.1 Completed sales personnel questionnaire  was given a number and the respondent’s employer was recorded as 1, 2 or 3; the value 1 was used to represent Jones and Sons, etc. The area of work was also coded numerically with 1 for North and 2 for South.  It is straightforward to have the verbal meanings of the numbers displayed in the printout or on the screen.   Although this type of investigation may not be of any interest to you, the  kind  of  responses  obtained  are  similar  to  those  yielded  by  many kinds of research. Essentially, we have series of numbers. Here they are used  to  represent  sex,  employer,  area  of  country,  attitude  expressed  on each of three questions, three performance measures  customers visited, last  month  sales,  current  month  sales ,  and  the  date  when  the  person started with the company. We could have data on socio-economic status, number of children, or a thousand other things which can be represented as numbers.  4.4 Numeric and string  alphanumeric  variables  SPSS does accept alphanumeric  known as string  data, in which the data is  coded  in  the  data  ﬁle  not  as  a  number  but  as  a  series  of  letters   or letters  and  numbers .  If  the  data  contains  any  letters,  it  is  a  string variable.  There  are  some  drawbacks  to  using  string  variables.  First,  typing  in strings takes longer than typing in numbers. Second, there are limitations on what SPSS can do with string variables: one cannot use them in most statistical procedures. Consequently, it is usually more convenient to use numerical coding of all variables. For example, when recording a respon- dent’s sex you might code male as 1 and female as 2.  It is simple to have   42  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  the printout or the screen show that a score of 1 on sex means male and a score of 2 means female. In the Data Editor use the Value Labels icon button or select View  Value Labels to switch from the numerical code to their assigned labels.   Bear  in  mind  when  using  numbers  instead  of  a  string  label,  such  as coding male as 1 rather than ‘m’ and female as 2 rather then ‘f’, that the numbers are merely labels and form a nominal scale.  In  version  9,  if  you  are  using  a  string  variable  in  your  data  ﬁle  you have to tell SPSS that the variable is a string by using the Deﬁne Variable dialogue box, as described in section 5.5.  A  string  variable  can  be  converted  into  a  numeric  one  using  the Automatic  Recode  procedure  described  in  section  12.7  or  by  using Compute If, covered in section 12.3.  4.5 Scientiﬁc notation  In some cases, with very large or very small numbers, the output may be expressed in scientiﬁc notation such as 5E15 or 2.7E24. Remember that the exponential number  15, 24 in these examples  tells you how many places to move the decimal place to obtain the number in the usual form. If the exponent is positive, the decimal point is moved to the right, and if it is negative it is moved to the left. So 5E15 means that you start with 5.00 and move the decimal point ﬁve places to the right so the number is 500000.00.  The  scientiﬁc  notation  2.7E24  means  you  start  with  2.7  and move the decimal place four places to the left so the number is 0.00027.   5  THE DATA FILE  Summary  This chapter explains how to:  c enter data into the Data Editor c insert rows or columns anywhere in the table c save the ﬁle on the ﬂoppy disk using Save As c assign variable names and variable labels to the data c assign  value  labels  when  appropriate   e.g.  to  show  1  represents  ‘male’   c use missing values c use templates for deﬁning a number of variables c see information about the variables on screen or in the output c retrieve a data  .sav  ﬁle c import data from text ﬁles c import data from Excel c print the data ﬁle.  In  SPSS  for  Windows,  data  is  entered  into  the  table  which  is  automati- cally presented in the Data Editor window. When putting data into the Data  Editor,  each  row  of  the  table  should  contain  the  results  from  one respondent; SPSS refers to each line as a case.  Each  column  contains  the  results  on  one  variable;  for  example  the second column, var00002, might contain the data indicating the respon- dent’s sex. The cell entries are values, usually numbers.  If you wish to use letters, refer to section 4.4   If you do not want the grid lines separating the cells in the Data Editor window, turn them off by selecting View from the menu: the drop-down menu includes a Grid Lines option, and selecting it turns the lines off or on.   44  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  5.1 Entering data into SPSS  To enter data, have the Data Editor window visible and the cursor in the top left cell.  If necessary, press the Ctrl1Home key combination to move the cell selector to this cell.   Type  in  the  ﬁrst  set  of  numbers  for  the  ﬁrst  case  of  your  data  set:  I advise you always to have an identiﬁcation number as the ﬁrst ‘score’ for each respondent.  Press the right arrow key or the down arrow key or ¿ on the keyboard. If you press the right arrow key, the cell selector moves to the next cell on the  right  of  the  one  you  have  just  been  addressing.  It  is  usually  more convenient and less prone to error to enter the data for each respondent  row  rather than each variable  column , so pressing the right arrow key is normally the easiest procedure. If you press Enter or down arrow, the cell selector will move down to the cell below the one you have just been addressing.  The ﬁrst cell will now contain the ﬁgures you typed in, and the column will  now  be  headed  var00001.  Type  in  the  ﬁgures  for  the  second  cell, press  the  right  arrow  key  and  continue  until  all  the  ﬁgures  have  been entered in the appropriate row and column positions. Each time you put a  number  into  a  column  for  the  ﬁrst  time,  the  column  will  be  given  a label: column 2 is labelled var00002, column 3 is var00003 and so on.  Exercise 5.1: Entering a set of data into the Data Editor  The data I shall use to explain how SPSS for Windows operates has been described in chapter 4 and will be referred to as salesq  for Sales Questionnaire . The table of data is shown in Table 5.1, and your ﬁrst task is to enter it into the Data Editor. Put the ﬁrst number  1, the id for the ﬁrst respondent  into the top left cell of the table, the number 2  representing the sex of respondent number 1  into the top cell of the second column. Then continue entering numbers until all the data has been put into the table. The complete number for sales_1  3450.60 for the ﬁrst case  goes into one cell in column 9 of the table. The three sets of numbers representing the date started go into separate columns, so you will have 13 columns of numbers altogether.  The variables  with their names shown in brackets  are, reading from left to right: id, sex, employer  empl , area, response to question 5  att1 , response  to  question  6   att2 ,  response  to  question  7   att3 ,  customer visits   cust ,  sales  for  last  month   sales_1 ,  sales  for  the  current  month  sales_2 ,  day  of  date  started   dstd ,  month  of  date  started   dstm   and year  started   dsty .  The  abbreviated  variable  names  are  shown  in  the   THE DATA FILE  45  table.  Remember that variable names cannot exceed eight characters in length.

There are  no  empty  cells  in  the  salesq  data,  but  if  respondent  number  5  had failed to indicate their sex, for example, you could just skip over that cell when  entering  the  data.  It  would  contain  a  full-stop,  which  is  the ‘system-missing’ value. This is the value that SPSS inserts into any empty cell  in  a  column  that  contains  data.  It  allows  the  programme  to  keep track  of  the  occupied  cells  –  even  those  into  which  no  data  has  been entered  have  some  content.   The  notions  of  the  system-missing  value and user-deﬁned missing values are explained in section 5.6.   5.2 Editing data  If you need to make corrections to any of the cell entries, simply move the  cursor  to  that  cell   most  easily  done  by  clicking  on  it ,  type  in  the correct numbers and press ¿ or an arrow movement key.  If you want to alter one number in a long numerical entry, click on the relevant cell. The cell contents are reproduced in the line below the icon bar of the window; click at an appropriate position in this cell editor line, and  you  can  edit  the  entry.  To  insert  it  in  the  table,  press  ¿ or  use  the mouse to select another cell in the table.   46  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  I N T H E TA B L E Rows  can  be  inserted I N S E RT I N G RO W S O R C O L U M N S into a table by selecting a cell in the row below the one where you want a row inserted and then using from the menu bar  A  column  is  inserted  by  selecting  a  cell  in  the  column  to  the  right  of where you want one inserted, and then choosing from the menu bar  Data  Insert Case  Data  Insert Variable  C O P Y I N G O R M O V I N G DATA I N T H E TA B L E To copy or move cells, select them  using  the  click drag  technique,  and  while  they  are  highlighted, select  Edit  from  the  menu  bar  of  the  Data  Editor  window.

In most cases you will want to save the ﬁle on a ﬂoppy disk, so make sure your formatted disk is inserted into drive a:. To save the ﬁle on the ﬂoppy disk, follow these steps:  c While viewing the Data Editor, from the menu bar, select  File  Save As  You will be presented with the Save Data As dialogue box which is shown in Figure 5.1 as it appears when the drop-down list of the Save In options has been opened.  c Type  in  the  ﬁlename  which  you  want  the  ﬁle  to  be  called   for example,  salesq .  Remember  that  the  name  cannot  exceed  8  charac- ters and must not contain any spaces, full-stops or commas.  c Open the drop-down list for the Save In alternatives and click on the icon for drive a: so it appears in the Save In text area. This means the ﬁle will be stored on the ﬂoppy disk.  c Unless  you  have  a  reason  for  doing  otherwise,  save  the  ﬁle  in  the format  for  the  version  of  SPSS  you  are  using.  To  save  in  a  different format, open the drop-down menu for Save File as Type, which lists a number of alternative ﬁle formats. Select the one you want.  c Click  on  the  Save  button.  The  data  ﬁle  will  then  be  stored  on  your ﬂoppy  disk,  with  the  name  salesq.sav   If  you  used  the  ﬁlename mydat, the ﬁle will be mydat.sav.  The name will now appear in the Title bar of the Data Editor window.  If  you  think  you  made  a  mistake,  just  repeat  the  steps  given  above, checking that you are making the right selections at each point.  S AV I N G T H E DATA F I L E F O R T H E S E C O N D T I M E When you are working on a data ﬁle and have saved it once, or are working on a ﬁle that you have retrieved from disk, you can save the ﬁle under the same name as it already has by simply selecting  File  Save  from the Data Editor window menu bar. The version you are now saving will overwrite the previous one. If you want to keep the old version and the  current  one,  use  File   Save As   as  described  above ,  and  type  in  a different  name  from  the  current  one.  For  example,  suppose  you  have   THE DATA FILE  49  Figure 5.1 The Save Data As dialogue box  made some changes to salesq.sav and want to keep both the original and the  altered  versions;  you  would  save  the  current  version  under  a  new name by typing in a name such as salesq2, and the ﬁle will then be saved as salesq2.sav.  Exercise 5.2: Save the data  Save the ﬁle as salesq.sav, following the procedure described above.  5.5 Assigning names and labels to variables and values  VA R I A B L E N A M E S Variable  names  are  used  by  SPSS  to  refer  to  the variables   columns   when  it  is  processing  the  data.  Left  to  itself,  SPSS names the variables  columns  as var00001, var00002 and so on, which is not at all informative when you are looking at the table. So you need to insert meaningful names into the column headings.  When  deciding  on  a  variable  name,  it  is  sensible  to  use  one  that reminds you of what the variable actually is. So you would call sex ‘sex’, and  age  ‘age’.  But  variable  names  cannot  be  longer  than  8  characters, cannot contain a blank space between characters, must not end in a full stop   although  one  can  be  enclosed  by  characters ,  and  must  not  use   50  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  punctuation  characters  such  as  !  or  *. Also,  the  name  can  only  be  used once. We have two sets of sales ﬁgures in the data ﬁle used in this book, but  cannot  call  them  both  sales;  instead  they  are  named  sales_1  and sales_2. Note that case is ignored, so SALARY, salary and Salary are all the  same  to  SPSS  and  cannot  be  used  together  in  one  set  of  variable names.  It is important to distinguish between variable names, variable labels and  value  labels.  The  variable  name  is  used  by  SPSS  when  identifying which  variables  it  is  to  analyse,  and  as  explained  cannot  be  more  than eight  characters  long,  cannot  contain  a  space,  etc.  So  sales_1  is  an acceptable variable name but sales*1 or sales 1 are not. Variable labels are added to the output and serve to explain what the variable is. They are not restricted in the way variable names are, since they can be up to 120 characters and can contain any characters or spaces. So for the variable which  is  named  sales_1  you  could  have  the  label  ‘Sales  for  previous month’.  Value  labels,  on  the  other  hand,  are  added  to  the  output  to  explain what  a  particular  value  or  score  on  a  variable  denotes;  so  the  printout will  show,  for  example,  that  a  score  of  1  on  the  variable  sex  indicates ‘male’.  A S S I G N I N G VA R I A B L E N A M E S A N D VA R I A B L E L A B E L S I N V E R S I O N S 8  O R 9 O F S P S S To  name  the  variable  and or  assign  a  variable  label,  click  on one of the cells in the column containing the data on that variable, and from the menu bar of the Data Editor window select  Data  Deﬁne Variable  Clicking on this entry yields a dialogue box  Figure 5.2 , with the cursor already  positioned  in  the  text  box  marked  Variable  Name.  Type  in  the new name of the variable.  To  change  the  name  of  a  variable,  repeat  the  process  of  naming  the variable by opening the Deﬁne Variable dialogue box and typing the new name into the Variable Name text box.  To  assign  a  variable  label,  click  on  the  Labels  button  in  the  Deﬁne Variable  dialogue  box.  This  will  reveal  another  dialogue  box,  headed Deﬁne Labels  Figure 5.3 . Type the label into the text box to the right of Variable Label:, and click on the Continue button. This will return you to the Deﬁne Variable box, and the label will be shown on the relevant line of  the  centre  part  of  the  box,  the  area  marked  as  Variable  Description. Click  on  OK,  and  the  name  and  label  will  be  assigned.  The  column containing  the  data  on  that  variable  will  now  be  headed  with  the variable name you assigned.  A S S I G N I N G VA L U E L A B E L S To give labels to each value  score  on a varia- ble, you use the Deﬁne Labels box  Figure 5.3 , obtained from the Deﬁne   THE DATA FILE  51  Figure 5.2 The Deﬁne Variable dialogue box  Figure 5.3 The Deﬁne Labels dialogue box  Variable box by clicking on the Labels button as explained above. Move the pointer so it is in the Value text window, click the mouse to anchor the cursor, and type in the value. Then type the label into the Value Label   52  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  text  box  and  click  on  the Add  button.  For  example,  to  insert  the  value label ‘male’ for the score of 1 on sex, you would type 1 into the Value box and  male  into  the  Value  Label  box,  then  click  on  the Add  button.  The result, 15‘male’ appears in the list box to the right of the Add button.  If you need to change one of the labels, get to the box shown in Figure 5.3 and click on the label in the list that is shown. Enter the new label in the Value Label box and click on the Change button. You delete a label by clicking on it in the list box and then clicking on the Remove button.  Once you have assigned value labels you can readily switch between seeing  the  numbers  or  their  label  equivalents  by  clicking  on  the  Value Labels  icon  in  the  Data  Editor’s  icon  bar  or  by  selecting  View   Value Labels from the menus.  A S S I G N I N G VA R I A B L E N A M E S A N D VA R I A B L E L A B E L S I N V E R S I O N 1 0  O F In  version  10,  while  viewing  the  Data  Editor  select  the  Variable S P S S View  tabbed  page  to  obtain  a  display  similar  to  Figure  5.4.  To  enter  a variable label, type it into the Label column. To enter value labels, click in the Values column for the row corresponding to the variable for which you are deﬁning value labels. A button will become available in the cell, and clicking on it will reveal a Value Labels dialogue box which is shown as the Value Labels section of Figure 5.3. Move the pointer so it is in the Value text window, click the mouse to anchor the cursor, and type in the value. Then type the label into the Value Label text box and click on the Add button. For example, to insert the value label ‘male’ for the score of 1 on sex, you would type 1 into the Value box and male into the Value Label box, then click on the Add button. The result, 15‘male’ appears in the list box to the right of the Add button.  Exercise 5.3  Assign names to each of the variables in salesq, using the names shown just above the ﬁrst row of numbers in Table 5.1: id, sex, empl, att1 and so on. Assign variable labels: ‘Employer’ to empl, ‘Customer visits’ to cust, ‘Start day’ to dstd, ‘Start month’ to dstm and ‘Start year’ to dsty. Assign value labels to sex: 1 represents ‘male’ and 2 represents ‘female’. Finally, assign value labels to area: 1 represents ‘North’, 2 represents ‘South’.  5.6 When data is missing: missing values  When  a  respondent  fails  to  provide  a  response  on  a  variable  it  is important to encode the fact that there is no response, using a separate number which is deﬁned as indicating ‘missing value’. In versions 8 and   THE DATA FILE  53  Figure 5.4 The Variable View of the Data Editor in SPSS version 10  9 of SPSS, you inform the program of the missing value for a variable by selecting  Data   Deﬁne  Variable  from  the  Data  Editor  menu  bar  which exposes  the  Deﬁne  Variable  box   Figure  5.2 .  When  presented  with  the Deﬁne  Variable  dialogue  box,  click  on  the  Missing  Values  button.  This exposes  the  Deﬁne  Missing  Values  box  shown  in  Figure  5.5.  In  SPSS version  10,  select  the  Variable  View  tabbed  page  of  the  Data  Editor,  to obtain a display similar to Figure 5.4; click in the Missing column for the row  corresponding  to  the  variable  you  are  deﬁning.  A  button  will become  available,  and  clicking  it  will  open  a  Missing  Values  dialogue box similar to that shown in Figure 5.5.  When  presented  with  Figure  5.5,  you  can  enter  up  to  three  different values each of which will be classed as missing  i.e. not a genuine data value . Having a number of different missing values can be useful: you may  have  one  number  to  represent  ‘no  response  given’,  another  to represent ‘response was “Don’t Know” ’, another to represent ‘response was  “Undecided” ’.  You  will,  of  course,  have  had  to  encode  these responses with the relevant numbers when you enter the data in the data editor. As  suggested  by  the  contents  of  Figure  5.5,  you  can  also  have  a range  of  numbers  deﬁned  as  missing  values  or  a  range  plus  a  single discrete value.  To  deﬁne  a  particular  number  as  a  missing  value,  type  it  into  one  of  the Discrete missing values boxes and click on Continue.   54  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  Figure 5.5 The Deﬁne Missing Values dialogue box  Exercise 5.4  Using the technique described above, tell SPSS that a score of 3 on sex is a missing value  i.e. signiﬁes that the respondent’s sex is unknown .  5.7 Setting the column width of a variable and aligning entries in a column  In SPSS versions 8 and 9, selecting Data  Deﬁne Variable from the menu reveals  the  Deﬁne  Variable  dialogue  box   Figure  5.2 .  The  Variable Description  area  of  this  display  provides  further  information  about  the variable. Type shows whether it is a numeric variable  i.e. numbers only , a date variable, a string variable  meaning it includes letters rather than just numbers , or one of a range of other types. It also indicates the width of the variable as it is displayed in the table.  In  Figure  5.2  the  variable  is  of  Numeric  type  and  has  a  width  of  8.2: this  means  the  numbers  displayed  in  this  column  can  be  up  to  8 characters  wide,  including  the  decimal  point,  and  there  are  2  decimal places  allowed.  So  the  largest  number  which  could  be  shown  in  this variable  column  is  99999.99.  The  settings  are  altered  by  ensuring  the cursor is in the appropriate column in the Data Editor and then selecting from the menu Data  Deﬁne Variable and clicking on the Type button. The width settings only control the width as displayed on the screen, and  not  the  way  the  variable  is  stored  in  the  program,  where  numeric variables  are  40  characters  wide  with  up  to  16  decimal  places.  So   THE DATA FILE  55  although you may type in a number like 44.444, the table may only show 44.44; but in carrying out calculations the program uses the full number, with  in this example  three decimal places.  The  Alignment  entry  in  the  Variable  Description  area  of  the  Deﬁne Variable box tells you how the entries in the column will be aligned; for numeric  variables,  the  conventional  setting  is  right  aligned.  It  can  be changed  to  left  aligned  or  centred  by  selecting  the  Column  Format button from the Deﬁne Variable box shown in Figure 5.2 and clicking the relevant radio button in the Deﬁne Column Format dialogue box.  In  SPSS  version  10,  the  column  width  of  a  variable  and  its  type, number  of  decimals  shown,  alignment,  etc.  can  be  set  if  you  select the  Variable  View  tabbed  page  of  the  Data  Editor   Figure  5.4 .  Click  in the appropriate column  type, width, decimals, align  of the row for the variable you are deﬁning, and a control will become available allowing you  to  change  the  default  setting.  For  example,  to  alter  the  number  of decimals you click in that column and then use the up or down arrows to increase or decrease the number of decimal places.  5.8 Using templates to assign value labels etc. to a number of variables  You may have a large number of variables for which you wish to assign the same value labels, missing values, column width, alignment speciﬁ- cation or some combination of these features. It is tedious to go through the  process  of  deﬁning  these  attributes  for  each  one,  and  in  versions  8 and 9 you can use a template to do it for you.  In version 10 you can copy and  paste  variable  deﬁnition  attributes  to  multiple  variables  from  the Variable  View  tabbed  page  of  the  Data  Editor.   You  create  a  template from  Data  Templates  in  the  Data  Editor  menu  bar,  which  exposes  a  Template  dialogue  box. Clicking  on  the  Deﬁne  button  allows  you  to  access  Deﬁne  Template buttons,  and  from  them  you  can  enter  the  settings  you  want.  You  can then  save  the  template  by  clicking  on  the Add  button.  In  the  Template dialogue box you can give your speciﬁcation a particular name or have it as the default template.  Having speciﬁed a template, you will want to apply it to a number of variables.  When  in  the  Data  Editor,  select  the  variables  to  which  the template is to be applied by dragging along the row so that entries in the appropriate variables are highlighted. Then click on Data  Templates . . . and select which attributes of the template you wish to apply by clicking on the relevant items from the list provided in the Apply area of the box.   56  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  You  can  apply  any  combination  of  Type,  Value  Labels,  Missing  Values, Column  Format  speciﬁcations.  Then  click  on  the  OK  button,  and  the highlighted  variables  in  the  Data  Editor  will  have  the  designated  tem- plate attributes applied to them.  Exercise 5.5  Make any adjustments you wish to the variable names, column widths, value labels features of the data in the ﬁle salesq and then save it again.  5.9 Seeing information about the variables in the data ﬁle  You may sometimes forget what the features of a variable are and want information  about  the  variables  displayed.  In  SPSS  versions  8  and  9, select  which opens a window in which the variables are listed and information about the selected one is shown. If you want a printout of a description of all the variables in the data ﬁle, select  Utilities  Variables  Utilities  File Info  and a listing will be sent to the output viewer.  If  you  have  version  10,  information  about  the  variables  is  obtained simply  by  selecting  the  Variable  View  tabbed  page  of  the  Data  Editor, which  gives  a  display  like  that  shown  in  Figure  5.4.  You  can  also  use Utilities  Variables to obtain a window in which the variables are listed and information about the selected one is shown and Utilities  File Info to have a description of all the variables sent to the Output Viewer.

If the data ﬁle has a ﬁlename extension other than .sav, you need to open  the  drop-down  list  and  select  the  appropriate  ﬁle  type.  The  ﬁnal entry in the list is All Files  *.* , which allows you to see all the ﬁles in the subdirectory.  Selecting  this  option  means  that  all  the  ﬁles  will  be  listed and you can click on the one you want. If the ﬁle is on a ﬂoppy, open the Look In drop-down list and click on the icon for drive a:. All the ﬁles on   58  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  the ﬂoppy disk will be shown in the ﬁle list, and you can use the scroll bars to scroll down the list. When the name of the ﬁle you want is visible, click on it and it will appear in the File Name text box. Then click on the Open button.  When  you  open  the  File  of  Type  drop-down  list  of  the  Open  File dialogue box, you will see that you can import ﬁles from other packages, such as Excel and dBase. How to import Excel ﬁles is described in section 5.12 below.  5.11 Importing data prepared in a word processor  Data can be prepared outside SPSS for Windows. If possible, it is better to  prepare  the  data  in  a  spreadsheet  rather  than  a  word  processor  and then  import  it  into  SPSS. You  can  then  use  the  spreadsheet  to  do  some tasks such as graph drawing, and the data in a spreadsheet will already be  organized  into  columns  and  rows.  Importing  from  a  spreadsheet  is explained  in  section  5.12  below.  But  you  can  use  a  word  processor  to prepare the data and then import it into SPSS. When writing the data in a word processor, use a Tab between each of the variables if possible and use the ﬁrst row for the variable labels; this makes it simpler to import it into SPSS.  I M P O RT I N G A TA B - D E L I M I T E D F I L E I N TO S P S S V E R S I O N S 8  O R 9 If data is prepared in a word processor with scores on the variables separated by tabs and the ﬁle saved in Text Only format, the data ﬁles can be imported into SPSS version 8 or 9 by selecting from the menus  File  Open  Open  the  Files  of  Type  drop-down  menu.  From  the  list  of  ﬁle  types, choose  Tab-delimited  and  the  names  of  ﬁles  with  the  .txt  ﬁlename extension will be shown in the list of ﬁles. Click on the appropriate one, then on the Open button. You will be presented with a File Open Options dialogue  box.  If  you  have  prepared  the  text  ﬁle  so  that  the  ﬁrst  row contains  the  variable  names,  check  the  option  Read  Variable  Names. These  names  will  become  the  names  of  the  variables   columns   in  the SPSS ﬁle. If the ﬁle is on a ﬂoppy disk, open the Look In drop-down list and click on the icon for drive a:. Select the ﬁle to be imported from the list of ﬁle names or type the name in so that it appears in the File Name text box. Click on Open.  I M P O RT I N G A T E X T F I L E W I T H O U T TA B S I N TO S P S S V E R S I O N S 8  O R 9 If you  are  preparing  the  data  in  a  word  processor  but  not  using  Tabs  to separate  the  different  variables,  use  a  ﬁxed-width  font  and  ensure  the   THE DATA FILE  59  data is lined up in columns in a consistent way. For example, make sure that for all respondents id is in columns 1 to 3, age is in columns 5 and 6 and  so  on,  and  also  make  sure  the  data  is  right-aligned.  This  means that if id numbers run from 1 to 100, the number 1 is put in column 3, the number 10 is put in columns 2 and 3 and the number 100 is in columns 1,  2  and  3.  This  is  easier  to  do  if  you  make  all  the  data  for  any one variable the same length so that id 1 would be typed as 001, 10 as 010.  The  text  ﬁle  of  the  data  can  be  imported  into  SPSS  for  Windows  by  selecting  File  Read ASCII Data  Fixed Columns  If the ﬁle is on a ﬂoppy disk, click the Browse button of the Deﬁne Fixed Variables dialogue box, open the Look In drop-down list and click on the icon for drive a:. Select the ﬁle to be imported from the list of ﬁle names or type the name in so that it appears in the File Name text box and click on  the  Open  button  which  returns  you  to  the  Deﬁne  Fixed  Variables dialogue box. Here you have to specify the name of the variables. If the data  for  each  case  extends  over  more  than  one  line  you  must  indicate which line of the case has the variable you are deﬁning by entering the line  number  in  the  box  marked  Record.  You  must  also  indicate  the columns  in  the  ASCII  ﬁle  which  each  variable  occupies.   In  salesq  for example, id is in columns 1–2, sex in column 4 and so on.  The type of data  must  be  speciﬁed  in  Data  Type.   For  the  beginner,  the  default Numeric  as  is  will  be  appropriate  but  other  types  are  available  in  the drop-down list . Then click on the Add button, and the information you have provided will appear in the Deﬁned Variables list.  When you have entered the speciﬁcations for all the variables, click on OK. The ﬁle will be read and the data appear in the Data Editor window: before you do anything else, check that the data is as you expected!  I M P O RT I N G A T E X T F I L E I N TO S P S S V E R S I O N 1 0 To  import  a  text  ﬁle into version 10, select  File  Read Text Data  Select the ﬁle to be opened from the list of ﬁles presented, and this will then lead to the Text Import Wizard. This guides you through the process of importing the ﬁle.   60  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  5.12 Transferring data ﬁles to from other packages such as Excel version 4  Data  ﬁles  can  be  saved  in  a  number  of  formats  so  they  can  be  read  by other packages such as Excel or dBase. The options are offered when you select File  Save As for a data ﬁle and open the drop-down list Save File as Type. Similarly, data ﬁles from these other packages can be read into SPSS  for  Windows.  This  is  extremely  useful,  since  you  can  prepare  the data in a program such as Excel and do not need a computer with SPSS installed.  If you are preparing the data in MSWorks or Excel, it is easiest if you save the spreadsheet ﬁle in the format for Excel 4 or lower, not Excel 5 or 7. This means that you only save one sheet of the Excel workbook; if you are  using  Excel  5  or  higher  and  have  a  workbook  with  a  number  of tabbed sheets, it can be imported into SPSS but you need to read section 5.13 below.  When preparing the spreadsheet ﬁle of the data, you can put variable names into the ﬁrst row of the sheet and these can then be imported and will form the column names in the SPSS ﬁle.  I M P O RT I N G A N E X C E L 4  F I L E I N TO S P S S V E R S I O N S 8  O R 9 When you have an Excel 4 ﬁle to import, select  File  Open  The  usual  dialogue  box  is  presented.  Open  the  drop-down  list  Files  of Type  and  select  Excel.  If  the  ﬁle  is  on  a  ﬂoppy  disk,  open  the  Look  In drop-down  list  and  select  the  icon  for  drive  a:.  Enter  the  name  of  the Excel ﬁle into the File Name text box by selecting it from the ﬁle list. If the Excel ﬁle contains only the data with no variable names in the ﬁrst row of the spreadsheet, clicking on Open will load the ﬁle into SPSS. If you have written the variable names into the ﬁrst row of the Excel table, check  the  option  Read  Variable  Names  in  the  Opening  Files  Options dialogue box before clicking Open. The data will be imported into SPSS with the variable names already assigned.  Whenever  importing  data  from  another  package,  check  the  data carefully  so  that  you  can  be  sure  the  transfer  has  been  accurate  and complete.  5.13 Importing data ﬁles from Excel version 5 and above into SPSS versions 8 or 9  Although it is claimed to be possible to create a data ﬁle from a number of  sheets  in  a  multi-sheet  workbook  such  as  Excel  5  provides,  it  is  not   THE DATA FILE  61  easy.   Which  is  a  disguised  way  of  saying  that  I  could  not  make  this feature  work!   But  importing  data  from  one  of  the  tabbed  sheets  of  an Excel 5 ﬁle is possible. Use the ﬁrst row of the spreadsheet to contain the variable names, so that the sheet looks like this:  To import an Excel 5 or higher spreadsheet, select from the menu  var1 11 21  var2 12 22  var3 13 23  File  Database Capture  New Query  This starts the Database Capture Wizard shown in Figure 5.7. Select the Excel  Files  option  from  the  list  which  is  offered  and  click  on  the  Next button.  This  presents  the  Select  Workbook  dialogue  box  and  you  can navigate  to  the  subdirectory  containing  the  Excel  ﬁle  and  then  click  on the particular .xls ﬁle from the list which is shown.  This opens the next screen of the Database Capture Wizard, shown in Figure 5.8. You can select which sheets of the .xls ﬁle to enter into SPSS by dragging and dropping from the left-hand list of Available Tables to the Retrieve Fields in This Order list. I advise you to select only one of the sheets. The ﬁelds will be shown in the Retrieve Fields in This Order list,  and  you  can  click  on  Finish.  The  data  will  be  entered  into  SPSS’s Data Editor, with the names of the variables being the names used in the ﬁrst line of the spreadsheet.  So in the example above, the variable names will be var1, var2 and var3.  If you click on the Next buttons rather than Finish, further complicated options are offered; you might like to experi- ment  with  them  to  see  how  they  function.  But  the  facilities  they  offer  such as altering the variable names or selecting only cases which meet some  criterion   can  more  easily  be  accomplished  either  while  you  are running the spreadsheet program or once the data has been entered into SPSS.  5.14 Importing data ﬁles from Excel version 5 and above into SPSS version 10  To import an Excel 5 spreadsheet, select from the menu  File  Database Capture  New Query  This starts the Database Capture Wizard shown in Figure 5.7.

The Print dialogue box will appear. By default,  one  copy  of  the  whole  ﬁle  will  be  printed.  To  print  more  than one copy, type in the number required in the Copies box. Click on OK. In SPSS version 10, the File menu has a Print Preview entry so you can see what will be printed before committing yourself.  If you do not want the grid lines printed, remove them from the data editor  window  before  you  select  File   Print.  While  viewing  the  Data Editor, select View  Grid Lines from the menu and click on Grid Lines. If  you  have  assigned  value  labels  to  the  data  so  that,  for  example,  a value  of  1  in  the  variable  sex  has  the  label  ‘male’  and  value  2  has  the label ‘female’, you can have these labels printed instead of the numbers when  you  print  out  the  ﬁle.  To  do  this,  while  viewing  the  Data  Editor, select  View  and  click  on  Value  Labels  or  use  the  Labels  icon  button  to have  the  labels  shown  instead  of  the  numbers.  Then  print  the  ﬁle  by selecting File  Print as explained above.   6  MERGING DATA FILES  Summary  This chapter explains how to:  c merge ﬁles which have sets of data from different respondents c merge ﬁles which have additional data for the same respondents.  6.1 When do you need to merge data ﬁles?  You may ﬁnd that you have two sets of data, in separate ﬁles, that you want  to  merge  to  form  one  ﬁle.  There  are  two  situations  where  this  is likely  to  happen.  First,  you  have  collected  data  from  a  sample  of respondents,  and  later  obtain  data  from  some  more  respondents  which you  want  to  add  to  your  ﬁrst  set.  The  obvious  way  of  doing  this  is  to retrieve the original data ﬁle and simply add the new cases on the end, but  this  is  not  always  feasible.   Perhaps  you  have  the  data  from  1000 children  in  Mexico,  and  a  colleague  has  data  from  1000  children  in Poland.  Both  of  you  have  written  a  ﬁle  containing  the  data  you  have collected,  neither  of  you  wants  to  type  in  another  1000  cases!  You  can merge the two data ﬁles using Add Cases as described below.  The second situation where you want to merge data is when you have data  from  a  set  of  respondents,  and  then  obtain  another  series  of responses  from  the  same  respondents.  For  example,  imagine  we  sur- veyed 500 adults on their alcohol drinking behaviour six months ago and yesterday. We want to add the data we collected yesterday to the ﬁle of their responses of six months ago, so we can look at changes in drinking behaviour over the six month period. We are not adding new cases to our data ﬁle, only adding new data to existing cases. We could go back and add  the  new  data  to  our  data  ﬁle,  but  it  may  be  that  we  have  the  two data  sets  in  separate  ﬁles  and  want  to  merge  them.  For  this  type  of situation, use Add Variables  section 6.3 .               MERGING DATA FILES  65  6.2 Adding cases  Suppose we have a ﬁle which contains data on additional respondents to be added to salesq and this additional data, shown in Table 6.1, has been saved in a ﬁle called extra.sav, with the same names for the variables as were used in salesq.  Table 6.1 Additional data from three respondents to be added to the data ﬁle  23 24 25  1 2 2  1 2 1  1 2 2  3 4 3  2 2 2  3 4 5  055 060 078  03800.50 04780.60 06782.00  010691 030690 040690  To  add  these  cases  to  salesq,  retrieve  salesq  so  it  is  in  an  active  Data  Editor window. From the menus, select  Data  Merge Files  Add Cases  This  opens  a  dialogue  box  entitled Add  Cases:  Read  File.  Click  on  the name of the ﬁle to be added  extra.sav in this example  so it appears in the File Name text box, and click on the Open button.  This reveals another dialogue box  Add Cases From , and variables in the two data ﬁles which match are listed in the text box headed Variables in New Working Data File. So if both data ﬁles have a variable called sex, this will be listed in this box. The dialogue box also has a list of variables in a text box headed Unpaired Variables. Those variables followed by a * are present in the current, open data ﬁle and those variables followed by a 1 are present in the external ﬁle  extra.sav in this example . These are variables  which  do  not  have  the  same  name  in  the  two  ﬁles.  You  can make  a  pair  of  them,  so  a  variable  called  sex  in  the  current  ﬁle  can  be matched with a variable called gender in the external ﬁle, by clicking on the  ﬁrst  of  these  two  names  and  then  do  a  Ctrl  1 click  on  the  second name.  If  necessary,  variables  in  the  Unpaired  Variable  list  can  be renamed by selecting them and clicking on the Rename button.  If you want the merged ﬁle to include a variable that only exists in one of  the  ﬁles  being  merged,  select  its  name  and  click  on  the  right  arrow button to add it to the list of Variables in New Working Data File.  When  the  deﬁnition  is  complete,  Paste  the  command  into  a  syntax window and run it. A ﬁle called Untitled will appear in the Data Editor. Save  this  ﬁle,  but  before  carrying  out  any  analysis  check  it  carefully  to see that the new cases have been added accurately.   66  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  6.3 Adding scores to existing cases: Add Variables  This  procedure merges two  data ﬁles that contain different data on the same respondents. Imagine we have additional data for the respondents recorded in salesq: perhaps we now have their date of birth as a six-digit number  like  this:  050870,  representing  5th  August,  1970.  This  data  has been  assigned  to  three  variables:  dobd   day ,  dobm   month   and  doby  year , and is stored in a data ﬁle  addat.sav . An example of the data for the ﬁrst two respondents is:  01 120870 02 221070  We want to add this additional data on each respondent to the salesq ﬁle. First, the data in both ﬁles must have been sorted into the same order on the key variable which will be used to ensure the data is assigned to the correct case: this is one reason for having identiﬁcation numbers  id  in data ﬁles such as salesq. Having sorted both salesq and addat.sav by id, ensure  one  of  the  ﬁles  is  in  the  active  Data  Editor.   Assume  for  this explanation that salesq is the active ﬁle.  From the menu select  Data  Merge Files  Add Variables  Select the name of the other ﬁle  addat.sav in this example  from the list in the Add Variables: Read File dialogue box. Then click on Open.  Any variables which appear in either of the data ﬁles are shown in the New  Working  Data  File  list  of  the  dialogue  box  entitled Add  Variables From.  Those  variables  followed  by  a  *  are  present  in  the  current,  open data ﬁle and those variables followed by a 1 are present in the external ﬁle   addat.sav  in  this  example . Any  variables  which  appear  in  both  of the data ﬁles are shown in the Excluded Variables list, since one does not want them to appear twice in the merged ﬁle.  If the second ﬁle  addat.sav  has data on every case in the current ﬁle  salesq , you can click on Paste and run the syntax. The two sets of data will  be  merged  and  seen  in  the  Data  Editor  window.  Save  the  data  ﬁle and check it carefully for accuracy before analysing it.  If the external ﬁle  addat.sav  does not have data for every one of the  cases in the current ﬁle  salesq , see the next section.  6.4 Add Variables with incomplete data  Suppose we have a set of additional data, the marital status of some of the respondents in salesq. The variable is named as marst, and 1 means   MERGING DATA FILES  67  unmarried,  2  is  married.  The  data  is  shown  in  Table  6.2,  the  ﬁrst  two digits  being  the  respondent’s  id   identiﬁcation  number .  This  data  has been saved in a data ﬁle called marry.sav.  Table 6.2 Additional data on the respondents to be added to the data ﬁle  06 03 05 18 11  1 2 2 1 2  Marry.sav has scores on marst for 5 respondents.  Note that in marry- .sav the respondents are not in the same order as in the original data ﬁle; this is so you see how to cope with this situation.   When one merges the data from the two ﬁles, it is obviously essential that  the  data  from  marry.sav  is  added  to  the  appropriate  persons  in salesq. There must be some way of identifying which lines from salesq match  which  lines  from  marry.sav,  and  in  this  example  the  variable  id, referred to as a key variable, lets us do that because id is included in both the data ﬁles.  The key variable must have the same name in both ﬁles, but you can if necessary  use  the  Rename  facility  to  bring  this  situation  about  by clicking  on  the  variable  name  in  the  list  of  variables  and  then  on  the Rename  button  in  the  Add  Variables  From  dialogue  box.  Then  ensure that both data ﬁles have the cases sorted on the key variable  id, in this example ; if necessary, retrieve each ﬁle, sort the data and then save the ﬁle.  Once the ﬁles have been sorted on the key variable, the procedure for  matching salesq and marry.sav is to select from the menu  Data  Merge Files  Add Variables  When faced with the Add Variables From dialogue box, click on the key variable name  id in our example  in the Excluded Variables list, check the box entitled Match Cases on Key Variables in Sorted Files and then enter the key variable into the Key Variables text box by clicking on the right arrow button. Then click on Paste.  When the syntax is run, the ﬁles will be merged and the new merged set of data will appear in the Data Editor window where you can inspect it  to  ensure  the  data  has  been  matched  correctly.  Then  save  the  new ﬁle.   7  RUNNING A SIMPLE ANALYSIS AND OBTAINING  THE OUTPUT  Summary  This chapter explains how to:  c set the output page length and page width c obtain analyses from the Statistics menu in the Data Editor window c modify the source list of variables in dialogue boxes c open new output windows c ensure an output window is the designated window which receives  the output  c save and retrieve output ﬁles c edit the output c print the output c transfer the output to a word processor or web browser c obtain on-screen help on statistical terms.  7.1 Setting output page length, page width and inserting commands in output  The  output  is  shown  in  either  the  Output  Viewer  or  the  Draft  Viewer, depending  in  which  you  select  to  be  the  default  and  which  you  select when you open a new output window. The Draft Viewer gives a rather crude  appearance  with  its  simple  text  output  and  you  are  likely  to  use the Output Viewer most of the time.  SPSS is set up so that it assumes that you are using a non-A4 page and it is sensible to alter the settings to the paper size you are actually using, which will usually be A4. SPSS is very proliﬁc with paper, and will waste a huge amount by inserting page breaks at very frequent intervals. While you are carrying out analyses you can save a few trees by turning off this wasteful feature.   RUNNING A SIMPLE ANALYSIS  69  It  is  extremely  useful,  when  you  are  trying  to  follow  a  series  of complicated  tables  and  statistics,  to  have  the  output  contain  the  com- mands used to obtain it. To have the commands inserted in the output, use Edit  Options as described below.  Select from the menu  Edit  Options  This presents the dialogue box shown in Figure 7.1.  In version 10 there are  some  slight  differences,  but  the  general  appearance  is  the  same.  Select  the  Viewer  tab  and  the  window  shown  in  Figure  7.2  will  be revealed.  To  have  the  syntax  commands  printed  in  the  output  viewer  imme- diately  before  the  output  which  the  syntax  produces,  ensure  that  in Figure  7.2  there  is  a  tick  in  the  box  alongside  the  wording  Display Commands in the Log. If there is no tick, just click in the box.  To stop SPSS inserting page breaks in the output, set the page length to ‘Inﬁnite’  by  selecting  that  option  in  the  Length  area  of  the  part  of  the display  headed  Text  Output.  If  you  want  to  set  the  page  length  to  A4 paper, click on the Custom option in Length and type 70 into the text box beside  it.  To  alter  the  page  width  from  the  default  value,  select  the Custom option and type in a ﬁgure for the width of the page. The width is measured in characters, and a normal full width is 80. As can be seen in Figure 7.2, you can also set the fonts and typesizes for the title and for the  text  output.   To  change  the  page  size  for  the  Draft  Viewer,  use  the Draft Viewer tab of the window shown in Figure 7.1.   7.2 Using the menus to analyse the data  Once you have a data ﬁle open  an active Data Editor window contain- ing data  and have decided which analyses you require, you are ready to run  SPSS.  Most  of  the  analyses  can  be  obtained  by  selecting  from  the menus in the Data Editor window.  Clicking  on  the  Application  window  Analyze  or  Statistics  menu reveals  the  drop-down  menu  shown  in  Figure  7.3  with  some  or  all  of these options:  Reports Descriptive Statistics Custom Tables Compare Means Geneal Linear Model   70  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  Figure 7.1 The Edit Options dialogue box  Figure 7.2 The Edit Options window for setting the format of the Output Viewer   RUNNING A SIMPLE ANALYSIS  71  Figure 7.3 The Statistics drop-down menu  Correlate Regression Loglinear Classify Data Reduction Scale Nonparametric Tests Time Series Survival Multiple Response  ing these entries:  Frequencies...

The  . . .  indicates  that  if  you  select  that  entry,  a  dialogue  box  will  be revealed in which you enter more details about the analysis you want.  Exercise 7.1  We want to ﬁnd out for the data in the data ﬁle salesq.sav the number of males and females and the number of people from each area, i.e. we want to know how many cases there are for each level of the variable sex and for each level of the variable area. This information is obtained using the Frequencies procedure. So click on Analyze  Descriptive Statistics  Frequencies, and a dialogue box  Figure 7.4  will appear.  Figure 7.4 The dialogue box for Frequencies  Dialogue boxes for the statistical procedures have a common format.  In the left-hand box, which has no title but is known as the source variable list, there is a list of the variables in the Data File; the variable names are those which are given at the top of the columns in the Data   RUNNING A SIMPLE ANALYSIS  73  Editor, so will be var00001, var00002, etc. unless you have assigned variable names as explained in section 5.5.  You have to tell SPSS which variables you want analysed. To do this,  select each variable by clicking on its name, which will then be highlighted. Then click in the button marked with a right-pointing arrow, and the variable will appear in the right-hand box, the one headed Variable s . Select whichever variables you want to analyse in this way. If you want to select a number of variables, you can use the drag method of selecting a set in one movement; pressing on the arrow button will transfer the names of all the variables in the set to the Variable s  box.  If you make a mistake, and have selected a variable you do not want to  analyse, you remove it from the Variable s  box by clicking on it; the arrow in the arrow button will become a left-pointing one, and clicking on that will remove the highlighted variable from the list and return it to the left-hand box.  In our example, click on sex in the left-hand box and then on the  right-pointing arrow; then click on area in the left-hand box and on the right-pointing arrow again. The variable names sex and area will appear in the Variables s  box.  Now click on the OK button at the top right of the dialogue box.  For  the moment ignore the other buttons down the right hand side and along the bottom of the dialogue box.  The Frequencies procedure will run, and the results will appear in the output window, Output1. It is as simple as that!  The result of running this example is shown in Figure 7.5. The ﬁrst few  lines, which may not appear in your output, show the syntax for the analysis. Syntax is explained in chapter 8. The ﬁrst table headed Statistics shows the number of valid and missing cases for each of the two variables. The missing case under Sex is because one of the cases in the data ﬁle has a sex value of 3, which has been designated a missing value indicating that the sex of that person is unknown. The table headed Sex shows the frequency of males, females and sex unknown  missing , corresponding to values 1, 2 and 3 on the variable sex. The Area table shows the frequency of each level  North corresponding to 1 and South corresponding to 2  on the variable area.  Further explanation of the output from Frequencies is provided in section 14.1.   When you are looking at the output on screen, the outline is shown in  the left-hand panel. You can select the part of the output to look at by clicking on its entry in the outline, and can also move parts of the output. You will see that there is an item entitled Notes, which may not be shown in the Output Viewer itself.  This depends on the settings in the Edit  Options  Viewer.  To see the Notes, double click on its icon; the Notes information tells you the ﬁle and syntax used but is rarely of much use.   74  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  Figure 7.5 Output from running Frequencies for sex and area on the data in salesq.sav  Exercise 7.2  Now try a second example, to obtain the mean and standard deviation of the number of customer visits  the variable is labelled cust  for the data in salesq. Means can also be obtained via the Frequencies procedure, so select from the Application window  Analyze  Descriptive Statistics  Frequencies  The dialogue box may still have sex and area listed in the Variable s  box. Remove them by clicking on them and pressing the left-pointing arrow   RUNNING A SIMPLE ANALYSIS  75  button. Select cust from the source variable list, and click on the right- pointing area so that cust appears in the Variable s  box.  To obtain the means using Frequencies, you need to request them by  clicking on the button labelled Statistics... in the dialogue box which reveals another dialogue box illustrated in Figure 7.6. This is where you indicate the statistics you want: click on the word Mean in the area labelled Central Tendency, and on Std. deviation in the area labelled Dispersion. As you click on these, the small squares next to the words will have a tick put into them to show they have been selected. If you click on the wrong thing, just click on the wrongly-selected item and the cross will be removed from its indicator square to show it is not selected.  Clicking the Cancel button will cancel all the selections you have made and take you back up one level, to the Frequencies dialogue box.  Now click on Continue in the upper right of the dialogue box, and you will be returned to the Frequencies dialogue box; click on the OK button. The Frequencies procedure will run, the results again appearing in the Output1 window. The output is illustrated in Figure 7.7; the mean and standard deviation of the data on the cust variable are shown in the table headed Statistics.

The variables are shown in the source list of the dialogue boxes in alphabetical order or in the order in which they occur in the data ﬁle. To select which order you want,  use  Edit   Options  and  select  the  General  tab.  There  is  an  area headed Variable Lists and buttons for Alphabetical or File orders.   RUNNING A SIMPLE ANALYSIS  77  When you have a very lengthy set of variables in the data ﬁle, it can be convenient to restrict those which are presented in the source list in the dialogue  boxes.  This  can  be  done  using  Utilities   Deﬁne  Sets  from  the menu bar. Give the set a name, specify the variables to be included in a set,  and  then  click  the Add  Set  button  to  create  it.  To  have  this  newly created set used in the dialogue boxes, select Utilities  Use Sets, enter the name of the new set in the Sets in Use list and remove from the list the ALLVARIABLES entry.  You can change the order in which variables are listed in the target lists by clicking on the name of the variable to be moved and then clicking on the  control  box  in  the  top  left  of  the  dialogue  box  title  bar:  options  to Move Selection Up and Move Selection Down are offered.  7.4 Sending the output to a different output window  When  SPSS  for  Windows  starts,  it  always  creates  an  output  window entitled  Output1,  and  the  results  of  any  analysis  will  be  put  in  that window. You can open another output window, by selecting  File  New  Output  A number of output windows can be open simultaneously, but only one of them, known as the designated window, can receive output. Any fresh output  that  you  generate  will  be  appended  to  the  bottom  of  the currently-designated output window.  When  a  new  output  window  is  opened  it  is  automatically  made  the designated window. You know which is the designated window because it  has  an  exclamation  mark  in  the  message  bar  at  the  bottom  of  the window.  Any  output  window  can  be  made  the  designated  one  by clicking its ! icon button in the icon bar.  7.5 Saving an output ﬁle  S AV I N G T H E O U T P U T F I L E F O R T H E F I R S T T I M E As  you  have  seen,  the output is displayed in an output window. By default, this will be saved on the hard disk when you leave SPSS with the name Output1.spo. It is almost always more convenient to save it on a ﬂoppy. While viewing the output window, select from the menu bar  File  Save As ...  The dialogue box you will see is similar to that for saving the data ﬁle shown in Figure 5.1. Enter the name of the ﬁle into the File Name box.   78  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  Open the Save In drop-down list, click on the icon for drive a: and then click on the Save button.  S AV I N G A P R E V I O U S LY S AV E D O U T P U T F I L E A F T E R E D I T I N G I T Any changes you make to an output ﬁle you have retrieved from disk will be lost unless you save the ﬁle. While viewing the window, select from the menu bar  File  Save  Save As ...  To save the current version of the ﬁle, overwriting previous ones, select  The  new  version  will  be  saved  on  the  same  drive  from  which  it  was retrieved.  To save the current version while keeping the previous one, select  which will present the Save As dialogue box. Type in a new name for the output  ﬁle  in  the  File  Name  text  box;  remember  it  must  not  contain  a blank space or full stop. To save the ﬁle on the ﬂoppy disk, open the Save In  drop-down  list,  click  on  the  icon  for  drive  a:  and  click  on  the  Save button.  7.6 Retrieving an output ﬁle from the ﬂoppy disk  To retrieve a saved .spo ﬁle, it has to be opened in an output window by selecting from the window menu bar  File  Open  Output  The Open File dialogue box will be presented. If the ﬁle you want is on your ﬂoppy disk, open the Look In drop-down list and click on the icon for  drive  a:.  If  Files  of  Type  shows  something  other  than  Viewer Document  *.spo , open the drop-down list and scroll down until you get to  Viewer  Document   *.spo   and  click  on  this  entry.  When  the  Files  of Type  shows  Viewer  Document   *.spo ,  all  ﬁles  with  the  .spo  ﬁlename extension will be listed in the ﬁle list on the left hand side. If necessary, you can scroll down the list. Click on the name of the ﬁle you want, so that its name appears in the File Name text box, and then on the Open button.  The  ﬁle  you  have  retrieved  will  be  displayed  in  an  output window.   RUNNING A SIMPLE ANALYSIS  79  To open a Draft Viewer ﬁle, the procedure is the same except that the Files  of  Type  is  Draft  Viewer  Document   *.rtf ,  so  this  should  be  used instead of *.spo.  7.7 Editing the contents of the output viewer  In  the  Output  Viewer,  some  of  the  material  is  text  but  most  consists  of tables.  In  the  examples  used  in  this  book,  the  commands  which  are shown before the results of a procedure are text material.  If you want to insert extra text A D D I N G T E X T TO T H E O U T P U T V I E W E R into  the  output,  the  Insert   New  Text  will  insert  a  box  into  which  you can type the new material. The box can be moved within the output by dragging it with the mouse.  E D I T I N G T E X T M AT E R I A L Text, not tables, can be edited if you click on that part of the output so that it becomes surrounded by a sizing frame and  has  a  red  arrow  pointing  to  it.  To  edit  the  contents  of  the  frame, double-click in it or select  Edit  SPSS Rtf Document Object  when  you  can  then  choose  either  Edit  or  Open.  If  you  choose  Open,  a new window will be opened with the selected text material in it. You can edit  the  text  and  apply  formatting  such  as  bold  face,  changing  the typeface  and  so  on.  When  you  have  ﬁnished  the  editing,  close  the window with  File  Exit and Return to Output  or  in  version  10  just  click  outside  the  area  being  edited.  If  you  choose Edit  rather  than  Open,  you  edit  the  text  material  within  the  Output Viewer. To change the formatting, the Format menu allows you to apply bold  face,  italic  and  underlining;  from  this  menu  you  can  select  Font, which allows you to change the typesize as well as the typeface.  E D I T I N G TA B L E S To  edit  a  table  of  the  Output  Viewer,  either  double- click in it or select it and then from the menu bar choose  Edit  SPSS Pivot Table Object  This offers the alternatives of Edit or Open.  If  you  choose  the  Open  option,  a  fresh  window  will  open  with  the table in it. From the menu of the window, you use Edit  Select to select   80  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  the part of the table you want to edit. If you click on the row or column headings in the table, you will be able to select Data Cells or Data and Label  Cells  as  well  as  Table  or  Table  Body.  With  the  appropriate  selec- tions, you can modify the format of the table by, for example, using the Format  drop-down  menu.  To  add  a  caption,  title  or  footnote  use  the Insert drop-down menu. The range of possibilities is too vast to describe in  detail;  the  best  procedure  is  to  experiment  with  the  various  alter- natives. It may be worth taking notes as you go, so you have a record of just  how  you  achieved  any  particular  effect  in  case  you  want  to  use  it again!  To  close  the  window  in  which  the  pivot  table  is  edited,  use  File  Close from the Pivot Table editing window.  You may ﬁnd that after editing, you return to the Output Viewer and the  table  is  shaded.  This  happens  if  you  fail  to  use  the  File   Close sequence  to  leave  the  editing  window;  the  situation  can  be  restored  if you select the table again with Edit  SPSS Pivot Table Object  Open and then do a File  Close.  The alternative to using a separate window for editing the pivot table  is to select from the drop-down menu  Edit  SPSS Pivot Table Object  Edit  You can then edit the table within the Output Viewer window. Use Edit  Select to select the part or aspect of the table to be edited. Click in a row or column heading to permit the selection of Data Cells or Data Cells and Labels as well as Table or Table Body. When the appropriate aspect of the table has been selected, the Insert and Format drop-down menus allow access to a wide range of formatting alternatives. Try the Format  Table Properties and Format  TableLooks to see what a wide set of alternatives are available.  To stop the editing, just click on some other part of the output in the  Output Viewer.  E D I T I N G T H E D R A F T O U T P U T V I E W E R The Draft Output Viewer contains only  text,  and  the  formatting  possibilities  are  rather  limited.  You  can select  text  and  apply  bold  face,  italic  and  underlining  or  change  the typeface  and  size  from  the  Format  drop-down  menu.  The  Edit  menu offers a ﬁnd replace facility.  7.8 Changing fonts and type style in output  The facility for altering output fonts is available by selecting  Edit  Options  and the Viewer tab.   RUNNING A SIMPLE ANALYSIS  81  7.9 Adding or removing a title before each procedure  When SPSS runs a procedure such as Frequencies, it can put the title of the  procedure  before  the  table  of  results.  This  can  be  turned  on  or  off from  Edit   Options:  select  the  Viewer  tab  and  in  the  list  under  Initial Output  State  click  on  the  titles  entry.  You  can  select  either  Shown  or Hidden radio buttons.  7.10 Rounding numbers in the output  The  output  may  show  more  decimal  places  than  you  want.  You  can modify  the  output  display  by  selecting  the  table  for  editing,  and  then using  the  click drag  procedure  to  highlight  the  cells  to  be  modiﬁed. Right-click or from the menu bar choose Format. In either case, selecting  Cell Properties will present the dialogue box shown in Figure 7.8. Click on the ﬁrst entry in the Format list, and the Decimals control shown in Figure 7.8 will be added to the dialogue box. Change the number shown in the Decimals text box using the up and down arrow keys to its side, and then press the Apply button.

You can preview the printout from File   Print  Preview  to  conﬁrm  that  you  have  made  the  selection  of material that you want.  If you want to print all the tables  or all the notes, all the titles, etc.  in  the output and nothing else, you can select them from the menu:  Edit  Select  When you have selected the type of material you want to print, go to File  Print.  7.12 Transferring output to a word processor  Output from the Output Viewer can be imported into a word processor but it is necessary to use the Copy  Paste facility. Most of the material in the Output Viewer is tables, and to put them into a word processor such as  Word97  you  need  to  click  on  the  table  in  SPSS  and  then  select  Edit  Copy.  To  make  an  exact  copy  of  the  SPSS  table,  open  the  word   RUNNING A SIMPLE ANALYSIS  83  processor  and  use  Edit   Paste  Special.   Remember  to  use  Edit   Paste Special,  not  Edit   Paste.   A  window  is  shown,  and  it  is  important  to select  the  Picture  option.  The  table  will  then  be  pasted  into  Word  and will look just as it did in the SPSS Output Viewer. It can be resized and moved around the window by using the handles.  If you want to put the table into the word processor so that you can edit it, paste it into the word processor with Edit  Paste. It will not look the same as it did in SPSS, but in Word97 it is in the table editor so you can alter the column widths and generally alter its appearance until it is how you want it.  If you have some straight text to import to a word processor, such as the commands printed before the tables of output, select it in the Output Viewer  by  clicking  it  and  then  select  Edit   Copy.  Open  the  word processor,  and  use  Edit   Paste  to  put  the  text  into  the  word  processor ﬁle.  Output  ﬁles  from  the  Draft  Viewer  are  simple  rich  text  format  ﬁles, saved with the ﬁlename extension .rtf. They can be loaded into a word processor directly. For example, if you are using Microsoft Word, you use the normal File  Open procedure and tell Word to list All Files  *.*  from the  Files  of  Type  drop-down  list.  Files  with  the  sufﬁx  .rtf  will  then  be shown in the set of ﬁle names and can be selected for opening.  7.13 Exporting output ﬁles to a web browser  In  the output  viewer, the  menu entry File  Export allows the ﬁle to be exported either as a text ﬁle or in the .htm format for viewing in a web browser  and  editing.  Charts  can  be  exported  in  a  number  of  formats including .bmp, .tif, .eps, .jpg and .cgm.  7.14 On-screen help on statistical terms  You  may  come  across  statistical  terms  in  the  output  of  your  analyses which  you  do  not  understand  or  have  temporarily  forgotten.  You  can obtain  an  explanation  of  them  by  using  the  various  Help  systems.  The main  ones  are  obtained  from  the  Help  drop-down  menu.  The  Statistics Coach  is  intended  to  help  you  decide  which  statistical  procedure  you need for a particular type of question. The Help  Topics gives access to a help  ﬁle  which  explains  statistical  terms  and  SPSS’s  own  terminology. Use the Index or Ask Me sections to ﬁnd information you need.  You  can  obtain  a  short  explanation  of  the  terms  in  a  dialogue  box  if  you put the cursor over it and right click.  When you are viewing a table in the Output, it can be activated with a double  click.  Then  a  right-click  on  any  terms  in  the  table  will  open  a menu and selecting the What’s this? entry will show an explanation.   8  SYNTAX FILES  Summary  This chapter explains how to:  c use the Paste button to paste commands into a syntax window c run  commands  from  a  syntax  window  by  selecting  them  with  the click drag  procedure  and  clicking  on  the  Run  current  button  or  by using the Run drop-down menu  c save the syntax window as a syntax ﬁle c add comments to the syntax by typing them in c make  a  syntax  window  the  designated  window  by  clicking  the  ! button. Any fresh pastings of syntax will be appended to the bottom of the currently-designated window.  If you have followed the exercises in chapter 7, you carried out a simple analysis by selecting commands from the menu and clicking on OK. But I  strongly  urge  you  not  to  do  that  again!  It  is  far  better  to  store  the commands in a syntax window and run them from there.  8.1 What is a syntax ﬁle?  A syntax ﬁle is a ﬁle containing the commands for the analyses you have requested expressed in SPSS’s language. There are a number of reasons for  always  creating  a  syntax  ﬁle  of  the  commands  you  have  selected. First, if you need to run an analysis again you do not have to go through the  menus  a  second  time;  you  can  run  the  commands  from  the  syntax window.  Secondly,  by  saving  the  syntax  window  as  a  separate  ﬁle  you have  a  permanent  copy  to  use  again  whenever  you  like.  Thirdly,  when you  know  the  SPSS  language  for  the  analyses  you  want  you  can  write the  SPSS  commands  using  a  normal  word  processor,  save  them  in  text ﬁle form, import them into a syntax window and run them: so one can   SYNTAX FILES  85  do  the  preparatory  work  even  on  a  machine  that  does  not  have  SPSS installed.  If  you  carried  out  the  simple  analyses  contained  in  the  previous chapter, you may have noticed that the dialogue box for the Frequencies procedure has a button labelled Paste. All the dialogue boxes which are used  for  selecting  an  analysis  have  a  Paste  button,  and  you  are  most strongly urged to use them every time you use SPSS. Pressing the Paste button pastes the SPSS language command for the procedure you have selected into a separate window, the syntax window. When you ﬁrst start a session with SPSS there may not be a syntax window, but the ﬁrst time you press Paste one is opened and the command you have created from your  menu  selections  is  pasted  into  it.  As  you  make  further  menu selections and press Paste, the commands are added to the bottom of the set that already exists in the syntax window. Get in the habit of pressing Paste rather than OK!  8.2 Entering commands in a syntax window using Paste  When  you  have  selected  items  from  the  on-screen  menus,  paste  the commands  into  a  syntax  window  by  using  the  Paste  button  in  the dialogue box for the procedure you have selected. If no syntax window is open the ﬁrst time you use Paste, one is automatically opened to receive the commands you are pasting. Subsequent uses of Paste add the current commands  to  the  syntax  window,  appending  them  to  the  existing contents. If you want to start pasting into a second syntax window, you need  to  open  a  new  one,  which  you  can  do  by  selecting  File   New  Syntax from the menu bar. Ensure it is the designated syntax window with a ! in the information bar on the bottom line. If necessary, make it the  designated  window  by  pressing  the  !  button  in  the  icon  bar.  The syntax window can be saved as a ﬁle and edited.  Exercise 8.1  Repeat exercise 7.1 from chapter 7 but instead of pressing OK in the dialogue box, press Paste. The SPSS language for the Frequencies procedure will be pasted into a syntax window, shown in Figure 8.1.  Try running the command. Make sure the cursor is in the line  containing the word FREQUENCIES and click the Run icon button in the application window icon bar; it has a right-pointing arrow in the lower right corner. SPSS will carry out the command and produce the output shown in Figure 7.5 in chapter 7.   86  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  Figure 8.1 The syntax window  8.3 Structure of procedure commands All  commands  must  start  on  a  new  line,  and  must  end  in  a  full-stop  period .  So  in  Figure  8.1,  the  command  starts  with  the  word  FRE- QUENCIES and continues as far as the full stop. Although there are three lines  of  text,  this  is  one  command.  Subcommands  are  used  to  specify how  the  procedure   FREQUENCIES  in  Figure  8.1   should  operate.  For example, VARIABLES 5 sex area is a subcommand which indicates that the procedure should be applied to the variables sex and area in the data set. Subcommands are separated  usually  by the   character.  8.4 Running the commands from a syntax window  The  beneﬁt  of  a  syntax  ﬁle  is  that  you  can  run  all  or  some  of  the commands it contains directly, without having to go through the process of  making  menu  selections  again.  An  example  of  a  syntax  window containing a series of commands is shown in Figure 8.2. To identify the commands  to  run,  select  them  with  the  click drag  procedure   or  from the  keyboard  by  holding  down  shift  and  using  the  up down  arrow keys , so they are highlighted, and then click on the Run button. If you want  to  run  all  or  some  of  the  commands,  use  the  syntax  window’s menu bar Run entry and then click on All, Selection, Current or To End. To run just one command, put the cursor anywhere in the line containing the command and click on the Run icon button.   SYNTAX FILES  87  Figure 8.2 Example of a syntax window containing a series of commands and comment lines  8.5 Saving the syntax window as a syntax ﬁle  S AV I N G T H E S Y N TA X F I L E F O R T H E F I R S T T I M E To save the contents of the syntax window as a ﬁle on a ﬂoppy, check that the window is active and select from the Application window menu bar  File  Save As ...  The dialogue box presented is the same as that for saving data or output ﬁles. Type the name of the ﬁle into the File Name box. Open the Save In drop-down list and click on the icon for the a: drive. Click on the Save button. The ﬁle is saved with the ﬁlename extension .sps.  S AV I N G A P R E V I O U S LY S AV E D S Y N TA X F I L E A F T E R E D I T I N G I T Any changes you make to a syntax ﬁle will be lost unless you save the ﬁle.

To save the current version while keeping the previous one, select  Save As ...  which will present the Save As dialogue box. Type in a new name for the ﬁle; remember it must not contain a blank space. Check that the Save as Type shows the ﬁle will have the .sps extension, or open the drop-down list and select that alternative. Open the Drives drop-down list and click on the icon for the a: drive. Click on the Save button.  8.6 Retrieving a saved syntax ﬁle from disk  In versions 8 or 9, to retrieve an existing syntax ﬁle, select  If you are using SPSS version 10, select  File  Open  File  Open  Syntax  A dialogue box will appear. Check that Files of Type shows syntax  .sps : if it does not, open the drop-down list and select this option. If the ﬁle is on a ﬂoppy disk, open the Drives drop-down list and click on the icon for  the  a:  drive.  The  ﬁles  on  the  ﬂoppy  which  have  the  ﬁlename extension .sps will appear in the list of ﬁles. Click on the name of the ﬁle you want to open, check that its name appears in the File Name text box, and click on the Open button.  8.7 Opening another syntax window  The  ﬁrst  time  you  use  a  Paste  button,  a  syntax  window  is  opened automatically. But you can open a new  empty  one by selecting from the window menu  File  New  Syntax  You  can  have  more  than  one  syntax  window  open  at  one  time,  but  as with  output  ﬁles  only  one  can  be  the  ‘designated’  window  to  which   SYNTAX FILES  89  commands are pasted, and from which commands can be run. You know which is the designated window because it has an exclamation mark in the  bottom  line,  the  information  area.  To  make  a  syntax  window  the designated window, while viewing it click on the ! icon button in the icon bar. Any fresh pastings of syntax will be appended to the bottom of the currently-designated window.  8.8 Transferring syntax ﬁles to a word processor  Syntax  ﬁles  are  simple  text  ﬁles.  So  a  syntax  .sps  ﬁle  prepared  in  SPSS can be loaded into a word processor and reformatted and printed from there.  8.9 Loading a text ﬁle into a syntax window  You  can  type  SPSS  syntax  using  a  word  processor,  and  save  the  ﬁle  in text format. The text ﬁle can be copied and pasted into a syntax window, so  that  if  you  are  familiar  with  the  exact  syntax  you  can  prepare  your syntax  ﬁle’s  contents  on  a  machine  that  does  not  have  SPSS  installed. When  using  a  word  processor,  each  line  of  data  or  commands  must  be ended with a carriage-return. It should be saved in the word processor as a  text  ﬁle,  preferably  with  the  ﬁlename  extension  .sps.  It  can  then  be opened within SPSS as a syntax ﬁle.  Assume you have written a text ﬁle of SPSS syntax and stored it on a ﬂoppy  disk  with  the  ﬁlename  syn.sps.  To  load  it  into  SPSS,  select  from the Application window menu bar  File  Open  When  the  dialogue  box  appears,  open  the  Look  In  drop-down  list  and click  on  the  icon  for  the  a:  drive.  The  File  of  Type  box  needs  to  show Syntax   .sps ;  if  it  shows  something  else,  open  the  drop-down  list  and select  the  Syntax  option.  The  list  of  .sps  ﬁles  on  the  disk  will  then  be shown and you can click on the name of the ﬁle you want. Then click on Open and the ﬁle will then appear in a syntax window.  8.10 Entering commands in a syntax window by typing  You can edit the contents of a syntax window just like any other text ﬁle, and type straight into it. This is beneﬁcial to those who are familiar with the command language of SPSS, but if you are not experienced with SPSS be  careful  when  trying  to  create  commands  directly.  The  syntax  of   90  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  commands  is  not  simple,  and  there  are  a  number  of  rules  you  must follow.  For  example,  all  command  lines  must  start  on  a  new  line,  and must  end  in  a  full-stop   period .  Subcommands  are  separated   usually  by  .  To  enter  the  names  of  variables  in  the  commands  in  the  syntax window,  you  can  readily  type  them  in.  Or  you  can  use  the  Variables dialogue box which is obtained from the Utilities  Variables menu of the syntax  window.  This  displays  a  dialogue  box  and  you  can  select  a variable from the list in the left-hand side of the box. Information about the variable appears in the right-hand window. If the Paste button at the bottom of the window is clicked, the highlighted variable name is pasted into the syntax window at the point where the cursor was located. This is rather  laborious  and  most  users  will  probably  ﬁnd  this  method  not worth the effort.  Exercise 8.2  Try editing the contents of the syntax window created in Exercise 8.1 so that you obtain a Frequencies analysis of the data on the variable att1. To do this, while viewing the syntax window move the cursor  using the mouse  so it is to the right of the words sex area and click the mouse to anchor the insertion point. Use the backspace Delete key to delete these words and type in att1 in their place. Then run the command by clicking the Run icon button. SPSS should then run the commands, and give you in the Output1 window the results of applying the frequencies procedure to the variable att1.  8.11 Typing comments into the syntax window  It is always worthwhile adding comments to the syntax so that later you will be reminded of what a particular procedure achieves. For example, you  might  want  to  add  the  explanatory  comment  that  the  command calculates the mean for a certain variable.  Add comments to the syntax by typing them in, but make sure that the line  begins  with  an  asterisk  *  and  ends  with  a  full  stop. An  acceptable comment line would be  * This calculates mean on cust.  If you omit either the * or the full stop, SPSS will not understand and will give  you  an  error  message  when  you  try  to  run  the  syntax  window’s contents.   SYNTAX FILES  91  8.12 Help on syntax: the Syntax button in a syntax window  When you are using a syntax window, pressing the Syntax help icon in the  icon  bar  will  provide  help  information  about  the  procedure  on  the current  line  of  the  syntax  ﬁle.  The  help  information  can  be  highly complex, consisting of material from the SPSS technical manuals, and is likely  to  be  meaningful  only  to  those  who  have  a  thorough  under- standing  of  SPSS  commands.  Nevertheless,  you  may  ﬁnd  it  valuable once  you  have  developed  some  expertise  with  the  package.  So  do  try using  the  facility,  but  do  not  be  depressed  if  the  result  is  not  very helpful.  To print the ﬁle, while viewing it select from the window menu bar  8.13 Printing syntax ﬁles  File  Print  The Print dialogue box will appear. By default, one copy of the whole ﬁle will  be  printed.  To  print  more  than  one  copy,  type  in  the  number required in the Copies box. Click on OK.  P R I N T I N G PA RT O F T H E F I L E Highlight the area to be printed using the click drag technique, and then select File  Print from the menus. When the Print dialogue box appears, check that the Selection radio button is selected and click on OK.  As  a  syntax  ﬁle  is  a  simple  text  ﬁle  it  can  be  loaded  into  a  word  processor and printed from there.  8.14 Altering the page size for printing  To omit page breaks so you get just one continuous printing or to have the  output  ﬁt  A4  paper,  change  the  page  size  from  the  dialogue  box presented when you choose Edit  Options, as explained in section 7.1.   9  TAKING A PRELIMINARY LOOK AT THE DATA  Summary  This chapter explains how to:  c use  Explore  to  obtain  an  overview  of  the  data,  to  discover  any  possible errors in the data ﬁle  c use  Explore  to  ﬁnd  the  mean,  median,  standard  error,  variance, standard deviation,  minimum, maximum, range, interquartile range  IQR , and indices of skew  c display the cases with the ﬁve largest and ﬁve smallest values on any  variables  c obtain stem-leaf plot and boxplots c investigate  whether  subgroups  show  homogeneity  of  variance  and  whether the scores are normally distributed  c use Case Summaries to obtain a listing of the data ﬁle.  9.1 Checking the data  Before  proceeding  with  detailed  statistical  investigation,  it  is  always worth  having  an  overview  of  the  data  to  reveal  any  peculiarities  or possible errors in the data ﬁle. If you have coded sex as 1 for male, 2 for female,  3  for  missing  value   i.e.  sex  is  unknown ,  then  any  respondent with a sex score of 8 has obviously been miscoded. It is crucial to make sure the data is correct before analysing it, and so the ﬁrst step once the data  ﬁle  has  been  created  is  to  search  for  possible  coding  errors.  The SPSS procedures Explore and Case Summaries allow you to do this. The most useful is Explore.  9.2 Running the analyses  If  you  have  completed  the  example  exercises  described  in  previous chapters,  you  will  be  familiar  with  the  techniques  used  to  get  SPSS  for Windows to carry out an analysis:   TAKING A PRELIMINARY LOOK AT THE DATA  93  c Select  the  appropriate  menu   e.g.  Analyze   from  the  menu  bar  to  reveal a drop-down menu;  c Select the appropriate entry  Descriptive Statistics, Compare Means,  etc.  from the drop-down menu;  c Select the appropriate entry from the next submenu  e.g. Frequencies,  Descriptives, etc. ;  c When  presented  with  a  dialogue  box  for  the  procedure  you  are  requesting, specify the variables to be analysed;  c Click  on  Paste  to  have  the  procedure  commands  you  have  selected  pasted into a syntax window;  c Click on the Run icon button or use the Run drop-down menu.  The output appears in the Output window.  Once you have learned how to use the various dialogue box options, the procedure should be straightforward. To alter any of the choices you made in the dialogue box, you merely have to get back to it by working through the menu selection process, and then you can change the choices you  made  and  paste  the  revised  commands  into  the  syntax  window. Alternatively,  you  can  edit  the  commands  in  the  syntax  ﬁle  by  typing directly into it, as described in chapter 8.  9.3 Exploring the averages and distributions of scores using Explore  Note: Although  the  Explore  command  is  selected  from  the  menu,  it  is named Examine in the syntax window.  The  Explore  procedure  allows  you  to  ﬁnd  the  mean,  median,  and standard deviation of the scores on any or all of the variables. It provides you with measures of skewness in the distribution, gives box plots and shows the maximum and minimum scores so you can see if there are any aberrant  values  that  might  indicate  a  coding  error  when  the  data  was keyed in.  The Explore procedure is obtained from  Analyze  Descriptive Statistics  Explore...  When presented with the dialogue box illustrated in Figure 9.1, specify the variables to be analysed by adding them to the Dependent List text area and Paste the command into a syntax window. Run the procedure by clicking the Run icon or using the Run drop-down menu, to obtain a printout as shown in Figure 9.2 which Explored the variable cust in the ﬁle salesq.   94  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  Figure 9.1 The dialogue box for the Explore procedure  Figure  9.2  shows  two  tables,  the  Case  Processing  summary  which gives the number of cases and the number of missing cases, and then the Descriptives  tables  provide  a  range  of  statistics  including  the  mean, median,  standard  error,  variance,  standard  deviation,  minimum,  max- imum, range, interquartile range, and indices of skew. The 5% Trimmed Mean ﬁgure is the mean of the scores when the most extreme 10% of the scores are omitted from the calculation: the highest 5% of scores and the lowest 5% of scores are both deleted before this mean is calculated. The trimmed mean can be a useful indicator of the ‘average’, less inﬂuenced by  one  or  two  extreme,  outlying  scores  than  the  simple  arithmetic mean.  The ﬁgure for skewness indicates how non-symmetric the distribution is.  A  positive  value  on  kurtosis  indicates  that  the  distribution  of  the scores has heavier tails than a normal distribution curve. The values for both  skewness  and  kurtosis  will  be  close  to  zero  if  the  distribution  is normally distributed.  The stem-leaf plot is similar to a histogram but numbers indicate the actual  values  plotted.  The  ﬁrst  column,  headed  Frequency,  shows  the number of scores in the band indicated by the stem. For example, the ﬁrst line of the stem-leaf part of Figure 9.2 shows there was one respondent who scored  in  the  twenties  on  customers  visited   the  stem  is  2 .  The  actual score of this respondent was 28  the leaf is 8, so the actual score is 2, the stem, and 8 the leaf .  The  Explore  dialogue  box  allows  you  to  reﬁne  the  analysis  further. From  the  Display  area  of  the  box,  you  can  ask  for  the  output  to  show statistics,  plots   stem-leaf  plot   or  both,  which  is  the  default  option.  To obtain a histogram, press the Plots button and select histogram.   TAKING A PRELIMINARY LOOK AT THE DATA  95  Continued on next page  It is possible to have Explore display the cases with the 5 largest and 5 smallest values on any variables, which is useful for identifying aberrant, possibly mis-keyed items of data. After pressing the Statistics button in the Explore dialogue box of Figure 9.1, select Outliers; an example of the output is shown in Figure 9.3. It shows the ﬁve smallest and ﬁve largest scores on the variable, together with the case number of those scores. The case number is the number assigned to each case by the system when it   96  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  s t i s i v   r e m o t s u c   f o   r e b m u N  90  80  70  60  50  40  30  20  N =  22  Customer visits  Figure 9.2 Output from the command Explore Variable cust  reads  the  data  ﬁle;  the  ﬁrst  case  is  row  number  1  in  the  data  table,  the second  is  row  number  2  and  so  on.  The  data  ﬁle  salesq  includes  ids  identiﬁcation  numbers ,  which  are  for  this  particular  set  of  data  the same as the case number, since they count up from 1 in regular sequence. But  many  data  ﬁles  do  not  do  this:  the  ids  may  not  be  in  sequence. Assuming  you  have  a  variable  labeled  id  in  the  data  ﬁle,  you  can  tell Explore  to  print  the  entries  on  the  variable  id  by  inserting  id  into  the Label Cases By box of the Explore dialogue box shown in Figure 9.1.  To obtain further statistics, click on the Statistics button of Figure 9.1. You can request maximum-likelihood estimators of location such as M- estimator which provide estimates of the central tendency when extreme values  are  given  less  weight  than  more  central  values.  Percentiles  are also available.  Explore will exclude from the analysis any case that has data missing on any of the variables to be explored. You can alter this by selecting the Options button of Figure  9.1; the box revealed lets you choose Exclude Cases  Pairwise,  which  means  that  every  case  that  has  data  for  the variable being Explored will be included in the analysis of that variable. So the number of cases Explored for different variables will ﬂuctuate: a case that has missing data on the variable sex will not be included in the analysis of sex, but if the same case does have data for the variable area then it will be included when that variable is Explored.  If you have cases where there is no data on the variables that make up the Factor List, these cases can be made into a separate category or group of respondents by selecting the Report Values option. Their scores on the variables being Explored will then be reported.              TAKING A PRELIMINARY LOOK AT THE DATA  97  Figure 9.3 Using Explore to list outliers, the extreme scores on a variable  You  may  wish  the  scores  to  be  analysed  separately  for  subgroups  of cases,  depending  on  their  scores  on  one  or  more  of  the  variables.  For example, in salesq, suppose we want to Explore the scores on sales_1 for men  and  women.  Here  sex  is  a  factor  variable,  and  we  would  need  to have this variable inserted into the Factor List text box in Figure 9.1. You can have a number of Factor variables; if sex and area are inserted into the Factor List, SPSS would Explore the scores of the variables listed in the Dependent List for each level of sex and then for each level of area. Figure 9.4 shows the output when the command was to Explore sales_1 by sex.  From  menus,  you  cannot  ask  for  separate  analyses  of  subgroups deﬁned by combining scores on separate Factor variables: so you cannot get  an  analysis  broken  down  into  men  from  one  area,  men  from  the second area, women from the ﬁrst area and women from the second area. To achieve this, you have to paste the command into a syntax ﬁle, and then edit it so that it separates the factor variables with the word BY. If we wanted the scores on sales_1 to be analysed for each sex subdivided by area, the syntax ﬁle command would have to read:  EXAMINE VARIABLES=sales_1 BY sex BY area.   98  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  Continued on facing page  9.4 Boxplots of score distributions from Explore  Boxplots  such  as  those  shown  in  Figure  9.2  and  9.4  summarize  the scores on a variable by displaying the median  as an asterisk , the 25th and 75th percentiles as the lower and upper edges of a box surrounding the  median.  The  box  length  represents  the  interquartile  range  of  the scores.  Outliers  are  any  cases  which  are  between  1.5  and  3  boxlengths from the edge of the box, and Extremes are more than 3 boxlengths away. Lines  are  drawn  from  the  edge  of  the  box  to  the  largest  and  smallest values which are not outliers.   TAKING A PRELIMINARY LOOK AT THE DATA  99  12000  10000  8000  6000  4000  2000  1 _ S E L A S  0  N =  10 Male  SEX  11  Female  Figure 9.4 Extract of output from the command Explore Variables sales_1 by sex  A boxplot allows you to make a number of ‘eyeball’ judgments about the distribution of the scores. The median is the indicator of the central value, and the length of the box indicates the variability of the scores. If the median is not in the middle of the box, the distribution of scores is skewed.   100  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  Explore provides boxplots automatically, but pressing the Plots button of  Figure  9.1  opens  a  dialogue  box  in  which  you  can  specify  the characteristics of the boxplots or suppress them completely, and ask for a histogram.  The  box  plot  options  are  Factor  Levels  Together,  which  is used  for  comparing  subgroups  of  respondents   see  Figure  9.4  for  an example , and Dependents Together which is used to compare the scores of  one  set  of  respondents  on  a  number  of  variables.  When  plots  are selected,  the  output  is  shown  in  the  Viewer.  Details  on  saving  and printing charts are provided in chapter 10.  9.5 Do subgroups show homogeneity of variance?  If you select the Plots button from the Explore dialogue box  Figure 9.1 , the  section  entitled  Spread  vs.  Level  with  Levene  Test  allows  you  to request plots of the spread of scores against the level of the scores, and to test whether the subsets of scores show homogeneity of variance.  Imagine  we  wanted  to  know  whether  in  the  data  ﬁle  salesq  the variability  of  the  scores  of  men  and  women  on  sales_1  was  equal:  the Levene  test  is  one  method  of  investigating  this.  You  obtain  the  test  by having at least one Factor List variable and then selecting the Plot button from  Explore’s  dialogue  box,  and  choosing  Untransformed.   If  sub- groups  of  respondents  show  unequal  variances  on  the  variables  being compared,  you  may  wish  to  apply  a  transformation  to  the  raw  data. There  are  options  for  applying  various  transformations  to  the  data,  or leaving it untransformed.  If the Levene test is signiﬁcant, reject the null hypothesis that the groups have equal variances.  As well as the Levene test, this procedure gives a boxplot and a graph showing the spread of scores  interquartile range  in each group plotted against the level  median . An example of this type of plot is shown in Figure  9.5.  It  permits  one  to  see  how  variability  varies  with  average level.  9.6 Are the scores normally distributed?  If you select the Plots button from the Explore dialogue box  Figure 9.1 , the  Normality  Plots  with  Tests  button  provides  a  graph  of  the  data plotted  in  such  a  way  that  it  would  be  a  straight  line  if  the  data  were normally  distributed.  This  is  described  as  a  Normal  Q–Q  plot,  and  an example is shown in Figure 9.6. If the data is not normally distributed, the  points  will  differ  from  the  straight  line,  and  the  amount  by  which they  differ  is  itself  plotted  as  a  detrended  normal  plot  also  shown  in Figure  9.6.  If  the  data  were  normally  distributed,  the  detrended  plot would be a horizontal line passing through 0. These plots allow you to judge visually whether the data is normally distributed.   TAKING A PRELIMINARY LOOK AT THE DATA  101  Spread vs. level plot of Sales_1 by Sex  d a e r p S  4700 4600 4500 4400 4300 4200 4100 4000  5300   5400   5500   5700   5800   5900  5600  Level  * Data transformed using P = 1 Slope = –1.346  Figure 9.5 Example of output from Explore: Plot Spread vs. Level  Tests  of  whether  a  set  of  data  is  normally  distributed  are  the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test and the Shapiro–Wilks test  when the number of  scores  is  less  than  50 ,  and  these  are  calculated  and  the  probability values  shown  when  you  ask  for  Normal  plots  with  tests.  A  low  sig- niﬁcance  value  means  that  the  scores  are  not  normally  distributed,  but with large sets of data non-perfect normal distribution is almost certain to  occur  and  so  the  interpretation  of  these  tests  should  be  treated cautiously: the visual displays indicate how non-normal the distribution is.  9.7 Obtaining a listing of the data using Case Summaries  A listing of the data merely reproduces the lines from the data ﬁle, and is probably less helpful than printing the data ﬁle itself. To obtain a simple listing of the data, select   102  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  Normal Q–Q plot of Sales_1  l a m r o n   d e t c e p x E  l a m r o n   m o r f   v e D  2.0  1.5  1.0  0.5  0  –0.5  –1.0  –1.5  –2.0  0.4  0.3  0.2  0.1  0  –0.1  –0.2  –0.3  –0.4  0  2000   4000   6000   8000  10000   12000  Observed value  Detrended normal Q–Q plot of Sales_1  0  2000   4000   6000   8000  10000   12000  Observed value  Figure 9.6 Example of normal plot output from Explore: Plot Npplot  Analyze  Reports  Case Summaries  The  dialogue  box  requires  you  to  specify  which  variables  should  be listed.

If  you  ask  for  the  ﬁrst  20, these  will  be  the  ﬁrst  20  rows  of  the  data  ﬁle.   You  can  have  the  case number  included  in  the  listing  by  checking  Show  Case  Numbers  from the bottom of the dialogue box; remember this is the number of the row in the Data Editor table, not any identiﬁcation number which you may have added as a variable  such as id in the salesq data ﬁle .  Further details on this facility are given in section 21.3.   10  GRAPHS  Summary  This chapter explains how to:  c use Interactive Graphs to obtain various types of graph c use Interactive Graphs to edit graphs c obtain histograms, barcharts, stem-and-leaf plots and box plots using the Analyze  Descriptive Statistics  Frequencies or  Explore menus c obtain  scattergrams  and  other  types  of  chart  by  using  the  Graphs  menu  c edit charts in the Chart Editor c suppress any missing values from being plotted c save, retrieve, print charts and transfer them to other applications.  Version  8  of  SPSS  introduced  a  feature  known  as  interactive  graphs, which  is  available  from  the  Graphs  drop-down  menu.  It  is  intended  to make it much easier to create graphs than using the Graphs menu itself. But note that although the Interactive Graphs facility produces visually impressive output comparatively easily, it does not always provide more complex  graphs  such  as  the  clustered  bar  chart   Figure  10.10   or  the multiple  line  graph   Figure  10.15 .  To  achieve  these  more  complex graphs, use the Graphs menu. The way interactive graphs operate will be described ﬁrst, and then the more traditional ways of creating graphs in SPSS will be covered.  10.1 Creating graphs using Interactive Graphs  The Interactive Graphs facility is available from  Graphs  Interactive  This offers a list of alternative types of graph. How to create bar graphs, line graphs, histograms, scatterplots and ribbon graphs will be described   GRAPHS  105  here.  Once  the  basic  idea  of  how  to  use  Interactive  Graphs  has  been grasped, you will be able to investigate the mass of facilities which are available.  When  an  interactive  graph  is  being  created  as  explained  in  the following  sections,  you  make  selection  from  tabbed  pages  like  those shown in Figure 10.3. One of the tabs is headed Options and offers a list of  alternative  ChartLooks.  These  are  pre-designed  styles  and  you  can select  one  of  them  to  give  an  impressively  professional  appearance  to your graph.  Note that when a graph has been created using Interactive Graphs, it can be edited by double-clicking on it. It will then be surrounded by an editing frame, illustrated in Figure 10.1. Moving the mouse cursor over the various icons will, after a few seconds delay, reveal an explanation of what  each  does.  In  addition,  putting  the  cursor  over  an  element  of  the graph  and  right-clicking  will  open  a  relevant  drop-down  menu  which allows  modiﬁcation  of  that  part  of  the  display.  There  is  yet  another feature:  an  icon  in  the  top  icon  bar  of  Figure  10.1  opens  the  Chart Manager, shown in Figure 10.2. The Chart Contents are listed, and when one of these is selected, the Edit button can be pressed to reveal further windows which allow editing of the element selected. So the alternatives are  enormous;  the  only  way  to  deal  with  all  these  possibilities  is  to experiment,  keeping  notes  on  what  you  did  and  which  selections  you made so you can repeat it if needed in the future!  10.2 Bar graphs from Interactive Graphs  From the menu select  Graphs  Interactive Bar...  and  the  window  shown  in  Figure  10.3  will  be  revealed.  Move  the variable  to  be  plotted  on  the  vertical  axis  from  the  variable  list  to  the textbox on the vertical axis using the click drag procedure, and do the same  to  allocate  a  variable  to  the  horizontal  axis.  Only  when  you  have done this will the  Bars Represent  feature appear in the window. If you open the drop-down list you will ﬁnd that the bars can represent many different statistics apart from the mean.  To  produce  separate  graphs  for  each  level  of  a  variable,  enter  the variable into the Panel Variables box. For example, if sex is entered as a panel variable, separate graphs for males and females are obtained.  As is indicated in Figure 10.3, there are tabbed pages which allow you  to set the characteristics of the bars, add a title, etc.   106  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  Figure 10.1 An interactive graph prepared for editing  Figure 10.2 The Chart Manager for editing an interactive graph   GRAPHS  107  Figure 10.3 The window for creating a bar chart using Graph Interactive  10.3 Line graphs from Interactive Graphs  From the menu select  Graphs  Interactive Line...  and a window similar to that shown in Figure 10.3 will be revealed but with the title Create Lines. Move the variable to be plotted on the vertical axis  from  the  variable  list  to  the  textbox  on  the  vertical  axis  using  the click drag  procedure,  and  do  the  same  to  allocate  a  variable  to  the horizontal axis. Only when you have done this will the Lines and Dots Represent feature appear in the window. If you open the drop-down list you will ﬁnd that the lines can represent many different statistics apart   108  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  from  the  mean.  If  a  variable  is  entered  into  the  Panel  Variables  box, separate graphs will be produced for each level of the panel variable. For example, by entering sex as a panel variable, separate graphs for males and females are obtained.  As is indicated in Figure 10.3, there are tabbed pages which allow you  to set the characteristics of the lines, add a title, etc.  10.4 Histograms from Interactive Graphs  From the menu select  Graphs  Interactive  Histogram...  and a window similar to that shown in Figure 10.3 will be revealed but with the title Create Histogram. A histogram plots on the vertical axis the frequency  as a number or as a percentage  of a variable’s scores. Move the  variable  to  be  plotted  from  the  variable  list  to  the  textbox  on  the horizontal axis using the click drag procedure. To have the histogram of percentage  values  rather  than  actual  frequencies,  use  click drag  to remove Count  $count  from the textbox on the vertical axis back into the variable list and take Percent  $pct  from the variable list and put it in the vertical axis textbox. If a variable is entered into the Panel variables box, separate graphs will be produced for each level of the panel variable. For example, by entering sex as a panel variable, separate graphs for males and females are obtained.  As is indicated in Figure 10.3, there are tabbed pages which allow you to  set  the  characteristics  of  the  histogram,  add  a  title,  etc.  Three- dimensional effects and a superimposed normal curve are available from the Histogram tab.  10.5 Scatterplots from Interactive Graphs  From the menu select  Graphs  Interactive  Scatterplot...  and a window similar to that shown in Figure 10.3 will be revealed but with the title Create Scatterplot. Move the variable to be plotted on the vertical axis from the variable list to the textbox on the vertical axis using the click drag procedure, and  do the same to allocate a variable to the   GRAPHS  109  horizontal  axis.  If  a  variable  is  entered  into  the  Panel  Variables  box, separate graphs will be produced for each level of the panel variable. For example, by entering sex as a panel variable, separate graphs for males and females are obtained.  As is indicated in Figure 10.3, there are tabbed pages which allow you to set the characteristics of the lines, add a title, etc. To have a regression line ﬁtted to the data, use the Fit tab.  10.6 Ribbon graphs from Interactive Graphs  A simple example of a ribbon graph is shown in Figure 10.4. Although these can look impressive you are advised to use them, if at all, with care. They  can  detract  from  accurate  communication,  and  may  be  more appropriate for a commercial presentation rather than a scientiﬁc report. If you decide to try them out, from the menu select  Graphs  Interactive  Ribbon...  and a window similar to that shown in Figure 10.3 will be revealed but with  the  title  Create  Ribbons.  Move  the  variable  to  be  plotted  on  the vertical axis from the variable list to the textbox on the vertical axis using the click drag procedure, and  do the same to allocate a variable to the horizontal axis. Only when you have done this will the Ribbons Repre- sent feature appear in the window. If you open the drop-down list you will ﬁnd that the lines can represent many different statistics apart from the mean. If a variable is entered into the Panel Variables box, separate graphs  will  be  produced  for  each  level  of  the  panel  variable.  For example, by entering sex as a panel variable, separate graphs for males and females are obtained.  As is indicated in Figure 10.3, there are tabbed pages which allow you to set the characteristics of the ribbons, add a title, etc. When you have obtained  a  ribbon  graph  in  the  Output  Viewer,  double  click  on  it  to invoke the editing facilities. Among many other things, the ribbon graph can be rotated in both left-right and up-down dimensions, which is fun to do if not immediately of any great use.  10.7 Histograms, barcharts and piecharts from Frequencies  Histograms  and  barcharts,  stem-and-leaf  plots  and  box  plots  showing the  distribution  of  scores  on  a  variable  are  obtained  from  the  Analyze  Descriptive  Statistics   Frequencies  menu.  Scattergrams  and  all  other types  of  chart,  including  more  complex  barcharts  and  histograms,  are   110  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  Figure 10.4 Example of a ribbon graph  obtained by using the Graphs menu, which is covered in later sections of this chapter.  Histograms  and  barcharts  have  a  superﬁcial  similarity  in  that  they both represent data as the length of a bar on a chart. A histogram such as that shown in Figure 10.5 is used to show a frequency distribution when the variable being plotted is continuous. With large sets of data, it may be  necessary  to  group  the  scores  into  intervals  before  plotting  a  histo- gram.  For  example,  if  you  have  data  on  people’s  age  you  might  group them into intervals of 0–20 years old, 21–40 years old, etc. as explained in section 12.6.  Barcharts  are  used  to  show  a  distribution  of  scores  on  a  non- continuous or categorical variable. For example, Figure 10.6 is a barchart of scores on the variable sex; the categories of sex are not continuous and the  bars  are  separated  rather  than  being  adjacent  to  each  other  as  they are in the histogram of Figure 10.5. In SPSS, a histogram shows an empty space  for  a  value  having  no  cases,  whereas  a  barchart  does  not:  any category  having  no  entries  will  be  omitted  from  the  graph.  Piecharts, such as Figure 10.7, are an alternative way of presenting the data.  Histograms, barcharts and piecharts of the distribution of the scores on  variables in the data ﬁle can be obtained from  Analyze  Descriptive Statistics  Frequencies  Click on the Charts button of the dialogue box to reveal another. You can ask for histograms, barcharts or piecharts, ask for a normal curve to be superimposed  on  a  histogram,  for  barcharts  or  piecharts  to  plot  actual frequencies or percentages. Click on Continue, then on the Paste button in the Frequencies dialogue box and run the syntax to obtain the graph.

The  box  length  represents  the interquartile range of the scores. Outliers are cases which are between 1.5 and 3 boxlengths from the edge of the box, and Extremes are more than 3  boxlengths  away.  Lines  are  drawn  from  the  edge  of  the  box  to  the largest and smallest values which are not outliers. Examples are given in Figures 9.2 and 9.4.  The  boxplot  allows  you  to  make  a  number  of  ‘eyeball’  judgements about  the  distribution  of  the  scores.  The  median  is  the  indicator  of  the central  value,  and  the  length  of  the  box  indicates  the  variability  of  the scores. If the median is not in the middle of the box, the distribution of scores is skewed.  A stem-and-leaf plot, such as that shown in Figure 9.2, is similar to a histogram,  but  numbers  indicate  the  actual  values  plotted.  The  column headed Frequency shows the number of scores in the band indicated by the  stem.  For  example,  the  ﬁrst  line  of  the  stem-leaf  plot  in  Figure  9.2 shows  there  was  one  respondent  who  scored  in  the  twenties  on  cus- tomers visited  the stem is 2 . The actual score of this respondent was 28  the leaf is 8, so the actual score is 2, the stem, and 8 the leaf .  Stem-and-leaf  plots,  histograms,  boxplots  and  spread-by-level  plots  can be obtained from  Analyze  Descriptive Statistics  Explore  Identify the variable s  to be plotted by entering them into the Depend- ent  List.  If  data  from  subgroups  of  cases  are  to  be  plotted  separately, enter the variable for separating the subgroups into the Factor List box. In Figure 9.4, scores on sales_1 are plotted for each sex separately, since sex was entered into the Factor List. Clicking the Plots button opens the dialogue box shown in Figure 10.8. Select Stem-and-leaf or Histogram or both and then click the Continue button, and Paste.  When  the  Explore   Plots  procedure  has  run,  the  output  is  shown  in the Viewer. If you want to edit it, double-click on it and it will be opened in a window titled SPSS Chart Editor which is described in section 10.15 below.  The  chart  is  saved  when  the  output  ﬁle   with  the  ﬁlename extension .spo  is saved.  10.9 Graphs, charts and scattergrams from Graphs  The basic steps in creating a chart from the Graphs menu are straightfor- ward, but there are numerous alternatives in format. It would be tedious   GRAPHS  113  Figure 10.8 The Explore Plots dialogue box  and unnecessary to describe them all here. Once the user is familiar with the basic steps, there should be little difﬁculty in investigating the other features available.  To create a chart via the Graphs menu, you must have a data ﬁle open. Open  the  Graphs  drop-down  menu,  and  select  the  type  of  chart  you want to create. Note that the ﬁrst entry in the menu list, Gallery, shows the types of graph available and provides immediate access to help and instructions  on  creating  charts.  The  menu  offers  a  barchart,  line  graph, area  chart,  pie  chart,  boxplot,  scattergram,  histogram  and  others.  The system will guide you through a series of dialogue boxes in which you can specify how you want the chart drawn, the titles and legends to be put  on  it,  the  scales  for  the  axes,  etc.  The  particular  boxes  presented  to you  depend  on  the  choices  you  have  made  previously,  so  I  shall  only describe  the  general  structure  of  the  system  here.  Once  you  have understood  the  basic  techniques,  you  will  undoubtedly  enjoy  some hours investigating the many other options.  When  you  have  indicated  which  type  of  chart  you  want,  the  ﬁrst dialogue  box  has  a  Deﬁne  button  which  takes  you  further  into  the system.   Figure  10.9  illustrates  the  dialogue  box  when  a  bar  graph  has been requested.  But it also has an area entitled ‘Data in Chart Are’, with three  alternatives.  The  headings  offered  are  rather  unclear,  and  the following explanation may be helpful.  If  you  want  a  chart  showing  the  average  score  of  subgroups  of  your respondents  on  one  of  the  variables  you  measured,  or  if  you  want  to show  how  many  people  obtained  each  score  on  one  or  more  of  the variables, ask for ‘Summaries for groups of cases’. This option can plot,   114  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  Figure 10.9 Dialogue box from the Graphs Bar . . . menu  for example, a barchart showing the number of males and females in the data  set,  or  the  average  on  sales_2  of  the  respondents  from  different employers. This is the default option – the one that is active unless you select  one  of  the  others.  Figure  10.10  provides  an  example  of  the output.  If you want to summarize more than one variable, such as the mean score on sales_1 and sales_2, select the ‘Summaries of separate variables’ option.  The  charts  produced  can  be  quite  complex,  as  you  can  obtain summaries  of  a  number  of  variables  for  subgroups  of  respondents.  So you could have the average of sales_1 and of sales_2 for men and women from the data ﬁle salesq plotted on one chart, as in Figure 10.11.  The  third  option  is  ‘Values  of  individual  cases’.  This  means  that  the data  on  the  selected  variables  are  plotted  for  each  case   row  of  data . Respondent   case   is  plotted  along  the  horizontal  axis  with  this  option. An example is shown in Figure 10.12, which displays the values on the att1  variable  of  salesq  for  each  case.  It  is  worth  emphasizing  that  this type  of  display  is  rarely  useful   although  they  are  popular  with  many beginners .  If  the  Summaries  for  Groups  of  Cases  option  has  been  selected  from the  Deﬁne  Chart  dialogue  box   Figure  10.9   and  the  Deﬁne  button  is pressed,  you  are  presented  with  another  dialogue  box  allowing  you  to specify what the lines bars represent. The options vary according to the type of chart you have chosen. The box presented after selecting Graphs  Bar... and Summaries for Groups of Cases is shown in Figure 10.13. By default, the chart shows the number of cases having a particular value on   GRAPHS  115  Employer  Jones and Son  Smith and Co  Tomkins  Male  Female  SEX  Figure 10.10 Example of barchart showing mean on sales_2 subdivided by sex for each employer.

The Other summary function allows you to make further choices: Other is  usually  the  mean  of  the  data  for  the  variable,  but  for  stacked  bar, stacked area and pie charts it is the sum.  1 T T A   e u l a V  6  5  4  3  2  1  0  1   3   5   7   9  11   13   15   17   19   21  Case number  Figure 10.12 Example of barchart of scores on att1 for each respondent. Note: This graph was obtained by selecting the Values of Individual Cases option  Figure 10.13 The dialogue box for choosing which summary of data for groups of cases is required   GRAPHS  117  It  is  possible  to  have  different  Summary  statistics,  by  selecting  the variable and entering it in the Variable box of the Bars Represent section, then  clicking  on  the  Change  Summary  button.  From  the  Summary Function dialogue box you can specify the summary statistics you want from  the  list  of  alternatives  offered  which  includes  median,  mode, number of cases, standard deviation and others. You can also ask for a plot  of  the  number  or  percentage  falling  above  or  below  a  particular value   which  you  enter  into  the  Value  text  box ,  percentiles,  even  the percent  or  number  of  cases  with  values  between  and  including  a  Low and High value which you enter into text boxes. The range of possibil- ities is enormous, and experimentation is the best way to discover what they all do!  10.10 Dealing with missing data when creating charts with Graphs  When you are charting data that has some data missing, SPSS will omit any  case  that  has  data  missing  on  the  variables  being  plotted.  This cannot be altered when you are plotting data for individual cases, nor if you are plotting a histogram. But for other charts, you do have a choice. To over-ride the default setting, you must select the Options button from the  Deﬁne  Chart  dialogue  box  such  as  that  shown  in  Figure  10.13. ‘Exclude  cases  listwise’  means,  although  the  name  is  rather  confusing, that  any  row  of  data  which  has  a  missing  data  point  for  any  of  the variables selected for plotting will be omitted from the graph. This is the default condition. The alternative is ‘Exclude cases variable by variable’, which  means  that  when  a  particular  variable  is  plotted,  any  case  with missing data is omitted, but when you analyse another variable the case is included if it has a score on that variable.  For some charts, missing values are plotted as a separate category. For example, in Figure 10.7 the piechart includes a sector for the case where the sex is unknown  sex had a value of 3 which was deﬁned as a missing value .  You  may  wish  to  suppress  the  plotting  of  these  missing  value cases. To do so, select the Options button from the Deﬁne Chart dialogue box and click on the button entitled ‘Display groups deﬁned by missing values’,  so  the  tick  in  the  box  is  removed.  Missing  value  cases  will  not then be plotted.  10.11 Creating a bar chart from Graphs  Suppose  we  want  a  barchart  showing  the  means  on  sales_2  of  respon- dents  subdivided  by  sex  and  employer   Figure  10.10 .  To  obtain  this graph, select  Graphs  Bar...   118  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  which opens the Bar Charts window. You can choose a Simple, Clustered or Stacked barchart by selecting the appropriate icon. A Simple barchart represents each value on the variable being plotted as a bar, and the bars are  equally  spaced  along  the  axis.  In  Clustered  charts,  some  bars  are clustered  together  as  in  Figure  10.10. A  stacked  barchart  shows  two  or more variables in each bar.  To create Figure 10.10, select the Clustered barchart option, check that Summaries  for  Groups  of  Cases  is  selected  in  the  area  headed  Data  in Chart  Are,  and  click  on  Deﬁne.  This  reveals  the  Deﬁne  Clustered  Bar dialogue box.  You  must  identify  the  variables  to  be  plotted:  in  this  example  it  is sales_2. Click in the list on the left of the box the variable to be plotted, on the button marked Other summary function, and on the arrow button to  insert  the  variable  name  in  the  text  box  headed  Variable  which  will then  contain  MEAN sales_2 .  Enter  the  variable  sex  into  Category Axis and  empl  into  Deﬁne  Clusters  by.  Click  on  the  Options  button  and deselect Display Groups Deﬁned by Missing Values. Click Continue and then Paste. The syntax should read:  GRAPH  BAR GROUPED =MEAN sales_2  BY sex BY empl.  Run  the  syntax;  after  a  few  seconds  the  chart  will  be  presented  in  the Output Viewer.  10.12 Creating a scattergram from Graphs  To create a scattergram select  Graphs  Scatter  Indicate  whether  you  want  a  simple  scatterplot,  an  overlay  in  which multiple scatterplots are put into the same frame, a scatterplot matrix or a  3-dimensional  plot.  Initially,  the  Simple  option  is  likely  to  be  most useful.  An  example  is  shown  in  Figure  17.1.  You  may  wonder  what  a scatterplot matrix is. Suppose you selected three variables and asked for this  option,  then  you  would  obtain  scatterplots  for  variable1  versus variable2,  variable2  v  variable3,  and  variable1  v  variable3  .  .  .  and  the same  plots  with  the  axes  swapped  so  you  also  get  variable2  versus variable1, variable3 v variable2 and variable3 v variable1!  Having  selected  the  type  of  scatterplot  required,  click  on  Deﬁne  and this  will  produce  a  window  in  which  you  specify  the  variables  to  be plotted  on  each  axis  by  selecting  them  from  the  list  on  the  left  and clicking  the  right-pointing  arrow  for  the  Y   vertical   axis  and  then repeating the procedure for the X  horizontal  axis.   GRAPHS  119  You can separate the plots for subgroups of respondents: for example, one could plot cust versus sales_1 for all the respondents in salesq, but have  the  data  for  females  indicated  by  a  different  marker  from  those used to plot males’ data. This is achieved by entering sex as the variable in  the  Set  Markers  By  text  box.  Click  on  Paste,  run  the  syntax  and  the graph will be presented on screen.  Individual points can be labelled if you enter a variable in Label Cases  By in the dialogue box revealed when you select Graphs  Scatter.  Scatterplots  in  three  dimensions  require  you  to  specify  the  three variables  to  be  used  as  the  axes.  When  the  plot  is  presented  you  can enjoy playing with it by rotating it around various axes if you select from the menus  Edit  Format  Spin Mode  and click the 3-d rotation buttons in the icon bar.  10.13 Obtaining the regression line on a scattergram from Graphs  If you want the regression line to be shown in the scatterplot then, while the  graph  is  shown,  double  click  it  so  it  is  opened  in  the  Chart  Editor. Click on the Chart  Options menu to reveal the dialogue box shown in Figure  17.2. In the  Fit Line area, make the selection to tell the program whether  you  want  to  ﬁt  a  line  for  the  Total  data  set  or  for  subgroups separately. The Fit options button then becomes available, and clicking it reveals  Figure  17.3.  The  linear  regression  line  is  the  default,  although quadratic and cubic can be selected instead. Click on Continue to return to the Scatterplot Options box, and then on OK. The regression line will be added to the plot.  10.14 Creating a line graph of means of subgroups from Graphs  It  is  often  helpful  when  trying  to  interpret  the  results  of  an  analysis  to plot the means of subgroups of respondents. This is particularly true if analysis of variance with more than one independent variable has been performed, as it demonstrates the effects of any interaction between the variables.  Although  a  line  graph  is  not  the  most  appropriate  way  of plotting  means  when  the  subgroups  are  divided  on  a  non-continuous scale,  it  can  be  a  useful  aid  to  understanding  the  pattern  of  results. Relevant  line  graphs  of  estimated  marginal  means  can  readily  be obtained from the dialogue boxes used when you request an analysis of variance, as is explained in chapter 16.   120  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  Suppose we wished to plot the means of the data on the variable sales_ 2 for males and females from each of the two areas North and South as in Figure  10.14.  Select  Graphs   Line  from  the  menu,  to  reveal  a  dialogue box in which you select the Multiple option icon and the Summarize for Groups  of  Cases  alternative.  Click  on  Deﬁne  to  open  another  dialogue box; click on sales_2 then on Other summary function and ﬁnally on the right-pointing arrow button next to the Variable text box. MEAN sales_2  will appear in the text box. Insert the variable area as the Category axis and insert sex as Deﬁne Lines by. Use the Options button to allow access to  the  method  for  suppressing  the  displaying  of  missing  value  cases. Click on Continue and then on Paste. The syntax should read:  GRAPH   LINE MULTIPLE MEAN sales_2  BY area BY sex.  When  the  syntax  is  run  and  the  chart  made  visible  on  the  screen  by pressing the Chart icon in the output window, the graph should look like Figure 10.14.  8000  7000  2 _ S E L A S   n a e M  6000  5000  4000  3000  North  SEX Male Female  AREA  South  Figure 10.14  Line graph of means of sales_2 for each area for each sex  10.15 Editing the chart created from Graphs  When the chart is ﬁrst created, it is displayed in the Output Viewer. For editing, it needs to be placed in the Chart Editor shown in Figure 10.15. This  is  done  by  double  clicking  the  chart  or  by  selecting  it  and  then choosing Edit  SPSS Chart Object  Open. The facilities for editing charts   GRAPHS  121  are  so  numerous  that  it  is  best  to  learn  by  experimentation:  once  the basics are understood, the user will learn most, and most enjoyably, by experimenting  with  the  host  of  alternatives,  so  only  some  of  the  alter- natives will be described here.  Figure 10.15 The Chart Editor window  With  the  Chart  Editor  window  open,  the  menu  bar  contains  these  entries which allow you to make numerous alterations to the chart:  File Edit View Gallery Chart Series Format Statistics Graphs Help  The icon bar of the Chart Editor duplicates the commands available from the Format menu. By clicking on the icons, you can, among other things, set  the  pattern  for  ﬁlling  enclosed  areas,  set  the  colours,  specify  the marker used to plot a point, set the thickness and style of lines, specify whether bars have a shadow or 3-d appearance, determine whether bars are labelled, decide how interpolated lines are drawn, vary the font and size of text used in the chart, apply 3-d rotation for a 3-d plot, swap axes, explode the slice of a pie chart, spin a 3-d plot.  The  File  menu  allows  you  to  save  Chart  Templates  and  Export  the chart in various ﬁle formats. To alter the typeface used in the charts and to have grid lines displayed, use Edit  Options from the menu bar.  You  can  replace  the  current  chart  with  another  of  a  different  type, using  the  same  data,  by  selecting  Gallery.  Line  graphs,  area  charts,  pie   122  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  charts  can  be  requested  at  the  ﬁrst  stage  of  creating  a  chart.  But  more complex  charts  such  as  mixed  bars  and  lines,  exploded  pie  charts,  or dropped  line  charts  are  available  once  you  have  created  a  chart,  by putting it into the Chart Editor, and selecting Gallery from the menu bar. Experimenting  with  the  possibilities  is  perhaps  the  best  way  to  learn how to control these displays. As usual, the system provides appropriate dialogue boxes at every point.  To  use  the  editing  facilities,  you  need  to  appreciate  that  a  chart contains  two  kinds  of  object.  ‘Series  objects’  are  the  bars,  lines  and markers  that  represent  the  data.  ‘Chart  objects’  are  the  layout  and labelling features. To modify an object, you either use the Chart or Series menus of the Chart Editor window, or you can double-click on the object you wish to modify. With either procedure, an appropriate dialogue box is then presented allowing you to specify the attributes of the object. For example, to change the way the bar in a barchart is ﬁlled with a pattern, double click on one of the bars. To change the label for the vertical axis, double click on the existing label.  To alter the title of the chart, select Chart  Title from the menus, and  type text into the Title 1 and or Title 2 text boxes; then click on OK.  To  alter  the  title  or  labels  of  the  horizontal  axis,  double  click  on  the existing  ones.  This  reveals  the  Category Axis  box,  and  you  can  enter  a different  title.  To  alter  the  labels  of  the  categories,  click  on  the  Labels button.  In  the  Category  Axis:  Labels  dialogue  box  you  can  set  the number of decimal places, change the orientation of the labels and make other adjustments. When the label settings have been altered, a click on the Continue button returns you to the Category Axis box and you click on OK.  To alter the title, scale or labels of the vertical axis, double click on the existing vertical axis title, and the Scale Axis box is exposed. It functions in a similar way to the Category Axis box used to modify the horizontal axis described above.  That  part  of  the  chart  which  indicates  which  variables  are  shown  is known as the legend. Double clicking on the existing legend will reveal a Legend box allowing you to add a title to the legend, alter the labels of the legend, vary its position or suppress it completely.  To add a short text message to the chart, select Chart  Annotation. The resulting  box  allows  you  to  type  in  the  message  and  locate  it  at  a  set point deﬁned by position on the vertical and horizontal axes.  To alter the layout or change the scales of the chart axes select Chart  Options and further dialogue boxes appropriate to the type of chart you are  editing  allow  you  to  specify  how  you  want  the  chart  to  be  con- structed. The options offered depend on the type of chart you are editing, but this menu gives great ﬂexibility in chart design.  To have a normal curve added to a histogram or add a regression line  to a scatterplot, use the menu Chart  Options.   GRAPHS  123  You  can  swap  axes,  so  that  histograms,  for  example,  are  oriented horizontally  rather  than  vertically,  by  selecting  Format   Swap Axes,  or by clicking on the icon in the icon bar which portrays a movement of the axes.  To alter the patterns used to ﬁll areas of the chart, and similar features  of the chart, select the Format menu.  To alter the text fonts and sizes, select Format  Text. To suppress the display of some of the variables you have previously  selected for inclusion in the chart, select Series  Displayed.  To  alter  the  sequence  in  which  variables  are  grouped  in  a  clustered barchart or a stacked chart, select Series  Displayed and alter the order in  which  variables  are  listed  in  the  Display  text  box  of  the  Displayed Data  dialogue  box  by  removing  variables  from  the  list  and  then  re- inserting them in the new sequence.  10.16 Saving and retrieving a chart  A  chart  is  saved  in  the  Output  Viewer  ﬁle,  which  has  the  ﬁlename extension .spo.  Select from the menu bar  File  Save As  The  name  of  the  output  ﬁle  will  appear  in  the  Filename  box.  The directory  in  which  it  will  be  saved  is  shown,  and  you  can  alter  this  by clicking  on  the  required  alternative  in  the  Save  In  drop-down  list  and navigating  to  the  desired  directory.  To  save  the  ﬁle  to  the  ﬂoppy  disk, you need to click on a:.  As charts are saved in the output ﬁle, retrieving them merely requires opening  the  output  ﬁle  containing  the  chart  which  had  been  saved previously. How to open an output ﬁle is described in section 7.6.  10.17 Transferring a chart to another application  When you are looking at a chart in the Output Viewer, it can be copied into  other  Windows  applications,  such  as  Word.  Copy  the  chart  to  the windows  clipboard  by  selecting  it  with  a  left  click  and  then  using  the Edit   Copy  menu.  Open  a  document  in  Word  and  select  Edit   Paste Special. A dialogue box is presented: select the Picture option and click OK. The chart will be pasted into the document as a picture and can be edited using Microsoft Draw.  Charts can be exported from SPSS in a variety of formats such as .bmp, .wmf, .tif for importing into other applications. To save the chart in one   124  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  of  these  formats,  use  File   Export. A  dialogue  box  illustrated  in  Figure 10.16  is  presented.  Open  the  drop-down  list  to  show  the  alternatives which  can  be  exported   Output  Document,  Output  Document   No charts , or Charts Only . If Charts Only is selected, different graphic ﬁle formats become available in the File Type drop-down list.  Figure 10.16 The dialogue box for exporting charts  10.18 Printing charts  File  Print  10.19 Chart templates  If the chart is in the Output Viewer, it can be printed be selecting it with a click and then from the menu bar choosing  A chart template allows you to save the style of a chart so that it can be applied to other charts, so you do not have to go through the process of designing  a  chart  every  time.  Essentially,  when  you  save  a  chart,  the features of that chart can be applied when you create a new chart or can be applied to a chart already in the chart window.   GRAPHS  125  U S I N G A T E M P L AT E W H E N C R E AT I N G A C H A RT When  you  access  the Deﬁne Chart dialogue box, it contains an area titled Template, with the option ‘Use chart speciﬁcations from:’. If you select this and then click on the  File  button  in  the  template  area,  a  list  of  template  ﬁles,  with  the ﬁlename extension .sct, is shown. Select the one you want from the list so its name appears in the Chart Template File text box and click on Open. The chart you are creating will be assigned the attributes of the chart you are using as a template.  If you have a chart in A S S I G N I N G A T E M P L AT E TO A N E X I S T I N G C H A RT the Chart Editor and want to apply a template to it, select from the menu Format  Apply Chart Template.  10.20 Adding grid lines to charts  You can ask for horizontal or vertical grid lines to be added to charts by selecting from the menu Edit  Options. Select the Charts tab, and there is the  facility  for  adding  grid  lines:  use  the  check  boxes  to  request  hor- izontal lines  Scale axis  and or vertical lines  Category axis .   11  RANKING AND SORTING THE DATA  Summary  Cases.  c To  convert  a  set  of  scores  into  rank  values,  use  Transform   Rank  c When a variable ve is ranked, you obtain a new variable called rve. Switch to the Data Editor window to see the scores on rve, the ranked variable.  c To  rank  within  subgroups  enter  the  variable  name  for  forming  subgroups into the By box of the Rank Cases dialogue box.  c To obtain rank correlations refer to section 17.3. c To sort the cases into a new order, use Data  Sort Cases.  If  you  want  to  convert  a  set  of  scores  into  rank  values,  select  from  the menu  11.1 Ranking scores  Transform  Rank Cases  The dialogue box shown in Figure 11.1 will be presented. Enter into the Variable s   box  the  variables  to  be  ranked.  Ensure  the  option  Display Summary Tables is ticked  clicking in the check box if necessary ; this has the effect of putting a message in the output window to tell you what the procedure  has  done.  An  example  of  the  message  is  shown  in  Figure 11.2.  To have rank values assigned in ascending order, so the lowest score has a rank value of 1, you need do nothing, but if you want the scores ranked  in  descending  order  so  the  largest  value  has  the  rank  of  1  then you select Largest Value in the Assign Rank 1 To section of the dialogue box. Paste the command into the syntax window and run it.  The Rank procedure creates a new variable, which by default has the name  of  the  variable  being  ranked  preceded  by  the  letter  r.  So  when sales_1 are ranked, you obtain a new variable called rsales_1. When you   RANKING AND SORTING THE DATA  127  Figure 11.1 The Rank Cases dialogue box  have run Rank you will see the message illustrated in Figure 11.2 in the output window; switch to the Data Editor window and you will ﬁnd that the new variable has been added to the data in the table. The name of the new  variable  must  be  used  if  you  wish  to  list  or  analyse  the  ranked values.  Figure 11.2 The output from the Rank procedure.  Switch to the Data window to see the new variable rsales_1   There are a number of options on how to assign ranks to tied values. Unless  you  specify  otherwise,  via  the  Ties  button,  tied  values  will  be given the mean rank value of the scores. Alternative methods of ranking, unlikely to be used by the beginner, are available from the Rank Types button.  11.2 Ranking within subgroups  The basic Rank command ranks the whole set of scores on the variables speciﬁed.  You  frequently  need  the  ranking  of  scores  within  subgroups;   128  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  for  example,  one  may  require  the  data  for  males  and  females  to  be ranked separately. This is achieved by entering a variable name into the By box of the Rank Cases dialogue box shown in Figure 11.1. So to have the  scores  of  the  males  and  females  on  sales_1  ranked  separately,  you insert  sales_1  into  the  Variables  box,  sex  into  the  By  box  and  click  on Paste. The syntax is shown in Figure 11.3.  Figure 11.3 The output from ranking within subgroups of sex.  Switch to the Data window to see the new variable rsales_1   11.3 Rank correlation  Rank  correlations  are  obtained  from  the  Correlate  entry  of  the Analyze drop-down menu, described in section 17.3. If the data is on an interval or ratio scale, you do not have to use the rank procedure before ﬁnding the rank correlation, as the ranking is done automatically.  11.4 Putting the cases in a different order: Sort Cases  There  are  occasions  when  you  may  wish  to  sort  the  cases  into  a  new order. For example, if you were analysing just the ﬁrst 50 cases in a large data ﬁle, you might want those ﬁrst 50 cases to be all males, or all of a given  level  of  income  or  having  some  other  feature.  You  can  have  the cases  sorted  into  a  speciﬁed  order  using  the  Sort  Cases  procedure.  The procedure is obtained from the menu  Data  Sort Cases  Enter the variable s  to be used for sorting the data into the Sort By box, and select ascending or descending Sort Order.  If you enter two variables in the Sort By box, the cases will be sorted ﬁrst of all by the ﬁrst one in the list and then by the second one in the list and so on. So if you wanted the data in salesq to be sorted so that all the males  sex 5 1  from the North  area 5 1  came ﬁrst, followed by all the men from the South  area 5 2 , then all the women from the North and ﬁnally all the women from the South, you would put sex and area into the Sort By box. When the cases have been sorted, they are shown in the new order in the Data Editor window.                RANKING AND SORTING THE DATA  129  11.5 Restoring the original order after using Sort Cases  If the cases were originally ordered by some other variable, such as id, the original order can be restored by running the Sort Cases procedure again  with  id  as  the  deﬁning  variable.   This  is  one  reason  why  it  is always  worth  having  an  identifying  variable  such  as  the  variable  id  in salesq; you can restore the original order.  If, however, you do not have a variable  with  which  you  can  sort  to  regain  the  original  order,  you  can only get back to the original by reloading the data ﬁle from the disk. This makes it important that if you have sorted the data you should save the data ﬁle under a new ﬁlename so that the original order is preserved in the original data ﬁle on the disk.   CHANGING THE WAY DATA IS CODED AND  12  GROUPED  Summary  c To calculate a new variable from the original data use the Transform   Compute procedure.  c To code the data in a different way from that used when the data ﬁle was  initially  created,  use  the  Transform   Recode  procedure.  It  is always wise to choose Recode  Into Different Variables.  c To  obtain  z  scores  use   the  Analyze   Descriptive  Statistics   Descriptives procedure, explained in section 15.4.  c To collapse data across a set of cases and form a new ‘case’ which has  scores derived from the collapsed data, use Data  Aggregate.  12.1 Why you might want to modify the data  In  analysing  data  you  may  want  to  calculate  a  new  variable  from  the original  data.  For  example,  from  respondents’  sales  and  the  number  of customers  visited,  you  may  want  to  create  a  new  variable  which  is  the average sales per customer visit or you may want to know the average of respondents’ scores on a number of measures such as ﬁnding the mean for each person of their responses to att1, att2 and att3. This is achieved using the Compute procedure.  Sometimes you may want to code the data in a different way from that used when the data ﬁle was initially created. For example, the salesq ﬁle includes  data  on  the  number  of  customers  visited.  You  may  want  to divide the respondents into just two groups: those who visited more than 40 customers, and those who visited less than 40. The Recode procedure will do this for you.  Another common situation is when you want to reverse the scoring of one of the variables. For example, in the Sales Personnel Questionnaire, there  were  three  questions  asking  respondents  about  their  attitude  to their job. Questions 5 and 6  named as att1 and att2  have the responses   CHANGING THE WAY DATA IS CODED AND GROUPED  131  coded so that 1 indicates the respondent is very satisﬁed and 5 indicates dissatisfaction. But for question 7  att3 , 1 indicates dissatisfaction and 5 indicates satisfaction. Suppose you wanted the scores on att3 to be scored in the opposite direction, so they are consistent with att1 and att2, with a low  score  meaning  very  satisﬁed  and  a  high  score   5   meaning  very dissatisﬁed.  This  kind  of  alteration  is  easily  made  using  the  Recode command.  12.2 Calculating ‘new’ scores and transforming scores: Compute  Figure 12.1 The Compute Variable dialogue box  Compute is found from the menu under  Transform  Compute  It  opens  the  dialogue  box  entitled  Compute  Variable  shown  in  Figure 12.1.  Type  a  name  for  the  variable  you  are  computing  into  the  Target Variable text box: the name must not be more than eight characters long, must not contain a space, must not end in a full-stop. You can assign a label to the new variable name by pressing the Type&Label button from the dialogue box and responding to the box revealed.  The  new  variable  will  be  calculated  from  some  combination  of  the existing  variables,  linked  by  mathematical  operators.  For  example,  you might  want  to  calculate  a  new  variable,  totatt,  which  is  the  total  of  the scores  on  att1,  att2  and  att3.  The  box  headed  Numeric  Expression  is where you indicate the formula that is used to calculate the new variable,   132  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  and you select existing variables to enter into the formula by the usual process  of  clicking  on  their  names  in  the  left-hand  list  and  then  on  the right-pointing arrow. Mathematical operators  the plus sign, multiplica- tion sign, etc.  are entered into the formula by clicking on the appropriate button in the area which looks like a calculator key-pad. So the formula for  calculating  totatt  is  att1  1 att2  1 att3,  and  you  enter  this  into  the Numeric  Expression  box  by  clicking  on  att1  in  the  lefthand  list  and  on the arrow, then on the  1 sign in the on-screen key-pad, then on att2 in the variable list and the right arrow, etc.  When  you  have  created  the  formula  you  want,  click  on  the  Paste button at the bottom of the screen and the syntax window will contain these lines:  COMPUTE totatt = att1 + att2 + att3 . EXECUTE .  When you run these two commands, switch to the data window to see the  new  variable   totatt  in  this  example   which  has  been  added  in  the ﬁrst empty column to the right of the original data.  The  key  pad  area  allows  you  to  use  not  only  arithmetic  operators  in your formula, but also relational operators such as  , and  . as well as logical operators: the keypad has an & key to represent AND, a key with a vertical line to represent OR, and a ~ key which represents NOT.  So the ~5 key means Not Equal to.   You will notice that a list appears under the label Functions, and this allows  access  to  a  set  of  transformations  and  mathematical  functions which can be used in the formula. For example, if you wanted to obtain the  log  of  the  scores  on  variable  cust,  you  would  enter  a  new  variable name,  logcust,  and  then  scroll  down  the  Functions  list  until  the  LG10 function  was  exposed.  Click  on  that  and  then  on  the  upward  pointing arrow above the list of Functions. The function you selected will appear in  the  Numeric  Expression  list,  with  question  marks  to  show  that  you still have to enter the arguments for the expression  i.e. the variables to be used when calculating the log, mean, square root or whatever you are asking  for .  Click  on  the  ﬁrst  question  mark  in  the  expression  in  the Numeric Expression list, then click on the appropriate variable  cust, for example  in the variable list on the left of the dialogue box. The Numeric Expression  will  then  read  LG10[cust].  Click  on  Paste  and  run  the Compute procedure, and the new variable logcust will be added to the Data  Editor.  It  is  important  to  realize  that  the  Functions  facility  deals with  missing  values  in  a  way  that  can  be  misleading.  See  section  12.4 below for an explanation and details on how to avoid being misled.  The  Functions  list  allows  you  to  select  a  number  of  transformations and  statistics  expressions.  You  can  obtain  the  absolute  value  of  scores with  ABS,  the  SQRT  provides  square  roots,  arcsines  are  provided  by ARSIN, and there are many others. The statistical functions allow you to   CHANGING THE WAY DATA IS CODED AND GROUPED  133  obtain  the  mean,  sum,  standard  deviation,  variance,  minimum  or  max- imum  of  a  set  of  scores,  but  remember  this  refers  to  a  set  of  scores obtained  by  each  respondent.  Suppose  you  want  to  obtain  the  average score on att1, att2 and att3 for each respondent: you would put a name for the new variable in the Target Variable box and then from the Functions list select MEAN numexpr,numexpr,. . . . It appears in the Numeric Expres- sion window, and you then click on the names of the variables for which you want the mean by clicking on them in the variable list and then clicking on the right arrow. In this example, you would select att1, att2 and att3 so  that  the  formula  in  the  Numeric  Expressions  text  box  read  MEAN  att1,att2,att3 .  Clicking on the Paste button at the bottom of the screen will insert into  the syntax window these lines:  COMPUTE Meanatt = MEAN att1,att2,att3  . EXECUTE .  When these two commands have been run, switch to the data window to see the new variable  Meanatt in this example  which has been added in the ﬁrst empty column to the right of the original data.  The earlier example of calculating the total of scores att1, att2 and att3 could be obtained more simply by using the function SUM att1,att2,att3 , but do see section 12.4 below regarding the treatment of missing values when functions are used.  The  Functions  list  contains  an  entry ANY test,value,value. . . ,  one  of the Logical Functions. What this does is to check whether the scores for each respondent on a named variable  the one referred to as test  match a  speciﬁed  value.  For  example,  ANY year,90,91   will  examine  the  data for  each  respondent  to  see  whether  the  score  on  the  variable  year matches the values given: 90 or 91. If there is a match, the new variable is added to the Data Editor and a score of 1 is given.  Exercise 12.1  Use Compute to calculate a new score called avsales1 which is the average sales_1 per customer visited for each respondent in the data ﬁle salesq. The formula for avsales1 is sales_1 cust.  12.3 Using Compute with certain cases only: Compute If  You  may  want  to  compute  a  new  variable  for  just  some  cases  in  your data ﬁle, cases that meet certain criteria. For example, you might want to calculate  the  sum  of  att1,  att2  and  att3  only  for  people  from  the  North   134  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  area.  To  do  this,  you  click  on  the  If. . .  button  in  the  Compute  Variable dialogue box shown in Figure 12.1, and this opens another box entitled Compute  Variables:  If  Cases.  The  structure  of  this  box  resembles  the previous  Compute  Variable  one,  but  you  can  specify  the  conditions  to apply before the Compute procedure takes place. For example, suppose you want to calculate a new variable called Northtot which is the total of att1, att2 and att3 but is only calculated for those respondents who had a score of 1 on the variable area  these are the respondents who worked in the North . To do this, you need the box in Compute Variables: If Cases to contain the expression area 5 1.  The  expression  is  created  very  much  as  the  Numeric  Expression  in Compute  Variables  was  obtained,  by  selecting  variable  names  from  the list,  entering  them  into  the  box  by  clicking  on  the  arrow  button,  and using  the  calculator  key  pad  to  obtain  arithmetic  or  logical  expressions and  functions.  Once  the  formula  is  entered  in  the  box,  click  on  the Include  if  Cases  Satisﬁes  Condition:  button,  and  then  on  the  Continue button  at  the  bottom  of  the  box.  Once  the  Compute  box  has  been completed,  clicking  on  Paste  will  insert  into  the  syntax  window  the lines:  IF  area = 1  Northtot = att1 + att2 + att3 . EXECUTE .  When  these  commands  are  run,  the  variable  Northtot  will  be  added  to the data window and the values inserted just for those respondents who have an entry of 1 on the variable area.  12.4 Missing values in Compute  If  you  are  using  compute  with  an  arithmetic  expression,  such  as att11att21att3, then any case which has a missing value on any of the variables included in the formula  in this example att1, att2, att3  will be classiﬁed  as  having  a  missing  value  on  the  new  variable  you  are computing.  Statistical  functions  work  differently:  if  you  compute  a  new  variable using the function MEAN att1,att2,att3 , then the new variable will have a missing value if the respondent has missing data on all of the variables in the expression. This could be misleading: you might ask for the mean of  att1,  att2  and  att3  for  a  respondent  who  only  has  scores  on  att1  and att2.  The  mean  that  is  given  will  be  the  mean  of  the  two  scores  the respondent  has,  and  you  may  be  unaware  that  for  this  respondent  the mean  calculated  is  not  the  mean  of  three  variables  but  only  of  two.  To prevent this happening use MEAN.3 att1,att2,att3 . You have to type the .3  in:  before  the  opening  bracket,  put  a  decimal  point  and  follow  this with  a  number  equal  to  the  number  of  variables  listed  in  the  function.   CHANGING THE WAY DATA IS CODED AND GROUPED  135  With this formulation, any case that has a missing value on any one of the  variables  named  between  the  brackets  will  have  a  missing  value assigned on the computed variable.  12.5 Obtaining z scores  When a series of parametric data is transformed so that it has a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 1.00, the scores are known as z scores. To obtain z scores for any variable, use the Descriptives procedure and select  the  Save  Standardized  Values  as  Variables  option  in  the  Descrip- tives dialogue box. Details are given in section 15.4.  12.6 Changing the way data is coded: Recode  Recode is obtained from the menu by selecting  Transform  Recode  Into Different Variables  which yields the dialogue box shown in Figure 12.2. It is always wise to choose Recode  Into Different Variables. The recoded values make a new variable,  which  you  have  to  name  as  described  below,  and  the  original variable and the scores on it are retained in the data ﬁle. If you choose Recode   Into  Same  Variables,  the  recoded  values  will  replace  the  old values in the Data Editor. This is a dangerous thing to do, as you run the risk of losing the original values which you may need later. It is always possible  to  reload  the  original  data  ﬁle  from  disk  so  that  you  get  the original scores back, but it is easy to make mistakes and save a version of the data which overwrites the original ﬁle. If this happens you can have lost the original scores for good.  Specify the variables to be recoded by entering them in the Variables list  and  provide  a  name  for  the  variable  when  it  has  been  recoded  by typing in the new name in the Output Variable Name box and clicking on Change. The new name will be inserted next to the old name in the Input  Variable  ﬁ Output  Variable  list  as  shown  in  Figure  12.2.  Next select  the  Old  and  New  Values  button  to  obtain  the  display  shown  in Figure 12.3. Specify the old value and the new value; for example, if you want a score of 5 to be recoded as a 1, 5 goes into the Old Value’s Value box,  and  1  into  the  New  Value’s  Value  box. You  then  click  on  the Add button.  As the lower left part of Figure 12.3 implies, you can specify a range of values to be recoded as a single value. Suppose we wanted to recode the data  so  that  two  groups  are  formed  according  to  their  standing  on  the   136  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  Figure 12.2 The dialogue box for Recode. Note that the variable cust has been selected for recoding into the variable custrc  Figure 12.3 The dialogue box for assigning new values in Recode. The current value 5 has been set to be recoded as 1  cust variable, with all cases where cust is 40 or less being given a new, recoded score of 1 and all those with a cust score of 41 or more having a recoded  score  of  2.  You  could  deﬁne  one  range  as  0  through  40  and assign  it  the  new  value  of  1,  click  on Add,  and  then  deﬁne  the  second range as 41 through highest, assign it a new value of 2 and click on Add. Note that you can specify one category for recoding as lowest score to a speciﬁed  value  and  another  as  from  a  speciﬁed  value  to  the  highest   CHANGING THE WAY DATA IS CODED AND GROUPED  137  score,  which  is  useful  for  forming  two  groups  such  as  those  scoring below and above the median.  When you have speciﬁed the old values to be recoded, it is necessary to  decide  how  any  unspeciﬁed  values  are  to  be  treated.  If  you  do nothing, they will all be given the system missing value, which is rarely what is needed. To ensure that any old values you do not want recoded are  carried  over  into  the  new  variable  with  the  same  values  as  before, make  sure  you  select  All  Other  Values  in  the  Old  and  New  Values dialogue box, and then select Copy Old Values in the New Value area of the  box  and  ﬁnally  press  the  Add  button.  The  entry  ELSE  ﬁ COPY appears in the list to show that all unspeciﬁed values will be carried over into the new variable.  You can ask for only certain cases to be recoded: if you wanted only the  men’s  scores   sex  5 1  in  salesq   recoded,  for  example,  click  on  the If. . .  button  of  Figure  12.2.  This  opens  the  If  dialogue  box  which  is explained in section 12.3.  When all selections have been made from the dialogue boxes, Paste the syntax into a syntax window. An example of the Recode syntax is shown in Figure 12.4.  When  the  commands  are  run,  switch  to  the  Data  window  to  see  the new recoded variables which have been added to the data. To save the new variables, save the contents of the Data Editor as a data ﬁle.  Figure 12.4 Examples of the syntax for Recode  Recode   Into  Same  Variables  operates  in  a  similar  way  to  Recode  Into Different Variables, except that as noted above it runs unnecessary dangers.  Recode only applies to the data in the active ﬁle. The original data ﬁle is  not  affected  by  running  the  Recode  command,  so  there  is  no  risk  of making  permanent   and  non-reversible   changes  to  the  entries  in  the data  ﬁle.  To  store  a  copy  of  the  data  to  which  the  Recode  has  been applied,  carry  out  the  recode,  and  then  save  the  data  ﬁle.  It  is  a  wise precaution  to  save  it  under  a  different  name  from  the  original  data  ﬁle  use File  Save As. . .  just in case there are any catastrophes later.  Exercise 12.2  Recode the scores on the variable sales_1 in the data ﬁle salesq so that values of 8000 or over are coded as 3, values of 4000 or less are coded as 1 and values between 4000 and 8000 are coded as 2.   138  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  12.7 Automatic Recode  This  procedure  automatically  recodes  all  the  scores  on  a  variable  into consecutive integers. For example, the customers-visited scores in salesq include a 28, a 29, a 30, a 33 and the largest ﬁgure is 83. If you use  Transform  Automatic Recode  the scores will be modiﬁed so that the lowest score is changed to 1, the second-lowest to 2, the third-lowest to 3 and so on. The procedure creates a new variable for the recoded scores, which must be given a new name by  highlighting  the  variable  entered  in  the  Variable  ﬁ New  Name  list, typing  the  new  name  in  the  text  box  to  the  right  of  the  New  Name button,  then  clicking  on  that  button.  When  Automatic  Recode  runs, switch  to  the  data  window  to  see  the  new  variable.  The  values  on  the new  variable  are  automatically  given  value  labels  corresponding  to  the original  values  on  the  variable  which  has  been  recoded.  Figure  12.5 illustrates the effect of using Automatic Recode.  Figure 12.5 Example of the effects of Automatic Recode  12.8 Multiple responses  Surveys often use questions with non-exclusive responses: suppose that instead  of  asking  the  people  who  completed  the  sales  questionnaire described in chapter 4 which employer they worked for now, we asked them to indicate which of the employers they had ever worked for. We might  ﬁnd  individuals  who  had  worked  for  employer  1   Jones   only,   CHANGING THE WAY DATA IS CODED AND GROUPED  139  others  who  had  worked  for  1   Jones   and  2   Smith ,  others  who  had worked for 2  Smith  and 3  Tomkins , and so on. There are alternative ways of dealing with such data. One method would be to have a variable for each employer and use a score of 1 to indicate ‘yes’ and 2 to indicate ‘no’. This is referred to as the multiple dichotomy method.  The  alternative  method  is  known  as  the  multiple  category  method. Here one would have three variables, and the score on each one would indicate which employer had been mentioned. In our example, a score of 1 would represent Jones, 2 Smith and 3 Tomkins. So a respondent who had  been  employed  by  Jones  and  by  Tomkins  would  score  1  on  varia- ble1, 3 on variable2 and have a missing value on variable3.  Whichever method one chose, the responses on the variables need to be  combined  either  into  a  multiple  dichotomy  set  or  into  a  multiple category set. This is achieved by selecting from the menu  Analyze  Multiple Response  Deﬁne Sets  The dialogue box allows you to specify the variables to be entered into a set.  You  have  to  indicate  for  each  variable  whether  the  scores  are dichotomies  the scores represent yes or no  or whether the scores have more than two alternatives. The former is used for the multiple dichot- omy  method,  the  latter  for  the  multiple  category  method.  You  have  to enter a name for the set and Add it to the list, where the name you gave will be preceded with a $ sign.  The analysis of multiple response sets is achieved by selecting either  Analyze  Multiple Response Frequencies  or  Analyze  Multiple Response  Tables  Frequencies  produces  tables  which  show  the  number  of  respondents giving  each  possible  response   i.e.  each  employer,  in  our  example  collapsed across the variables in the set. The Tables subcommand is used to produce cross-tabulations, in which the responses are collapsed across the  variables  in  the  deﬁned  set  and  then  tabulated  against  scores  on another variable.   140  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  12.9 Collapsing data across cases: Aggregate  You  may  wish  to  collapse  data  across  a  set  of  cases,  and  form  a  new ‘case’ which has scores which are derived from the collapsed data. As an example, you could collapse the scores for each of the sexes and have one case  representing  ‘men’  and  a  second  case  representing  ‘women’.   This procedure  should  be  used  only  rarely  and  after  some  thought  about whether  it  is  justiﬁed.  This  example  is  merely  to  allow  me  to  explain what Aggregate achieves.   To obtain an aggregation, select  Data  Aggregate  Specify in the Break Variable s  box the variable to be used to identify the groups to be formed. In the example I am using, this would be sex. In the Aggregate Variable s  box you enter the variables to be aggregated; SPSS will create a new variable. You have to indicate the function to be used in making the aggregation: do you want the aggregate score to be the mean of  the  individual  cases  or  their  sum  or  the  percentage  of  cases  falling between  certain  limits  or  some  other  function?  The  mean  is  used  by default; if you want any other function, you have to select the Functions button and ﬁll in the dialogue box.  The  Aggregate  procedure  creates  a  new  data  ﬁle,  aggr.sav,  in  the current  directory.  If  you  want  a  different  name  or  the  ﬁle  to  be  saved elsewhere, click on the File button and complete the dialogue box.   13  SELECTING SUBGROUPS FOR ANALYSIS  Summary  File.  Cases.  c Analysing subgroups is needed to carry out an analysis on a subset of  cases such as just the males.  c To form subgroups based on each level of a variable use Data  Split  c To  form  subgroups  based  on  scores  on  a  variable  use  Data   Select  c To select a random sample of cases of data use Data  Select Cases. c Turn off both Split File and Select Cases after use.  13.1 When analysing subgroups is needed  If you have data from different groups, such as males and females, you may  want  to  carry  out  some  analyses  on  each  group  separately.  For example, in the data ﬁle salesq we have a record of the number of sales  sales_1  by male and female respondents from the North and from the South. Imagine you want to analyse separately the sales_1 scores for the two  sexes.  Split  File  allows  you  to  do  so  and  you  can  then  return  to analysing all the cases by turning Split File off.  13.2 Selecting subgroups based on each level of a variable: Split File  From the menu select  Data  Split File  In the dialogue box revealed  Figure 13.1  select either Compare Groups or Organize Output by Groups.  Both of these have the effect of invoking the  Split  File  procedure.  The  difference  is  in  the  way  the  output  is   142  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  Figure 13.1 The dialogue box for Split File  organized, as explained in section 13.3 below.  Then select the variable to be  used  to  divide  the  cases  into  subgroups  and  enter  it  in  the  Groups Based On text box. Suppose that we want to take each sex separately and compare  people  from  the  North  with  those  from  the  South  on  their scores on the variable sales_1. We want to select people according to their sex,  so  the  variable  sex  would  need  to  be  entered  in  this  box.  When Pasted, the syntax window contains these lines:  SORT CASES BY sex . SPLIT FILE  LAYERED BY sex .  or  SORT CASES BY sex . SPLIT FILE  SEPARATE BY sex .  To carry out a t-test comparing people from the North with those from the South on sales_1 data, one then selects the necessary commands from the menu and pastes them into the syntax window, and then turns Split File off by returning to the Split File dialogue box, selecting Analyze All Cases, Do Not Create Groups and pressing Paste. The complete syntax is included  in  Figure  13.2.   The  ﬁrst  section  of  the  syntax  uses  the  Select Cases  command,  explained  in  13.4  below,  to  exclude  from  the  analysis those  cases  where  sex  is  not  known,  where  the  respondent  has  a  score more than 2 on the variable sex. You will be able to understand it better when you have read section 13.4.    SELECTING SUBGROUPS FOR ANALYSIS  143  The  output  from  running  this  syntax  is  shown  in  Figure  13.2.  Two separate t-tests have been performed, one on males and one on females. Each t-test compares the sales_1 scores for respondents from the North with those for respondents from the South.  Once  invoked  the  Split  File  command  continues  to  be  operative throughout  an  SPSS  run  of  commands  unless  you  turn  it  off  by  going back to the Split File box and selecting Analyze All Cases, Do Not Create Groups.  When it is operating, Split File sorts the data in the data ﬁle so that it has all cases with the same value on the grouping variables in the correct sequence.  This is done automatically, but if the data is already sorted in the appropriate order, the sorting can be omitted by selecting the button marked File Is Already Sorted.   13.3 Compare Groups or Organize Output by Groups in Split File  Either  of  these  options  invokes  the  splitting  of  the  ﬁle.  The  difference between them is in the way the output is organized. Figures 13.2 and 13.3 illustrate  the  formats.  In  Figure  13.2,  the  ﬁle  was  split  by  sex  with  the Compare Groups option chosen  leading to the syntax Layered by Sex . The  tables  of  Group  Statistics  and  of  Independent  Samples  Test  both have sex as a layer in the table. By contrast, Figure 13.3 shows the output when  the  ﬁle  was  split  with  the  Organize  Output  by  Groups  option  yielding the syntax Separate by Sex . This gives separate tables for each level of the sex variable.  13.4 Selecting subgroups using Select Cases  Select Cases resembles Split File but applies a ﬁlter to the data ﬁle and then only analyses those cases which have been ﬁltered. Select Cases is needed if you want to form a subset of cases based on their standing on a continuous variable, or you want a more sophisticated way of selecting cases than can be achieved by using Split File. Select Cases was used to exclude some cases from the analysis in Figures 13.2 and 13.3. You also use Select Cases if you want to analyse the results from a random sample of the cases.  As an example, suppose you wanted to analyse the data only for those cases which had  a  value  of  5000 or more on the variable sales_1 in the data ﬁle salesq. Select Cases allows you to do this.  It is possible to tell the program to delete from the data ﬁle those cases which have not been ﬁltered; if this happens the deleted cases cannot be retrieved unless you have kept a copy of the original data ﬁle on a disk. So be wary of using the Delete cases option!   144  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  Figure 13.2 Example of using Split File to analyse males and females separately  When you choose from the menu Data  Select Cases  it  opens  a  dialogue  box  shown  in  Figure  13.4,  which  has  a  number  of paths through it. Suppose you want to compare  using a t-test  the sales_ 2 scores of men and women but only for those respondents who had a score  of  at  least  5000  on  sales_1.  To  select  respondents  with  a  sales_1 score  of  at  least  5000,  click  on  the  If  Condition  is  Satisﬁed  option  and then on the If. . . button, which opens another box, entitled Select Cases: If. This requires you to enter the variables to be used for selecting cases and mathematical or logical expressions and is described in section 12.3.   SELECTING SUBGROUPS FOR ANALYSIS  145  Figure 13.3 Example of output from Split File with the Organize Output by Groups option  So for the example of selecting the cases where sales_1 is 5000 or more, you need to have this formula  sales_1 .5 5000  in the main text box of this  dialogue  box.  Click  on  Continue  to  return  to  the  Select  Cases  box   146  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  and  then  press  Paste  to  insert  the  syntax  into  a  syntax  window.  The syntax is shown in Figure 13.5, and illustrates the way a ﬁlter is applied. The  t-test  can  then  be  requested  from  the  Statistics  menu,  and  will  be applied  only  to  those  cases  included  when  the  Select  Cases  command has run.  When you have used Select Cases and want to return to using all the cases  in  the  data  ﬁle,  turn  Select  Cases  off  by  selecting  the  All  Cases option from Figure 13.4 and pasting that into the syntax window, where it will show, as illustrated in Figure 13.5, the commands  Filter off. Use all. Execute.  Running these commands turns Select File off.  Figure 13.4 The dialogue box for Select Cases  13.5 Selecting a subset of cases based on case number or id number  The  option  in  Figure  13.4  to  select  cases  based  on  Time  or  Case  Range allows  you  to  select  subsets  of  cases.  If  you  select  this  entry  and  then   SELECTING SUBGROUPS FOR ANALYSIS  147  Figure 13.5 Example of the syntax for Select Cases. Note that this example selects cases with a score of 5000 or more on the variable sales_1  press  the  Range. . .  button,  you  can  type  into  textboxes  the  numbers  of the ﬁrst and last cases you want to use in the analysis. Remember that the casenumber is the number of the row in the table you see when you are looking at the Data Editor. The actual data which is in any row may change;  for  example  you  might  start  with  respondent  1,  a  male,  in  the ﬁrst row. But if you then sort the data by sex, this respondent’s data may move and be in a different row of the Data Editor. Bear this in mind if you are thinking of using this way of selecting cases.  You  may  want  to  select  certain  cases,  knowing  just  which  cases  they are. For example, you might want to analyse the data from respondents 1 to 10 only. This can easily be done if you have entered an identiﬁcation number as a variable, which is always to be recommended.  In the data ﬁle salesq, the variable id was used for this purpose.  To analyse only the data from respondents 1 to 10, i.e. with identiﬁcation numbers below 11, and  assuming  the  variable  id  is  the  identiﬁcation  number  variable  that was entered for each respondent, select  Data  Select Cases  and then click on the If Condition is Satisﬁed option and the If. . . button. By  clicking  on  the  appropriate  buttons,  get  the  entry  in  the  text  box  to read  id<11,  and  then  press  the  Continue  button  and  then  the  Paste button to put the command into your syntax ﬁle. Run the syntax to have Select  Cases  operating.  When  you  have  run  the  analyses  you  require, remember to turn off Select Cases by selecting the All Cases option from Figure 13.4, pasting that into your syntax ﬁle and running it.  13.6 Selecting a random sample of cases  With  very  large  data  ﬁle,  you  may  wish  to  select  a  sample  of  cases  for analysis. To select a 10% random sample, use from the menu   148  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  Data  Select Cases...  In the Select Cases dialogue box  Figure 13.4  select Random Sample of Cases  and  click  on  the  Sample  button.  Another  box  is  revealed  and allows  you  to  specify  a  percentage  of  the  cases  or  an  exact  number  of cases selected randomly from the data ﬁle.   14  HOW MANY RESPONDENTS GAVE A PARTICULAR  ANSWER? FREQUENCY DATA  Summary  c To  obtain  tables  and  histograms  or  barcharts  showing  how  many people  gave  each  response  use  Analyze   Descriptive  Statistics  Frequencies.  c To  ﬁnd  out  how  often  a  respondent  used  a  particular  response  category use Transform  Count.  c Obtain  cross-tabulations   from  Analyze   Descriptive  Statistics   Crosstabs.  c The  two-sample  chi-square  is  made  available  from  the  Statistics button  of  the  Analyze   Descriptive  Statistics   Crosstabs  dialogue box.  Do  not  confuse  this  two-sample  chi-square  with  the  one obtained from the chi-square option of the Analyze  Nonparametric Tests menu, which gives the one-sample chi-square.  14.1 Obtaining tables showing how many people gave each response: Frequencies  Probably  the  ﬁrst  question  you  ask  of  your  data  is:  how  many  people gave  each  alternative  response  to  a  particular  question?  The  answer  is obtained using the Frequencies command. If you want cross-tabulations, showing  how  many  people  with  a  particular  score  on  one  variable obtained a particular score on another variable, the procedure needed is Crosstabs described in section 14.4.  Obtain the frequencies procedure by selecting Analyze  Descriptive Statistics  Frequencies  The dialogue box shown in Figure 14.1 is presented. Select each variable to be analysed by clicking on its name, which will then be highlighted.   150  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  Then  click  in  the  button  marked  with  a  right-pointing  arrow,  and  the variable will appear in the right-hand box, the one headed Variable s .  Figure 14.1 The dialogue box for Frequencies  The  result  of  running  Frequencies  on  the  variable  sex  in  salesq  is shown in Figure 14.2. The ﬁrst table shows the number of valid cases and the number of cases in the data ﬁle where data on the variable sex was missing.  The  main  table  shows  the  frequency  of  each  score  on  the variable sex. In the data ﬁle salesq, the scores are 1 for male, 2 for female and  3  which  was  deﬁned  as  a  missing  value  and  represents  sex unknown.  In  the  output  table  the  scores  1  and  2  have  been  given  their value  labels  ‘male’  and  ‘female’.  The  frequencies  are  shown  as  percen- tages  in  the  Percent  column.  Valid  Percent  gives  the  percentages  when missing  values  are  excluded,  so  for  males  there  are  10  cases,  which  is 45.5% of 22  the total number of cases in the data ﬁle  but 47.6% of 21  the number of cases where sex is known . The Cum Percent column shows the cumulative percentages of the valid percent column.  To obtain the means or other statistics using Frequencies, request them by  clicking  on  the  button  labelled  Statistics. . .  at  the  bottom  left  of  the dialogue box shown in Figure 14.1, which reveals another dialogue box illustrated in chapter 7  Figure 7.6 .  14.2 Histograms, bar charts and piecharts showing distributions of scores  The Frequencies procedure provides histograms, bar charts and piecharts showing the distribution of the scores on any variable. These are useful   FREQUENCY DATA  151  Figure 14.2 Output from the Frequencies procedure  for seeing whether the distribution approximates a normal one, whether it is likely that some of the data has been miskeyed. Details on how to obtain these types of data plot are given in section 10.7.  14.3 How many times did a respondent give a particular answer? Count  Figure 14.3 The dialogue box for Count  You  may  wish  to  know  how  often  a  respondent  used  a  particular response category. For example, in salesq, how often did the respondents   152  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  use the response 3 on the attitude questions? This kind of question can be answered by using the Count procedure, obtained from the menu by selecting  Transform Count  Count creates a new variable, and the dialogue box shown in Figure 14.3 asks you to enter a name for this in the Target Variable text box. You then specify  the  variables  to  be  analysed,  and  click  on  the  Deﬁne  Values button,  which  opens  another  box,  shown  in  Figure  14.4,  in  which  you indicate the value or range of values to be counted. To count how many times the response 3 was given to att1, att2 and att3 in salesq, you would enter these variables into the Variables list in Figure 14.3, enter a name such as num3 for the Target variable, and put a label such as ‘Number of 3 responses on att questions’ in the Target Label text box. Click on Deﬁne Values, and in the Value text box shown in Figure 14.4 you would enter 3, click on the Add button, and then on Continue, which takes you back to  the  Count  Occurrences  box.  Clicking  on  Paste  puts  the  syntax  illus- trated in Figure 14.5 into a syntax window. When the procedure is run, the  new  variable  is  added  to  the  data  in  the  Data  Editor.  Switch  to  the data window to see the new variable.  It is possible to perform Count on speciﬁed cases, such as only those which  have  a  score  of  1  on  sex.  This  is  achieved  by  selecting  the  If. . . button,  and  entering  requirements  in  the  Count  Occurrences:  If  Cases dialogue  box.  Click  on  Include  if  Cases  Satisfy  Conditions:,  specify  the variable to be used to identify the cases  e.g. sex  and then indicate how the cases are to be identiﬁed by inserting the appropriate conditions  e.g. sex 5 1 . The way the If function operates is described in section 12.3.  14.4 Obtaining cross-tabulations  You  often  want  to  examine  how  scores  on  two   or  more   variables  are related; for example, in salesq, what is the relationship between sex and employer? This requires a two-dimensional table showing the number of people of each sex who are employed by each employer. Tables like this are obtained using Crosstabs, which is obtained by selecting  Analyze  Descriptive Statistics  Crosstabs  The  dialogue  box  shown  in  Figure  14.6  asks  you  to  enter  a  variable  to form the rows of the table and a variable to form the columns from the variable  list.  If  you  insert  more  than  one  variable  into  the  Row s   or   FREQUENCY DATA  153  Figure 14.4 The Count Values: Values to Count dialogue box  Figure 14.5 Example of the syntax for the Count procedure  Column s  boxes, you will obtain a set of cross-tabulations. An example of the output when a cross-tabulation of sex by employer was requested is shown in Figure 14.7.  Note  that  in  Figure  14.7,  the  total  shown  in  the  Case  Processing Summary is 21 and one missing observation is indicated; this is because the original data had one case where sex was coded as 3, which had been deﬁned  as  a  missing  value  indicating  the  sex  of  that  respondent  was unknown. Consequently there are only 21 cases that can be used in the sex by employer table.  The  contents  of  the  Crosstabs  table  are  set  by  clicking  on  the  Cells button  in  Figure  14.6,  which  opens  a  box  in  which  you  can  ask  for Expected frequencies, and for the observed frequencies to be expressed as  percentages  of  the  row,  column  and or  total  number  of  cases  in  the table.  Figure  14.8  shows  the  output  when  all  statistics  are  requested: there are the actual frequency of cases in each cell  Count , the expected value if there were no relationship between the two variables tabulated  Expected Count , the frequencies as a percentage of the total in the row, as  a  percentage  of  the  total  in  the  column,  and  as  percentage  of  the overall  total.  There  are  also  ﬁgures  for  Residual,  Std  Residual  and Adjusted Residual which are associated with the chi-square test and are   154  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  Figure 14.6 The dialogue box for Crosstabs  Figure 14.7 Output from the command Crosstabs Tables sex By empl   FREQUENCY DATA  155  unlikely to be needed.  Residual is the difference between the observed frequency and the expected frequency.   Figure 14.8 Output from the command Crosstabs Tables sex By empl with additional cell contents  You may want a further breakdown of the ﬁgures, with separate tables of  variable1  by  variable2  for  each  level  of  variable3;  for  example, suppose we want a sex by employer table, like that shown in Figure 14.7 but  for  each  area  group  separately.  The  variable  area  is  referred  to  as control variable, and you have to enter it in the box under the heading Layer  1  of  1  in  the  dialogue  box  shown  in  Figure  14.6.  You  can  have further control variables by clicking on the Next button.   156  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  If you wish to have the table organised in descending order of variable scores, or to obtain an index of the tables you are requesting, these can be set by using the Format button in the Crosstabs dialogue box.  14.5 Obtaining the two-sample chi-square test  The  chi-square  test  is  used  when  respondents  have  been  allocated  to categories on two variables  e.g. sex, area . The test compares the number of cases falling into each cell of the table with the frequency that would be expected if there were no association between the two variables that form the table.  The expected frequencies are calculated for each cell in the  table  by  multiplying  the  appropriate  row  and  column  totals  and dividing by N.   Chi-square  and  other  tests  of  association  such  as  the  contingency coefﬁcient, and also correlations are available from the Statistics button of the Crosstabs dialogue box  Figure 14.6 .  The output from the chi-square test for two samples is shown in Figure 14.9. The Cross-tabulation table shows the number of cases in each cell of the table. It is followed by the Chi-square Tests table showing the value of chi-square  labelled Pearson Chi-square , with the degrees of freedom  df  and the probability  Asymp. Sig. . If the Signiﬁcance value is equal to  or  less  than  0.05,  you  can  conclude  that  the  chi-square  test  indicates that  there  is  a  signiﬁcant  association  between  the  two  variables.  The output also gives you the ﬁgures for Likelihood Ratio chi-square and the Fisher Exact Test which should be used if more than 20% of cells have an expected frequency count of less than 5.  The number of cells having an expected frequency less than 5 is shown below the table.  The Linear-by- Linear  Association  tests  whether  there  is  a  linear  relationship  between the row and column variables. It is only applicable to ordinal data, and should not be used if the data is nominal.  The chi-square test is only valid if three conditions are met. First, the data must be independent: no respondent can appear in more than one cell of the table. Secondly, no cell should have an expected frequency of less  than  1.  The  footnote  under  the  Chi-square  Tests  table  tells  you  the minimum  expected  frequency,  so  it  is  simple  to  check  whether  this condition has been met. If the test is not valid, you must either alter the data  table  by  amalgamating  categories   using  the  Recode  procedure explained  in  section  12.6   to  remove  cells  with  small  expected  fre- quencies, or collect more data.  The  third  requirement  is  that  no  more  than  20%  of  the  Expected Frequencies in the table can be less than 5. So if you have a 2 3 5 table which has 10 cells, the test will be invalid if three expected frequencies are below 5. If your data fails to meet this criterion, you have to collect more  data  or  it  may  be  possible  to  change  the  table;  for  example  you could merge groups together.   FREQUENCY DATA  157  With a 2 3 2 table, there are two further points to bear in mind. For a 2 3 2 table, one should use the correction for continuity rather than the simple  chi-square:  you  will  see  that  there  is  a  Continuity  Correction value  shown  in  the  output  table,  and  this  rather  than  the  chi-square value should be used for this 2 3 2 table. Also, with a 2 3 2 table, if the smallest expected frequency for any cell is less than 5, then one should use the Fisher Exact Test. As Figure 14.9 illustrates, the result of this test is provided if it is needed, as it is in this case. The chi-square test is not valid on this table, as more than 20% of cells have an expected frequency smaller than 5; so you would use the Fisher Exact Test, and conclude that there is no relationship between sex and area of work.  Figure 14.9 Output from Crosstabs Tables sex By area Statistics Chisq   158  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  14.6 Loglinear analysis  Loglinear  analysis  is  a  technique  for  analysing  multiway  contingency tables  of  frequency  counts   cross  tabulations   which  are  more  complex than the two-dimensional tables shown in Figures 14.7, 14.8 and 14.9. It involves  transforming  the  frequency  values  into  their  natural  logs,  and has  the  beneﬁt  of  allowing  tests  for  interactions  in  the  classiﬁcations. Accounts can be found in texts on multivariate statistics such as Stevens  1996 . It is available from the Analyze  Loglinear drop-down menu.   15  WHAT IS THE AVERAGE SCORE? MEASURES OF  CENTRAL TENDENCY AND DISPERSION  Summary  c To  obtain  the  mean,  sum  and  standard  deviation  of  all  respondents on  any  of  the  variables  use  the  Analyze   Descriptive  Statistics  Explore, Frequencies or Descriptives procedures.  c To  obtain  the  means  of  subgroups  of  respondents  use  the  Analyze   Compare Means  Means procedure.  c To  obtain  the  median  or  mode  use  Analyze   Descriptive  Statistics   Frequencies.  c Obtain z scores using Analyze  Descriptive Statistics  Descriptives.  15.1 Finding the mean and standard deviation  Note  that  when  you  require  the  means  of  subgroups  of  respondents, such as the mean of males and then separately the mean of females, you need  the  Means  procedure   see  section  15.3 ,  which  also  provides  the mean score of all the respondents on any of the variables. But the simple way to obtain the mean, sum and standard deviation of all respondents on  any  of  the  variables  in  the  data  ﬁle,  is  to  use  the  Explore   which appears  in  the  syntax  ﬁle  as  Examine ,  Frequencies  or  Descriptives procedures which are accessed by selecting  Analyze  Descriptive Statistics  Specify the variables to be analysed by clicking on their names in the list and  then  on  the  button  with  the  right-pointing  arrow.  The  mean  and standard deviation are provided automatically. To obtain the sum, vari- ance,  range,  standard  error  and  indices  of  kurtosis  or  skew,  if  you  are using  Descriptives  select  the  Options  button  and  if  you  are  using Frequencies  select  the  Statistics  button.  Then  specify  the  statistics   160  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  required.  You  can  have  the  means  listed  in  alphabetical  order  of  the variable  names  if  you  use  Descriptives,  select  Options  and  in  the dialogue box which is then presented select Name display order.  When carrying out parametrical statistical tests, such as the t-test, the output will give the means and variances of the data, so there is no need to obtain them using a separate procedure.  15.2 Finding median or mode  The median and mode are obtained if you use  Analyze  Descriptive Statistics  Frequencies  When presented with the dialogue box, click on the Statistics button, and check the appropriate boxes.  The  median  is  also  provided  by  the  Explore  procedure,  described  in  chapter 9 or the Table procedure described in chapter 21.  15.3 Finding the means of subgroups of respondents  To  obtain  the  means  of  subgroups  of  respondents,  use  the  Means procedure, which is obtained by selecting  Analyze  Compare Means  Means  This reveals the dialogue box shown in Figure 15.1. Suppose you want the  mean  scores  of  males  and  females  on  the  sales_1  variable  in  the salesq data ﬁle. Having selected Analyze  Compare Means  Means from the  window  menu,  insert  the  dependent  variable   sales_1   in  the Dependent List text box of the Means dialogue box, and then insert sex into  the  Independent  List  text  box,  and  click  on  Paste.  The  output  is shown  in  Figure  15.2.  It  shows  the  mean  and  standard  deviation  on sales_1 for each of the two sex groups from the data ﬁle salesq. Observe that the respondent whose sex is unknown, who was given a sex score of 3  missing value , is not included in the table.  The Means dialogue box allows you to subdivide the respondents into further subgroups by using the unhelpfully-titled Layer 1 of 1 option. To ﬁnd the mean scores on the sales_1 variable of males and females from each  area   North  and  South ,  enter  sales_1  as  the  Dependent  List variable,  enter  sex  as  the  Independent  List  variable,  then  click  on  the                MEASURES OF CENTRAL TENDENCY AND DISPERSION  161  Figure 15.1 The Means dialogue box  Next button and insert area in the Independent List box.

Guidance  on  selecting  which  test  to  use  is  provided  in  section  2.9.  To compare  the  means  of  two  sets  of  scores,  use  the  t-test.  If  you  are comparing the scores of the same respondents on two variables, use the within-subjects   paired-samples   t-test.  To  compare  the  scores  of  two groups of different subjects on one variable, use the between-subjects or independent-samples  t-test.  To  compare  the  mean  of  a  sample  with  a speciﬁed  test  value,  use  the  one-sample  t-test.  If  you  wish  to  compare more  than  two  sets  of  scores,  you  need  the  analysis  of  variance  and should refer to section 16.5.  The  printouts  for  the  parametric  tests  show  two-tailed  signiﬁcance  probability   levels  which  are  appropriate  for  testing  non-directional hypotheses.  If  you  have  a  directional  hypothesis  you  can  halve  the probability  values  which  SPSS  prints  out.  For  example,  a  signiﬁcance   164  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  level  of  0.08  for  a  two-tailed   non-directional   test  equates  to  a  sig- niﬁcance level of 0.04 for a one-tailed  directional  test.  Except  for  section  16.12,  the  examples  shown  in  this  chapter  use  the names  of  the  variables  in  the  salesq  ﬁle;  if  you  are  applying  the commands  to  a  set  of  data  with  different  variable  names,  you  must  of course use those variable names.  16.2 Within-subjects  paired-samples  t-test  The dialogue box for the paired-samples t-test, shown in Figure 16.1, is obtained by selecting  Analyze  Compare Means  Paired-Samples T Test  Indicate the two variables to be compared by clicking on each of them; the  ﬁrst  one  will  appear  as  the  Current  Selections  Variable  1,  and  the second one will appear as Current Selections Variable 2. To insert these into  the  Paired  Variables  list,  click  on  the  right-pointing  arrow  button: the  two  variables  will  then  be  shown  as  a  linked  pair.  You  can  create further  pairs  in  the  same  way.  The  Options  button  of  the  T  Test  box allows  you  to  alter  the  conﬁdence  intervals  shown  in  the  output  by entering a number  such as 99 for the 99% interval  in the text box.  Figure 16.1 The dialogue box for the paired-samples t-test  Clicking  on  Paste  will  put  into  the  Syntax  window  the  procedure commands shown in Figure 16.2, where the scores on att1 and att2 have   PARAMETRIC STATISTICAL TESTS COMPARING MEANS  165  been  selected  for  comparison.  When  the  procedure  is  run,  the  output shown in Figure 16.2 appears in the output viewer. The ﬁrst table shows the means, standard deviations and standard errors of the scores on the two  variables.  The  second  table  shows  the  correlation  between  them  0.700  in  this  example .  The  signiﬁcance  of  the  correlation  is  provided: the value of .000 in Figure 16.2 indicates that the correlation is signiﬁcant beyond the 0.001 level.  The paired t-test involves taking the difference between the two scores for each respondent and ﬁnding the mean of these difference scores. The Paired  Samples  Test  table  in  the  output  gives  this  mean  difference,  its standard  deviation  and  standard  error  and  the  conﬁdence  intervals  of the difference. The value of the t statistic is then shown, with its degrees of freedom  df  and its probability level  Sig. 2-tail : if the probability is less  than  0.05   in  Figure  16.2  it  is  .004 ,  you  can  conclude  there  was  a statistically  signiﬁcant  difference  between  the  means  of  the  two  sets  of scores. In Figure 16.2, the mean on att2 at 3.0909 is signiﬁcantly different from the mean on att1, which is 2.5455.  Figure 16.2 Output from a paired-sample t-test  16.3 Between-subjects  independent-samples  t-test  The  dialogue  box  for  the  independent-samples  t-test,  shown  in  Figure 16.3, is obtained by selecting   166  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  Analyze  Compare Means  Independent Samples T Test  The  dependent  variables  to  be  compared  have  to  be  inserted  into  the Tests  Variable s   text  box.  The  independent   grouping   variable  used  to divide  the  respondents  into  the  two  groups  to  be  compared  has  to  be inserted into the Grouping Variable text box, and you then have to click the  Deﬁne  Groups  button,  which  opens  the  dialogue  box  shown  in Figure  16.4.  The  normal  procedure  is  to  enter  into  the  Group  1  and Group 2 windows the values on the grouping variable which deﬁne the two groups to be compared. For example, if you wanted to compare the scores  on  sales_1  for  respondents  of  employer  2  with  those  for  respon- dents  on  employer  3,  you  would  insert  the  variable   empl   in  the Grouping Variable box of the Independent Samples T Test dialogue box  Figure  16.3 .  Then  you  would  click  on  the  Deﬁne  Groups  button  and when  presented  with  the  Deﬁne  Groups  dialogue  box  shown  in  Figure 16.4, enter 2 into the Group 1 window and 3 into the Group 2 window. Click  on  Continue  to  return  to  the  T-Test  box,  and  click  on  Paste  to transfer the commands to the syntax window.  Figure 16.3 The dialogue box for the independent-samples t-test  An  example  of  the  syntax  for  the  independent  groups  t-test  and  the output  provided  is  shown  in  Figure  16.5.  The  Group  Statistics  table shows that the variable being tested was sales_1, and that the groups of   PARAMETRIC STATISTICAL TESTS COMPARING MEANS  167  Figure 16.4 The Deﬁne Groups dialogue box  scores being compared were those for the two employers Smith and Co and  Tomkins.   The  variable  labels  which  were  assigned  earlier  are printed.   The  mean  score  on  sales_1  for  each  group  is  shown,  with  the standard deviations and standard errors. The table entitled Independent Samples Test gives the outcome of Levene’s test for equality of variance, and then t values, degrees of freedom, two-tailed probability  Sig.  of t, mean  difference,  standard  errors  for  the  difference  and  95%  conﬁdence intervals for the difference. If the Levene test shows a Signiﬁcance  Sig.  level  less  than  0.05,  the  populations  from  which  the  two  groups  are samples  had  unequal  variances  and  you  should  use  the  t value  for unequal  variances   the  ﬁnal  line  of  the  table .  If  the  Levene  test  has  a probability value greater than 0.05  as here , you are entitled to use the t value  for  equal  variances.  Remember  that  it  is  the  absolute  value  of  t which  is  taken:  ignore  the  negative  sign.  You  do  not  need  a  table  of  t values,  as  the  printout  shows  the  signiﬁcance  value.  In  Figure  16.5  the signiﬁcance is shown as .000 indicating that the means differ at less than the 0.001 level.  F O R M I N G T W O G RO U P S A C C O R D I N G TO T H E I R S C O R E S O N A N I N D E P E N D E N T VA R I A B L E When  the  Deﬁne  Groups  dialogue  box   Figure  16.4   is  pre- sented, it has an option Cut Point, and a text window into which a value can be entered. This has the effect of dividing the cases into two groups, one  which  has  scores  below  the  value  entered  as  the  cut  point  and  the other having scores equal to or above the cut point. This can be useful if, for example, you wanted to compare the means of two groups formed by dividing them into those scoring below and above a certain value on one of the variables.  An example of the syntax and printout using the Cut Point facility is shown  in  Figure  16.6,  where  two  groups  were  formed  according  to whether they scored below 3 or above or equal to 3 on the variable att2 and their scores on the variable cust were compared. The Levene test was not signiﬁcant  Signiﬁcance 5 0.266 , so the t value for equal variances is the one to consider. In Figure 16.6, t 5 21.915 and p 5 .070 so there is no signiﬁcant difference between the two means.   168  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  Figure 16.5 Output for an independent t-test  Figure 16.6 Examples of use of Cut Point in the independent t-test  16.4 One-sample t-test  The  one-sample  t-test  is  used  to  compare  the  mean  of  a  sample  with  a speciﬁed  test  value.  For  example,  it  could  be  used  to  see  whether  the mean of the scores on the variable att1 is signiﬁcantly different from 3, the neutral point of the scale for att1 which ran from 1 to 5.   PARAMETRIC STATISTICAL TESTS COMPARING MEANS  169  Obtain  the  one-sample  t-test  by  selecting  it  from  the  Analyze  Compare Means menu. Select the variable to be tested and type into the text  box  the  test  value  with  which  the  mean  is  to  be  compared.  An example of the syntax and output is illustrated in Figure 16.7. In the One- Sample  Test  table,  the  test  value  is  shown  and  the  t-value  and  sig- niﬁcance  probability  are printed. Here, t 5 21.936, p 5 .066. As 0.066 is larger  than  0.05,  the  mean  on  att1   shown  in  the  One-Sample  Statistics table to be 2.5455  is not signiﬁcantly different from 3.  Figure 16.7  Syntax and output for the one-sample t-test  16.5 Dealing with cases that have missing data when using a t-test  The  t-test  procedures  will  exclude  any  case  which  has  missing  data  on either the variable used to create the groups being compared or on the variable  which  is  being  subjected  to  the  t-test.  This  is  referred  to  as Exclude Cases Analysis-by-Analysis. If you are requesting a number of t- tests  on  a  series  of  variables,  the  package  will  omit  those  cases  which have missing data on the variable being analysed and do this separately for each test. You can ask the program to omit, from all t-tests, any cases which have missing values on either the grouping variable or on any of the variables being t-tested. This is obtained by clicking on the Options button in the T Test dialogue box and then selecting the Exclude Cases Listwise alternative.   170  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  16.6 Basic principles of the analysis of variance  When you have three or more sets of parametric data, you may want to test the hypothesis that the means of the sets differ. You cannot use the t- test,  as  that  only  compares  two  sets,  so  the  parametric  analysis  of variance is the technique to employ.  As  the  name  implies,  analysis  of  variance  examines  the  variance within the whole sets of scores. Imagine we have sets of data from three separate  groups  of  subjects,  and  want  to  know  whether  there  is  a difference between the three groups. If there were no difference between the groups  the null hypothesis is true  their data would all come from the same population, and the three sets of data would all have the same means and the same variances. The variance of each group would be an estimate of the population variance  variance due to random ﬂuctuations between  respondents,  known  as  error  variance  because  it  arises  due  to chance  alterations  in  the  data .  Our  best  estimate  of  the  population variance  is  given  by  calculating  the  mean  of  the  variances  of  the  three groups. So by looking at the average variance of the three groups, we can get an estimate of the error variance.  Again, if the null hypothesis is true, the means of the three groups will be  the  same,  and  the  variance  of  the  means   i.e.  how  much  the  means differ from each other  will be very small.  We would expect it to be the same as the population variance.  The variance of the means of the three groups is known as the treatment variance. So if the null hypothesis were true,  and  the  three  groups  did  not  differ  from  each  other,  the  variance between  the  means   the  treatment  variance   would  equal  the  error variance; if we divided the treatment variance by the error variance, the answer would be 1.00. The result of dividing the treatment variance by the error variance is denoted as F.  If the null hypothesis is not true, there is a difference between the three groups. The variance of the means will be larger than the error variance. If  we  divide  the  variance  of  the  means   the  treatment  variance   by  the error variance, we shall get a number  F  bigger than 1.00.  In  the  analysis  of  variance,  we  compare  the  treatment  variance  with the  error  variance  to  test  the  hypothesis  that  there  is  a  signiﬁcant difference  between  the  means.  There  are  different  types  of  analysis  of variance,  and  you  need  to  ensure  you  apply  the  procedure  which  is appropriate  for  the  situation  you  are  analysing.  When  you  want  to compare three or more levels of one between-subjects variable, use a one- way  analysis  of  variance.  But  analysis  of  variance  can  be  extended  to situations  in  which  there  are  two  or  more  independent  variables.  Ima- gine  we  have  measured  the  performance  of  young   under  30   and  old  over  50   subjects  at  two  different  times  of  day   2 am  and  2 pm ,  and used different subjects in each group so there were four separate groups altogether.  We  might  be  interested  in  knowing  whether  performance differed according to the subject’s age, differed according to time of day,   PARAMETRIC STATISTICAL TESTS COMPARING MEANS  171  and  whether  there  was  an  interaction  between  these  variables.  Inter- action means that the effect of one variable was inﬂuenced by the other; for example, we might ﬁnd that the difference between performance at 2 pm and 2 am was less for the younger subjects than for the older ones. If  this  were  so,  the  analysis  of  variance  would  show  a  signiﬁcant interaction term.  In  the  example  just  given,  both  variables  are  between-subjects,  as different  people  were  used  in  each  of  the  four  groups.  But  analysis  of variance  can  be  applied  to  within-subjects   repeated  measures   studies, where  the  same  subjects  are  used  in  different  conditions.  For  example, we  would  have  a  repeated  measures  study  if  we  had  carried  out  our time-of-day age  of  subjects  experiment,  and  tested  the  same  respon- dents at 2 am and 2 pm.  F I X E D A N D R A N D O M FA C TO R S When you are asking SPSS to carry out analysis  of  variance,  you  will  usually  be  asked  to  indicate  whether  the independent variables or factors are ﬁxed or random ones. If the levels of the  independent  variable  are  taken  to  be  a  random  sample  of  possible levels,  then  the  variable  is  a  random  factor.  But  if  the  levels  of  the independent  variable  are  not  taken  to  be  a  random  sample  of  possible levels,  the  variable  is  a  ﬁxed  factor. An  example  might  make  this  clear. Imagine  you  were  comparing  the  two  sexes  in  an  analysis  of  variance. The  possible  levels  on  the  variable  sex,  male  and  female,  cannot  be thought  of  as  a  random  sample  from  a  whole  series  of  other  possible levels, so sex would be a ﬁxed factor. But if you had respondents from different employers, as we do in the dataﬁle salesq, you might want to take the employers who were included in the study as a random sample from all the other employers who could have been included, so that you could  generalize  any  results  and  say  they  were  not  true  only  for  the employers studied but would also be true for any other random sample of  employers.  Then  employers  would  be  a  random  factor.  Or  suppose you had investigated people’s memory for short and long words, using words of 6, 8 and 14 letters. You might want to generalize the results to other possible word lengths which could have been used, in which case word length would be a random factor.  If a factor called vname has been identiﬁed as a random factor, rather  than a ﬁxed one, the syntax includes the subcommand   RANDOM = vname  and  some  of  the  output  numbers  differ  since  the  calculations  of  error terms for random factors are different from those used for ﬁxed factors.  A P R I O R I A N D P O S T H O C T E S T S Analysis  of  variance  can  tell  you  that there  is  a  difference  between  the  means  of  the  three  or  more  groups  of respondents, but it does not tell you just where the differences occur: is   172  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  group  1  different  from  both  group  2  and  group  3,  does  group  2  differ from  both  group  1  and  group  3?  Questions  like  this  are  answered  by comparing  the  means  of  the  subgroups,  and  there  are  two  types  of procedure. One is referred to as a priori comparisons, and these are ones that were planned before the data was collected: you might, for example, have  predicted  that  group  3  differs  signiﬁcantly  from  group  1  but  not from  group  2.  Post  hoc  tests,  on  the  other  hand,  are  comparisons suggested after you have examined the data.  A priori contrasts, including orthogonal contrasts, can be obtained by clicking the Contrasts. . . button in the dialogue box presented when you are requesting an analysis of variance. How to use this is best explained with  a  simple  example.  Suppose  we  are  using  a  one-way  analysis  of variance  to  compare  the  scores  on  sales_1  for  the  three  employers  in salesq,  and  had  predicted  that  there  would  be  a  signiﬁcant  difference between the scores for employer 1 and the combined scores for employ- ers  2  and  3.  To  test  this  prediction  we  would  use  linear  contrasts:  the coefﬁcient for employer 1’s data can be set at 21 and the coefﬁcients for employers 2 and 3 each set to 0.5. When the Contrasts button has been pressed,  the  coefﬁcient  of  21  for  group  1  is  entered  in  the  box  marked Coefﬁcient,  and  the  Add  button  used  to  insert  it  into  the  list.  The coefﬁcient  of  0.5  for  group  2  is  then  entered  in  the  Coefﬁcient  box  and Add used to insert it in the list, and ﬁnally the coefﬁcient for group 3 is inserted in the list by using the Add button. The order of the coefﬁcients is  crucial,  as  they  are  applied  in  sequence  to  the  ascending  order  of values on the factor variable: the ﬁrst coefﬁcient is assigned to the lowest value, the second to the next-to-lowest value and so on. Coefﬁcients can be  removed  or  altered  by  highlighting  them  and  using  the  Remove  or Change buttons. Further sets of contrasts can be entered if you click on the  Next  button.  An  example  of  the  output  obtained  when  a  priori contrasts were requested in a one-way analysis of variance is shown in Figure 16.11.  Post  hoc  tests  such  as  Duncan’s  test,  Tukey’s  test,  Scheffe’s  test   and others   are  obtained  if  you  click  on  the  Post  Hoc. . .  button  in  the dialogue box for requesting analysis of variance. Select the tests required from  the  list  provided  in  the  dialogue  box  which  is  presented.  Figure 16.10 shows how the output of the Tukey test is presented in a one-way analysis of variance.  E TA - S Q U A R E D This  statistic  is  a  measure  of  the  strength  of  the  experi- mental effect, indicating the proportion of the variance accounted for by the experimental variable or factor. It can be obtained from the dialogue boxes  used  in  requesting  analysis  of  variance,  by  pressing  the  Options button  to  reveal  a  screen  such  as  that  shown  in  Figure  16.13,  and checking the Estimates of Effect Size entry. It is added to the analysis of variance output, usually as a separate column of the ANOVA table.   PARAMETRIC STATISTICAL TESTS COMPARING MEANS  173  T E S T O F S P H E R I C I T Y The output from an analysis of variance will often include a test of sphericity, which shows whether there is heterogeneity of covariance. Advanced textbooks on statistics such as Howell  1992  or Stevens   1996   discuss  the  meaning  of  sphericity,  but  non-experts  can take  comfort  from  Stevens   1996 :  ‘There  are  various  tests  of  sphericity .  .  .  we  don’t  recommend  using  these  tests’   p. 460 .  Nevertheless,  a simpliﬁed explanation may be useful. One test of sphericity is Mauchly’s test. The values of the Greenhouse–Geisser epsilon and the Huynh–Feldt epsilon  are  also  indications  of  whether  the  data  shows  sphericity:  if sphericity  is  met,  the  Greenhouse–Geisser  epsilon  equals  1.  The  worst possible  violation  gives  epsilon  5 1  k21 .  If  the  test  of  sphericity  is signiﬁcant,  then  some  adjustment  to  the  degrees  of  freedom  used  in calculating  the  mean  square  can  be  made.  There  are  different  recom- mendations about the adjustment which should be applied and how to use  the  Greenhouse–Geisser  epsilon  to  modify  the  degrees  of  freedom. Stevens  1996  says that one should adjust the degrees of freedom from  k21   and   k21  n21   by  multiplying  each  of  these  by  epsilon,  which will reduce the degrees of freedom and mean that a higher value of F is needed  before  it  is  taken  as  statistically  signiﬁcant.  In  the  output,  SPSS gives  the  epsilon  values  and  in  the  familiar  analysis  of  variance  table shows  the  degrees  of  freedom,  mean  squares  and  values  of  F which occur if they are used.

Which analysis of variance you need is determined by the design of your study.  For  most  situations,  there  are  two  points  you  need  to  know:   1  how many independent variables were there  one or more than one ?  2  taking  each  independent  variable  in  turn,  was  it  a  between-subjects  independent samples  variable or a within-subjects  repeated measures  one? If you have more than one independent variable and all variables are between subjects, you need SPSS’s UNIANOVA procedure. If any of the  independent  variables  is  within  subjects   repeated  measures ,  you need SPSS’s GLM procedure.  In some cases, you may have two or more dependent variables to be analysed  together.  In  such  cases,  you  require  the  MANOVA  procedure which is described in section 16.14. Table 16.1 will help you decide which type of ANOVA you need.   174  1  1  2 or more  2 or more  2 or more  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  Table 16.1 Deciding between the various types of analysis of variance  How many independent variables?*  Between or within  subjects?

SPSS has three separate procedures for calculating the analysis of variance: Oneway, UNIANOVA and GLM. If you have one independ- ent  between-subjects  variable,  Oneway  or  UNIANOVA  can  be  used.  If you  have  two  or  more  independent  between-subjects  variables,  use UNIANOVA.  If  any  of  the  variables  is  within-subjects,  you  need  GLM. For each procedure, dialogue boxes are used to tell the program which are the dependent variables and how any subgroups of respondents are identiﬁed.  When  necessary  the  system  will  present  dialogue  boxes  so you can tell it which variables are within subjects and which are between subjects.  Note that in the analysis of variance summary tables which appear in the output, the column headed Sig shows the probability of getting the observed F value by chance. If the entry is .0000, this means the ﬁnding is signiﬁcant beyond the 0.0001  0.01%  level.  16.9 One independent variable, between-subjects  This form of analysis of variance can be obtained in three ways. If you use the Means procedure described in section 15.3, one-way analysis of variance  ANOVA  can be requested via the Options button and select- ing ANOVA Table and Eta  section 16.9.1 . Alternatively, you can request Oneway from the Analyze  Compare Means menu entry  section 16.9.2 . A one-way analysis of variance  UNIANOVA  is also available from the Analyze   General  Linear  Model  entry   section  16.9.3 .  Oneway  and UNIANOVA are basically the same and give similar output.   PARAMETRIC STATISTICAL TESTS COMPARING MEANS  175  16.9.1 One-way analysis of variance from Means  The  Means  procedure  is  described  in  chapter  15.  One-way  analysis  of variance to compare the means of subgroups is obtained by selecting  Analyze  Compare Means  Then  press  the  Options  button  from  Figure  15.1  and  check  the  box labelled  ANOVA  Table  and  Eta.  So  if  you  have  used  sales_1  as  the dependent  variable  and  empl   employer   as  the  independent  variable, selecting the Options button and requesting the ANOVA Table and Eta will  give  a  one-way  analysis  of  variance  on  the  sales_1  scores  of  the subgroups  of  the  employer  variable.  The  output  is  illustrated  in  Figure 16.8.  The  Report  shows  the  mean  and  standard  deviation  for  each employer group and then there is an analysis of variance summary table. Here F is 6.838, which is signiﬁcant  p 5 0.006 , so there is a signiﬁcant difference  between  the  groups  on  the  sales_1  scores.  The  ﬁnal  table shows  the  value  of  eta  and  eta-squared.  Part  of  the  output  shown  in Figure  16.8  is  expressed  in  scientiﬁc  notation:  if  you  are  unsure  about this, see section 4.5.  One-way  analysis  of  variance  obtained  from  the  Analyze   Compare Means  menu  will  exclude  any  case  which  has  a  missing  value  on  the dependent or on the factor variables. If you are requesting a number of analyses, you can ask for any case that has missing values on any of the variables  involved  to  be  excluded  from  all  analyses.  This  is  done  by clicking  on  the  Options  button  of  the  dialogue  box  and  selecting  the Exclude Cases Listwise option.  16.9.2 One-way analysis of variance using Oneway  Select from the menu system  Analyze  Compare Means  One-way ANOVA  The dialogue box shown in Figure 16.9 will be presented.  Suppose  you  want  to  compare  the  scores  on  sales_1  for  respondents from  the  three  different  employers  in  the  ﬁle  salesq.  This  involves  the one-way  analysis  of  variance  and  can  be  achieved  by  following  the stages listed here:  1  Identify the dependent variable. In this example, the variable sales_1 is the  dependent  variable.  Click  on  its  name  and  then  on  the  right- pointing  arrow  button  so  that  sales_1  appears  in  the  box  headed Dependent List.   176  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  Figure 16.8 Output of analysis of variance obtained from the Means procedure  Figure 16.9 The dialogue box for Oneway   PARAMETRIC STATISTICAL TESTS COMPARING MEANS  177  2  Identify the variable  Factor  which distinguishes the subgroups of respon- dents. In the example, this is the variable empl, the variable name for employer. Click on its name in the variable list and then click on the right-arrow button next to the box headed Factor. The variable name will then appear as the Factor.  3 Request the means of the subgroups. If you want the output to show you the means on the dependent variable  sales_1 in this example  for the various  levels  of  the  independent  variable,  click  on  the  Options button; yet another dialogue box is revealed, and you select Descrip- tive.  A  plot  of  the  means  can  also  be  requested.  When  you  have ﬁnished with the Options window, click on Continue, to be returned to Figure 16.9.  4 Request any a priori tests by pressing the Contrasts button and any post hoc tests by pressing the Post Hoc button and completing the dialogue boxes revealed.  Figure  16.10  shows  the  output  of  the  Oneway  procedure,  in  which  the scores  on  the  variable  sales_1  were  compared  for  the  three  employers, and descriptive statistics were requested. A plot of the means was asked for  and  a  Tukey  post  hoc  test  was  speciﬁed.  The  ﬁrst  table  shows  the descriptive  statistics,  and  this  is  followed  by  the  conventional ANOVA summary table, showing the Sum of Squares, degrees of freedom, Mean Square,  F ratio  and  signiﬁcance   Sig.   of  F for  the  between-groups variable. The F ratio is the between-groups mean square divided by the within-groups mean square. The probability associated with F is given in the  ﬁnal  column:  if  it  is  less  than  0.05   in  Figure  16.10  it  is  .006 ,  this shows  there  is  a  signiﬁcant  difference  between  the  groups  being  com- pared. In our example, it indicates that there was a signiﬁcant difference between the employers in the sales_1 scores. Remember that if the entry is .0000, this means the ﬁnding is signiﬁcant beyond the 0.0001  0.01%  level.  The  additional  output  obtained  by  including  the  subcommand  POSTHOC  5 TUKEY  is  given  in  the  Multiple  Comparisons  table  of Figure 16.10. The ﬁrst part of this table indicates that the Jones and Son group  does  not  differ  signiﬁcantly  from  the  Smith  and  Co  group:  the mean difference between the two groups is 708.06 and the signiﬁcance is shown  as  0.731.  It  also  shows  that  the  Jones  and  Son  group  is  sig- niﬁcantly  different  from  the  Tomkins  group:  the  mean  difference  is 22874.1837 and the signiﬁcance is 0.026. The other lines of the table can be  read  in  a  similar  way:  the  Smith  and  Co  group  differs  signiﬁcantly from  the  Tomkins  group;  the  Tomkins  group  differs  signiﬁcantly  from both the Jones and Son group and the Smith and Co group.  The section of the output entitled Homogeneous Subsets lists in each column the subset of means which do not differ from each other. In this example, the Smith and Co and the Jones and Son groups do not differ,   178  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  and  so  are  listed  in  one  column;  both  of  these  differ  from  the  Tomkins group, so that is listed in a separate column.  The  plot  of  the  means  in  Figure  16.10  was  obtained  by  making  the appropriate  selection  from  the  window  which  is  presented  when  the Options button of Figure 16.9 is pressed.  In Figure 16.11, Oneway was run with a priori contrasts requested. The Contrast Coefﬁcients table shows that coefﬁcients were set at 21, 0.5 and 0.5.  The  Contrast  Tests  printout  shows  that  the  t probability   Sig.   was greater than 0.05, so you would conclude that the Jones and Son group is not signiﬁcantly different from the pooled value of the other two groups. If you look at the means of the three subgroups included in Figure 16.10, you will see that a more sensible comparison would be to compare the Tomkins  group   mean  5 8207.415   with  the  pooled  mean  of  the  other two groups  means 5 5333.2313 and 4625.1713 . You might like to carry out this analysis to conﬁrm that you understand how it is done.  16.9.3 One-way analysis of variance using the General Linear Model menu  Select from the menu system  Analyze  General Linear Model  Univariate  A dialogue box will appear  Figure 16.12 . Suppose you want to compare the scores on sales_1 for respondents from the three different employers in the ﬁle salesq. This involves the one-way analysis of variance and can be achieved by following the stages listed here:  1  2  Identify  the  dependent  variable.  You  have  to  tell  SPSS  which  is  the dependent variable by clicking on its name  sales_1 in this example  and  then  on  the  right  arrow  button  so  that  it  appears  in  the  box headed Dependent Variable. Identify  the  variable  that  distinguishes  the  groups  you  are  comparing  Factor .  In  this  example,  this  is  called  empl,  for  employer.  Click  on empl and then either on the right arrow next to the box headed Fixed Factor s   or  on  the  right  arrow  next  to  the  box  headed  Random Factor s .  The  variable  name  will  appear  in  the  appropriate  box.  If you need reminding about the distinction between ﬁxed and random factors, refer to section 16.6. For the data being used here, employer is not being taken as a random sample from all possible employers, so empl would be a ﬁxed factor.  3 Request the means of the subgroups. To obtain the mean scores of each of the  subgroups  of  respondents   each  level  on  the  Factor ,  click  on Options in Figure 16.12. Another box is shown, reproduced in Figure 16.13, in which you can request Descriptive Statistics and a number of other measures including eta-squared  Estimate of effect size .

As  the  command  included  the  subcommand   PRINT  5 DESCRIPTIVE, the Descriptive Statistics table is provided, showing the means, standard deviations and n for each subgroup and for the total set of scores.   182  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  Figure 16.13 The dialogue box for Univariate Options. Note that Descriptive Statistics and Homogeneity Tests have been requested  The analysis of variance table Tests of Between-Subjects Effects is then given.  Here,  F for  the  empl  variable  is  6.838,  and  the  signiﬁcance  is shown as .006.  Figure  16.10  and  Figure  16.14  show  the  outputs  for  analyses  of  the same  set  of  data.  There  are  slight  differences  in  their  layout:  using Oneway  Figure 16.10  gives a less cluttered appearance as fewer details are shown than when UNIANOVA is used  Figure 16.14 .  16.10 One independent variable, within-subjects  When  you  have  one  independent  within-subjects  variable  with  more than two levels and want to compare the scores on the levels, the GLM  Repeated Measures procedure is needed. For an example of one inde- pendent  within-subjects  variable,  suppose  that  we  had  carried  out  a study  involving  the  effects  of  different  types  of  praise  on  employees’   PARAMETRIC STATISTICAL TESTS COMPARING MEANS  183  Figure 16.14  Syntax and output for the GLM Univariate UNIANOVA  attitude to their employer. We might, perhaps, have given no praise for one  week,  irregular  praise  for  one  week  and  regular  praise  for  another week. These three conditions are levels of an independent variable. If we arranged  all  participants  to  experience  all  three  conditions,  we  would have a within-subjects variable. Although the data in the data ﬁle salesq is  not  really  like  this,  we  can  use  the  scores  on  the  three  attitude statements   att1,  att2  and  att3   to  illustrate  how  to  analyse  a  single, within-subjects variable with more than two levels.   DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  To  obtain  the  repeated-measures  ANOVA  select  from  the  menu  sys-  184  tem  Analyze  General Linear Model  Repeated Measures  This presents the dialogue box shown in Figure 16.15.  Figure 16.15 The dialogue box for GLM Model Repeated Measures  2  1 Name  the  within-subject  factor.  The  within-subject  factor  is  initially labelled factor1, and you need to enter a more meaningful title for it. In  our  example,  the  factor  is  made  up  from  the  three  scores  on measures of attitude  att1, att2 and att3 , so we can label the within- subjects variable attitude by typing it in to replace the name factor1. Identify the number of levels of the within-subjects factor. You need to type the  appropriate  number  into  the  Number  of  Levels  box:  in  this example  there  are  three  levels.  Only  when  you  have  inserted  the number  of  levels  can  you  click  on  the Add  button,  and  the  untitled box will have inserted into it the factor name and number of levels; here it is attitude 3 . Identify  the  variables  which  make  up  the  within-subject  factor.  You  still have to tell SPSS which are the variables in the data which make up the factor. To do this, ensure the factor name in the list is highlighted and  click  on  the  Deﬁne  button:  the  Repeated  Measures  ANOVA dialogue box shown in Figure 16.16 will be revealed. Select the data variables  in this example they are att1, att2 and att3  by clicking on them and then on the right-arrow button. They will then be added to the box headed Within-Subjects Variables.  3  4 Request  a  table  of  means  and  a  graph  of  estimated  marginal  means.  To obtain  a  table  showing  the  mean  scores  on  each  variable  use  the   PARAMETRIC STATISTICAL TESTS COMPARING MEANS  185  Options button of Figure 16.16 to open a dialogue box similar to that shown  in  Figure  16.13.  Check  the  Descriptive  Statistics  option.  Eta- squared is obtained if you check the Estimates of Effect Size option. If you want the printout to show the estimated marginal means for the different levels of the between-subjects factor, click on the names of  the  variable  or  variables  listed  under  Factors s   and  Factor  Inter- actions: and then on the arrow button so the variable names appear in the  Display  Means  For  list.  If  you  ask  for  the  estimated  marginal means, the syntax will include the subcommands   EMEANS TABLES variablename   where  variablename  is  the  name  of  the  variables  speciﬁed.  The printout  will  show  the  estimated  means  of  the  subgroups  after  the ANOVA summary tables, as shown in Figure 16.19.  To obtain a graph of the estimated marginal means, press the Plots button  of  Figure  16.16  and  request  the  graph  by  completing  the Proﬁle  Plots  dialogue  box  then  revealed  and  pressing  the  Add button.  5 Request any a priori tests by pressing the Contrasts button and any post  hoc  tests  by  pressing  the  Post  Hoc  button  and  completing  the dialogue boxes revealed.  The syntax and output for this analysis is shown in Figure 16.17, when descriptive statistics and a graph of marginal means were requested.  The  ﬁrst  section  of  the  output  in  Figure  16.17  shows  that  the  factor Attitude was made up of the variables att1, att2 and att3. The Descriptive Statistics  table  provides  the  means  and  standard  deviations  on  each variable,  and  this  is  followed  by  the  Multivariate  Tests  section  which shows the results of multivariate tests  Pillais, Wilks’, etc.   which can be ignored as they are only relevant when there are a number of dependent variables .  The  table  for  the  Mauchly  Test  of  Sphericity  follows,  and  in this example shows a highly signiﬁcant value.  The main part of the output, the Tests of Within-Subjects Effects table, is  a  conventional  ANOVA  table.  In  Figure  16.17  it  shows  that,  with sphericity assumed, the Mean Square for the variable attitude was 4.197, F was  2.831  and  the  probability   Sig.   was  0.070.  Adjusted  values  are given  for  the  various  corrections  one  can  make  because  the  sphericity test  was  signiﬁcant;  they  involve  adjusting  the  degrees  of  freedom,  so that  the  same  F values   shown  in  the  column  headed  F   have  different signiﬁcance levels. As the signiﬁcance here is in all cases larger than 0.05, there  was  no  signiﬁcant  difference  between  the  scores  for  the  different levels  of  the  variable  i.e.  the  scores  on  att1,  att2  and  att3  do  not  differ signiﬁcantly.  The Test of Within-Subject Contrasts and the Test of Between-Subjects Effects  can  be  ignored.

Suppose that for the  data  in  salesq  we  wanted  to  see  whether  there  is  a  difference  on sales_2  for  people  from  different  areas  and  of  different  sexes,  and whether there is an interaction between these two factors. Is it the case, for example, that men sold more than women in the North but women sold more than men in the South?

If  you  ask  for  the  estimated  marginal means, the syntax will include the subcommands   EMEANS TABLES variablename   where  variablename  is  the  name  of  the  variables  speciﬁed.  The printout  will  show  the  estimated  means  of  the  subgroups  after  the ANOVA summary tables, as shown in Figure 16.19.  To  obtain  a  graph  of  the  estimated  marginal  means,  use  the  Plots button  of  Figure  16.12  and  request  the  plot  from  the  window  then revealed.  4 Request any a priori tests by pressing the Contrasts button and any post  hoc  tests  by  pressing  the  Post  Hoc  button  and  completing  the dialogue boxes revealed.  The  syntax  and  output  for  this  two-way  analysis  of  variance  with independent groups, where means and a graph were requested, is shown in  Figure  16.18.  The  ﬁrst  table  shows  the  variables  being  analysed  and their value labels. The Descriptive Statistics table is the result of includ- ing  PRINT 5 DESCRIPTIVE in the command. It gives the mean scores on  the  dependent  variable  for  all  subsets  of  respondents  together  with the number of respondents in each subgroup.  The  table  Tests  of  Between-Subjects  Effects  shows  the  ANOVA  table listing  the  sources  of  variation,  divided  into  main  effects  and  inter- actions,  and  for  each  one  there  is  the  sum  of  squares,  the  degrees  of freedom,  the  Mean  Square   the  sum  of  squares  divided  by  the  degrees   190  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  of freedom , the value of F and the probability of F  Sig. . If any value in this ﬁnal column is smaller than .05, there is an effect signiﬁcant at the 0.05  5%  level. The F value for sex is .917 and the probability is .352, so there is no overall difference between the two sexes. F for the area factor is  3.040  and  the  probability  is  .099  which  means  there  was  no  overall difference  between  the  two  areas.  The  interaction  between  the  two factors, Sex * Area, has F 5 4.612 and has a probability of .046. So the area 3 sex interaction is signiﬁcant at the 0.05 level. To see what this means, look at the mean scores of the four area sex subgroups. For area 1, males  sex 5 1  sold less  6115.15  than females  sex 5 2  who sold 7362.41. But for  area  2,  the  men  sold  6538.56  and  the  women  sold  3283.35.  So  the difference  between  the  sexes  differs  according  to  which  area  one examines.  The  graph  included  in  Figure  16.18  was  obtained  by  using  the  Plots button  of  Figure  16.16.  It  demonstrates  the  interaction  between  the  sex and area variables, since the lines are not parallel. Note that the graph is of the estimated marginal means; to obtain a plot of the actual means, see section 10.6.  16.12 Two  or more  independent variables, with at least one between-subjects and at least one within-subjects  mixed design   In the data set salesq, we have two ﬁgures  sales_1 and sales_2  showing amount  sold  by  each  respondent,  and  data  on  the  respondents’  sex. Suppose  we  varied  the  amount  of  commission  the  people  received  so that  in  one  situation  they  received  1%  and  in  the  other  situation  they received  2%  commission,  and  that  the  amounts  in  sales_1  and  sales_2 indicate  their  sales  under  these  two  conditions.  So  there  is  one  within- subjects independent variable  amount sold  which has two levels  sales_ 1  and  sales_2 ,  and  one  between-subjects  variable   sex .  Suppose  we want to know whether there is a difference between sales_1 and sales_2 and whether any difference that there is varies according to the respon- dent’s sex. To answer the question, we need to use the GLM procedure.  To obtain the mixed ANOVA, from the menu system select  Analyze  General Linear Model  Repeated Measures  You will be presented with the GLM Repeated Measures  Deﬁne Factors dialogue box  Figure 16.15 .  1 Deﬁne  the  within-subjects  factor.

To  do  this,  click  on  the  variable  name   amsold 2   in  this example  and then on the Deﬁne button of the dialogue box shown in Figure 16.15, which will lead to the screen showing the GLM Repeated Measures dialogue box illustrated in Figure 16.16. Select the data vari- ables  sales_1, sales_2  by clicking on them and then on the right-arrow button. These variable names will be inserted into the Within-Subjects Variables  list  as  the  different  levels  of  the  within-subjects  factor.  Do not  press  Paste  yet:  you  still  have  to  deﬁne  the  between-subjects factor!  3 Deﬁne  the  between-subjects  factor.  While  you  are  faced  with  the Repeated Measures ANOVA dialogue box  Figure 16.16 , click on the name of the between-subjects variable  in the example we are describ- ing, it will be sex , and then on the right-pointing arrow next to the box headed Between-Subjects Factor s . The variable will be inserted into that list.  4 Request the means of the subgroups. To obtain the means for the different levels  of  the  between-subjects  factor,  click  on  the  Options  button  of the  GLM  Repeated  Measures  box   Figure  16.16 ,  to  open  a  window              PARAMETRIC STATISTICAL TESTS COMPARING MEANS  193  similar  to  Figure  16.13.  Select  the  Descriptive  Statistics  option.  Eta- squared is obtained if you check the Estimates of Effect Size option. If you want the printout to show the estimated marginal means for the different levels of the between-subjects factor, click on the names of  the  variable  or  variables  listed  under  Factors s   and  Factor  Inter- actions: and then on the arrow button so the variable names appear in the  Display  Means  For  list.  If  you  ask  for  the  estimated  marginal means, the syntax will include the subcommands   EMEANS TABLES variablename   where  variablename  is  the  name  of  the  variables  speciﬁed.  The printout  will  show  the  estimated  means  of  the  subgroups  after  the ANOVA summary tables.  A graph of the estimated marginal means is obtained by pressing the Plots button of Figure 16.16. In the window then shown, specify the  variable  for  the  horizontal  axis,  the  variable  for  Separate  Lines and  then  press  the  Add  button.  Note  that  the  graph  is  of  the estimated marginal means.  5 Request any a priori tests by pressing the Contrasts button and any post  hoc  tests  by  pressing  the  Post  Hoc  button  and  completing  the dialogue boxes revealed.  The syntax and output for this mixed ANOVA analysis with the request for  the  descriptive  statistics  of  the  subgroups  is  shown  in  Figure  16.19. Note  that  in  the  syntax  the  subcommand   WSFACTORS  is  included when a within-subjects variable has been identiﬁed.  The  ﬁrst  table  shows  the  variables  making  up  the  within-subjects factor  Measure_1,  and  the  second  one  identiﬁes  the  between-subjects factor.  The  Descriptive  Statistics  table  gives  the  means  and  standard deviations on each level of the within-subjects factor for each level of the between-subjects factor.  The Multivariate Tests table can be ignored as it is only relevant when there  are  a  number  of  dependent  variables.  The  table  for  the  Mauchly Test of Sphericity follows; it can be ignored in this analysis since it does not  apply  with  only  two  levels  of  the  independent  variable.   You  will notice  that  no  signiﬁcance  level  is  indicated,  and  that  the  values  in  the table of Within Subjects Effects are the same for the rows with Sphericity Assumed and for the other rows such as Greenhouse–Geisser.   The  analysis  of  variance  output  is  in  separate  sections.  In  the  table headed  Tests  of  Within-Subject  Effects,  the  line  Sphericity  Assumed shows that comparing the levels of amsold  the within-subjects variable  gave  F 5 0.319,  Signiﬁcance  5 0.579  showing  no  signiﬁcant  difference between  the  levels  of  amsold  i.e.  between  sales_1  and  sales_2.  The interaction between the two variables  amsold * sex  gave F 5 2.427, p 5   194  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  0.136. So for this data there is also no signiﬁcant interaction between the two  variables  of  amount  sold  and  sex.  The  table  headed  Tests  of Between-Subjects Effects compares the means for the different levels on the between-subjects variable  sex, in this example : here F 5 0.267, p 5 0.611 so there is no overall difference between the sexes on the amount sold.  When  there  are  two  or  more  variables  being  analysed  and  any signiﬁcant  F is obtained, it often helps to gain an understanding of the data if the means of the subsets of scores are plotted on a graph. A plot of the estimated marginal means can be obtained by using the Plots button in Figure 16.16. Specify the variable for the horizontal axis, the variable for  Separate  Lines  and  then  press  the  Add  button  and  the  Continue button.  Continued on facing page   PARAMETRIC STATISTICAL TESTS COMPARING MEANS  195  Figure 16.19 variable and one between-subjects variable  Syntax and output for analysis of variance with one within-subjects   196  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  16.13 Two  or more  independent variables, all within-subjects  repeated measures   To explain this analysis, we shall have a rest from the salesq data ﬁle and use  a  separate  example.  An  investigator  studied  people’s  ability  to recognize faces in upright and inverted orientation, and when the faces were  shown  in  black-and-white   b w   or  colour.  There  were  two  inde- pendent variables, orientation and colour, both with two levels  upright or inverted; b w or colour  so there were four conditions: upright b w, inverted  b w,  upright  colour,  inverted  colour.  The  researcher  used  one group  of  respondents;  everyone  took  part  in  all  of  the  four  conditions. Both independent variables are within-subjects, as each person saw both levels of every variable. So the two-way analysis of variance for repeated measures is needed.  The  data,  and  the  order  in  which  it  should  be  entered  into  SPSS,  is  shown in Table 16.2.  Table 16.2 Data from an experiment on facial recognition  Subject  INVBW  INVCOL  UPBW  UPCOL  1.00 2.00 3.00 4.00 5.00 6.00 7.00 8.00 9.00 10.00  1.25 1.82 1.59 1.73 1.72 1.49 1.03 1.35 1.47 1.02  2.33 2.56 2.69 3.01 2.87 3.23 3.78 3.22 3.21 3.26  1.67 1.48 1.58 1.63 1.88 1.22 0.94 1.21 1.20 1.02  2.18 2.04 2.58 2.21 2.73 3.20 3.71 3.15 3.40 3.11  When entering the data into SPSS for a within-subjects factorial design, it is vital that the order of columns is correct: all the subconditions at one level of one variable occur before the subconditions at the second level of that  variable.  In  Table  16.2,  the  ﬁrst  two  columns  both  refer  to  the Inverted  condition,  one  with  black-and-white  faces  and  the  other  with colour. Then the data for the Upright condition is given, again with two columns since there has to be one for black-and-white and one for colour. You will also see that the order of the two levels of the colour condition is  consistent:  for  both  Inverted  and  Upright  faces,  they  are  in  the  same order  BW followed by COL .  To  obtain  the  repeated-measures ANOVA,  select  from  the  menu  sys-  tem  Analyze  General Linear Model  Repeated Measures  This presents the dialogue box shown in Figure 16.15.   1  2  PARAMETRIC STATISTICAL TESTS COMPARING MEANS  197  Identify the within-subjects factors. The within-subjects factor is initially labelled factor1, and you need to enter a more meaningful title for it. In  the  faces  experiment,  the  variables  were  position   upright  or inverted   and  colour   b w  or  colour .  You  need  to  give  these  vari- ables  names,  which  should  be  different  from  those  used  as  variable names  column headings  in the data ﬁle. We shall call them downup and  colour.  So  when  presented  with  Figure  16.15,  type  in  the  name downup  so  that  it  replaces  factor1  in  the  box  and  enter  the  appro- priate number in the Number of Levels box. In the experiment, there were two levels of downup, so enter 2. Then click on the Add button, and  the  untitled  box  will  have  inserted  into  it  the  factor  name  and number of levels; here it is downup 2 .  The second within-subjects factor is deﬁned in a similar way. Type the  name   in  this  example  it  is  colour   into  the  box  where  factor names  appear,  the  number  of  levels  into  the  appropriate  box,  and then click on Add. The factor list then reads:  downup 2  colour 2   Identify  the  variables  which  make  up  the  within-subjects  factors. You  still have to tell SPSS which are the variables  columns  in the data which make  up  the  factors.  Click  on  one  of  the  factor  names   downup 2   and  then  on  the  Deﬁne  button.  You  will  be  presented  with  the Repeated Measures ANOVA dialogue box shown in Figure 16.20. The variables from the data ﬁle are listed on the left-hand side. You have to select the data variables so that they are matched correctly with the names and levels of the within-subject variables.  In this example, the ﬁrst factor, which appears in the brackets after the  Within-Subjects  Variables  title  is  downup;  the  second  factor  is colour. You will see that there are entries in the central box: __?__[1,1] etc. The ﬁrst of these has to be paired with the ﬁrst level on downup and  the  ﬁrst  level  on  colour,  i.e.  the  variable  INVBW:  click  on  this name  in  the  variable  list  and  then  on  the  right-pointing  arrow.  The second entry in the within-subjects variable list, __?__[1,2] has to be paired with the data variable corresponding to the ﬁrst level on the ﬁrst  factor   downup   and  the  second  level  on  the  second  factor  colour :  the  INVCOL  data.  The  third  entry  is  paired  with  second level on the ﬁrst factor  downup is the factor and the second level is UP  and the ﬁrst level on the second factor  colour is the factor and the level is BW  so the variable needed is UPBW. The fourth entry is paired with the second level of the ﬁrst factor and the second level of the second factor: the variable UPCOL.  This  is  a  little  confusing,  but  it  is  vital  to  appreciate  that  the  ﬁrst level  of  the  ﬁrst  factor  is  entered  ﬁrst,  with  the  levels  of  the  second factor entered sequentially. Then the second level of the ﬁrst factor is   198  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  Figure 16.20 The dialogue box for GLM Repeated Measures for two within- subjects variables  downup, colour   entered with the levels of the second factor entered sequentially. So if you have two factors, A and B, with three levels of A  A1, A2 and A3  and  two  levels  of  B   B1  and  B2 ,  the  ﬁnal  sequence  which  has  to appear in the Within Subjects Variables list is: A1 B1; A1 B2; A2 B1; A2 B2; A3 B1; A3 B2.  3 Request the means of the subgroups. To obtain the means for the different levels  of  the  between-subjects  factor,  click  on  the  Options  button  of the  GLM  Repeated  Measures  box   Figure  16.20 ,  to  open  a  window similar  to  Figure  16.13.  Select  the  Descriptive  Statistics  option.  This will give in the output the means etc. for each column of the data set of Table 16.2. It is worth running this procedure, if only to check that you have completed Figure 16.20 correctly! Eta-squared is obtained if you check the Estimates of Effect Size option.  If you want the printout to show the estimated marginal means for the different levels of the between-subjects factor, click on the names of  the  variable  or  variables  listed  under  Factors s   and  Factor  Inter- actions: and then on the arrow button so the variable names appear in the  Display  Means  For  list.  If  you  ask  for  the  estimated  marginal means, the syntax will include the subcommands   PARAMETRIC STATISTICAL TESTS COMPARING MEANS  199   EMEANS TABLES variablename   where  variablename  is  the  name  of  the  variables  speciﬁed.  The printout  will  show  the  estimated  means  of  the  subgroups  after  the ANOVA summary tables.  To obtain a plot of the means of the various conditions, choose the Plots  button  from  Figure  16.20.  A  dialogue  box  will  be  revealed  in which  you  specify  which  factor  to  use  for  the  horizontal  axis  and which to use for separate lines on the graph.  4 Request  any  a  priori  or  post  hoc  tests  by  pressing  the  Contrasts  or  Post Hoc buttons and completing the dialogue box revealed.  The syntax and output for this analysis is shown in Figure 16.21. The ﬁrst table shows how the dependent variables have been allocated to the within-subject  factors,  and  is  followed  by  the  Descriptive  Statistics table.  The  table  for  the  Mauchly  Test  of  Sphericity  follows,  and  in  this example  shows  a  highly  signiﬁcant  value.  The  Multivariate  Tests  table shows  the  results  of  multivariate  tests   Pillais,  Wilks’  etc. ;  it  can  be ignored  as  it  is  only  relevant  when  there  are  a  number  of  dependent variables.  It  is  followed  by  the  table  for  Mauchly’s  Test  of  Sphericity, which  can  also  be  ignored;  such  tests  are  of  questionable  value,  as explained in section 16.6.  The  main  part  of  the  output  is  the  table  Tests  of  Within-Subjects Effects. This shows that the test of the DOWNUP effect has F 5 4.627, p 5 0.060;  the  COLOUR  effect  has  F 5 45.10  and  p is  0.000  while  the interaction of the two variables has F 5 1.200 and p is 0.302. So in this set of data, only colour has a signiﬁcant effect. The effect of orientation is not signiﬁcant  p 5 0.06  . 0.05 . The full output includes tables of Tests of Within-Subjects  Contrasts  and  Tests  of  Between-Subjects  Effects,  but these can be ignored.  16.14 Analysing two or more dependent variables together: MANOVA  Multivariate  analysis   MANOVA   is  used  when  you  have  a  number  of dependent  variables  to  be  analysed  together.  Tabachnick  and  Fidell  1996   give  an  example  in  which  a  researcher  studies  the  effects  of different  types  of  treatment  on  anxiety,  and  measures  three  kinds  of anxiety:  test  anxiety,  minor  life  stress  anxiety  and  free-ﬂoating  anxiety. Each participant is given one of the types of treatment and assessed on all  three  kinds  of  anxiety,  so  they  each  yield  three  scores.  MANOVA  is used to determine whether a combination of the three anxiety measures varies  according  to  the  treatment  the  participant  received.  ‘MANOVA tests whether mean differences among groups on a combination of DVs   200  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS   dependent variables  are likely to have occurred by chance’  Tabachnick and Fidell, 1996: 375 .  In  the  data  ﬁle  salesq,  there  are  three  measures  of  attitude  for  each respondent  and  these  can  be  used  to  illustrate  how  the  MANOVA procedure operates. Suppose we want to compare the two sexes on their responses  to  the  three  attitude  measures,  and  are  taking  the  three measures as indicative of three types of attitude in a similar way to the three kinds of anxiety mentioned in the previous paragraph.

For  this  example,  the  three  attitude responses were entered as Dependent Variables, and sex was entered as a Fixed Factor.   202  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  The  outcome  of  this  analysis  is  shown  in  Figure  16.22.  The  Multi- variate Tests table indicates that there is a signiﬁcant difference between the  two  sexes   F  5 3.541,  p 5 0.037 .  Note  that  this  difference  is  on  a combination  of  the  three  attitude  measures.  In  the  Tests  of  Between- Subjects  table,  the  scores  of  the  two  sexes  are  compared  on  each  of  the three attitude measures. On none of them is there a signiﬁcant difference:  Figure 16.22 with three dependent variables  Syntax and excerpt of output for multivariate analysis of variance   PARAMETRIC STATISTICAL TESTS COMPARING MEANS  203  on att1, F 5 0.074, p 5 0.789; on att2, F 5 0.556, p 5 0.465 and on att3 F 5 2.488, p 5 0.131. This appears rather odd: how can there be an overall difference between the sexes, but no difference between them on each of the  three  attitude  measures  taken  individually?  Remember  that  the Multivariate  Test  is  on  a  combination  of  the  three  separate  scores calculated so as to maximize the probability of distinguishing the groups  sexes in this example . ‘In MANOVA, a new DV that maximizes group differences  is  created  from  the  set  of  DVs.  The  new  DV  is  a  linear combination of measured DVs, combined so as to separate the groups as much as possible’  Tabachnick and Fidell, 1996: 375 .   17  CORRELATIONS AND MULTIPLE REGRESSION  Summary  c When  calculating  correlations,  always  plot  the  two  variables  in  a scattergram using Graph  Scatter to see whether there is evidence of a curvilinear relationship.  c Obtain  the  mean  and  standard  deviations  of  the  variables  being correlated  from  the  Options  button  of  the  Bivariate  Correlations dialogue box.  c Partial correlation allows you to examine the correlation between two variables when the effect of a third variable has been partialled out. c Multiple  regression  uses  a  number  of  independent  variables  to predict  the  dependent  variable.  The  Enter  method  forces  all  the predictor  variables  to  be  included  in  the  analysis.  The  Stepwise method is more often used.  17.1 The concept of correlation  A correlation expresses the extent to which two variables vary together. A  positive  correlation  means  that  as  one  variable  increases  so  does  the other. For example, there is a strong positive correlation between size of foot and height, and a weak positive correlation between how much one is  paid  and  one’s  job  satisfaction.  A  negative  correlation  is  when  one variable increases as the other decreases; for example, there is a negative correlation between job satisfaction and absenteeism: the more satisﬁed people  are  with  their  job,  the  lower  the  amount  of  absenteeism  they show.  Correlations  vary  between  21.00  and  11.00;  a  correlation  of  0.00 means there is no relationship between the two variables. For example, one would expect the correlation between size of foot and job satisfaction to  be  about  0.00   although  I  have  never  seen  any  data  on  this  relation- ship! .   CORRELATIONS AND MULTIPLE REGRESSION  205  If two variables have both been measured on an interval scale, use the Pearson  product  moment  correlation  coefﬁcient.  When  data  is  ordinal, use the Spearman Rank  rho  correlation coefﬁcient.  Whichever coefﬁcient is chosen, you should always plot a scattergram of the relationship between the two variables to check that the relation- ship can be reasonably assumed to be linear. Simple correlations indicate how  far  there  is  a  linear  relationship  between  the  two  variables.  In  a curvilinear  relationship,  low  scores  on  x are  associated  with  low  scores on y, medium scores on x are associated with high scores on y and high scores on x are associated with low scores on y. This relationship would not  appear  in  a  correlation  coefﬁcient,  which  would  have  a  low  value  about  0 ,  but  will  be  revealed  if  the  two  sets  of  data  are  plotted graphically.  When you have a scattergram it is possible to draw-in the best-ﬁtting straight line that represents the relationship between x and y. The best- ﬁtting line is known as the regression line and it can be expressed as an equation  of  the  form  x 5 c 1 by,  where  c is  the  intercept  and  b the slope.  The  correlation  coefﬁcient  squared   r2   indicates  how  much  of  the variance  in  y is  explained  by  x.  So  if  x correlates  with  y 0.6,  then  0.36  36%  of the variance in y is explained by the variance in x.  Always bear in mind the aphorism ‘Correlation does not equal causa- tion’: if variables A and B are correlated, one cannot say that A causes B. It could  be  that  B causes  A, or they may both be related to some other factor that produces the variation in A and B. Some examples: absentee- ism  and  job  satisfaction  are  negatively  correlated,  but  one  cannot  con- clude  that  low  job  satisfaction  causes  absenteeism;  it  is  possible  that being absent a lot causes the feelings of low job satisfaction. The positive correlation  between  foot  size  and  height  does  not  mean  that  having  a large foot makes you grow; foot size and overall height are both caused by  a  common  genetic  factor.  However,  correlations  are  used  to  predict one variable from another. Knowing someone’s foot size, one can predict better  how  tall  they  are  than  one  could  if  you  did  not  know  their  foot size.  Partial correlation is used when the correlation between two variables may  arise  because  both  are  correlated  with  a  third  variable.  Partial correlation  is  a  technique  which  allows  you  to  examine  the  correlation between  two  variables  when  the  effect  of  the  third  variable  has  been partialled out.  Multiple  regression  refers  to  using  more  than  one  variable  to  predict the dependent variable. Job satisfaction is correlated with pay and with level of occupation. So one can predict job satisfaction from pay and one can predict it from job level; but one may get a better prediction if one uses both pay and job level as predictors. So one would have an equation of the form:   206  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  job satisfaction 5 pay  multiplied by a  1 level of job  multiplied by b .  Each  predictor  variable  is  multiplied  by  a  weighting,  reﬂecting  its importance  in  determining  the  dependent,  or  predicted,  variable.  The weighting  is  known  as  the  regression  coefﬁcient  for  that  variable.  In multiple  regression  analysis,  one  investigates  which  variables  add  to one’s  ability  to  predict  the  dependent  variable,  and  the  weighting  they should have.  To get a scattergram between two variables, select from the menu  17.2 Obtaining a scattergram  Graphs  Scatter  The option Simple will be the default offered, so click the Deﬁne button, which opens a dialogue box in which you can specify which variable is to be on the Y axis and which on the X axis. Pressing the Titles button allows you to give a title to the graph. An example of the syntax and the scattergram it produces in the Output Viewer are shown in Figure 17.1.  Scattergram of att1 versus att2  1 T T A  6  5  4  3  2  1  0  1.5  2.0  2.5  3.0  4.0  4.5  5.0  5.5  3.5 ATT2  Figure 17.1 Example of a scattergram and the syntax for obtaining it  You can separate the plots for subgroups of respondents: for example, one could plot att1 versus att2 for all the respondents in salesq, but have the data for females indicated by a different marker from those used to   CORRELATIONS AND MULTIPLE REGRESSION  207  plot males’ data. This is achieved by entering sex as the variable in the Set Markers By text box.

You can ask for the correlation between all possible pairings of three or more variables simply by inserting all the variables into the Variables list.  SPSS indicates the actual signiﬁcance levels in the output. You can also ask  it  to  show  whether  a  correlation  is  signiﬁcant  by  printing  asterisks with the signiﬁcance ﬁgures: * indicates signiﬁcant at the 0.05 level, and ** signiﬁcant at the 0.01 level. To obtain these asterisks, ensure the Flag Signiﬁcant Correlations box in the Bivariate Correlations dialogue box is checked. The signiﬁcance of a correlation is by default presented in the output  using  a  non-directional   two-tailed   probability.  If  you  have predicted  in  advance  the  direction  of  the  relationship  between  the variables,  you  are  entitled  to  use  a  directional   one-tailed   probability, and this can be requested in the Bivariate Correlations dialogue box.  Requesting Pearson correlations yields the output illustrated in Figure 17.4, where the correlations between scores on sales_1, sales_2, att1, att2 and att3 in the salesq ﬁle were requested. In Figure 17.4, the correlation between sales_2 and att2 is 2.310  Do not forget the minus sign indicates a negative correlation.  If the Sig  signiﬁcance  value is less than .05, the correlation is statistically signiﬁcant.  The  Correlations  procedure  will  exclude  any  case  which  has  missing data  on  either  of  the  variables  being  correlated.  This  is  referred  to  as Exclude Cases Pairwise. If you are requesting a number of correlations, with  three  or  more  variables  entered  in  the  Variables  list,  you  can  ask SPSS to exclude from all the analyses any case that has a missing value   CORRELATIONS AND MULTIPLE REGRESSION  209  on any of the variables: this is Exclude Cases Listwise, and is available via the Options button of the Bivariate Correlations dialogue box.  Figure 17.4 Output from the correlation procedure showing Pearson correlation coefﬁcients  Spearman rank correlations are displayed as shown in Figure 17.5. The correlation  coefﬁcient  is  shown   .684  in  Figure  17.5 ,  followed  by  the signiﬁcance level  .000 in Figure 17.5  and ﬁnally the number of cases, N. If  the  Sig   signiﬁcance   value  is  less  than  .05,  the  correlation  is  statis- tically signiﬁcant.

Partial correlation is a technique which allows  you  to  examine  the  correlation  between  two  variables  when  the effect  of  other  variable s   has  been  partialled  out.  Partial  correlation analysis is obtained from the menu  Analyze  Correlate  Partial  Enter into the Variables list the two variables to be correlated, and into the  Controlling  For:  list  the  control  variables,  the  ones  whose  inﬂuence on the correlation between the two variables is to be partialled out.  To obtain the means and standard deviations on each variable, and or a  matrix  showing  the  zero-order  correlations  between  all  the  variables, request  them  via  the  Options  button.   A  zero-order  correlation  is  the usual  correlation,  with  no  partialling  out  for  the  effects  of  a  control variable.   Figure  17.6  illustrates  the  output  from  the  Partial  Correlations  proce- dure.  In  this  example,  the  correlation  between  sales_1  and  att2  was examined, with number of customers visited  cust  as the control varia- ble. Be careful in reading this old-style table: the correlation between the variables shown in a column and a row is shown where the column and row intersect. In Figure 17.6, the correlation is 2.1062.  Do not forget the negative sign!  The degrees of freedom used in the calculation are shown in brackets below the correlation  19  and the probability value is given last as p 5. In Figure 17.6 p 5 .647, which indicates the correlation is not signiﬁcant. Do not make the common mistake of taking the p value as the correlation value!   CORRELATIONS AND MULTIPLE REGRESSION  211  Previously in Figure 17.4, the correlation between sales_1 and att2 was found  to  be  negative  and  signiﬁcant  at  2.437.  But  now,  in  Figure  17.6, after the effect of customer visits has been partialled out, the correlation is  only  2.1062.  This  suggests  that  the  original  correlation  value  was spurious,  and  arose  because  att2  correlates  with  customers  visited  and sales_1 and customers visited are also highly correlated.  The correlation is .727.  Once the effects of customers visited are removed by the partial correlation  procedure,  the  low  correlation  between  att2  and  sales_1  is revealed.  Figure 17.6 Output from the partial correlation procedure  17.6 Multiple regression  In  multiple  regression,  you  use  a  number  of  independent  variables  to predict  the  dependent  variable.  For  example,  you  can  predict  sales_1 from  cust   number  of  customers  visited ,  since  the  correlation  between these  two  variables  is  0.727,  signiﬁcant  at  the  0.001  level.  But  will  the prediction be better if you also consider the person’s response to the att1, att2  and  att3  questions?  It  is  with  this  type  of  problem  that  multiple regression is concerned.  Multiple regression is obtained by selecting Analyze  Regression Linear  This  opens  the  Linear  Regression  dialogue  box  shown  in  Figure  17.7. Enter  the  dependent  variable  in  the  Dependent  box,  and  the  predictor   212  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  variables in the Independent box using the normal procedure of clicking on  the  variables  in  the  source  list  and  then  on  the  appropriate  arrow button.  You  can  specify  the  regression  method  to  be  used  from  Enter,  Step- wise,  Forward,  Backward  and  Remove.  Stepwise  is  probably  the  most frequently used method, although Enter is the default and enters all the variables in one step. Forward enters variables one at a time depending on  whether  they  meet  statistical  criteria,  Backward  enters  all  the  vari- ables  and  then  removes  them  one  at  a  time  depending  on  a  removal criterion,  while  Stepwise  which  is  a  combination  of  forward  and  back- ward procedures examines each variable for entry or removal. Remove means that variables in a block are removed in one step. It is possible to specify  one  method  for  one  block  of  variables  and  another  method  for another block; to do this, you have to create a second block of predictor variables  by  clicking  on  the  Next  button  and  then  enter  the  predictor variables  for  this  set.  To  move  between  the  blocks  of  variables,  use  the Previous and Next buttons.  The  Options  button  permits  you  to  alter  the  criteria  used  when  the stepwise, forward or backward methods are used, by inserting your own values for F or for the probability of F. You can also force the suppression of a constant term in the regression equation, by deselecting the Include Constant in Equation option.  Figure  17.8  illustrates  the  output  from  multiple  regression  when sales_1 was the dependent variable, cust, att1, att2 and att3 were used as predictor  independent  variables, and the Enter method was chosen.  Various statistics can be requested from the Statistics button of Figure 17.7.  When  it  is  clicked,  a  dialogue  box  is  revealed  allowing  various options  to  be  requested.  If  you  select  Descriptives,  the  output  will include  the  means  and  standard  deviations  of  the  variables  being  ana- lysed as well as a correlation matrix, as shown in Figure 17.8.  The Plots button will allow you to obtain a scatterplot of the depend- ent  variable   Dependent  in  the  source  variable  list   with  standardized predicted  values  or  one  of  a  number  of  other  predicted  or  residual variables which are calculated by the Regression procedure. These newly calculated variables can be saved from the Save button and its associated dialogue box.  The WLS button in the Linear Regression dialogue box allows you to  obtain a weighted least-squares model.  The  program  will  exclude  from  the  analysis  any  case  that  has  a missing value on any of the variables being analysed; this is referred to as  Exclude  Cases  Listwise.  You  can  have  any  missing  values  replaced with the mean of the scores on that variable, or you can ask the program to calculate correlations for all cases which have no missing value for the two  variables  being  correlated   Exclude  Cases  Pairwise .  These  alter- native  treatments  for  missing  values  are  obtained  from  the  Options button of the Linear Regression dialogue box.   CORRELATIONS AND MULTIPLE REGRESSION  213  Figure 17.7 The Linear Regression dialogue box  The  ﬁrst  part  of  the  output  shown  in  Figure  17.8  shows  means  and standard deviations of the variables included in the analysis, and this is followed  by  the  correlations  between  them,  all  with  one-tailed  sig- niﬁcance levels. In the table Variables Entered Removed, the dependent variable is identiﬁed as sales_1, and the multiple regression method used is shown as ‘Enter’.  The  Model  Summary  table  gives  the  multiple  r  R  5 .734  in  Figure 17.8  which is the correlation between the predictor variables combined and  the  dependent  variable.  R  Square  indicates  the  proportion  of  the variability  in  the  dependent  variable  which  is  accounted  for  by  the multiple regression equation. The ﬁgure labelled Adjusted R Square is an estimate of r2 for the population  rather than the sample from which the data was obtained , and includes a correction for shrinkage.  The analysis of variance  ANOVA  table shown in Figure 17.8 shows the  sum  of  squares  explained  by  the  regression  equation  and  the ‘residual’ sum of squares. The residual sum of squares is the variability in  the  dependent  variable  which  is  left  unexplained  by  the  regression equation. The F statistic  4.953 in Figure 17.8  is obtained by dividing the Mean Square regression by the Mean Square residual. If F is signiﬁcant  the  probability  value  labelled  Sig  is  less  than  0.05 ,  one  can  conclude that  r2 is  signiﬁcantly  different  from  zero.  This  means  that  one  can assume  there  is  a  linear  relationship  between  the  predictor  and  the   214  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  dependent  variables  and  that  the  regression  equation  allows  you  to predict the dependent variable at greater than chance level.  The  ﬁnal  table  is  entitled  Coefﬁcients.  The  ﬁrst  row,  labelled   Con- stant , refers to the intercept of the regression line. The t value indicates whether it is signiﬁcantly different from zero.  The remainder of the Coefﬁcients table lists the predictor variables and some statistics associated with each one. B is the regression coefﬁcient for the variable. In the present example, we have a regression equation like this:  sales_1 5 cust w1  1 att1 w2  1 att2 w3  1 att3 w4   The values of w1, w2, etc. are regression coefﬁcients, but these B values do  not  show  how  important  each  predictor  variable  is.  The  relative  Continued on facing page   CORRELATIONS AND MULTIPLE REGRESSION  215  Figure 17.8 Output from Regression with the Enter method  importance  is  shown  when  the  B  values  have  been  transformed  into standard scores, when they are referred to as beta. These are included in the  printout  and  indicate  that  cust   with  beta  5 .689   has  much  more inﬂuence on the dependent variable, sales_1, than do att1, att2 or att3. It is worth remembering that the beta coefﬁcients obtained depend on the independent  variables  which  have  been  used  in  the  analysis,  and  have no absolute value.   216  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  The  ﬁnal  columns  of  the  Coefﬁcients  table  show  t values  and  their probabilities  Sig. . These indicate whether the regression coefﬁcients for each variable are greater than zero. In Figure 17.8, the t values for att1, att2  and  att3  are  not  signiﬁcant,  so  one  would  conclude  that  these variables do not add to the ability to predict sales_1. The t value for cust is signiﬁcant  p 5 .002 , so this does predict sales_1.  Some idea of the way that the multiple regression method affects the output  can  be  seen  by  comparing  Figure  17.8  with  Figure  17.9,  which shows  the  output  of  analysing  the  same  variables  as  in  Figure  17.8  but  Continued on facing page   CORRELATIONS AND MULTIPLE REGRESSION  217  Figure 17.9 Output from Regression with the Stepwise method  using  the  Stepwise  method  rather  than  Enter.  The  Variables  Entered  Removed  table  shows  that  the  variable  Customer  visits   cust   was entered into the regression equation at step 1. The Model Summary table, ANOVA table and Coefﬁcients table are read in a similar way to those in Figure 17.8 except that here only the predictor variable Customer visits has been entered in the regression equation. Those variables not entered are  listed  in  the  Excluded  Variables  table,  with  the  beta  values  they would  have  if  they  were  entered.  The  non-signiﬁcant  t values  shown indicate that none of the variables would add to the predictive power of the  equation,  and  so  the  process  terminates  without  adding  them  in. Stepwise  produces  output  which  is  simpler  to  interpret  than  Enter.  In this example, the two methods produce very similar outcomes: only cust, of the four variables included, predicts sales_1.   18  ANALYSING NOMINAL AND ORDINAL DATA  Summary  c Use non-parametric tests with nominal or rank data, skewed data, or  if the groups show unequal variance.  c The  chi-square  test  for  independent  samples  is  obtained  from  the Analyze  Descriptive Statistics  Crosstabs procedure, not from Non- parametric Tests.  c Rank correlation is obtained from Analyze  Correlation. c All  other  non-parametric   tests  are  obtained   from  Analyze   Nonparametric Tests.  18.1 Non-parametric analyses  Non-parametric  tests  are  used  when  the  data  does  not  lend  itself  to parametric  statistical  analysis  because  it  is  nominal  or  rank  data,  or  is skewed,  or  the  groups  show  unequal  variance.  In  this  chapter  only  the more  commonly  used  ones  are  considered,  but  others  will  be  found  in the same menu as those described here.  It  is  important  to  distinguish  between  dealing  with  nominal   fre- quency   data  and  dealing  with  ordinal  data.  If  you  have  counted  the number of cases or people who appear in certain categories, the data is nominal and the chi-square test, the binomial test or the McNemar test are  appropriate.  If  the  data  has  been  measured  on  an  ordinal  scale  or consists of ranks, there are a number of tests which allow you to compare the  sets  of  rankings.  Section  2.9  gives  guidance  on  deciding  which analysis to use.  18.2 Obtaining the non-parametric tests  The  chi-square  test  for  independent  samples  is  used  when  you  have  a table showing the number of people categorized according to independ- ent variables, such as the number of people who are male and come from   ANALYSING NOMINAL AND ORDINAL DATA  219  the North, who are female from the North, who are male from the South or  are  female  from  the  South.  If  the  data  forms  a  table  like  this,  with different  people  appearing  in  each  of  the  possible  categories,  then  the SPSS procedure needed is Crosstabs with the subcommand for obtaining the  chi-square  for  independent  samples.  The  procedure  is  described  in sections 14.4 and 14.5.  All other non-parametric tests except rank correlation  see section 17.3   are obtained from the menu  Analyze  Nonparametric Tests  which offers the options listed below.  c Chi-square.  Note  that  this  is  the  one-sample  chi-square.  The  more common chi-square for testing the association between two categor- ical  variables  is  found  under  Analyze   Descriptive  Statistics  Crosstabs, as described in sections 14.4 and 14.5.  c Binomial.  The  binomial  test  is  used  when  the  data  forms  two  cate- gories   such  as  male  and  female ,  and  compares  the  observed  fre- quency  of  cases  in  each  category  with  the  frequency  expected  from the binomial distribution.  c Runs. The Runs test examines whether a sequence of two alternative  values is in a random order.  c 1 sample K–S. K–S stands for Kolmogorov–Smirnov. The test is used to determine  whether  a  sample  set  of  scores  comes  from  a  speciﬁed distribution such as normal or uniform.  c 2  Independent  samples.  The  dialogue  box  revealed  by  selecting  this reactions,  entry  offers  Kolmogorov–Smirnov two sample and Wald–Wolfowitz runs tests.  the  Mann–Whitney,  Moses  extreme   c K Independent samples. This has the Kruskal–Wallis and median tests. c 2  Related  samples.  This  includes  the  Wilcoxon,  sign  and  McNemar  tests.  c K Related samples. This provides the Friedman and Cochran’s Q tests, and  Kendall’s  W  the  coefﬁcient  of  concordance   which  is  used  to measure the relation among three or more sets of rankings. It can be seen as a measure of rank correlation but with three or more sets of data  rather  than  just  two.  Unlike  the  correlation  coefﬁcient,  W can only vary between 0 and 1.  Each set of tests has its own dialogue box in which the particular test is selected  and  the  variables  to  be  analysed  are  speciﬁed  in  the  conven- tional  manner  of  highlighting  the  variable  name  in  the  source  list  and clicking on the arrow button. Not all the tests available will be described here, as once you are familiar with the way the system operates and how to  use  the  Help  facility,  there  should  be  little  difﬁculty  in  making appropriate decisions for specifying the test required.   220  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  The  various  tests  allow  you  to  obtain  the  mean,  standard  deviation, lowest  and  highest  scores  and  number  of  cases  for  the  variables  being analysed, by selecting the Options button and then, in the Statistics area of the dialogue box that appears, selecting Descriptive.  M I S S I N G VA L U E S I N N O N PA R A M E T R I C T E S T S The Options button of the dialogue  box  for  each  test  allows  you  to  specify  how  missing  values should  be  treated.  The  default  is  Exclude  Cases  Test-by-Test,  which means that where you have requested a number of tests to be done, as each  test  is  carried  out,  any  cases  that  have  missing  values  on  the variable  being  analysed  are  excluded.  The  alternative  is  Exclude  Cases Listwise:  if  this  is  selected,  cases  with  a  missing  value  on  any  of  the variables  inserted  into  the  Test  Variable  List  box  are  excluded  from  all analyses.  18.3 One-sample chi-square  Do not confuse this with the two-sample chi-square, obtained from the Crosstabs  procedure!  The  one-sample  chi-square  test  is  used  to  test  a hypothesis  such  as  ‘Suicide  rate  varies  signiﬁcantly  from  month  to month’.  If  the  hypothesis  is  false,  the  suicide  rate  will  be  the  same  for every one of the twelve months. The one-sample chi-square can be used to  compare  observed  suicide  rates  per  month  with  what  would  be expected if the rate were equal for all months.  SPSS  will  assume  that  you  are  comparing  the  observed  distribution with  an  expected  distribution  in  which  the  cases  are  spread  equally across  the  categories.  This  can  be  altered,  using  the  Values  area  in  the Expected  Values  part  of  the  dialogue  box.  So  you  can  compare  the observed distribution of suicides with that expected if January had twice as many suicides as August, and all other months had an equal rate mid- way between the January and August ones. The way to achieve this is to enter a value for each category in the Values text box and click on Add. You  must  enter  the  values  in  the  order  corresponding  to  the  ascending order of the categories for the variable being tested.  To run this test, select  Analyze  Nonparametric Tests  Chi-square  This opens the appropriate dialogue box. Insert a variable into the Test Variable  List  box.  By  default,  each  value  of  score  on  the  variable generates its own category, but you can specify the range of values to be used by selecting Use Speciﬁed Range and inserting the lower and upper values.  In  this  way  you  could  exclude  cases  which  had  a  score  outside the range you specify.   ANALYSING NOMINAL AND ORDINAL DATA  221  Figure 18.1 shows the results of applying a one-sample chi-square on the  employer  variable  in  salesq,  to  see  whether  the  number  of  respon- dents  from  all  three  employers  differs  from  what  would  be  expected  if each  employer  had  an  equal  number.  The  categories  of  employer  are listed,  with  the  number  of  cases  for  each.  The  expected  frequencies which would occur if all employers had had an equal number of cases is shown  in  the column  headed  Expected N. The Residual column shows the  difference  between  the  observed  and  the  expected  values.  The  Test Statistics table shows the value of chi-square, the degrees of freedom  df  and the probability level. In this example, chi-square is not signiﬁcant, as the probability  0.834  is larger than 0.05.  Figure 18.1 Output from the one-sample chi-square test  18.4 Two matched groups: Wilcoxon test  If  you  have  carried  out  a  within-subjects  experiment,  and  have  two scores for each subject, the Wilcoxon test is used to see whether there is a signiﬁcant difference between the subjects’ scores under the two condi- tions.  It  involves  calculating  the  differences  between  the  scores  for  each subject, and ranking the difference scores, giving rank 1 to the smallest difference  etc.,  but  ignoring  the  sign  of  the  difference.  Any  subjects where the difference score is 0 are dropped from the analysis. The plus or minus signs of the difference scores are assigned to the rank values, and   222  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  the  sum  of  the  rank-values  obtained  for  the  plus-  and  minus-signed ranks separately.  The Wilcoxon test rests on the argument that if there is no difference between the two sets of scores, the sum of the ranks for plus-differences will be about the same as the sum of the ranks for the minus-differences. If  the  sums  of  plus-differences  are  very  dissimilar  to  the  sum  of  the minus-differences, then it is likely there is a reliable difference between the two sets of scores.  The dialogue box offering the Wilcoxon test also includes the sign test, used  to  establish  that  two  conditions  are  different  when  the  two  mem- bers  of  each  pair  can  be  ranked,  and  the  McNemar  test  for  the  sig- niﬁcance  of  changes  which  is  a  form  of  two-sample  chi-square  for repeated measures.  To obtain the Wilcoxon test, select from the menu  Analyze  Nonparametric Tests  2 Related Samples  In  the  dialogue  box,  indicate  the  two  variables  to  be  compared  by clicking  on  each  of  them;  the  ﬁrst  one  will  appear  under  Current Selections Variable 1:, and the second one will appear as Variable 2. To insert  these  into  the  Paired  Variables  list,  click  on  the  right-pointing arrow button: the two variables will then be shown as a linked pair. You can create further pairs in the same way. Figure 18.2 shows the output for a Wilcoxon test to compare the scores on att1 and att2 of the respondents in salesq.  The  printout  shows  how  many  cases  had  att2  score  less  than  att1 scores,  how  many  had  att2  greater  than  att1,  and  how  many  were  tied  i.e.  the  scores  on  att1  and  att2  were  the  same .  It  gives  also  the  mean rank for those situations where the scores were not tied. The test yields a z value, and this together with the relevant probability level is provided in the Test Statistics output. In this instance, probability is less than 0.05, so you can conclude there is a signiﬁcant difference between the scores on att1 and att2.  18.5 Three or more matched groups: Friedman test  This  is  used  to  compare  three  or  more  related  sets  of  scores. A  table  is created where each row is the data for one subject, and the data within each row is ranked. The sum of ranks  T  for each column is calculated. The  test  is  concerned  with  establishing  whether  the  rank  totals  of  each column differ more than would be expected by chance; if there were no difference between the sets of scores, the rank totals would be more or less the same.   ANALYSING NOMINAL AND ORDINAL DATA  223  Figure 18.2 Output from the Wilcoxon test  The test is available by selecting from the menu  Analyze  Nonparametric Tests  K Related Samples  In the dialogue box presented, specify the variables to be compared by clicking on the variable names and then on the right-pointing arrow. The output is shown in Figure 18.3, the test having been used to compare the scores on att1, att2 and att3.  The Friedman test ranks the scores on the variables for each respond- ent  separately,  and  calculates  the  mean  of  these  rank  score  for  each variable. These means are shown in the Ranks table; Test Statistics shows the  chi-square  statistic,  degrees  of  freedom  and  signiﬁcance  level.  In Figure  18.3,  the  signiﬁcance  value  is  less  than  0.05  and  so  you  would conclude there is a signiﬁcant difference between the scores on the three variables.  The Cochran Q test, also available from this dialogue box, is used for analysing nominal data from three or more matched groups or repeated measures.   224  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  Figure 18.3 Output from the Friedman test  18.6 Two independent groups: Mann–Whitney  The  Mann–Whitney  compares  the  scores  on  a  speciﬁed  variable  of  two independent groups. The scores of the two groups are ranked as one set, the sum of the rank values of each subgroup is found and a U statistic is then calculated. The Mann–Whitney is in the group of tests accessed by selecting from the menu  Analyze  Nonparametric Tests  2 Independent Samples  In the dialogue box, specify the variable to be analysed and then indicate the  variable  to  be  used  to  create  the  two  groups  of  respondents  whose scores are to be compared. This is done by inserting the variable name in the  Grouping  Variable  box  and  specifying  which  groups  you  need  by clicking on the Deﬁne Groups button. Suppose we want to compare the scores on sales_1 of the respondents in salesq from the employers 1 and 3. Enter the variable name empl into the Grouping Variable box, click the deﬁne  Groups  button,  and  then  enter  1  into  the  box  labelled  Group  1, and 3 into the box labelled Group 2.  Figure  18.4  shows  the  result  of  using  the  Mann–Whitney  to  compare scores  on  sales_1  for  respondents  of  employer  1  and  employer  3.  The average  rank  of  each  group  is  shown  in  the  Ranks  table.  The  Test Statistics table shows a value for U and a value for z with the associated two-tailed probability  Sig. . In this example, the probability is less than             ANALYSING NOMINAL AND ORDINAL DATA  225  0.05,  indicating  that  there  is  a  signiﬁcant  difference  between  sales_1 scores for employers 1 and 3.  The Mann–Whitney procedure also carries out the Wilcoxon Rank Sum  test, and the output shows the value of W.  The  Moses  extreme  reactions,  Kolmogorov–Smirnov  two-sample  and  Wald–Wolfowitz runs tests are also available.  Figure 18.4 Output from the Mann–Whitney test  18.7 Three or more independent groups: Kruskal–Wallis  Kruskal–Wallis is used to compare the scores on a variable of more than two independent groups. It is found under  Analyze  Nonparametric Tests  K Independent Samples  In the dialogue box, specify a grouping variable by selecting a variable from  the  source  list  and  inserting  it  in  the  Grouping  Variable  box. You then have to deﬁne the range of the grouping variable by clicking on the Deﬁne Range button which opens a dialogue box in which you enter the values corresponding to the lowest and highest scores on the grouping variable. For example, to compare the scores on cust for the respondents   226  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  Figure 18.5 Output from the Kruskal–Wallis test  of  the  three  employers  in  the  salesq  set  of  data,  remember  that  the employers  were  coded  as  1,  2  or  3.  So  in  the  Several  Independent Samples: Deﬁne Range box, you would enter 1 as the Minimum and 3 as the Maximum.  The output from the Kruskal–Wallis test is shown in Figure 18.5. The data  on  customer  visits  has  been  ranked,  and  the  mean  rank  for  each employer is given in the Ranks table. A chi-square value is shown in the Test Statistics table, with the df and probability value  Asymp. Sig. . In Figure 18.5 one can see that there is a signiﬁcant difference between the customer visits of the three employers, as the probability value  .004  is less than 0.05.  The median test which is also available from the dialogue box offering the  Kruskal–Wallis  is  used  to  test  whether  three  or  more  independent groups have been drawn from populations with equal medians.   19  ASSESSING TEST RELIABILITY  Summary  a test.  c Reliability refers to the consistency of the results on different items in  c Use the Scale  Reliability procedure to obtain Cronbach’s alpha.  19.1 The concept of test reliability  Many  studies  in  the  social  sciences  involve  assessing  some  attribute  of the respondents. In the data ﬁle salesq, for example, there is data on the sales  performance  of  those  who  completed  the  questionnaire  and  on their  responses  to  three  attitude  statements.  Whenever  attributes  of people are measured, it is necessary to consider the validity and reliabil- ity of the measuring instrument. Validity means ‘Does the test measure what it claims to measure?’ and is assessed by comparing the test with a ‘true’ measure of the attribute.  Reliability refers to the consistency of the results. There are a number of types of reliability. Test–retest reliability means that people obtain the same scores if they take the test twice. It can be assessed by giving the test to the same people on two occasions and correlating the two sets of scores.  In practice, to prevent the respondents simply remembering the answers they gave the ﬁrst time, you may have two versions of the test with  slightly  different  items.  The  two  versions  are  known  as  parallel forms.   Inter-scorer and inter-administrator reliability mean that the test gives  the same results whoever is marking or administering it.  Another aspect of reliability is ensuring that all the items measure ‘the same thing’. This can be assessed by comparing the scores on any item with the total score on all the items. If one item does not correlate with the  total  score,  it  is  eliminated  so  the  test  has  homogeneity  of  items. Another procedure is to divide the test into two halves and see how far the scores on each half correlate. This ‘split-half’ reliability indicates the internal consistency of the test.   228  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  But there are many ways you can construct the two halves. If you had a test of 40 items, you could take the ﬁrst 20 and the ﬁnal 20 or you could take the odd-numbered ones and then the even-numbered ones, or you could take items 1–10 and 21–30 as one half with the others forming the other  half  and  so  on.  Perhaps  the  best  thing  would  be  to  take  every possible  way  of  forming  two  halves,  correlate  the  scores  of  the  halves and  then  ﬁnd  the  average  of  the  correlations.  This  is  essentially  what Cronbach’s alpha does and is one of the standard ways of expressing a test’s reliability.  High reliability in all senses is not always a ‘good thing’. High inter- scorer agreement is always desirable, but high item homogeneity is not. If you are measuring intelligence, you want to be sure that all aspects of intelligence are tested, and so you will not want all the items to show a very high correlation with each other.  You may ask what is an acceptable level of reliability, but there is no simple  answer.  For  tests  of  cognitive  ability   such  as  intelligence  tests , reliability  coefﬁcients  of  about  0.8  are  usually  expected  and  for  ability, tests should not be below 0.7. But tests of personality often have much lower values, partly because personality is a broader construct. The issue of  test  reliability  is  complex,  and  you  should  consult  a  text  on  psycho- metric testing such as Kline  1993 .  19.2 Assessing test reliability with SPSS: Reliability  To  obtain  Cronbach’s  alpha  and  other  indications  of  the  reliability  of  a test select  Analyze  Scale  Reliability Analysis  In the dialogue box revealed, identify the items in the test from the list of variables  by  clicking  on  them  and  then  on  the  right-pointing  arrow button  so  the  variables  appear  in  the  list  to  the  right  headed  Items. Alternative models for assessing reliability can be chosen from the drop- down menu entitled Model.  An example of the syntax and output can be seen in Figure 19.1, where a  reliablility  analysis  was  conducted  on  the  scores  for  att1,  att2  and att3rc.  In the data ﬁle salesq, the scores on att3 are negatively related to those on att1 and att2 because of the way the questions are worded. The scores on att3 were recoded into the new variable att3rc, to be consistent with the scoring of att1 and att2, using the recode procedure described in section 12.6.   Pressing  the  Statistics  button  from  the  original  Reliability  Analysis dialogue box reveals the box shown in Figure 19.2 from which you can   ASSESSING TEST RELIABILITY  229  Figure 19.1  Syntax and output from Reliability  request  a  number  of  useful  statistics.  Figure  19.3  shows  the  output obtained  when  Descriptive  Statistics  for  Item,  Descriptives  for  Scale, Inter-item  Correlations,  and  Summaries  Means  are  requested.  The  ﬁrst section shows the means and standard deviations on each item and this is followed by the correlations between the items. The ﬁgures described as Statistics for Scale show the overall mean score, variance and standard deviation if the scores on the separate items  att1, att2 and att3rc  were added together to make a single scale. Summaries Means gives the mean of  the  means  for  the  separate  items  which  is  shown  in  the  section  of  Figure 19.2 The Reliability Analysis: Statistics dialogue box   230  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  Figure 19.3 headed Item Means. This also prints out the range of the item means, and their variance.  The ANOVA Table section of Figure 19.2 lets you select an analysis of variance  to  test  whether  there  is  a  signiﬁcant  difference  between  the mean  scores  on  the  items.  The  F-test  produces  a  repeated-measures ANOVA  table.  If  the  items  are  in  the  form  of  ranks,  you  can  select Friedman  chi-square,  and  if  they  are  all  dichotomies  you  can  select Cochran  chi-square.  Hotelling’s  T square  test  can  be  used  to  test  the hypothesis that the item means are equal, while Tukey’s test of additivity is used to test the assumption that there is no multiplicative interaction among the items.  Figure 19.3 Example of statistics obtained using Reliability Statistics   20  FACTOR ANALYSIS  Summary  c For factor analysis the number of respondents should not be less than 100,  and  there  should  be  at  least  twice  as  many  respondents  as variables.  The  respondents  should  be  heterogeneous  on  the  abilities or measures being studied.  c Perform a principal components analysis ﬁrst. The number of factors  to extract can be determined from a scree plot.  c Then run a common factor analysis with the number of factors set to  the value obtained from the principal components analysis.  c To obtain an orthogonal simple structure rotation use Varimax. If an  oblique rotation is needed, use Direct Oblimin.  20.1 Basic principles of factor analysis  Factor analysis is a technique or more accurately a family of techniques which aim to simplify complex sets of data by analysing the correlations between them. The underlying principles are explained in texts such as Stevens   1996   or  Tabachnick  and  Fidell   1996 .  A  simple  coverage  is provided by Kline  1994 , and this chapter relies heavily on his exposi- tion.  Given a set of scores on a number of variables, the correlation between each  of  the  variables  can  be  calculated  and  yields  a  correlation  matrix such  as  is  shown  in  the  upper  part  of  Figure  20.3.  In  the  example  data used in this chapter, 300 respondents answered 10 questions labelled att1 to  att10.  In  Figure  20.3,  the  correlations  between  the  responses  to  each question are shown: for example, the correlation between att1 and att2 is .368, and the correlation between att2 and att3 is .748.  Factor  analysis  is  designed  to  simplify  the  correlation  matrix  and reveal the small number of factors which can explain the correlations. A component  or  a  factor  explains  the  variance  in  the  intercorrelation   232  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  matrix, and the amount of variance explained is known as the eigenvalue for the factor.  A factor loading is the correlation of a variable with a factor. A loading of  0.3  or  more  is  frequently  taken  as  meaningful  when  interpreting  a factor. So when deciding what a factor signiﬁes, one looks to see which variables have loadings of 0.3 or above. Communality is the proportion of the variance in each variable which the factors explain; the higher it is, the more the factors explain the variable’s variance.  Exploratory factor analysis is employed to identify the main constructs which will explain the intercorrelation matrix, and is the most common usage. Conﬁrmatory factor analysis is where one tests whether hypothe- sized factor loadings ﬁt an observed intercorrelation matrix.  There are a number of considerations to bear in mind before carrying out  factor  analysis.  First,  the  outcome  depends  on  the  variables  which have  been  measured  and  the  respondents  who  yielded  the  data.  Sec- ondly, the number of respondents should not be less than 100, and there should be at least twice as many respondents as variables. So if you are measuring  60  variables  you  need  at  least  120  respondents.  Both  the number of respondents and the ratio of respondents to variables should be as large as possible. Thirdly, the respondents should be heterogeneous on the abilities or measures being studied.  As mentioned above, there are many different types of factor analysis and  you  should  have  previously  decided  which  particular  procedures you  mean  to  follow.   Those  described  in  this  chapter  are  only  an illustration  and  not  necessarily  to  your  speciﬁc problem.   those  relevant   In carrying out exploratory factor analysis, Kline recommends that one should  ﬁrst  of  all  perform  a  principal  components  analysis.  This  is  a form  of  analysis  which  derives  as  many  components  as  there  are variables, although the amount of variance explained by each component will  decrease  as  more  components  are  extracted.  It  is  a  consequence  of the  nature  of  principal  components  analysis  that  it  will  yield  a  large general factor ﬁrst. The components obtained in a principal components analysis are uncorrelated and emerge in decreasing order of the amount of  variance  explained.  Although  one  initially  obtains  as  many  compo- nents  as  there  are  variables,  the  aim  of  factor  analysis  is  to  explain  the matrix  with  as  few  factors  as  possible.  The  number  to  extract  can  be determined  if  one  obtains  a  scree  plot;  an  example  is  shown  in  Figure 20.4. A  scree  plot  shows  the  eigenvalues  plotted  against  the  number  of the  components.  One  looks  at  the  plot  to  ﬁnd  where  the  line  changes slope,  where  the  ‘elbow’  is.  In  Figure  20.4  it  is  between  the  factor numbers  2  and  3,  so  one  would  take  2  as  the  number  of  factors  to  be extracted.  Once  the  principal  components  analysis  has  indicated  the  number  of factors  to  extract,  a  common  factor  analysis  is  run  with  the  number  of   FACTOR ANALYSIS  233  factors set to the value obtained from the principal components analysis. There  are  many  alternative  types  of  analysis  which  can  be  chosen;  ‘In general principal factor analysis is an adequate method’  Kline, 1994: 54 . Kline  recommends  running  the  analysis  with  rotation  of  factors;  again, there  are  alternative  methods  of  rotation  but  he  recommends  using  the Varimax  method:  ‘where  an  orthogonal  simple  structure  rotation  is desired, Varimax should be applied’  1994: 68 .  However, it is not necessary for the factors to be orthogonal, and there can be advantages in having oblique or correlated factors. ‘If an oblique rotation gives a better simple structure then the Direct Oblimin package is the one to use’  Kline, 1994: 76 .  20.2 Obtaining a factor analysis  From the menu select  Analyze  Data Reduction  Factor  This opens the dialogue box shown in Figure 20.1. Identify the variables to be included in the analysis by selecting them and pressing the button with  the  right  arrow.  Clicking  the  Extraction  button  reveals  another  Figure 20.1 Dialogue box for Factor Analysis   234  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  dialogue  box,  shown  in  Figure  20.2,  in  which  you  can  choose  from  the drop-down  menu  the  method  to  use;  principal  components  is  the default.  A  scree  plot  is  requested  by  clicking  on  the  check  box.  If  you want the correlation matrix shown in Figure 20.3, press the Descriptives button of Figure 20.1 and check the box labelled Coefﬁcients in the area headed Correlation Matrix.  The  syntax  and  output  from  a  principal  components  analysis  is illustrated  in  Figure  20.3.  The  ﬁrst  section  of  output  illustrates  the intercorrelations  between  the  scores  on  each  of  the  variables,  requested via  the  Descriptives  button  of  Figure  20.1.  Principal  components  will begin with the same number of components as variables. The left-hand part  of  the  Total  Variance  Explained  table  shows  the  eigenvalues  and percentage of variance explained by each of the initial factors. The total of the eigenvalues equals the number of variables, and the percentage of variance explained is calculated from the eigenvalues: the eigenvalue for the  factor  is  divided  by  the  sum  of  the  eigenvalues  and  multiplied  by 100. The right-hand part of the Total Variance Explained table shows the percentage  of  variance  explained  just  for  those  factors  with  an  eigen- value greater than 1.00.  The  Component  Matrix  table  shows  the  loading  of  each  of  the  vari-  ables on each of the two factors which were extracted.  The principal components analysis indicated that two factors underlie the scores on variables att1 to att10, so a simple factor analysis with two factors to be extracted was run. From the dialogue box of Figure 20.2, the Principal-axis  method  was  selected  from  the  Method  drop-down  menu and the Number of Factors to Extract was set at 2 by clicking the radio  Figure 20.2 The Factor Analysis: Extraction dialogue box   FACTOR ANALYSIS  235  Figure 20.3 Output from the principal components analysis   236  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  Scree plot  e u l a v n e g i E  6  5  4  3  2  1  0  1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  Component number  Figure 20.4 Example of a scree plot  button and typing 2 into the text box. From the dialogue box shown in Figure  20.1  the  Rotation  button  was  used  to  reveal  a  box  allowing various  rotation  methods  to  be  chosen,  and  Varimax  was  selected.  The syntax and output is shown in Figure 20.5.  The output is similar to that from principal components  Figure 20.3 .  The  principal  axis  method  of  factor  analysis  is  identical  to  principal components  analysis  with  one  exception.  In  principal  components,  a value of 1 is inserted in the diagonal of the intercorrelation matrix but in the  principal  axis  method  an  estimate  of  communality  is  used.   This  is why the Initial Eigenvalues section of the Total Variance Explained tables of  Figure  20.3  and  Figure  20.5  are  identical.  In  Figure  20.5  the  result  of the  Varimax  rotation  is  presented,  showing  the  loading  on  each  of  the factors  for  each  of  the  variables  in  the  table  headed  Rotated  Factor Matrix.  If  oblique  rather  than  orthogonal  factor  rotation  is  used,  you  select Direct  Oblimin  instead  of  Varimax  in  the  dialogue  box  revealed  by selecting  the  Rotation  button  of  Figure  20.1.  The  syntax  and  output following  oblimin  rotation  is  shown  in  Figure  20.6.  The  Table  headed Pattern  Matrix  shows  the  coefﬁcients  used  to  express  standardized observed variables in terms of the factors, but the Table headed Structure Matrix  is  the  correlation  between  variables  and  factors  and  is  used  to interpret the factors. The Factor Correlation matrix shows the correlation between the factors.  In deciding whether to use orthogonal or oblique factor rotation, one can  apply  orthogonal  rotation  and  see  whether  it  provides  a  simple structure solution. Kline  1994: 65  maintains that the overriding criterion of simple structure is that each factor should have a few high loadings with  the  rest  being  zero  or  close  to  zero.  On  this  criterion,  the  solution   FACTOR ANALYSIS  237  shown in Figure 20.5 is superior to that shown in Figure 20.6. In Figure 20.5,  those  variables  which  load  at  0.7  or  above  on  factor  1   att2,  att3, att4,  att6,  att9  and  att10   all  load  less  than  0.4  on  factor  2  whereas  the variables that have low loadings on factor 1  att 1, att 5, att 7 and att 8  all  Continued on next page   238  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  Figure 20.5 Syntax and output for factor analysis with varimax rotation  have quite high loadings  above 0.5  on factor 2. In Figure 20.6, however, the  loadings  shown  in  the  Structure  Matrix  table  are  less  clear-cut:  all items are loading over 0.3 on both factors. In this instance, therefore, one would stop at the orthogonal, varimax procedure.  20.3 Adding factor scores to the data ﬁle  It is possible to have the factor scores for each case added to the active data  ﬁle  by  pressing  the  Scores  button  of  Figure  20.1  and  checking  the Save as Variables option. There are alternative ways in which the factor scores  are  calculated:  use  the  Help  button  to  gain  information  about them. If you use this procedure, a new variable for each factor is added to  the  data  in  the  data  window.  To  preserve  these  factor  scores  it  is necessary to save the modiﬁed data ﬁle to disk.

There  are  two  situations  when  you  want  a  clean  version  of  the  output. The  ﬁrst  is  when  you  have  carried  out  statistical  analyses,  probably making  some  mistakes  on  the  way,  and  need  a  clean  version  with  all indications of your past errors removed to include in your report of the research. Ways to achieve a cleaned copy of the output are described in section 21.1.  The  other  situation  is  when  you  need  tables  summarizing  the  data from the data ﬁle. You might, for example, want a neat table showing the mean scores on speciﬁc variables for the male and female respondents. There  are  a  number  of  ways  of  obtaining  such  tables,  and  these  are brieﬂy explained in sections 21.2 to 21.4.  21.1 Obtaining a clean output  .spo  ﬁle  If you wish to use the .spo ﬁle for presenting the results of your analysis, you will need a ‘clean’ version of the ﬁle, containing just the results you want. There are various ways of obtaining a clean .spo ﬁle. The simplest way is to start with a syntax ﬁle which is perfect so that it runs without error,  then  open  a  new  output  ﬁle   File   New   Output   and  run  the commands in the syntax ﬁle. A clean version of the output will be placed in the output window.  This is one of the reasons why the creation of a syntax ﬁle is recommended.  An alternative is to edit the .spo ﬁle, either within  SPSS  or  by  importing  it  into  a  word  processor  as  described  in section 7.12.   OBTAINING NEAT PRINTOUTS AND TABLES  241  21.2 Generating tables using OLAP Cubes  The OLAP Cubes procedure, which was Layered Reports in version 8 of SPSS,  calculates  totals,  means,  and  other  univariate  statistics  for  con- tinuous summary variables within categories of one or more categorical grouping  variables.   OLAP  stands  for  Online Analytical  Processing.  A separate layer in the table is created for each category of each grouping variable. The procedure is accessed by selecting  Analyze  Reports  OLAP Cubes  Specify  the  summary  variable  and  the  grouping  variables  by  selecting them from the variable list and pressing the arrow key to enter them in the  appropriate  list.  The  Statistics  button  allows  you  to  select  the statistics you want displayed. An example of the output obtained when cust was the summary variable and area the categorical variable is given in Figure 21.1.  The  output  does  not  appear  to  provide  separate  layers  for  each category  of  the  categorical  variable,  but  this  is  misleading.  Only  one layer of the table is visible at a time, but you can view other layers after the table is displayed in the Viewer by double-clicking the table. A drop- down list, shown in Figure 21.2, will become available and you use it to select which of the subgroup’s data to display.

For Figure 21.3, a table showing mean scores, standard deviations and n on the variable cust for subgroups of area was requested. The table in Figure 21.3 includes a listing of all the cases  in  each  subgroup,  but  this  can  be  suppressed  by  unchecking Display Cases in the Summarize Cases window. The result of doing this is  shown  in  Figure  21.4  where  subgroups  of  sex  and  area  were  reques- ted.   OBTAINING NEAT PRINTOUTS AND TABLES  243  The  Analyze   Reports  menu  also  includes  the  entries  Report  Sum- maries  in  Rows  and  Report  Summaries  in  Columns.  These  invoke  a procedure called Report which is of such complexity that few will have bothered to use it. The output from the Report procedure has not been updated  and  is  in  a  text  format.  The  procedure  is  now  obsolete  and  Figure 21.3 Example of output from Case Summaries   244  DATA ANALYSIS USING SPSS FOR WINDOWS  Figure 21.4 Example of output from Case Summaries with Display Cases suppressed  redundant  since  far  neater  tables  are  obtained  using  the  Table  proce- dure.  21.4 Generating tables using Custom Tables  Sophisticated  tables  of  the  data  can  be  obtained  using  Custom  Tables, which is obtained from  Analyze  Custom Tables  If  Basic  Tables  is  selected,  the  dialogue  box  shown  in  Figure  21.5  is presented.  Specify  which  variables  are  to  be  shown  in  the  tables  by selecting variables from the list in the left hand box and inserting them into  the  Summaries  box  by  clicking  on  the  right-pointing  arrow.  The variables  to  be  used  to  form  subgroups  are  speciﬁed  in  a  similar  way. The  Statistics  button  allows  you  to  request  a  number  of  alternative statistics. The Layout, Totals, Format, and Titles buttons provide access to further options for the appearance of the table.  An example of a Basic Table is shown in Figure 21.6, where the mean and standard deviation on the variables cust and sales_1 were requested. Count indicates the number of cases, usually denoted by n.   OBTAINING NEAT PRINTOUTS AND TABLES  245  In Figure 21.7, overall statistics are also shown; these are obtained by selecting  the  Totals  button  from  Figure  21.5  and  checking  the  option Totals over Each Group Variable.

In Basic Tables, the same summary statistics are given for all the variables being summarized,  but  General  Tables  allows  different  statistics  to  be  shown for  different  variables.  An  example  of  such  a  table  is  shown  in  Figure 21.8.  It  was  created  by  having  cust  and  sales_1  as  row  variables,  and ensuring  for  each  one  that  the  option  Selected  Variable  is  Summarized was  checked.  Then  Edit  Statistics  was  used  to  select  the  statistics required   mean  for  cust  and  median  for  sales_1 .  The  variable  sex  was entered as a column variable and the variable area was entered as a layer variable.  Different subgroups can form separate layers of the table, but only one layer  of  the  table  is  visible  at  a  time.  To  view  other  layers  of  the  table, double-click it so that a drop-down list similar to that shown in Figure 21.2 is presented.  The Tables of Frequencies option of the Analyze  Custom Tables menu allows  you  to  produce  tables  that  contain  multiple  variables  with  the same values. By default, the variables form columns and the categories form  rows,  as  shown  in  Figure  21.9.  Each  cell  displays  the  number  of cases  in  that  category.

This book is designed to teach beginners how to operate SPSS for Windows using versions 8 to 10 of the package. You have some data and some questions such as How do I get a frequency table, an average, or a histogram?. The book gives you the answers, explaining the commands you need, and showing you the output the commands provide. It is not a text in statistical analysis; I have assumed that the person who comes to SPSS is likely to know, at least in general terms, what statistical analysis they want to do. What they do not know is how to get SPSS to do it for them. SPSS is very efficient, but it is complicated. Do not become discouraged if at first you find it confusing: we all do! Once you have mastered the general principles, you will soon find that it is comparatively straightforward to obtain the results you want. And remember that when you are able to drive SPSS, you have enormous power at your disposal.
