He received a PhD in Physics and an MS in  Computer Science from Oregon State University. He has been teaching computer graphics to  undergraduates at PLU for over 10 years, using OpenGL.   About the Reviewers  Bartłomiej Filipek is an experienced software developer with a passion for teaching.   He has been leading OpenGL and graphics programming courses at Jagiellonian University in  Cracow for around five years now. Additionally he gives lectures and workshops about modern  C++ techniques at local universities.  His professional experience focuses mostly on native application development including  rendering systems, large-scale software development, game engines, multimedia  applications, user interfaces, GPU computing, and even biofeedback.  He shares his programming stories at his blog: http:  www.bfilipek.com .  Thomas Le Guerroué-Drévillon is a freshly graduated software engineer. Having a  profound interest in mathematics and drawing, it came easily to him to mix together these   two passions in one field: computer graphics.  Originally French, he used up all the opportunities given by his university to study and work  all around the world. It allowed him to enjoy his first international experience in Estonia, the  second in the prestigious KAIST in South Korea, and finally ending up now in Canada.  Even though his university provided the mathematical background, he got his experience with  OpenGL and GLSL on his own. He believes that the link between the well documented API and  the shader samples is missing. Thus he naturally accepted to review this cookbook, which for  him is the material he would have loved to get a hand on when he started developing interests  in OpenGL GLSL.   Dr. Muhammad Mobeen Movania received his PhD degree in Advance Computer  Graphics and Visualization from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. After finishing  his PhD, he joined Institute for Infocomm Research, A-Star, Singapore to work on Augmented  Reality based Virtual Tryon and Cloth Simulation systems using GPU and OpenGL. Before  joining NTU, he was a junior graphics programmer at Data Communication and Control  DCC   Pvt. Ltd., Karachi, Pakistan. He worked on DirectX and OpenGL API for producing real-time  interactive tactical simulators and dynamic integrated training simulators. His research  interests include GPU-based volumetric rendering techniques, GPU technologies, real-time  soft body physics, real-time dynamic shadows, real-time collision detection and response,  and hierarchical geometric data structures. He is also the author of the OpenCloth project   http:  code.google.com p opencloth , which implements various cloth simulation  algorithms in OpenGL. His blog  http:  mmmovania.blogspot.com  lists a lot of useful  graphics tips and tricks. When not involved with computer graphics, he composes music and  is an avid squash player.  Dr. Mobeen has published several conference and journal papers on real-time computer  graphics and visualization. Recently, he authored a book on OpenGL  OpenGL Development  Cookbook by Packt Publishing, published in 2013  which details several applied recipes using  modern OpenGL. He has also authored a book chapter in another book  OpenGL Insights by  AK Peters CRC Press, published in 2012 .  Dr. Mobeen is currently an Assistant Professor at DHA Suffa University, Karachi, Pakistan  where he is busy nurturing young minds to become outstanding programmers and  researchers of tomorrow.  I would like to thank almighty ALLAH for bestowing his countless blessings  on me and my family. After that, I would like to extend my gratitude towards  my family, my parents  Mr. and Mrs. Abdul Aziz Movania , my wife  Tanveer  Taji , my sisters  Mrs. Azra Saleem and Mrs. Sajida Shakir , my brothers  Mr.  Khalid Movania and Mr. Abdul Majid Movania , all my nephews nieces and  my daughter  Muntaha Movania .  Dario Scarpa has been coding for fun and profit for the last 15 years, and has no intention  to stop. Jumping around among IT jobs as developer sysadmin, amateur video game  programming, and CS exams at the University of Salerno  Italy , he also managed to work with  Adventure Productions in building Zodiac, a digital delivery platform focused on adventure  games. At the time of reviewing this book, he's about to get his Master's degree, with a thesis  on computer graphics that got him working intensively with—guess what—OpenGL.   Javed Rabbani Shah received his degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of  Engineering and Technology, Lahore, Pakistan in 2004. He started his professional career  by joining Delta Indus Systems  now Vision Master Inc. , where he worked with solder paste  inspection systems for statistical process control involving technologies such as Image  Processing, 3D Machine Vision, and FPGAs. He then joined the Embedded Systems Division of  Mentor Graphics in 2007 and got the opportunity to work with the Nucleus+ real-time operating  system, USB 2.0 middleware, WebKit, and OpenGL ES 2.0. He spearheaded the effort to  integrate OpenGL ES 2.0 features in Mentor's cross-platform Inflexion 3D user interface engine.  He is currently working at Saffron Digital in central London, where he is involved in work  related to cross-platform secure video playback, DRM, and UltraViolet technologies.  In his spare time, he likes to learn emerging technologies like OpenGL ES 3.0 and OpenCL.   www.PacktPub.com  Support files, eBooks, discount offers and more You might want to visit www.PacktPub.com for support files and downloads related to   your book.

It provides us with unprecedented flexibility and power by making the formerly  fixed-function graphics pipeline programmable. With GLSL, we can leverage the Graphics  Processing Unit  GPU  to implement advanced and sophisticated rendering techniques and  even do arbitrary computation. With GLSL 4.x, programmers can do more with the GPU than  ever before thanks to new shader stages such as tessellation shaders and compute shaders.  In this book, we cover the full spectrum of GLSL programming. Starting with the basics of  shading with the vertex and fragment shaders, we take you from simple to advanced techniques.  From textures, shadows, and image processing, to noise and particle systems, we cover practical  examples to give you the tools you need to leverage GLSL in your projects. We also cover how  to use geometry shaders, tessellation shaders, and the very recent addition to GLSL: compute  shaders. With these, you can make use of the GPU for a variety of tasks that go beyond just  shading. With geometry and tessellation shaders, we can create additional geometry or modify  geometry, and with compute shaders we can do arbitrary computation on the GPU.  For those new to GLSL, it's best to read this book in order, starting with Chapter 1. The recipes  will walk you through from basic through to advanced techniques. For someone who is more  experienced with GLSL, you might find it better to pick out specific recipes and jump directly  there. Most recipes are self-contained, but some may refer to other recipes. The introduction  to each chapter provides important general information about the topic, so you might want to  read through that as well.  GLSL 4.x makes programming with OpenGL even more rewarding and fun. I sincerely hope  that you find this book to be useful and that you use these recipes as a starting point in your  own projects. I hope that you find programming in OpenGL and GLSL as enjoyable as I do, and  that these techniques inspire you to create beautiful graphics.   What this book covers Chapter 1, Getting Started with GLSL, explains the steps needed to compile, link, and use  GLSL shaders within an OpenGL program. It also covers how to send data to shaders using  attributes and uniform variables, and the use of the GLM library for mathematics support.  Every modern OpenGL program today requires a function loader. In this chapter, we also cover  the use of GLLoadGen, a relatively new and easy-to-use OpenGL loader generator.  Chapter 2, The Basics of GLSL Shaders, introduces you to the basics of GLSL programming  with per-vertex shading. In this chapter, you see examples of basic shading techniques such  as the ADS  ambient, diffuse, and specular  shading algorithm, two-sided shading, and flat  shading. It also covers examples of basic GLSL concepts such as functions and subroutines.  Chapter 3, Lighting, Shading, and Optimization, presents more advanced shading techniques,  with a focus on the fragment shader. It introduces you to techniques such as spotlights, per- fragment shading, toon shading, fog, and others. We also discuss several simple optimizations  to make your shaders run faster.  Chapter 4, Using Textures, provides a general introduction to using textures in GLSL shaders.  Textures can be used for a variety of purposes besides simply "pasting" an image onto a  surface. In this chapter, we cover the basic application of one or more 2D textures, as well  as a variety of other techniques including alpha maps, normal maps, cube maps, projected  textures, and rendering to a texture. We also cover sampler objects, a relatively new feature  that decouples sampling parameters from the texture object itself.  Chapter 5, Image Processing and Screen Space Techniques, explains common techniques  for the post-processing of rendered images and some other screen-space techniques. Image  post-processing is becoming a crucially important part of modern game engines and other  rendering pipelines. This chapter discusses how to implement some of the more common  post-processing techniques such as tone mapping, bloom, blur, gamma correction, and edge  detection. We also cover some screen-space rendering techniques such as deferred shading,  multisample antialiasing, and order-independent transparency.  Chapter 6, Using Geometry and Tessellation Shaders, covers techniques that demonstrate  how to use these new and powerful shader stages. After reading this chapter, you should  be comfortable with their basic functionality and understand how to use them. We cover  techniques such as geometry-shader-generated point sprites, silhouette lines, depth-based  tessellation, Bezier surfaces, and more.  Chapter 7, Shadows, introduces basic techniques for producing real-time shadows. This  chapter includes recipes for the two most common shadow techniques: shadow maps and  shadow volumes. We cover common techniques for antialiasing shadow maps, as well as how  to use the geometry shader to help produce shadow volumes.  2   Chapter 8, Using Noise in Shaders, covers the use of Perlin noise for creating various effects.  The first recipe shows you how to create a wide variety of textures containing noise data using  GLM  a powerful mathematics library . Then we move on to recipes that use noise textures for  creating a number of effects such as wood grain, clouds, disintegration, paint, and static.  Chapter 9, Particle Systems and Animation, focuses on techniques for creating particle  systems. We see how to create a particle system to simulate fire, smoke, and water. We  also make use of the OpenGL feature called transform feedback, in order to gain additional  efficiency by moving the particle updates onto the GPU.  Chapter 10, Using Compute Shaders, introduces you to several techniques that make use of  one of the newest features in OpenGL, the compute shader. The compute shader provides  us with the ability to do general computation on the GPU within OpenGL. In this chapter,  we discuss how to use the compute shader for particle simulations, cloth simulation, edge  detection, and the generation of a procedural fractal texture. After reading this chapter,   the reader should have a good feel for how to use the compute shader for arbitrary  computational tasks.  What you need for this book The recipes in this book use some of the latest and greatest features in OpenGL 4.x. Therefore,  in order to implement them, you'll need graphics hardware  graphics card or onboard GPU  and  drivers that support at least OpenGL 4.3. If you're unsure about what version of OpenGL your  setup can support, there are a number of utilities available for determining this information.  One option is GLview from Realtech VR, available at: http:  www.realtech-vr.com  glview . If you're running Windows or Linux, drivers are readily available for most modern  hardware. However, if you're using MacOS X, unfortunately, you may need to wait. As of this  writing, the latest version of MacOS X  10.9 Mavericks  only supports OpenGL 4.1.  Once you've verified that you have the required OpenGL drivers, you'll also need the following:   f A C++ compiler. On Linux, the GNU Compiler Collection  gcc, g++, and so on  may  already be available, and if not, it should be available through your distribution's  package manager. On Windows, Microsoft Visual Studio will work fine, but if you don't  have a copy, then the MinGW compiler  available from http:  mingw.org   is a  good option.   f The GLFW library Version 3.0 or later, available from http:  www.glfw.org .    This library provides OpenGL context creation, window support, and support for user  input events.   f The GLM library Version 0.9.4 or later, available from http:  glm.g-truc.net .   This provides mathematics support with classes for matrices, vectors, common  transformations, noise functions, and much more.  3   Who this book is for The primary focus of this book is the OpenGL Shading Language  GLSL . Therefore, we don't  spend any time discussing the basics of programming with OpenGL. In this book I assume  that the reader has some experience with programming in OpenGL, and understands basic  3D rendering concepts such as model coordinates, view coordinates, clip coordinates,  perspective transforms, and the other associated transformations. There's no assumption of  any experience with shader programming, however, so if you're new to GLSL, this is a great  place to start.  If you're an OpenGL programmer looking to learn about GLSL programming, then this book  is for you. Even if you have some shader programming experience, you will very likely find the  recipes in this book to be valuable. We cover a range of simple to advanced techniques, using  some of the newest features of OpenGL  such as compute shaders and tessellation shaders .  So even experienced GLSL programmers, who are looking to learn how to use these new  features, may also find this book to be useful.  In short, this book is for programmers who understand the basics of 3D graphics in OpenGL,  and are interested in either learning GLSL, or taking advantage of some of the newest  features in modern GLSL 4.x.  Conventions In this book, you will find a number of styles of text that distinguish between different kinds of  information.

It allows  us to harness the power of modern Graphics Processing Units  GPUs  in a straightforward  way by providing a simple yet powerful language and API. Of course, the first step towards  using GLSL is to create a program that utilizes the latest version of the OpenGL API. GLSL  programs don't stand on their own; they must be a part of a larger OpenGL program. In this  chapter, we will provide some tips and techniques for getting a basic program up and running.  First, let's start with some background.   The OpenGL Shading Language The GLSL is now a fundamental and integral part of the OpenGL API. Going forward, every  program written using the OpenGL API will internally utilize one or several GLSL programs. These  "mini-programs" are often referred to as shader programs. A shader program usually consists  of several components called shaders. Each shader executes within a different section of the  OpenGL pipeline. Each shader runs on the GPU, and as the name implies,  typically  implement  the algorithms related to the lighting and shading effects of an image. However, shaders are  capable of doing much more than just implementing a shading algorithm. They are also capable  of performing animation, tessellation, or even generalized computation.  The field of study dubbed GPGPU  General Purpose Computing on  Graphics Processing Units  is concerned with utilization of GPUs   often using specialized APIs such as CUDA or OpenCL  to perform  general purpose computations such as fluid dynamics, molecular  dynamics, cryptography, and so on. With compute shaders,  introduced in OpenGL 4.3, we can now do GPGPU within OpenGL.  Shader programs are designed for direct execution on the GPU and are executed in parallel.  For example, a fragment shader might be executed once for every pixel, with each execution  running simultaneously on a separate GPU thread. The number of processors on the graphics  card determines how many can be executed at one time. This makes shader programs  incredibly efficient, and provides the programmer with a simple API for implementing highly  parallel computation.  The computing power available in modern graphics cards is impressive. The following   table shows the number of shader processors available for several models in the NVIDIA  GeForce series cards  source: http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Comparison_of_ Nvidia_graphics_processing_units .  Model GeForce GTS 450 GeForce GTX 480 GeForce GTX 780  Unified Shader Processors 192 480 2304  Shader programs are intended to replace parts of the OpenGL architecture referred to as the  fixed-function pipeline. Prior to OpenGL Version 2.0, the shading algorithm was "hard-coded"  into the pipeline and had only limited configurability. This default lighting shading algorithm  was a core part of the fixed-function pipeline. When we, as programmers, wanted to implement  more advanced or realistic effects, we used various tricks to force the fixed-function pipeline  into being more flexible than it really was. The advent of GLSL will help by providing us with the  ability to replace this "hard-coded" functionality with our own programs written in GLSL, thus  giving us a great deal of additional flexibility and power. For more details on the programmable  pipeline, see the introduction to Chapter 2, The Basics of GLSL Shaders.  8   In fact, recent  core  versions of OpenGL not only provide this capability, but they require  shader programs as part of every OpenGL program. The old fixed-function pipeline has  been deprecated in favor of a new programmable pipeline, a key part of which is the shader  program written in GLSL.  Profiles – Core vs. Compatibility OpenGL Version 3.0 introduced a deprecation model, which allowed for the gradual  removal of functions from the OpenGL specification. Functions or features can be marked as  deprecated, meaning that they are expected to be removed from a future version of OpenGL.  For example, immediate mode rendering using glBegin glEnd was marked deprecated in  version 3.0 and removed in version 3.1.  In order to maintain backwards compatibility, the concept of compatibility profiles was  introduced with OpenGL 3.2. A programmer that is writing code intended to be used with  a particular version of OpenGL  with older features removed  would use the so-called core  profile. Someone who also wanted to maintain compatibility with older functionality could   use the compatibility profile.  It may be somewhat confusing that there is also the concept of  a forward compatible context, which is distinguished slightly  from the concept of a core compatibility profile. A context that  is considered forward compatible basically indicates that all  deprecated functionality has been removed. In other words, if  a context is forward compatible, it only includes functions that  are in the core, but not those that were marked as deprecated.  Some window APIs provide the ability to select forward  compatible status along with the profile.  The steps for selecting a core or compatibility profile are window system API dependent.   For example, in GLFW, one can select a forward compatible, 4.3 core profile using the  following code:  glfwWindowHint  GLFW_CONTEXT_VERSION_MAJOR, 4  ; glfwWindowHint  GLFW_CONTEXT_VERSION_MINOR, 3  ; glfwWindowHint GLFW_OPENGL_FORWARD_COMPAT, GL_TRUE ; glfwWindowHint GLFW_OPENGL_PROFILE, GLFW_OPENGL_CORE_PROFILE ;  GLFWwindow *window = glfwCreateWindow 640, 480, "Title",         NULL, NULL ;  All programs in this book are designed to be compatible with a forward compatible OpenGL  4.3 core profile.  9   Using a function loader to access the latest  OpenGL functionality The OpenGL ABI  application binary interface  is frozen to OpenGL version 1.1 on Windows.  Unfortunately for Windows developers, that means that it is not possible to link directly to  functions that are provided in newer versions of OpenGL. Instead, one must get access to these  functions by acquiring a function pointer at runtime. Getting access to the function pointers  is not difficult, but requires somewhat tedious work, and has a tendency to clutter your code.  Additionally, Windows typically comes with a standard OpenGL gl.h file that also conforms  to OpenGL 1.1. The OpenGL wiki states that Microsoft has no plans to ever update the gl.h  and opengl32.lib that come with their compilers. Thankfully, others have provided libraries  that manage all of this for us by transparently providing the needed function pointers, while  also exposing the needed functionality in header files. There are several libraries available  that provide this kind of support. One of the oldest and most common is GLEW  OpenGL  Extension Wrangler . However, there are a few serious issues with GLEW that might make it  less desirable, and insufficient for my purposes when writing this book. First, at time of writing,  it doesn't yet support core profiles properly, and for this book, I want to focus only on the latest  non-deprecated functionality. Second, it provides one large header file that includes everything  from all versions of OpenGL. It might be preferable to have a more streamlined header file that  only includes functions that we might use. Finally, GLEW is distributed as a library that needs to  be compiled separately and linked into our project. It is often preferable to have a loader that  can be included into a project simply by adding the source files and compiling them directly into  our executable, avoiding the need to support another link-time dependency.  In this recipe, we'll use the OpenGL Loader Generator  GLLoadGen , available from  https:  bitbucket.org alfonse glloadgen wiki Home. This very flexible and  efficient library solves all three of the issues described in the previous paragraph. It supports  core profiles and it can generate a header that includes only the needed functionality, and  also generates just a couple of files  a source file and a header  that we can add directly into  our project.  Getting ready To use GLLoadGen, you'll need Lua. Lua is a lightweight embeddable scripting language  that is available for nearly all platforms. Binaries are available at http:  luabinaries. sourceforge.net, and a fully packaged install for Windows  LuaForWindows  is available at:  https:  code.google.com p luaforwindows  Download the GLLoadGen distribution from: https:  bitbucket.org alfonse  glloadgen downloads. The distribution is compressed using 7zip, which is not widely  installed, so you may need to install a 7zip utility, available at http:  7-zip.org . Extract  the distribution to a convenient location on your hard drive. Since GLLoadGen is written in  Lua, there's nothing to compile, once the distribution is uncompressed, you're ready to go.  10   How to do it... The first step is to generate the header and source files for the OpenGL version and profile of  choice. For this example, we'll generate files for an OpenGL 4.3 core profile. We can then copy  the files into our project and compile them directly alongside our code:  1.  To generate the header and source files, navigate to the GLLoadGen distribution   directory, and run GLLoadGen with the following arguments: lua LoadGen.lua -style=pointer_c -spec=gl -version=4.3 \  -profile=core core_4_3  2.  The previous step should generate two files: gl_core_4_3.c and gl_core_4_3.h.  Move these files into your project and include gl_core_4_3.c in your build. Within  your program code, you can include the gl_core_4_3.h file whenever you need  access to the OpenGL functions. However, in order to initialize the function pointers,  you need to make sure to call a function to do so. The needed function is called   ogl_LoadFunctions. Somewhere just after the GL context is created  typically  in an initialization function , and before any OpenGL functions are called, use the  following code: int loaded = ogl_LoadFunctions  ;  if loaded == ogl_LOAD_FAILED  {        Destroy the context and abort   return;  }    int num_failed = loaded - ogl_LOAD_SUCCEEDED;   printf "Number of functions that failed to load: %i.\n",        num_failed ;  That's all there is to it!  How it works... The lua command in step 1 generates a pair of files, that is; a header and a source file. The  header provides prototypes for all of the selected OpenGL functions and redefines them as  function pointers, and defines all of the OpenGL constants as well. The source file provides  initialization code for the function pointers as well as some other utility functions. We can  include the gl_core_4_3.h header file wherever we need prototypes for OpenGL functions, so  all function entry points are available at compile time. At run time, the ogl_LoadFunctions    function will initialize all available function pointers. If some functions fail to load, the number  of failures can be determined by the subtraction operation shown in step 2. If a function is not  available in the selected OpenGL version, the code may not compile, because only function  prototypes for the selected OpenGL version and profile are available in the header  depending  on how it was generated .  11   The command line arguments available to GLLoadGen are fully documented here:   https:  bitbucket.org alfonse glloadgen wiki Command_Line_Options.   The previous example shows the most commonly used setup, but there's a good amount   of flexibility built into this tool.  Now that we have generated this source header pair, we no longer have any dependency on  GLLoadGen and our program can be compiled without it. This is a significant advantage over  tools such as GLEW.  There's more... GLLoadGen includes a few additional features that are quite useful. We can generate more  C++ friendly code, manage extensions, and generate files that work without the need to call  an initialization function.  Generating a C++ loader GLLoadGen supports generation of C++ header source files as well. This can be selected via  the -style parameter. For example, to generate C++ files, use -style=pointer_cpp as in  the following example:  lua LoadGen.lua -style=pointer_cpp -spec=gl -version=4.3 \  -profile=core core_4_3  This will generate gl_core_4_3.cpp and gl_core_4_3.hpp. This places all OpenGL  functions and constants within the gl:: namespace, and removes their gl  or GL  prefix. For  example, to call the function glBufferData, you might use the following syntax.  gl::BufferData gl::ARRAY_BUFFER, size, data, gl::STATIC_DRAW ;  Loading the function pointers is also slightly different. The return value is an object rather  than just a simple integer and LoadFunctions is in the gl::sys namespace.  gl::exts::LoadTest didLoad = gl::sys::LoadFunctions  ;  if !didLoad  {           Clean up  destroy the context  and abort.        return;  }  printf "Number of functions that failed to load: %i.\n",     didLoad.GetNumMissing   ;  12   No-load styles GLLoadGen supports the automatic initialization of function pointers. This can be selected  using the noload_c or noload_cpp options for the style parameter. With these styles,  there is no need to call the initialization function ogl_LoadFunctions. The pointers are  loaded automatically, the first time a function is called. This can be convenient, but there's  very little overhead to loading them all at initialization.  Using Extensions GLLoadGen does not automatically support extensions. Instead, you need to ask for them with  command line parameters. For example, to request ARB_texture_view and ARB_vertex_ attrib_binding extensions, you might use the following command.  lua LoadGen.lua -style=pointer_c -spec=gl -version=3.3 \  -profile=core core_3_3 \  -exts ARB_texture_view ARB_vertex_attrib_binding  The -exts parameter is a space-separated list of extensions. GLLoadGen also provides the  ability to load a list of extensions from a file  via the -extfile parameter  and provides some  common extension files on the website.  You can also use GLLoadGen to check for the existence of an extension at run-time. For  details, see the GLLoadGen wiki.  See also   f GLEW, an older, and more common loader and extension manager, available from   glew.sourceforge.net.  Using GLM for mathematics Mathematics is core to all of computer graphics. In earlier versions, OpenGL provided support  for managing coordinate transformations and projections using the standard matrix stacks   GL_MODELVIEW and GL_PROJECTION . In recent versions of core OpenGL however, all of  the functionality supporting the matrix stacks has been removed. Therefore, it is up to us to  provide our own support for the usual transformation and projection matrices, and then to  pass them into our shaders. Of course, we could write our own matrix and vector classes to  manage this, but some might prefer to use a ready-made, robust library.  One such library is GLM  OpenGL Mathematics  written by Christophe Riccio. Its design is  based on the GLSL specification, so the syntax is very similar to the mathematical support  in GLSL. For experienced GLSL programmers, this makes GLM very easy to use and familiar.  Additionally, it provides extensions that include functionality similar to some of the much- missed OpenGL functions such as glOrtho, glRotate, or gluLookAt.  13   Getting ready Since GLM is a header-only library, installation is simple. Download the latest GLM distribution  from http:  glm.g-truc.net. Then, unzip the archive file, and copy the glm directory  contained inside to anywhere in your compiler's include path.  How to do it... To use the GLM libraries, it is simply a matter of including the core header file, and headers  for any extensions. For this example, we'll include the matrix transform extension as follows:  include   include    Then the GLM classes are available in the glm namespace. The following is an example of  how you might go about making use of some of them:  glm::vec4 position = glm::vec4  1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f  ; glm::mat4 view = glm::lookAt  glm::vec3 0.0,0.0,5.0 ,         glm::vec3 0.0,0.0,0.0 ,         glm::vec3 0.0,1.0,0.0   ; glm::mat4 model 1.0f ;      The identity matrix model = glm::rotate  model, 90.0f, glm::vec3 0.0f,1.0f,0.0   ; glm::mat4 mv = view * model; glm::vec4 transformed = mv * position;  How it works... The GLM library is a header-only library. All of the implementation is included within the  header files. It doesn't require separate compilation and you don't need to link your program  to it. Just placing the header files in your include path is all that's required!  The previous example first creates a vec4  four coordinate vector  representing a position.  Then it creates a 4 x 4 view matrix by using the glm::lookAt function. This works in a  similar fashion to the old gluLookAt function. Here, we set the camera's location at  0, 0,  5 , looking towards the origin, with the "up" direction in the direction of the y-axis. We then go  on to create the model matrix by first storing the identity matrix in the variable model  via the  single argument constructor , and multiplying by a rotation matrix using the glm::rotate  function. The multiplication here is implicitly done by the glm::rotate function. It multiplies  its first parameter by the rotation matrix  on the right  that is generated by the function. The  second parameter is the angle of rotation  in degrees , and the third parameter is the axis of  rotation. Since before this statement, model is the identity matrix, the net result is that model  becomes a rotation matrix of 90 degrees around the y-axis.  14   Finally, we create our modelview matrix  mv  by multiplying the view and model variables,  and then using the combined matrix to transform the position. Note that the multiplication  operator has been overloaded to behave in the expected way.  There's more... It is not recommended to import all of the GLM namespace by using the following command:  This will most likely cause a number of namespace clashes. Instead, it is preferable to import  symbols one at a time, as needed. For example:  using namespace glm;  include   using glm::vec3; using glm::mat4;  Using the GLM types as input to OpenGL GLM supports directly passing a GLM type to OpenGL using one of the OpenGL vector  functions  with the suffix v  . For example, to pass a mat4 named proj to OpenGL we can use  the following code:  glm::mat4 proj = glm::perspective  viewAngle, aspect, nearDist,       farDist  ; glUniformMatrix4fv location, 1, GL_FALSE, &proj[0][0] ;  See also   f The Qt SDK includes many classes for vector matrix mathematics, and is another   good option if you're already using Qt   f The GLM website http:  glm.g-truc.net has additional documentation    and examples  Determining the GLSL and OpenGL version In order to support a wide range of systems, it is essential to be able to query for the supported  OpenGL and GLSL version of the current driver. It is quite simple to do so, and there are two  main functions involved: glGetString and glGetIntegerv.  15   How to do it... The code shown as follows will print the version information to stdout:  const GLubyte *renderer = glGetString  GL_RENDERER  ; const GLubyte *vendor = glGetString  GL_VENDOR  ; const GLubyte *version = glGetString  GL_VERSION  ; const GLubyte *glslVersion =         glGetString  GL_SHADING_LANGUAGE_VERSION  ;  GLint major, minor; glGetIntegerv GL_MAJOR_VERSION, &major ; glGetIntegerv GL_MINOR_VERSION, &minor ;  printf "GL Vendor            : %s\n", vendor ; printf "GL Renderer          : %s\n", renderer ; printf "GL Version  string   : %s\n", version ; printf "GL Version  integer  : %d.%d\n", major, minor ; printf "GLSL Version         : %s\n", glslVersion ;  How it works... Note that there are two different ways to retrieve the OpenGL version: using glGetString  and glGetIntegerv. The former can be useful for providing readable output, but may not  be as convenient for programmatically checking the version because of the need to parse  the string. The string provided by glGetString GL_VERSION  should always begin with  the major and minor versions separated by a dot, however, the minor version could be  followed with a vendor-specific build number. Additionally, the rest of the string can contain  additional vendor-specific information and may also include information about the selected  profile  see the Introduction section of this chapter . It is important to note that the use of  glGetIntegerv to query for version information requires OpenGL 3.0 or greater.  The queries for GL_VENDOR and GL_RENDERER provide additional information about the  OpenGL driver. The call glGetString GL_VENDOR  returns the company responsible for  the OpenGL implementation. The call to glGetString GL_RENDERER  provides the name  of the renderer which is specific to a particular hardware platform  such as the ATI Radeon HD  5600 Series . Note that both of these do not vary from release to release, so can be used to  determine the current platform.  Of more importance to us in the context of this book is the call to glGetString  GL_ SHADING_LANGUAGE_VERSION  which provides the supported GLSL version number.   This string should begin with the major and minor version numbers separated by a period,   but similar to the GL_VERSION query, may include other vendor-specific information.  16   There's more... It is often useful to query for the supported extensions of the current OpenGL implementation.  In versions prior to OpenGL 3.0, one could retrieve a full, space separated list of extension  names with the following code:  GLubyte *extensions = glGetString GL_EXTENSIONS ;  The string that is returned can be extremely long and parsing it can be susceptible to error if  not done carefully.  In OpenGL 3.0, a new technique was introduced, and the previous functionality was deprecated   and finally removed in 3.1 . Extension names are now indexed and can be individually queried  by index. We use the glGetStringi variant for this. For example, to get the name of the  extension stored at index i, we use: glGetStringi GL_EXTENSIONS, i . To print a list of  all extensions, we could use the following code:  GLint nExtensions; glGetIntegerv GL_NUM_EXTENSIONS, &nExtensions ;  for  int i = 0; i < nExtensions; i++         printf "%s\n", glGetStringi  GL_EXTENSIONS, i    ;  See also   f The GLLoadGen tool has additional support for querying version and extension  information. Refer to the Using a function loader to access the latest OpenGL  functionality recipe and the GLLoadGen website.  Compiling a shader To get started, we need to know how to compile our GLSL shaders. The GLSL compiler is  built right into the OpenGL library, and shaders can only be compiled within the context of a  running OpenGL program. There is currently no external tool for precompiling GLSL shaders  and or shader programs.  Recently, OpenGL 4.1 added the ability to save compiled  shader programs to a file, enabling OpenGL programs  to avoid the overhead of shader compilation by loading  pre-compiled shader programs.  17   Compiling a shader involves creating a shader object, providing the source code  as a string  or set of strings  to the shader object, and asking the shader object to compile the code. The  process is roughly represented by the following diagram:  Shader Source  Shader Source  ...  Shader Object  Compile  Getting ready To compile a shader, we'll need a basic example to work with. Let's start with the following  simple vertex shader. Save it in a file named basic.vert.  version 430  in vec3 VertexPosition; in vec3 VertexColor;  out vec3 Color;  void main   {    Color = VertexColor;    gl_Position = vec4  VertexPosition, 1.0  ; }  In case you're curious about what this code does, it works as a "pass-through" shader. It takes  the input attributes VertexPosition and VertexColor and passes them along to the  fragment shader via the output variables gl_Position and Color.  Next, we'll need to build a basic shell for an OpenGL program using a window toolkit that  supports OpenGL. Examples of cross-platform toolkits include GLFW, GLUT, FLTK, Qt, or  wxWidgets. Throughout this text, I'll make the assumption that you can create a basic OpenGL  program with your favorite toolkit. Virtually all toolkits have a hook for an initialization function,  a resize callback  called upon resizing of the window , and a drawing callback  called for  each window refresh . For the purposes of this recipe, we need a program that creates and  initializes an OpenGL context, it need not do anything other than display an empty OpenGL  window. Note that you'll also need to load the OpenGL function pointers  refer to the Using a  function loader to access the latest OpenGL functionality recipe .  18   Finally, load the shader source code into a character array named shaderCode. Don't forget  to add the null character at the end! This example assumes that the variable shaderCode  points to an array of GLchar that is properly terminated by a null character.  How to do it... To compile a shader, use the following steps:  1.  Create the shader object as follows:  GLuint vertShader = glCreateShader  GL_VERTEX_SHADER  ; if  0 == vertShader   {   fprintf stderr, "Error creating vertex shader.\n" ;   exit EXIT_FAILURE ; }  2.  Copy the source code  perhaps from multiple locations  into the shader object: const GLchar * shaderCode = loadShaderAsString "basic.vert" ; const GLchar* codeArray[] = {shaderCode}; glShaderSource  vertShader, 1, codeArray, NULL  ;  3.  Compile the shader:  glCompileShader  vertShader  ;  4.  Verify the compilation status:  GLint result; glGetShaderiv  vertShader, GL_COMPILE_STATUS, &result  ; if  GL_FALSE == result   {   fprintf stderr, "Vertex shader compilation failed!\n" ;    GLint logLen;   glGetShaderiv vertShader, GL_INFO_LOG_LENGTH, &logLen ;       if  logLen > 0     {     char * log = new char[logLen];            GLsizei written;     glGetShaderInfoLog vertShader, logLen, &written, log ;            fprintf stderr, "Shader log:\n%s", log ;     delete [] log;   } }  19   How it works... The first step is to create the shader object using the glCreateShader function. The argument  is the type of shader, and can be one of the following: GL_VERTEX_SHADER, GL_FRAGMENT_ SHADER, GL_GEOMETRY_SHADER, GL_TESS_EVALUATION_SHADER, GL_TESS_CONTROL_ SHADER, or  as of version 4.3  GL_COMPUTE_SHADER. In this case, since we are compiling a  vertex shader, we use GL_VERTEX_SHADER. This function returns the value used for referencing  the vertex shader object, sometimes called the object "handle". We store that value in the  variable vertShader. If an error occurs while creating the shader object, this function will  return 0, so we check for that and if it occurs, we print an appropriate message and terminate.  Following the creation of the shader object, we load the source code into the shader object  using the function glShaderSource. This function is designed to accept an array of strings  as  opposed to just a single one  in order to support the option of compiling multiple sources  files,  strings  at once. So before we call glShaderSource, we place a pointer to our source code into  an array named sourceArray. The first argument to glShaderSource is the handle to the  shader object. The second is the number of source code strings that are contained in the array.  The third argument is a pointer to an array of source code strings. The final argument is an array  of GLint values that contains the length of each source code string in the previous argument.  In the previous code, we pass a value of NULL, which indicates that each source code string  is terminated by a null character. If our source code strings were not null terminated then this  argument must be a valid array. Note that once this function returns, the source code has been  copied into OpenGL internal memory, so the memory used to store the source code can be freed.  The next step is to compile the source code for the shader. We do this by simply calling  glCompileShader, and passing the handle to the shader that is to be compiled. Of course,  depending on the correctness of the source code, the compilation may fail, so the next step is  to check whether or not the compilation was successful.  We can query for the compilation status by calling glGetShaderiv, which is a function for  querying the attributes of a shader object. In this case we are interested in the compilation  status, so we use GL_COMPILE_STATUS as the second argument. The first argument is of  course the handle to the shader object, and the third argument is a pointer to an integer  where the status will be stored. The function provides a value of either GL_TRUE or GL_FALSE  in the third argument indicating whether or not the compilation was successful.  If the compile status is GL_FALSE, then we can query for the shader log, which will provide  additional details about the failure. We do so by first querying for the length of the log by  calling glGetShaderiv again with a value of GL_INFO_LOG_LENGTH. This provides the  length of the log in the variable logLen. Note that this includes the null termination character.  We then allocate space for the log, and retrieve the log by calling glGetShaderInfoLog.  The first parameter is the handle to the shader object, the second is the size of the character  buffer for storing the log, the third argument is a pointer to an integer where the number of  characters actually written  excluding the null terminator character  will be stored, and the  fourth argument is a pointer to the character buffer for storing the log itself. Once the log is  retrieved, we print it to stderr and free its memory space.  20   There's more... The previous example only demonstrated compiling a vertex shader. There are several other  types of shaders including fragment, geometry, and tessellation shaders. The technique  for compiling is nearly identical for each shader type. The only significant difference is the  argument to glCreateShader.  It is also important to note that shader compilation is only the first step. To create a working  shader program, we often have at least two shaders to compile, and then the shaders must  be linked together into a shader program object. We'll see the steps involved in linking in the  next recipe.  Deleting a Shader Object Shader objects can be deleted when no longer needed by calling glDeleteShader. This  frees the memory used by the shader and invalidates its handle. Note that if a shader object is  already attached to a program object  refer to the Linking a shader program recipe , it will not  be immediately deleted, but flagged for deletion when it is detached from the program object.  See also   f The Linking a shader program recipe  Linking a shader program Once we have compiled our shaders and before we can actually install them into the OpenGL  pipeline, we need to link them together into a shader program. Among other things, the linking  step involves making the connections between input variables from one shader to output  variables of another, and making the connections between the input output variables of a  shader to appropriate locations in the OpenGL environment.  Linking involves steps that are similar to those involved in compiling a shader. We attach each  shader object to a new shader program object and then tell the shader program object to link   making sure that the shader objects are compiled before linking .  Shader Object  Shader Object  ...  attach  attach  Shader Program Object  Link  21   Getting ready For this recipe, we'll assume that you've already compiled two shader objects whose handles  are stored in the variables vertShader and fragShader.  For this and a few other recipes in this Chapter, we'll use the following source code for the  fragment shader:  version 430  in vec3 Color;  out vec4 FragColor;  void main   {   FragColor = vec4 Color, 1.0 ; }  For the vertex shader, we'll use the source code from the previous recipe, Compiling a shader.  How to do it... In our OpenGL initialization function, and after the compilation of shader objects referred to by  vertShader and fragShader, use the following steps:  1.  Create the program object using the following code: GLuint programHandle = glCreateProgram  ; if  0 == programHandle   {   fprintf stderr, "Error creating program object.\n" ;   exit 1 ; }  2.  Attach the shaders to the program object as follows:  glAttachShader  programHandle, vertShader  ; glAttachShader  programHandle, fragShader  ;  3.  Link the program:  glLinkProgram  programHandle  ;  4.  Verify the link status:  GLint status; glGetProgramiv  programHandle, GL_LINK_STATUS, &status  ; if  GL_FALSE == status   {    fprintf  stderr, "Failed to link shader program!\n"  ;    GLint logLen;  22     glGetProgramiv programHandle, GL_INFO_LOG_LENGTH,             &logLen ;   if  logLen > 0     {     char * log = new char[logLen];     GLsizei written;     glGetProgramInfoLog programHandle, logLen, &written, log ;     fprintf stderr, "Program log: \n%s", log ;     delete [] log;   } }  5.   If linking is successful, install the program into the OpenGL pipeline: else {   glUseProgram  programHandle  ; }  How it works... We start by calling glCreateProgram to create an empty program object. This function  returns a handle to the program object, which we store in a variable named programHandle.  If an error occurs with program creation, the function will return 0. We check for that, and if it  occurs, we print an error message and exit.  Next, we attach each shader to the program object using glAttachShader. The first  argument is the handle to the program object, and the second is the handle to the shader  object to be attached.  Then, we link the program by calling glLinkProgram, providing the handle to the program  object as the only argument. As with compilation, we check for the success or failure of the  link, with the subsequent query.  We check the status of the link by calling glGetProgramiv. Similar to glGetShaderiv,  glGetProgramiv allows us to query various attributes of the shader program. In this case,  we ask for the status of the link by providing GL_LINK_STATUS as the second argument. The  status is returned in the location pointed to by the third argument, in this case named status.  The link status is either GL_TRUE or GL_FALSE indicating the success or failure of the link.   If the value of status is GL_FALSE, we retrieve and display the program information log,   which should contain additional information and error messages. The program log is retrieved  by the call to glGetProgramInfoLog. The first argument is the handle to the program  object, the second is the size of the buffer to contain the log, the third is a pointer to a  GLsizei variable where the number of bytes written to the buffer will be stored  excluding the  null terminator , and the fourth is a pointer to the buffer that will store the log. The buffer can  be allocated based on the size returned by the call to glGetProgramiv with the parameter  GL_INFO_LOG_LENGTH. The string that is provided in log will be properly null terminated.  23   Finally, if the link is successful, we install the program into the OpenGL pipeline by calling  glUseProgram, providing the handle to the program as the argument.  With the simple fragment shader from this recipe and the vertex shader from the previous  recipe compiled, linked, and installed into the OpenGL pipeline, we have a complete OpenGL  pipeline and are ready to begin rendering. Drawing a triangle and supplying different values  for the Color attribute yields an image of a multi-colored triangle where the vertices are red,  green, and blue, and inside the triangle, the three colors are interpolated, causing a blending  of colors throughout.  There's more... You can use multiple shader programs within a single OpenGL program. They can be swapped  in and out of the OpenGL pipeline by calling glUseProgram to select the desired program.  Deleting a Shader program If a program is no longer needed, it can be deleted from OpenGL memory by calling  glDeleteProgram, providing the program handle as the only argument. This invalidates  the handle and frees the memory used by the program. Note that if the program object is  currently in use, it will not be immediately deleted, but will be flagged for deletion when it is no  longer in use.  Also, the deletion of a shader program detaches the shader objects that were attached to the  program but does not delete them unless those shader objects have already been flagged for  deletion by a previous call to glDeleteShader.  24   See also   f The Compiling a shader recipe  Sending data to a shader using vertex  attributes and vertex buffer objects The vertex shader is invoked once per vertex. Its main job is to process the data associated  with the vertex, and pass it  and possibly other information  along to the next stage of the  pipeline. In order to give our vertex shader something to work with, we must have some  way of providing  per-vertex  input to the shader. Typically, this includes the vertex position,  normal vector, and texture coordinates  among other things . In earlier versions of OpenGL   prior to 3.0 , each piece of vertex information had a specific "channel" in the pipeline. It was  provided to the shaders using functions such as glVertex, glTexCoord, and glNormal   or within client vertex arrays using glVertexPointer, glTexCoordPointer, or  glNormalPointer . The shader would then access these values via built-in variables such  as gl_Vertex and gl_Normal. This functionality was deprecated in OpenGL 3.0 and later  removed. Instead, vertex information must now be provided using generic vertex attributes,  usually in conjunction with  vertex  buffer objects. The programmer is now free to define an  arbitrary set of per-vertex attributes to provide as input to the vertex shader. For example,  in order to implement normal mapping, the programmer might decide that position, normal  vector and tangent vector should be provided along with each vertex. With OpenGL 4, it's easy  to define this as the set of input attributes. This gives us a great deal of flexibility to define our  vertex information in any way that is appropriate for our application, but may require a bit of  getting used to for those of us who are used to the old way of doing things.  In the vertex shader, the per-vertex input attributes are defined by using the GLSL qualifier in.  For example, to define a 3-component vector input attribute named VertexColor, we use  the following code:  in vec3 VertexColor;  Of course, the data for this attribute must be supplied by the OpenGL program. To do so,  we make use of vertex buffer objects. The buffer object contains the values for the input  attribute. In the main OpenGL program we make the connection between the buffer and the  input attribute and define how to "step through" the data. Then, when rendering, OpenGL pulls  data for the input attribute from the buffer for each invocation of the vertex shader.  25   For this recipe, we'll draw a single triangle. Our vertex attributes will be position and color.  We'll use a fragment shader to blend the colors of each vertex across the triangle to produce  an image similar to the one shown as follows. The vertices of the triangle are red, green, and  blue, and the interior of the triangle has those three colors blended together. The colors may  not be visible in the printed text, but the variation in the shade should indicate the blending.  Getting ready We'll start with an empty OpenGL program, and the following shaders:  The vertex shader  basic.vert :  version 430  layout  location=0  in vec3 VertexPosition; layout  location=1  in vec3 VertexColor;  out vec3 Color;  void main   {   Color = VertexColor;    gl_Position = vec4 VertexPosition,1.0 ; }  Attributes are the input variables to a vertex shader. In the previous code, there are two input  attributes: VertexPosition and VertexColor. They are specified using the GLSL keyword  in. Don't worry about the layout prefix, we'll discuss that later. Our main OpenGL program  needs to supply the data for these two attributes for each vertex. We will do so by mapping our  polygon data to these variables.  26   It also has one output variable named Color, which is sent to the fragment shader. In  this case, Color is just an unchanged copy of VertexColor. Also, note that the attribute  VertexPosition is simply expanded and passed along to the built-in output variable   gl_Position for further processing.  The fragment shader  basic.frag :  version 430  in vec3 Color;  out vec4 FragColor;  void main   {   FragColor = vec4 Color, 1.0 ; }  There is just one input variable for this shader, Color. This links to the corresponding output  variable in the vertex shader, and will contain a value that has been interpolated across the  triangle based on the values at the vertices. We simply expand and copy this color to the  output variable FragColor  more about fragment shader output variables in later recipes .  Write code to compile and link these shaders into a shader program  see "Compiling a shader"  and "Linking a shader program" . In the following code, I'll assume that the handle to the  shader program is programHandle.  How to do it... Use the following steps to set up your buffer objects and render the triangle:  1.  Create a global  or private instance  variable to hold our handle to the vertex    2.  Within the initialization function, we create and populate the vertex buffer objects    array object: GLuint vaoHandle;  for each attribute: float positionData[] = {       -0.8f, -0.8f, 0.0f,       0.8f, -0.8f, 0.0f,       0.0f,  0.8f, 0.0f }; float colorData[] = {       1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f,       0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f,       0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f };  27      Create and populate the buffer objects GLuint vboHandles[2]; glGenBuffers 2, vboHandles ; GLuint positionBufferHandle = vboHandles[0]; GLuint colorBufferHandle = vboHandles[1];     Populate the position buffer glBindBuffer GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, positionBufferHandle ; glBufferData GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, 9 * sizeof float ,         positionData, GL_STATIC_DRAW ;     Populate the color buffer glBindBuffer GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, colorBufferHandle ; glBufferData GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, 9 * sizeof float , colorData,         GL_STATIC_DRAW ;  3.  Create and define a vertex array object, which defines the relationship between the  buffers and the input attributes.  See "There's more…" for an alternate way to do this  that is valid for OpenGL 4.3 and later.     Create and set-up the vertex array object glGenVertexArrays  1, &vaoHandle  ; glBindVertexArray vaoHandle ;     Enable the vertex attribute arrays glEnableVertexAttribArray 0 ;     Vertex position glEnableVertexAttribArray 1 ;     Vertex color     Map index 0 to the position buffer glBindBuffer GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, positionBufferHandle ; glVertexAttribPointer 0, 3, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, 0, NULL ;     Map index 1 to the color buffer glBindBuffer GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, colorBufferHandle ; glVertexAttribPointer 1, 3, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, 0, NULL ;  4.   In the render function, we bind to the vertex array object and call glDrawArrays to  initiate rendering: glBindVertexArray vaoHandle ; glDrawArrays GL_TRIANGLES, 0, 3  ;  28   How it works... Vertex attributes are the input variables to our vertex shader. In the given vertex shader,  our two attributes are VertexPosition and VertexColor. The main OpenGL program  refers to vertex attributes by associating each  active  input variable with a generic attribute  index. These generic indices are simply integers between 0 and GL_MAX_VERTEX_ATTRIBS  – 1. We can specify the relationship between these indices and the attributes using the  layout qualifier. For example, in our vertex shader, we use the layout qualifier to assign  VertexPosition to attribute index 0 and VertexColor to attribute index 1.  layout  location = 0  in vec3 VertexPosition; layout  location = 1  in vec3 VertexColor;  We refer to the vertex attributes in our OpenGL code, by referring to the corresponding generic  vertex attribute index.  It is not strictly necessary to explicitly specify the mappings  between attribute variables and generic attribute indexes, because  OpenGL will automatically map active vertex attributes to generic  indexes when the program is linked. We could then query for  the mappings and determine the indexes that correspond to the  shader's input variables. It may be somewhat more clear however,  to explicitly specify the mapping as we do in this example.  The first step involves setting up a pair of buffer objects to store our position and color data.  As with most OpenGL objects, we start by creating the objects and acquiring handles to the  two buffers by calling glGenBuffers. We then assign each handle to a separate descriptive  variable to make the following code more clear.  For each buffer object, we first bind the buffer to the GL_ARRAY_BUFFER binding point by  calling glBindBuffer. The first argument to glBindBuffer is the target binding point. In  this case, since the data is essentially a generic array, we use GL_ARRAY_BUFFER. Examples  of other kinds of targets  such as GL_UNIFORM_BUFFER, or GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER   will be seen in later examples. Once our buffer object is bound, we can populate the buffer  with our vertex color data by calling glBufferData. The second and third arguments to this  function are the size of the array and a pointer to the array containing the data. Let's focus on  the first and last arguments. The first argument indicates the target buffer object. The data  provided in the third argument is copied into the buffer that is bound to this binding point.  The last argument is one that gives OpenGL a hint about how the data will be used so that it  can determine how best to manage the buffer internally. For full details about this argument,  take a look into the OpenGL documentation. In our case, the data is specified once, will not  be modified, and will be used many times for drawing operations, so this usage pattern best  corresponds to the value GL_STATIC_DRAW.  29   Now that we have set up our buffer objects, we tie them together into a Vertex Array Object   VAO . The VAO contains information about the connections between the data in our buffers  and the input vertex attributes. We create a VAO using the function glGenVertexArrays.  This gives us a handle to our new object, which we store in the  global  variable  vaoHandle. Then we enable the generic vertex attribute indexes 0 and 1 by calling  glEnableVertexAttribArray. Doing so indicates that that the values for the   attributes will be accessed and used for rendering.  The next step makes the connection between the buffer objects and the generic vertex  attribute indexes.     Map index 0 to the position buffer glBindBuffer GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, positionBufferHandle ; glVertexAttribPointer  0, 3, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, 0, NULL  ;  First we bind the buffer object to the GL_ARRAY_BUFFER binding point, then we call  glVertexAttribPointer, which tells OpenGL which generic index that the data should be  used with, the format of the data stored in the buffer object, and where it is located within the  buffer object that is bound to the GL_ARRAY_BUFFER binding point. The first argument is the  generic attribute index. The second is the number of components per vertex attribute  1, 2, 3,   or 4 . In this case, we are providing 3-dimensional data, so we want 3 components per vertex.  The third argument is the data type of each component in the buffer. The fourth is a Boolean  which specifies whether or not the data should be automatically normalized  mapped to a range  of [-1, 1] for signed integral values or [0, 1] for unsigned integral values . The fifth argument  is the stride, which indicates the byte offset between consecutive attributes. Since our data is  tightly packed, we can use a value of zero. The last argument is a pointer, which is not treated as  a pointer! Instead, its value is interpreted as a byte offset from the beginning of the buffer to the  first attribute in the buffer. In this case, there is no additional data in either buffer before the first  element, so we use a value of zero.  The glVertexAttribPointer function stores  in the VAO's state   a pointer to the buffer currently bound to the GL_ARRAY_BUFFER  binding point. When another buffer is bound to that binding point, it  does not change the value of the pointer.  The VAO stores all of the OpenGL state related to the relationship between buffer objects and  the generic vertex attributes, as well as the information about the format of the data in the  buffer objects. This allows us to quickly return all of this state when rendering. The VAO is an  extremely important concept, but can be tricky to understand. It's important to remember  that the VAO's state is primarily associated with the enabled attributes and their connection  to buffer objects. It doesn't necessarily keep track of buffer bindings. For example, it doesn't  remember what is bound to the GL_ARRAY_BUFFER binding point. We only bind to this point  in order to set up the pointers via glVertexAttribPointer.  30   Once we have the VAO set up  a one-time operation , we can issue a draw command to render  our image. In our render function, we clear the color buffer using glClear, bind to the vertex  array object, and call glDrawArrays to draw our triangle. The function glDrawArrays  initiates rendering of primitives by stepping through the buffers for each enabled attribute  array, and passing the data down the pipeline to our vertex shader. The first argument is the  render mode  in this case we are drawing triangles , the second is the starting index in the  enabled arrays, and the third argument is the number of indices to be rendered  3 vertexes   for a single triangle .  To summarize, we followed these steps:  1.  Make sure to specify the generic vertex attribute indexes for each attribute in the   vertex shader using the layout qualifier.  2.  Create and populate the buffer objects for each attribute. 3.  Create and define the vertex array object by calling glVertexAttribPointer while   the appropriate buffer is bound.  4.  When rendering, bind to the vertex array object and call glDrawArrays, or other   appropriate rendering function  e.g. glDrawElements .  There's more... In the following, we'll discuss some details, extensions, and alternatives to the   previous technique.  Separate attribute format With OpenGL 4.3, we have an alternate  arguably better  way of specifying the vertex array  object state  attribute format, enabled attributes, and buffers . In the previous example, the  glVertexAttribPointer function does two important things. First, it indirectly specifies  which buffer contains the data for the attribute, which is the buffer currently bound  at the  time of the call  to GL_ARRAY_BUFFER. Secondly, it specifies the format of that data  type,  offset, stride, and so on . It is arguably clearer to separate these two concerns into their  own functions. This is exactly what has been implemented in OpenGL 4.3. For example, to  implement the same functionality as in step 3 of the previous How to do it… section, we   would use the following code:  glGenVertexArrays 1, &vaoHandle ; glBindVertexArray vaoHandle ; glEnableVertexArray 0 ; glEnableVertexArray 1 ;  glBindVertexBuffer 0, positionBufferHandle, 0, sizeof GLfloat *3 ; glBindVertexBuffer 1, colorBufferHandle, 0, sizeof GLfloat *3 ;  31   glVertexAttribFormat 0, 3, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, 0 ; glVertexAttribBinding 0, 0 ; glVertexAttribFormat 1, 3, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, 0 ; glVertexAttribBinding 1, 1 ;  The first four lines of the previous code are exactly the same as in the first example. We create  and bind to the VAO, then enable attributes 0 and 1. Next, we bind our two buffers to two  different indexes within the vertex buffer binding point using glBindVertexBuffer. Note that  we're no longer using GL_ARRAY_BUFFER binding point. Instead, we now have a new binding  point specifically for vertex buffers. This binding point has several indexes  usually from 0 - 15 ,  so we can bind multiple buffers to this point. The first argument to glBindVertexBuffer  specifies the index within the vertex buffer binding point. Here, we bind our position buffer to  index 0 and our color buffer to index 1.  Note that the indexes within the vertex buffer binding point  need not be the same as the attribute locations.  The other arguments to glBindVertexBuffer are as follows. The second argument is the  buffer to be bound, the third is the offset from the beginning of the buffer to where the data  begins, and the fourth is the stride, which is the distance between successive elements within  the buffer. Unlike glVertexAttribPointer, we can't use a 0 value here for tightly packed  data, because OpenGL can't determine the size of the data without more information, so we  need to specify it explicitly here.  Next, we call glVertexAttribFormat to specify the format of the data for the attribute.  Note that this time, this is decoupled from the buffer that stores the data. Instead, we're just  specifying the format to expect for this attribute. The arguments are the same as the first four  arguments to glVertexAttribPointer.  The function glVertexAttribBinding specifies the relationship between buffers that are  bound to the vertex buffer binding point and attributes. The first argument is the attribute  location, and the second is the index within the vertex buffer binding point. In this example,  they are the same, but they need not be.  Also note that the buffer bindings of the vertex buffer binding point  specified by  glBindVertexBuffer  are part of the VAO state, unlike the binding to GL_ARRAY_BUFFER,  which is not.  This version is arguably more clear and easy to understand. It removes the confusing aspects  of the "invisible" pointers that are managed in the VAO, and makes the relationship between  attributes and buffers much more clear with glVertexAttribBinding. Additionally, it  separates concerns that really need not be combined.  32   Fragment shader output You may have noticed that I've neglected to say anything about the output variable FragColor  in the fragment shader. This variable receives the final output color for each fragment  pixel .  Like vertex input variables, this variable also needs to be associated with a proper location.  Of course, we typically would like this to be linked to the back color buffer, which by default   in double buffered systems  is "color number" zero.  The relationship of the color numbers to  render buffers can be changed by using glDrawBuffers . In this program, we are relying on  the fact that the linker will automatically link our only fragment output variable to color number  zero. To explicitly do so, we could  and probably should  have used a layout qualifier in the  fragment shader:  layout  location = 0  out vec4 FragColor;  We are free to define multiple output variables for a fragment shader, thereby enabling us to  render to multiple output buffers. This can be quite useful for specialized algorithms such as  deferred rendering  see Chapter 5, Image Processing and Screen Space Techniques .  Specifying attribute indexes without using layout qualifiers If you'd rather not clutter up your vertex shader code with the layout qualifiers  or you're  using a version of OpenGL that doesn't support them , you can define the attribute indexes  within the OpenGL program. We can do so by calling glBindAttribLocation just prior to  linking the shader program. For example, we'd add the following code to the main OpenGL  program just before the link step:  glBindAttribLocation programHandle, 0, "VertexPosition" ; glBindAttribLocation programHandle, 1, "VertexColor" ;  This would indicate to the linker that VertexPosition should correspond to generic  attribute index 0 and VertexColor to index 1.  Similarly, we can specify the color number for fragment shader output variables without using  the layout qualifier. We do so by calling glBindFragDataLocation prior to linking the  shader program:  glBindFragDataLocation programHandle, 0, "FragColor" ;  This would tell the linker to bind the output variable FragColor to color number 0.  Using element arrays It is often the case that we need to step through our vertex arrays in a non-linear fashion.  In other words, we may want to "jump around" the data rather than just moving through it  from beginning to end as we did in this example. For example, we might want to draw a cube  where the vertex data consists of only eight positions  the corners of the cube . In order to  draw the cube, we would need to draw 12 triangles  2 for each face , each of which consists  of 3 vertices. All of the needed position data is in the original 8 positions, but to draw all the  triangles, we'll need to jump around and use each position for at least three different triangles.  33   To jump around in our vertex arrays, we can make use of element arrays. The element array  is another buffer that defines the indices used when stepping through the vertex arrays. For  details on using element arrays, take a look at the function glDrawElements in the OpenGL  documentation  http:  www.opengl.org sdk docs man .  Interleaved arrays In this example, we used two buffers  one for color and one for position . Instead, we could  have used just a single buffer and combined all of the data. In general, it is possible to  combine the data for multiple attributes into a single buffer. The data for multiple attributes  can be interleaved within an array, such that all of the data for a given vertex is grouped  together within the buffer. Doing so just requires careful use of the stride argument to  glVertexAttribPointer or glBindVertexBuffer. Take a look at the documentation   for full details  http:  www.opengl.org sdk docs man .  The decision about when to use interleaved arrays and when to use separate arrays, is highly  dependent on the situation. Interleaved arrays may bring better results due to the fact that  data is accessed together and resides closer in memory  so-called locality of reference ,  resulting in better caching performance.  Getting a list of active vertex input  attributes and locations As covered in the previous recipe, the input variables within a vertex shader are linked  to generic vertex attribute indices at the time the program is linked. If we need to specify  the relationship, we can either use layout qualifiers within the shader, or we could call  glBindAttribLocation before linking.  However, it may be preferable to let the linker create the mappings automatically and query  for them after program linking is complete. In this recipe, we'll see a simple example that  prints all the active attributes and their indices.  Getting ready Start with an OpenGL program that compiles and links a shader pair. You could use the  shaders from the previous recipe.  As in previous recipes, we'll assume that the handle to the shader program is stored in a  variable named programHandle.  34   How to do it... After linking and enabling the shader program, use the following code to display the list of  active attributes:  1.  Start by querying for the number of active attributes:  GLint numAttribs; glGetProgramInterfaceiv programHandle, GL_PROGRAM_INPUT,         GL_ACTIVE_RESOURCES, &numAttribs ;  2.  Loop through each attribute and query for the length of the name, the type and the   attribute location, and print the results to standard out:  GLenum properties[] = {GL_NAME_LENGTH, GL_TYPE,         GL_LOCATION};  printf "Active attributes:\n" ; for  int i = 0; i < numAttribs; ++i   {   GLint results[3];   glGetProgramResourceiv programHhandle, GL_PROGRAM_INPUT,         i, 3, properties, 3, NULL, results ;    GLint nameBufSize = results[0] + 1;   char * name = new char[nameBufSize];   glGetProgramResourceName programHandle,         GL_PROGRAM_INPUT, i, nameBufSize, NULL, name ;   printf "%-5d %s  %s \n", results[2],         name, getTypeString results[1]  ;   delete [] name; }  How it works... In step 1, we query for the number of active attributes, by calling  glGetProgramInterfaceiv. The first argument is the handle to the program object, and  the second  GL_PROGRAM_INPUT  indicates that we are querying for information about the  program input variables  the vertex attributes . The third argument  GL_ACTIVE_RESOURCES   indicates that we want the number of active resources. The result is stored in the location  pointed to by the last argument numAttribs.  35   Now that we have the number of attributes, we query for information about each one. The  indices of the attributes run from 0 to numAttribs-1. We loop over those indices and  for each we call glGetProgramResourceiv to get the length of the name, the type and  the location. We specify what information we would like to receive by means of an array of  GLenum values called properties. The first argument is the handle to the program object,  the second is the resource that we are querying  GL_PROGRAM_INPUT . The third is the index  of the attribute, the fourth is the number of values in the properties array, which is the fifth  argument. The properties array contains GLenums, which specify the specific properties we  would like to receive. In this example, the array contains: GL_NAME_LENGTH, GL_TYPE, and  GL_LOCATION, which indicates that we want the length of the attribute's name, the data type  of the attribute and its location. The sixth argument is the size of the buffer that will receive  the results; the seventh argument is a pointer to an integer that would receive the number of  results that were written. If that argument is NULL, then no information is provided. Finally,  the last argument is a pointer to a GLint array that will receive the results. Each item in the  properties array corresponds to the same index in the results array.  Next, we retrieve the name of the attribute by allocating a buffer to store the name and  calling glGetProgramResourceName. The results array contains the length of the  name in the first element, so we allocate an array of that size with an extra character  just for good measure. The OpenGL documentation says that the size returned from  glGetProgramResourceiv includes the null terminator, but it doesn't hurt to make sure  by making a bit of additional space. In my tests, I've found this to be necessary on the latest  NVIDIA drivers.  Finally, we get the name by calling glGetProgramResourceName, and then print the  information to the screen. We print the attribute's location, name and type. The location is  available in the third element of the results array, and the type is in the second. Note the use  of the function getTypeString. This is a simple custom function that just returns a string  representation of the data type. The data type is represented by one of the OpenGL defined  constants GL_FLOAT, GL_FLOAT_VEC2, GL_FLOAT_VEC3, and so on. The getTypeString  function consists of just one big switch statement returning a human-readable string  corresponding to the value of the parameter  see the source code for glslprogram.cpp in  the example code for this book .  The output of the previous code looks like this when it is run on the shaders from the   previous recipes:  Active attributes:  1    VertexColor  vec3   0    VertexPosition  vec3   36   There's more... It should be noted that in order for a vertex shader input variable to be considered active, it  must be used within the vertex shader. In other words, a variable is considered active if it is  determined by the GLSL linker that it may be accessed during program execution. If a variable  is declared within a shader, but not used, the previous code will not display the variable  because it is not considered active and effectively ignored by OpenGL.  The previous code is only valid for OpenGL 4.3 and later. Alternatively, you can achieve  similar results with the functions glGetProgramiv, glGetActiveAttrib and  glGetAttribLocation.  See also   f The Compiling a shader recipe  f The Linking a shader program recipe  f The Sending data to a shader using vertex attributes and vertex buffer objects recipe  Sending data to a shader using uniform  variables Vertex attributes provide one avenue for providing input to shaders; a second technique  is uniform variables. Uniform variables are intended to be used for data that may change  relatively infrequently compared to per-vertex attributes. In fact, it is simply not possible to set  per-vertex attributes with uniform variables. For example, uniform variables are well suited for  the matrices used for modeling, viewing, and projective transformations.  Within a shader, uniform variables are read-only. Their values can only be changed from  outside the shader, via the OpenGL API. However, they can be initialized within the shader   by assigning to a constant value along with the declaration.  Uniform variables can appear in any shader within a shader program, and are always used  as input variables. They can be declared in one or more shaders within a program, but if a  variable with a given name is declared in more than one shader, its type must be the same in  all shaders. In other words, the uniform variables are held in a shared uniform namespace for  the entire shader program.  37   In this recipe, we'll draw the same triangle as in previous recipes in this chapter, however, this  time, we'll rotate the triangle using a uniform matrix variable.  Getting ready We'll use the following vertex shader:  version 430  layout  location = 0  in vec3 VertexPosition; layout  location = 1  in vec3 VertexColor;  out vec3 Color;  uniform mat4 RotationMatrix;  void main   {   Color = VertexColor;   gl_Position = RotationMatrix * vec4 VertexPosition,1.0 ; }  Note the variable RotationMatrix is declared using the uniform qualifier. We'll provide the  data for this variable via the OpenGL program.  The RotationMatrix is also used to transform  VertexPosition before assigning it to the default output position variable gl_Position.  38   We'll use the same fragment shader as in previous recipes:  version 430  in vec3 Color;  layout  location = 0  out vec4 FragColor;  void main   {   FragColor = vec4 Color, 1.0 ; }  Within the main OpenGL code, we determine the rotation matrix and send it to the shader's  uniform variable. To create our rotation matrix, we'll use the GLM library  see the Using the  GLM for mathematics recipe in this chapter . Within the main OpenGL code, add the following  include statements:  include   using glm::mat4; using glm::vec3;  include    We'll also assume that code has been written to compile and link the shaders, and to create  the vertex array object for the color triangle. We'll assume that the handle to the vertex array  object is vaoHandle, and the handle to the program object is programHandle.  How to do it... Within the render method, use the following code:  glClear GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT ;  mat4 rotationMatrix = glm::rotate mat4 1.0f , angle,         vec3 0.0f,0.0f,1.0f  ;  GLuint location = glGetUniformLocation programHandle,        "RotationMatrix" ;  if  location >= 0   {   glUniformMatrix4fv location, 1, GL_FALSE,         &rotationMatrix[0][0] ; }  glBindVertexArray vaoHandle ; glDrawArrays GL_TRIANGLES, 0, 3  ;  39   How it works... The steps involved with setting the value of a uniform variable include finding the location of  the variable, then assigning a value to that location using one of the glUniform functions.  In this example, we start by clearing the color buffer, then creating a rotation  matrix using GLM. Next, we query for the location of the uniform variable by calling  glGetUniformLocation. This function takes the handle to the shader program object,   and the name of the uniform variable and returns its location. If the uniform variable is not   an active uniform variable, the function returns -1.  We then assign a value to the uniform variable's location using glUniformMatrix4fv. The  first argument is the uniform variable's location. The second is the number of matrices that  are being assigned  note that the uniform variable could be an array . The third is a Boolean  value indicating whether or not the matrix should be transposed when loaded into the uniform  variable. With GLM matrices, a transpose is not required, so we use GL_FALSE here. If you  were implementing the matrix using an array, and the data was in row-major order, you might  need to use GL_TRUE for this argument. The last argument is a pointer to the data for the  uniform variable.  There's more... Of course uniform variables can be any valid GLSL type including complex types such  as arrays or structures. OpenGL provides a glUniform function with the usual suffixes,  appropriate for each type. For example, to assign to a variable of type vec3, one would use  glUniform3f or glUniform3fv.  For arrays, one can use the functions ending in "v" to initialize multiple values within the array.  Note that if it is desired, one can query for the location of a particular element of the uniform  array using the [] operator. For example, to query for the location of the second element of  MyArray:  GLuint location =     glGetUniformLocation  programHandle, "MyArray[1]"  ;  For structures, the members of the structure must be initialized individually. As with arrays,  one can query for the location of a member of a structure using something like the following:  GLuint location =     glGetUniformLocation  programHandle, "MyMatrices.Rotation"  ;  Where the structure variable is MyMatrices and the member of the structure is Rotation.  40   See also   f The Compiling a shader recipe  f The Linking a shader program recipe  f The Sending data to a shader using vertex attributes and vertex buffer objects recipe  Getting a list of active uniform variables While it is a simple process to query for the location of an individual uniform variable, there  may be instances where it can be useful to generate a list of all active uniform variables. For  example, one might choose to create a set of variables to store the location of each uniform and  assign their values after the program is linked. This would avoid the need to query for uniform  locations when setting the value of the uniform variables, creating slightly more efficient code.  The process for listing uniform variables is very similar to the process for listing attributes    see the Getting a list of active vertex input attributes and locations recipe , so this recipe   will refer the reader back to the previous recipe for detailed explanation.  Getting ready Start with a basic OpenGL program that compiles and links a shader program. In the following,  we'll assume that the handle to the program is in a variable named programHandle.  How to do it… After linking and enabling the shader program, use the following code to display the list of  active uniforms:  1.  Start by querying for the number of active uniform variables:  GLint numUniforms = 0; glGetProgramInterfaceiv  handle, GL_UNIFORM,     GL_ACTIVE_RESOURCES, &numUniforms ;  2.  Loop through each uniform index and query for the length of the name, the type, the   location and the block index: GLenum properties[] = {GL_NAME_LENGTH, GL_TYPE,     GL_LOCATION, GL_BLOCK_INDEX};  printf "Active uniforms:\n" ; for  int i = 0; i < numUniforms; ++i   {   GLint results[4];   glGetProgramResourceiv handle, GL_UNIFORM, i, 4,         properties, 4, NULL, results ;  41     if  results[3] != -1            continue;          Skip uniforms in blocks    GLint nameBufSize = results[0] + 1;   char * name = new char[nameBufSize];   glGetProgramResourceName handle, GL_UNIFORM, i,         nameBufSize, NULL, name ; printf "%-5d %s  %s \n", results[2], name,         getTypeString results[1]  ;   delete [] name; }  How it works... The process is very similar to the process shown in the recipe Getting a list of active vertex  input attributes and locations. I will focus on the main differences.  First and most obvious is that we use GL_UNIFORM instead of GL_PROGRAM_INPUT   as the interface that we are querying in glGetProgramResourceiv and  glGetProgramInterfaceiv.  Second, we query for the block index  using GL_BLOCK_INDEX  in the properties array . The reason for this is that some uniform variables are contained  within a uniform block  see the recipe Using uniform blocks and uniform buffer objects . For this  example, we only want information about uniforms that are not within blocks. The block index  will be -1 if the uniform variable is not within a block, so we skip any uniform variables that do  not have a block index of -1.  Again, we use the getTypeString function to convert the type value into a human-readable  string  see example code .  When this is run on the shader program from the previous recipe, we see the following output:  Active uniforms: 0    RotationMatrix  mat4   There's more... As with vertex attributes, a uniform variable is not considered active unless it is determined by  the GLSL linker that it will be used within the shader.  The previous code is only valid for OpenGL 4.3 and later. Alternatively, you can achieve  similar results using the functions glGetProgramiv, glGetActiveUniform,  glGetUniformLocation, and glGetActiveUniformName.  See also  42   f The Sending data to a shader using uniform variables recipe   Using uniform blocks and uniform   buffer objects If your program involves multiple shader programs that use the same uniform variables, one has  to manage the variables separately for each program. Uniform locations are generated when a  program is linked, so the locations of the uniforms may change from one program to the next.  The data for those uniforms may have to be regenerated and applied to the new locations.  Uniform blocks were designed to ease the sharing of uniform data between programs.  With uniform blocks, one can create a buffer object for storing the values of all the uniform  variables, and bind the buffer to the uniform block. When changing programs, the same buffer  object need only be re-bound to the corresponding block in the new program.  A uniform block is simply a group of uniform variables defined within a syntactical structure  known as a uniform block. For example, in this recipe, we'll use the following uniform block:  uniform BlobSettings {   vec4 InnerColor;   vec4 OuterColor;   float RadiusInner;   float RadiusOuter; };  This defines a block with the name BlobSettings that contains four uniform variables. With  this type of block definition, the variables within the block are still part of the global scope and  do not need to be qualified with the block name.  The buffer object used to store the data for the uniforms is often referred to as a uniform  buffer object. We'll see that a uniform buffer object is simply just a buffer object that is bound  to a certain location.  For this recipe, we'll use a simple example to demonstrate the use of uniform buffer objects  and uniform blocks. We'll draw a quad  two triangles  with texture coordinates, and use our  fragment shader to fill the quad with a fuzzy circle. The circle is a solid color in the center, but  at its edge, it gradually fades to the background color, as shown in the following image:  43   Getting ready Start with an OpenGL program that draws two triangles to form a quad. Provide the position  at vertex attribute location 0, and the texture coordinate  0 to 1 in each direction  at vertex  attribute location 1  see the Sending data to a shader using vertex attributes and vertex  buffer objects recipe .  We'll use the following vertex shader:  version 430  layout  location = 0  in vec3 VertexPosition; layout  location = 1  in vec3 VertexTexCoord;  out vec3 TexCoord;  void main   {   TexCoord = VertexTexCoord;   gl_Position = vec4 VertexPosition,1.0 ; }  The fragment shader contains the uniform block, and is responsible for drawing our   fuzzy circle:  version 430  in vec3 TexCoord; layout  location = 0  out vec4 FragColor;  layout  binding = 0  uniform BlobSettings {   vec4 InnerColor;   vec4 OuterColor;   float RadiusInner;   float RadiusOuter; };  void main   {   float dx = TexCoord.x - 0.5;   float dy = TexCoord.y - 0.5;   float dist = sqrt dx * dx + dy * dy ;   FragColor =     mix  InnerColor, OuterColor,        smoothstep  RadiusInner, RadiusOuter, dist   ; }  44   Note the uniform block named BlobSettings. The variables within this block define the  parameters of our fuzzy circle. The variable OuterColor defines the color outside of the  circle. InnerColor is the color inside of the circle. RadiusInner is the radius defining the  part of the circle that is a solid color  inside the fuzzy edge , and the distance from the center  of the circle to the inner edge of the fuzzy boundary. RadiusOuter is the outer edge of the  fuzzy boundary of the circle  when the color is equal to OuterColor .  The code within the main function computes the distance of the texture coordinate to the center  of the quad located at  0.5, 0.5 . It then uses that distance to compute the color by using the  smoothstep function. This function provides a value that smoothly varies between 0.0 and  1.0 when the value of the third argument is between the values of the first two arguments.  Otherwise it returns 0.0 or 1.0 depending on whether dist is less than the first or greater  than the second, respectively. The mix function is then used to linearly interpolate between  InnerColor and OuterColor based on the value returned by the smoothstep function.  How to do it... In the OpenGL program, after linking the shader program, use the following steps to assign  data to the uniform block in the fragment shader:  1.  Get the index of the uniform block using glGetUniformBlockIndex.  GLuint blockIndex = glGetUniformBlockIndex programHandle,     "BlobSettings" ;  2.  Allocate space for the buffer to contain the data for the uniform block.  We get the   size using glGetActiveUniformBlockiv: GLint blockSize; glGetActiveUniformBlockiv programHandle, blockIndex,         GL_UNIFORM_BLOCK_DATA_SIZE, &blockSize ;  GLubyte * blockBuffer; blockBuffer =  GLubyte *  malloc blockSize ;  3.  Query for the offset of each variable within the block.  To do so, we first find the index   of each variable within the block: const GLchar *names[] = { "InnerColor", "OuterColor",        "RadiusInner", "RadiusOuter" }; GLuint indices[4]; glGetUniformIndices programHandle, 4, names, indices ;  GLint offset[4]; glGetActiveUniformsiv programHandle, 4, indices,         GL_UNIFORM_OFFSET, offset ;  45   4.  Place the data into the buffer at the appropriate offsets:     Store data within the buffer at the appropriate offsets GLfloat outerColor[] = {0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f}; GLfloat innerColor[] = {1.0f, 1.0f, 0.75f, 1.0f}; GLfloat innerRadius = 0.25f, outerRadius = 0.45f;  memcpy blockBuffer + offset[0], innerColor,         4 * sizeof GLfloat  ; memcpy blockBuffer + offset[1], outerColor,         4 * sizeof GLfloat  ; memcpy blockBuffer + offset[2], &innerRadius,         sizeof GLfloat  ; memcpy blockBuffer + offset[3], &outerRadius,         sizeof GLfloat  ;  5.  Create the buffer object and copy the data into it:  GLuint uboHandle; glGenBuffers  1, &uboHandle  ; glBindBuffer  GL_UNIFORM_BUFFER, uboHandle  ; glBufferData  GL_UNIFORM_BUFFER, blockSize, blockBuffer,         GL_DYNAMIC_DRAW  ;  6.  Bind the buffer object to the uniform buffer binding point at the index specified by the   binding layout qualifier in the fragment shader  0 : glBindBufferBase GL_UNIFORM_BUFFER, 0, uboHandle ;  How it works... Phew! This seems like a lot of work! However, the real advantage comes when using multiple  programs where the same buffer object can be used for each program. Let's take a look at  each step individually.  First we get the index of the uniform block by calling glGetUniformBlockIndex, then we  query for the size of the block by calling glGetActiveUniformBlockiv. After getting the  size, we allocate a temporary buffer named blockBuffer to hold the data for our block.  The layout of data within a uniform block is implementation dependent, and implementations  may use different padding and or byte alignment. So in order to accurately layout our data, we  need to query for the offset of each variable within the block. This is done in two steps. First,  we query for the index of each variable within the block by calling glGetUniformIndices.  This accepts an array of variable names  third argument  and returns the indices of the  variables in the array indices  fourth argument . Then we use the indices to query for the  offsets by calling glGetActiveUniformsiv. When the fourth argument is GL_UNIFORM_ OFFSET, this returns the offset of each variable in the array pointed to by the fifth argument.  This function can also be used to query for the size and type, however, in this case we choose  not to do so, to keep the code simple  albeit less general .  46   The next step involves filling our temporary buffer blockBuffer with the data for the uniforms  at the appropriate offsets. Here we use the standard library function memcpy to accomplish this.  Now that the temporary buffer is populated with the data with the appropriate layout, we can  create our buffer object and copy the data into the buffer object. We call glGenBuffers to  generate a buffer handle, and then bind that buffer to the GL_UNIFORM_BUFFER binding  point by calling glBindBuffer. The space is allocated within the buffer object and the data  is copied when glBufferData is called. We use GL_DYNAMIC_DRAW as the usage hint here  because uniform data may be changed somewhat often during rendering. Of course, this is  entirely dependent on the situation.  Finally, we associate the buffer object with the uniform block by calling glBindBufferBase.  This function binds to an index within a buffer binding point. Certain binding points are also  so-called "indexed buffer targets". This means that the target is actually an array of targets,  and glBindBufferBase allows us to bind to one index within the array. In this case, we  bind it to the index that we specified in the layout qualifier in the fragment shader: layout   binding = 0   see the "Getting ready…" section . These two indices must match.  You might be wondering why we use glBindBuffer and  glBindBufferBase with GL_UNIFORM_BUFFER. Aren't  these the same binding points used in two different contexts?  The answer is that the GL_UNIFORM_BUFFER point can be  used in each function with a slightly different meaning. With  glBindBuffer, we bind to a point that can be used for  filling or modifying a buffer, but can't be used as a source of  data for the shader. When we use glBindBufferBase, we  are binding to an index within a location that can be directly  sourced by the shader. Granted, that's a bit confusing.  There's more... If the data for a uniform block needs to be changed at some later time, one can call  glBufferSubData to replace all or part of the data within the buffer. If you do so, don't  forget to first bind the buffer to the generic binding point GL_UNIFORM_BUFFER.  Using an instance name with a uniform block A uniform block can have an optional instance name. For example, with our BlobSettings  block we could have used the instance name Blob, as shown here:  uniform BlobSettings {   vec4 InnerColor;   vec4 OuterColor;   float RadiusInner;   float RadiusOuter; } Blob;  47   In this case, the variables within the block are placed within a namespace qualified by the  instance name. Therefore our shader code needs to refer to them prefixed with the instance  name. For example:  FragColor =     mix  Blob.InnerColor, Blob.OuterColor,         smoothstep  Blob.RadiusInner, Blob.RadiusOuter, dist      ;  Additionally, we need to qualify the variable names  with the block name: BlobSettings   within the OpenGL code when querying for variable indices:  const GLchar *names[] = { "BlobSettings.InnerColor",        "BlobSettings.OuterColor", "BlobSettings. RadiusInner",       "BlobSettings.RadiusOuter" }; GLuint indices[4]; glGetUniformIndices programHandle, 4, names, indices ;  Using layout qualifiers with uniform blocks Since the layout of the data within a uniform buffer object is implementation dependent, it  required us to query for the variable offsets. However, one can avoid this by asking OpenGL  to use the standard layout std140. This is accomplished by using a layout qualifier when  declaring the uniform block. For example:  layout  std140   uniform BlobSettings {    };  The std140 layout is described in detail within the OpenGL specification document  available  at http:  www.opengl.org .  Other options for the layout qualifier that apply to uniform block layouts include packed  and shared. The packed qualifier simply states that the implementation is free to optimize  memory in whatever way it finds necessary  based on variable usage or other criteria . With  the packed qualifier, we still need to query for the offsets of each variable. The shared  qualifier guarantees that the layout will be consistent between multiple programs and program  stages provided that the uniform block declaration does not change. If you are planning to use  the same buffer object between multiple programs and or program stages, it is a good idea to  use the shared option.  There are two other layout qualifiers that are worth mentioning: row_major and   column_major. These define the ordering of data within the matrix type variables   within the uniform block.  48   One can use multiple  non-conflicting  qualifiers for a block. For example, to define a block  with both the row_major and shared qualifiers, we would use the following syntax:  layout  row_major, shared   uniform BlobSettings {    };  See also   f The Sending data to a shader using uniform variables recipe  Getting debug messages Prior to recent versions of OpenGL, the traditional way to get debug information was to call  glGetError. Unfortunately, that is an exceedingly tedious method for debugging a program.  The glGetError function returns an error code if an error has occurred at some point  previous to the time the function was called. This means that if we're chasing down a bug, we  essentially need to call glGetError after every function call to an OpenGL function, or do a  binary search-like process where we call it before and after a block of code, and then move  the two calls closer to each other until we determine the source of the error. What a pain!  Thankfully, as of OpenGL 4.3, we now have support for a more modern method for debugging.  Now we can register a debug callback function that will be executed whenever an error occurs,  or other informational message is generated. Not only that, but we can send our own custom  messages to be handled by the same callback, and we can filter the messages using a variety  of criteria.  Getting ready Create an OpenGL program with a debug context. While it is not strictly necessary to acquire  a debug context, we might not get messages that are as informative as when we are using  a debug context. To create an OpenGL context using GLFW with debugging enabled, use the  following function call prior to creating the window.  glfwWindowHint GLFW_OPENGL_DEBUG_CONTEXT, GL_TRUE ;  An OpenGL debug context will have debug messages enabled by default. If, however, you need  to enable debug messages explicitly, use the following call.  glEnable GL_DEBUG_OUTPUT ;  49   How to do it... Use the following steps:  1.  Create a callback function to receive the debug messages. The function must   conform to a specific prototype described in the OpenGL documentation. For this  example, we'll use the following one: void debugCallback GLenum source, GLenum type, GLuint id,         GLenum severity, GLsizei length,         const GLchar * message, void * param  {         Convert GLenum parameters to strings    printf "%s:%s[%s] %d : %s\n", sourceStr, typeStr,         severityStr, id, message ; }  2.  Register our callback with OpenGL using glDebugMessageCallback:  glDebugMessageCallback  debugCallback, NULL  ;  3.  Enable all messages, all sources, all levels, and all IDs:  glDebugMessageControl GL_DONT_CARE, GL_DONT_CARE,         GL_DONT_CARE, 0, NULL, GL_TRUE ;  How it works... The callback function debugCallback has several parameters, the most important of which  is the debug message itself  the sixth parameter, message . For this example, we simply print  the message to standard output, but we could send it to a log file or some other destination.  The first four parameters to debugCallback describe the source, type, id number, and severity  of the message. The id number is an unsigned integer specific to the message. The possible  values for the source, type and severity parameters are described in the following tables.  The source parameter can have any of the following values:  Source GL_DEBUG_SOURCE_API GL_DEBUG_SOURCE_WINDOW_SYSTEM GL_DEBUG_SOURCE_THIRD_PARTY GL_DEBUG_SOURCE_APPLICATION GL_DEBUG_SOURCE_OTHER  Generated By Calls to the OpenGL API Calls to a window system API An application associated with OpenGL This application itself. Some other source  50   The type parameter can have any of the following values:  Type GL_DEBUG_TYPE_ERROR GL_DEBUG_TYPE_DEPRECATED_BEHAVIOR GL_DEBUG_TYPE_UNDEFINED_BEHAVIOR GL_DEBUG_TYPE_PORTABILITIY GL_DEBUG_TYPE_PERFORMANCE GL_DEBUG_TYPE_MARKER GL_DEBUG_TYPE_PUSH_GROUP GL_DEBUG_TYPE_POP_GROUP GL_DEBUG_TYPE_OTHER  Description An error from the OpenGL API. Behavior that has been deprecated Undefined behaviour Some functionality is not portable. Possible performance issues An annotation Messages related to debug group push. Messages related to debug group pop. Other messages  The severity parameter can have the following values:  Severity GL_DEBUG_SEVERITY_HIGH GL_DEBUG_SEVERITY_MEDIUM  GL_DEBUG_SEVERITY_LOW  GL_DEBUG_SEVERITY_NOTIFICATION  Meaning Errors or dangerous behaviour Major performance warnings, other  warnings or use of deprecated functionality. Redundant state changes, unimportant  undefined behaviour. A notification, not an error or performance  issue.  The length parameter is the length of the message string, excluding the null terminator.  The last parameter param is a user-defined pointer. We can use this to point to some custom  object that might be helpful to the callback function. For example, if we were logging the  messages to a file, this could point to an object containing file I O capabilities. This parameter  can be set using the second parameter to glDebugMessageCallback  more on that in the  following content .  Within debugCallback we convert each GLenum parameter into a string. Due to space  constraints, I don't show all of that code here, but it can be found in the example code for this  book. We then print all of the information to standard output.  The call to glDebugMessageCallback registers our callback function with the OpenGL  debug system. The first parameter is a pointer to our callback function, and the second  parameter  NULL in this example  can be a pointer to any object that we would like to pass into  the callback. This pointer is passed as the last parameter with every call to debugCallback.  51   Finally, the call to glDebugMessageControl determines our message filters. This function  can be used to selectively turn on or off any combination of message source, type, id, or  severity. In this example, we turn everything on.  There's more... OpenGL also provides support for stacks of named debug groups. Essentially what this means  is that we can remember all of our debug message filter settings on a stack and return to  them later after some changes have been made. This might be useful, for example, if there  are sections of code where we have needs for filtering some kinds of messages and other  sections where we want a different set of messages.  The functions involved are glPushDebugGroup and glPopDebugGroup. A call to  glPushDebugGroup generates a debug message with type GL_DEBUG_TYPE_PUSH_ GROUP, and retains the current state of our debug filters on a stack. We can then change  our filters using glDebugMessageControl, and later return to the original state using  glPopDebugGroup. Similarly, the function glPopDebugGroup generates a debug message  with type GL_DEBUG_TYPE_POP_GROUP.  Building a C++ shader program class If you are using C++, it can be very convenient to create classes to encapsulate some of the  OpenGL objects. A prime example is the shader program object. In this recipe, we'll look at a  design for a C++ class that can be used to manage a shader program.  Getting ready There's not much to prepare for with this one, you just need a build environment that supports  C++. Also, I'll assume that you are using GLM for matrix and vector support, if not just leave  out the functions involving the GLM classes.  How to do it... First, we'll use a custom exception class for errors that might occur during compilation   or linking:  class GLSLProgramException : public std::runtime_error { public:   GLSLProgramException  const string & msg   :         std::runtime_error msg  { } };  52   We'll use an enum for the various shader types:  namespace GLSLShader {   enum GLSLShaderType {         VERTEX = GL_VERTEX_SHADER,          FRAGMENT = GL_FRAGMENT_SHADER,          GEOMETRY = GL_GEOMETRY_SHADER,          TESS_CONTROL = GL_TESS_CONTROL_SHADER,          TESS_EVALUATION = GL_TESS_EVALUATION_SHADER,          COMPUTE = GL_COMPUTE_SHADER   }; };  The program class itself has the following interface:  class GLSLProgram { private:   int  handle;   bool linked;   std::map  uniformLocations;    int  getUniformLocation const char * name  ;        A few other helper functions  public:   GLSLProgram  ;   ~GLSLProgram  ;    void compileShader  const char * filename          throw GLSLProgramException ;   void compileShader  const char * filename,         GLSLShader::GLSLShaderType type          throw GLSLProgramException ;   void compileShader  const string & source,         GLSLShader::GLSLShaderType type,        const char * filename = NULL          throw GLSLProgramException ;   void link        throw GLSLProgramException ;   void use         throw GLSLProgramException ;   void validate    throw GLSLProgramException ;    int    getHandle  ;   bool   isLinked  ;  53     void   bindAttribLocation  GLuint location,         const char * name ;   void   bindFragDataLocation  GLuint location,         const char * name  ;   void   setUniform const char *name, float x, float y,        float z ;   void   setUniform const char *name, const vec3 & v ;   void   setUniform const char *name, const vec4 & v ;   void   setUniform const char *name, const mat4 & m ;   void   setUniform const char *name, const mat3 & m ;   void   setUniform const char *name, float val  ;   void   setUniform const char *name, int val  ;   void   setUniform const char *name, bool val  ;    void   printActiveUniforms  ;   void   printActiveAttribs  ;   void   printActiveUniformBlocks  ; };  Code Download Tip You can download the example code files for all Packt books you  have purchased from your account at http:  www.packtpub. com.

Full source code for all of the recipes in this text is also available   on GitHub at: https:  github.com daw42 glslcookbook.  The techniques involved in the implementation of these functions are covered in previous  recipes in this chapter. Due to space limitations, I won't include the code here  it's available from  this book's GitHub repository , but we'll discuss some of the design decisions in the next section.  How it works... The state stored within a GLSLProgram object includes the handle to the OpenGL shader  program object  handle , a Boolean variable indicating whether or not the program has  been successfully linked  linked , and a map used to store uniform locations as they are  discovered  uniformLocations .  54   The compileShader overloads will throw a GLSLProgramException if the compilation  fails. The first version determines the type of shader based on the filename extension. In the  second version, the caller provides the shader type, and the third version is used to compile  a shader, taking the shader's source code from a string. The file name can be provided  as a third argument in the case that the string was taken from a file, which is helpful for  providing better error messages.  The GLSLProgramException's error message will contain the contents of the shader log or  program log when an error occurs.  The private function getUniformLocation is used by the setUniform functions to find the  location of a uniform variable. It checks the map uniformLocations first, and if the location  is not found, queries OpenGL for the location, and stores the result in the map before returning.  The fileExists function is used by compileShaderFromFile to check for file existence.  The constructor simply initializes linked to false and handle to zero. The variable handle  will be initialized by calling glCreateProgram when the first shader is compiled.  The link function simply attempts to link the program by calling glLinkProgram. It then  checks the link status, and if successful, sets the variable linked to true and returns true.  Otherwise, it gets the program log  by calling glGetProgramInfoLog , stores the result in a  GLSLProgramException and throws it.  The use function simply calls glUseProgram if the program has already been successfully  linked, otherwise it does nothing.  The functions getHandle and isLinked are simply "getter" functions that return the handle  to the OpenGL program object and the value of the linked variable.  The functions bindAttribLocation and bindFragDataLocation are wrappers around  glBindAttribLocation and glBindFragDataLocation. Note that these functions  should only be called prior to linking the program.  The setUniform overloaded functions are straightforward wrappers around the appropriate  glUniform functions. Each of them calls getUniformLocation to query for the variable's  location before calling the glUniform function.  Finally, the printActiveUniforms, printActiveUniformBlocks, and  printActiveAttribs functions are useful for debugging purposes. They simply display a  list of the active uniforms attributes to standard output.  55   The following is a simple example of the use of the GLSLProgram class:  GLSLProgram prog;  try {   prog.compileShader "myshader.vert" ;   prog.compileShader "myshader.frag" ;   prog.link  ;   prog.validate  ;   prog.use  ; } catch  GLSLProgramException &e   {   cerr << e.what   << endl;   exit EXIT_FAILURE ; }  prog.printActiveUniforms  ; prog.printActiveAttribs  ;  prog.setUniform "ModelViewMatrix", matrix ; prog.setUniform "LightPosition", 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f ;  See also  daw42 glslcookbook   f All of the recipes in this chapter!   f For full source code, check out the GitHub site for this book: http:  github.com   56   2  The Basics of   GLSL Shaders  In this chapter, we will cover:   f Implementing diffuse, per-vertex shading with a single point light source  f Implementing per-vertex ambient, diffuse, and specular  ADS  shading  f Using functions in shaders  f Implementing two-sided shading  f Implementing flat shading  f Using subroutines to select shader functionality  f Discarding fragments to create a perforated look  Introduction Shaders were first added into OpenGL in Version 2.0, introducing programmability into the  formerly fixed-function OpenGL pipeline. Shaders give us the power to implement alternative  rendering algorithms and a greater degree of flexibility in the implementation of those  techniques. With shaders, we can run custom code directly on the GPU, providing us with the  opportunity to leverage the high degree of parallelism available with modern GPUs.   Shaders are implemented using the OpenGL Shading Language  GLSL . The GLSL is  syntactically similar to C, which should make it easier for experienced OpenGL programmers  to learn. Due to the nature of this text, I won't present a thorough introduction to GLSL here.  Instead, if you're new to GLSL, reading through these recipes should help you to learn the  language by example. If you are already comfortable with GLSL, but don't have experience  with Version 4.x, you'll see how to implement these techniques utilizing the newer API.  However, before we jump into GLSL programming, let's take a quick look at how vertex and  fragment shaders fit within the OpenGL pipeline.  Vertex and fragment shaders In OpenGL Version 4.3, there are six shader stages types: vertex, geometry, tessellation  control, tessellation evaluation, fragment, and compute. In this chapter we'll focus only on  the vertex and fragment stages. In Chapter 6, Using Geometry and Tessellation Shaders, I'll  provide some recipes for working with the geometry and tessellation shaders, and in Chapter  10, Using Compute Shaders, I'll focus specifically on compute shaders.  Shaders replace parts of the OpenGL pipeline. More specifically, they make those parts of the  pipeline programmable. The following block diagram shows a simplified view of the OpenGL  pipeline with only the vertex and fragment shaders installed:  Vertex Shader  Primitive Assembly  Clipping  Viewport Transform  Rasterization  Fragment Shader  Framebuffer  Vertex data is sent down the pipeline and arrives at the vertex shader via shader input  variables. The vertex shader's input variables correspond to the vertex attributes  refer to  the Sending data to a shader using vertex attributes and vertex buffer objects recipe in  Chapter 1, Getting Started with GLSL . In general, a shader receives its input via programmer- defined input variables, and the data for those variables comes either from the main OpenGL  application or previous pipeline stages  other shaders . For example, a fragment shader's  input variables might be fed from the output variables of the vertex shader. Data can also be  provided to any shader stage using uniform variables  refer to the Sending data to a shader  using uniform variables recipe, in Chapter 1, Getting Started with GLSL . These are used  for information that changes less often than vertex attributes  for example, matrices, light  position, and other settings . The following figure shows a simplified view of the relationships  between input and output variables when there are two shaders active  vertex and fragment :  58   Slowly varying data  from OpenGL application  uniform variables  Vertex Shader  uniform variables  Fragment Shader  Vertex  attributes  v a r i a b e s  l  i  n p u t  v a r i a b e s  l  o u t p u t  v a r i a b e s  l  i  n p u t  v a r i a b e s  l  o u t p u t  Framebuffer  The vertex shader is executed once for each vertex, usually in parallel. The data corresponding  to the position of the vertex must be transformed into clip coordinates and assigned to the  output variable gl_Position before the vertex shader finishes execution. The vertex shader  can send other information down the pipeline using shader output variables. For example, the  vertex shader might also compute the color associated with the vertex. That color would be  passed to later stages via an appropriate output variable.  Between the vertex and fragment shader, the vertices are assembled into primitives, clipping  takes place, and the viewport transformation is applied  among other operations . The  rasterization process then takes place and the polygon is filled  if necessary . The fragment  shader is executed once for each fragment  pixel  of the polygon being rendered  typically in  parallel . Data provided from the vertex shader is  by default  interpolated in a perspective  correct manner, and provided to the fragment shader via shader input variables. The fragment  shader determines the appropriate color for the pixel and sends it to the frame buffer using  output variables. The depth information is handled automatically.  Replicating the old fixed functionality Programmable shaders give us tremendous power and flexibility. However, in some cases we  might just want to re-implement the basic shading techniques that were used in the default  fixed-function pipeline, or perhaps use them as a basis for other shading techniques. Studying  the basic shading algorithm of the old fixed-function pipeline can also be a good way to get  started when learning about shader programming.  In this chapter, we'll look at the basic techniques for implementing shading similar to that of  the old fixed-function pipeline. We'll cover the standard ambient, diffuse, and specular  ADS   shading algorithm, the implementation of two-sided rendering, and flat shading. Along the  way, we'll also see some examples of other GLSL features such as functions, subroutines, and  the discard keyword.  59   The algorithms presented within this chapter are largely unoptimized. I present them this way  to avoid additional confusion for someone who is learning the techniques for the first time.  We'll look at a few optimization techniques at the end of some recipes, and some more in the  next chapter.  Implementing diffuse, per-vertex shading  with a single point light source One of the simplest shading techniques is to assume that the surface exhibits purely diffuse  reflection. That is to say that the surface is one that appears to scatter light in all directions  equally, regardless of direction. Incoming light strikes the surface and penetrates slightly  before being re-radiated in all directions. Of course, the incoming light interacts with the  surface before it is scattered, causing some wavelengths to be fully or partially absorbed  and others to be scattered. A typical example of a diffuse surface is a surface that has been  painted with a matte paint. The surface has a dull look with no shine at all.  The following screenshot shows a torus rendered with diffuse shading:  The mathematical model for diffuse reflection involves two vectors: the direction from the  surface point to the light source  s , and the normal vector at the surface point  n . The  vectors are represented in the following diagram:  n  s  60   The amount of incoming light  or radiance  that reaches the surface is partially dependent  on the orientation of the surface with respect to the light source. The physics of the situation  tells us that the amount of radiation that reaches a point on a surface is maximal when the  light arrives along the direction of the normal vector, and zero when the light is perpendicular  to the normal. In between, it is proportional to the cosine of the angle between the direction  towards the light source and the normal vector. So, since the dot product is proportional to the  cosine of the angle between two vectors, we can express the amount of radiation striking the  surface as the product of the light intensity and the dot product of s and n.  Where Ld is the intensity of the light source, and the vectors s and n are assumed to be  normalized.  The dot product of two unit vectors is equal to the cosine  of the angle between them.  As stated previously, some of the incoming light is absorbed before it is re-emitted. We can  model this interaction by using a reflection coefficient  Kd , which represents the fraction of  the incoming light that is scattered. This is sometimes referred to as the diffuse reflectivity,  or the diffuse reflection coefficient. The diffuse reflectivity becomes a scaling factor for the  incoming radiation, so the intensity of the outgoing light can be expressed as follows:  Because this model depends only on the direction towards the light source and the normal to  the surface, not on the direction towards the viewer, we have a model that represents uniform   omnidirectional  scattering.  In this recipe, we'll evaluate this equation at each vertex in the vertex shader and interpolate  the resulting color across the face.  In this and the following recipes, light intensities and material  reflectivity coefficients are represented by 3-component   RGB  vectors. Therefore, the equations should be treated  as component-wise operations, applied to each of the three  components separately. Luckily, the GLSL will make this  nearly transparent because the needed operators operate  component-wise on vector variables.  61   Getting ready Start with an OpenGL application that provides the vertex position in attribute location 0,   and the vertex normal in attribute location 1  refer to the Sending data to a shader using   vertex attributes and vertex buffer objects recipe in Chapter 1, Getting Started with GLSL .  The OpenGL application also should provide the standard transformation matrices  projection,  modelview, and normal  via uniform variables.  The light position  in eye coordinates , Kd, and Ld should also be provided by the OpenGL  application via uniform variables. Note that Kd and Ld are of type vec3. We can use vec3   to store an RGB color as well as a vector or point.  How to do it... To create a shader pair that implements diffuse shading, use the following steps:  1.  Use the following code for the vertex shader:  layout  location = 0  in vec3 VertexPosition; layout  location = 1  in vec3 VertexNormal;  out vec3 LightIntensity;  uniform vec4 LightPosition;   Light position in eye coords. uniform vec3 Kd;              Diffuse reflectivity uniform vec3 Ld;              Light source intensity  uniform mat4 ModelViewMatrix; uniform mat3 NormalMatrix; uniform mat4 ProjectionMatrix; uniform mat4 MVP;              Projection * ModelView  void main   {        Convert normal and position to eye coords     vec3 tnorm = normalize  NormalMatrix * VertexNormal ;     vec4 eyeCoords = ModelViewMatrix *                      vec4 VertexPosition,1.0  ;     vec3 s = normalize vec3 LightPosition - eyeCoords  ;         The diffuse shading equation     LightIntensity = Ld * Kd * max  dot  s, tnorm  , 0.0  ;         Convert position to clip coordinates and pass along     gl_Position = MVP * vec4 VertexPosition,1.0 ; }  62   2.  Use the following code for the fragment shader:  in vec3 LightIntensity;  layout  location = 0   out vec4 FragColor;  void main   {     FragColor = vec4 LightIntensity, 1.0 ; }  3.  Compile and link both shaders within the OpenGL application, and install the shader   program prior to rendering. See Chapter 1, Getting Started with GLSL, for details  about compiling, linking, and installing shaders.  How it works... The vertex shader does all of the work in this example. The diffuse reflection is computed in  eye coordinates by first transforming the normal vector using the normal matrix, normalizing,  and storing the result in tnorm. Note that the normalization here may not be necessary if your  normal vectors are already normalized and the normal matrix does not do any scaling.  The normal matrix is typically the inverse transpose of the  upper-left 3 x 3 portion of the model-view matrix. We use the  inverse transpose because normal vectors transform differently  than the vertex position. For a more thorough discussion of  the normal matrix, and the reasons why, see any introductory  computer graphics textbook  A good choice would be Computer  Graphics with OpenGL by Hearn and Baker . If your model-view  matrix does not include any non-uniform scalings, then one can  use the upper-left 3 x 3 of the model-view matrix in place of  the normal matrix to transform your normal vectors. However,  if your model-view matrix does include  uniform  scalings,  you'll still need to  re normalize your normal vectors after  transforming them.  The next step converts the vertex position to eye  camera  coordinates by transforming it via  the model-view matrix. Then we compute the direction towards the light source by subtracting  the vertex position from the light position and storing the result in s.  Next, we compute the scattered light intensity using the equation described previously and store  the result in the output variable LightIntensity. Note the use of the max function here. If the  dot product is less than zero, then the angle between the normal vector and the light direction is  greater than 90 degrees. This means that the incoming light is coming from inside the surface.  Since such a situation is not physically possible  for a closed mesh , we use a value of 0.0.  However, you may decide that you want to properly light both sides of your surface, in which case  the normal vector needs to be reversed for those situations where the light is striking the back  side of the surface  refer to the Implementing two-sided shading recipe in this chapter .  63   Finally, we convert the vertex position to clip coordinates by multiplying with the model-view  projection matrix,  which is: projection * view * model  and store the result in the  built-in output variable gl_Position.  gl_Position = MVP * vec4 VertexPosition,1.0 ;  The subsequent stage of the OpenGL pipeline expects that  the vertex position will be provided in clip coordinates in the  output variable gl_Position. This variable does not directly  correspond to any input variable in the fragment shader, but is  used by the OpenGL pipeline in the primitive assembly, clipping,  and rasterization stages that follow the vertex shader. It is  important that we always provide a valid value for this variable.  Since LightIntensity is an output variable from the vertex shader, its value is interpolated  across the face and passed into the fragment shader. The fragment shader then simply  assigns the value to the output fragment.  There's more... Diffuse shading is a technique that models only a very limited range of surfaces. It is best used  for surfaces that have a "matte" appearance. Additionally, with the technique used previously,  the dark areas may look a bit too dark. In fact, those areas that are not directly illuminated are  completely black. In real scenes, there is typically some light that has been reflected about the  room that brightens these surfaces. In the following recipes, we'll look at ways to model more  surface types, as well as provide some light for those dark parts of the surface.  See also   f The Sending data to a shader using uniform variables recipe in Chapter 1, Getting   Started with GLSL   f The Compiling a shader recipe in Chapter 1, Getting Started with GLSL  f The Linking a shader program recipe in Chapter 1, Getting Started with GLSL  f The Sending data to a shader using vertex attributes and vertex buffer objects recipe   in Chapter 1, Getting Started with GLSL  64   Implementing per-vertex ambient, diffuse,  and specular  ADS  shading The OpenGL fixed function pipeline implemented a default shading technique which is very  similar to the one presented here. It models the light-surface interaction as a combination  of three components: ambient, diffuse, and specular. The ambient component is intended  to model light that has been reflected so many times that it appears to be emanating  uniformly from all directions. The diffuse component was discussed in the previous recipe,  and represents omnidirectional reflection. The specular component models the shininess of  the surface and represents reflection around a preferred direction. Combining these three  components together can model a nice  but limited  variety of surface types. This shading  model is also sometimes called the Phong reflection model  or Phong shading model , after  Bui Tuong Phong.  An example of a torus rendered with the ADS shading model is shown in the   following screenshot:  The ADS model is implemented as the sum of the three components: ambient, diffuse, and  specular. The ambient component represents light that illuminates all surfaces equally and  reflects equally in all directions. It is often used to help brighten some of the darker areas within  a scene. Since it does not depend on the incoming or outgoing directions of the light, it can be  modeled simply by multiplying the light source intensity  La  by the surface reflectivity  Ka .  The diffuse component models a rough surface that scatters light in all directions  refer to  the Implementing diffuse, per-vertex shading with a single point light source recipe in this  chapter . The intensity of the outgoing light depends on the angle between the surface normal  and the vector towards the light source.  65   The specular component is used for modeling the shininess of a surface. When a surface has  a glossy shine to it, the light is reflected off of the surface in a mirror-like fashion. The reflected  light is strongest in the direction of perfect  mirror-like  reflection. The physics of the situation  tells us that for perfect reflection, the angle of incidence is the same as the angle of reflection  and that the vectors are coplanar with the surface normal, as shown in the following diagram:  In the preceding diagram, r represents the vector of pure-reflection corresponding to the  incoming light vector  -s , and n is the surface normal. We can compute r by using the  following equation:  To model specular reflection, we need to compute the following  normalized  vectors: the  direction towards the light source  s , the vector of perfect reflection  r , the vector towards the  viewer  v , and the surface normal  n . These vectors are represented in the following diagram:  n  r  -s  n  r  v  0  0  -s  We would like the reflection to be maximal when the viewer is aligned with the vector r, and to  fall off quickly as the viewer moves further away from alignment with r. This can be modeled  using the cosine of the angle between v and r raised to some power  f .  66    Recall that the dot product is proportional to the cosine of the angle between the vectors  involved.  The larger the power, the faster the value drops towards zero as the angle between  v and r increases. Again, similar to the other components, we also introduce a specular light  intensity term  Ls  and reflectivity term  Ks . The specular component creates specular highlights  bright spots  that are typical of glossy  surfaces. The larger the power of f in the equation, the smaller the specular highlight and   the shinier the surface appears. The value for f is typically chosen to be somewhere between  1 and 200.  Putting all of this together, we have the following shading equation:  For more details about how this shading model was implemented in the fixed function  pipeline, take a look at Chapter 5, Image Processing and Screen Space Techniques.  In the following code, we'll evaluate this equation in the vertex shader, and interpolate the  color across the polygon.  Getting ready In the OpenGL application, provide the vertex position in location 0 and the vertex   normal in location 1. The light position and the other configurable terms for our lighting  equation are uniform variables in the vertex shader and their values must be set from the  OpenGL application.  How to do it... To create a shader pair that implements ADS shading, use the following steps:  1.  Use the following code for the vertex shader:  layout  location = 0  in vec3 VertexPosition; layout  location = 1  in vec3 VertexNormal;  out vec3 LightIntensity;  struct LightInfo {     vec4 Position;    Light position in eye coords.     vec3 La;          Ambient light intensity     vec3 Ld;          Diffuse light intensity     vec3 Ls;          Specular light intensity };  67   uniform LightInfo Light;  struct MaterialInfo {     vec3 Ka;               Ambient reflectivity     vec3 Kd;               Diffuse reflectivity     vec3 Ks;               Specular reflectivity     float Shininess;       Specular shininess factor }; uniform MaterialInfo Material;  uniform mat4 ModelViewMatrix; uniform mat3 NormalMatrix; uniform mat4 ProjectionMatrix; uniform mat4 MVP;  void main   {     vec3 tnorm = normalize  NormalMatrix * VertexNormal ;     vec4 eyeCoords = ModelViewMatrix *                      vec4 VertexPosition,1.0 ;     vec3 s = normalize vec3 Light.Position - eyeCoords  ;     vec3 v = normalize -eyeCoords.xyz ;     vec3 r = reflect  -s, tnorm  ;     vec3 ambient = Light.La * Material.Ka;     float sDotN = max  dot s,tnorm , 0.0  ;     vec3 diffuse = Light.Ld * Material.Kd * sDotN;     vec3 spec = vec3 0.0 ;     if  sDotN > 0.0           spec = Light.Ls * Material.Ks *            pow max  dot r,v , 0.0  , Material.Shininess ;      LightIntensity = ambient + diffuse + spec;     gl_Position = MVP * vec4 VertexPosition,1.0 ; }  2.  Use the following code for the fragment shader:  in vec3 LightIntensity;  layout  location = 0   out vec4 FragColor;  void main   {     FragColor = vec4 LightIntensity, 1.0 ; }  3.  Compile and link both shaders within the OpenGL application, and install the shader   program prior to rendering.  68   How it works... The vertex shader computes the shading equation in eye coordinates. It begins by transforming  the vertex normal into eye coordinates and normalizing, then storing the result in tnorm. The  vertex position is then transformed into eye coordinates and stored in eyeCoords.  Next, we compute the normalized direction towards the light source  s . This is done by  subtracting the vertex position in eye coordinates from the light position and normalizing   the result.  The direction towards the viewer  v  is the negation of the position  normalized  because in  eye coordinates the viewer is at the origin.  We compute the direction of pure reflection by calling the GLSL built-in function reflect,  which reflects the first argument about the second. We don't need to normalize the result  because the two vectors involved are already normalized.  The ambient component is computed and stored in the variable ambient. The dot product  of s and n is computed next. As in the preceding recipe, we use the built-in function max to  limit the range of values to between one and zero. The result is stored in the variable named  sDotN, and is used to compute the diffuse component. The resulting value for the diffuse  component is stored in the variable diffuse. Before computing the specular component,  we check the value of sDotN. If sDotN is zero, then there is no light reaching the surface, so  there is no point in computing the specular component, as its value must be zero. Otherwise,  if sDotN is greater than zero, we compute the specular component using the equation  presented earlier. Again, we use the built-in function max to limit the range of values of the dot  product to between one and zero, and the function pow raises the dot product to the power of  the Shininess exponent  corresponding to f in our lighting equation .  If we did not check sDotN before computing the specular  component, it is possible that some specular highlights  could appear on faces that are facing away from the light  source. This is clearly a non-realistic and undesirable result.  Some people solve this problem by multiplying the specular  component by the diffuse component, which would decrease  the specular component substantially and alter its color. The  solution presented here avoids this, at the cost of a branch  statement  the if statement .  Branch statements can have  a significant impact on performance.   The sum of the three components is then stored in the output variable LightIntensity.  This value will be associated with the vertex and passed down the pipeline. Before reaching  the fragment shader, its value will be interpolated in a perspective correct manner across the  face of the polygon.  69   Finally, the vertex shader transforms the position into clip coordinates, and assigns the result  to the built-in output variable gl_Position  refer to the Implementing diffuse, per-vertex  shading with a single point light source recipe in this chapter .  The fragment shader simply applies the interpolated value of LightIntensity to the output  fragment by storing it in the shader output variable FragColor.  There's more... This version of the ADS  Ambient, Diffuse, and Specular  reflection model is by no means  optimal. There are several improvements that could be made. For example, the computation  of the vector of pure reflection can be avoided via the use of the so-called "halfway vector".  This is discussed in the Using the halfway vector for improved performance recipe in Chapter  3, Lighting, Shading, and Optimization.  Using a non-local viewer We can avoid the extra normalization needed to compute the vector towards the viewer  v ,  by using a so-called non-local viewer. Instead of computing the direction towards the origin,  we simply use the constant vector  0, 0, 1  for all vertices. This is similar to assuming that the  viewer is located infinitely far away in the z direction. Of course, it is not accurate, but in practice  the visual results are very similar, often visually indistinguishable, saving us normalization.  In the old fixed-function pipeline, the non-local viewer was the default, and could be adjusted   turned on or off  using the function glLightModel.  Per-vertex versus per-fragment Since the shading equation is computed within the vertex shader, we refer to this as per- vertex shading. One of the disadvantages of this is that specular highlights can be warped  or lost, due to the fact that the shading equation is not evaluated at each point across the  face. For example, a specular highlight that should appear in the middle of a polygon might  not appear at all when per-vertex shading is used, because of the fact that the shading  equation is only computed at the vertices where the specular component is near zero. In the  Using per-fragment shading for improved realism recipe of Chapter 3, Lighting, Shading, and  Optimization, we'll look at the changes needed to move the shading computation into the  fragment shader, producing more realistic results.  Directional lights We can also avoid the need to compute a light direction  s , for each vertex if we assume a  directional light. A directional light source is one that can be thought of as located infinitely  far away in a given direction. Instead of computing the direction towards the source for each  vertex, a constant vector is used, which represents the direction towards the remote light  source. We'll look at an example of this in the Shading with a directional light source recipe of  Chapter 3, Lighting, Shading, and Optimization.  70   Light attenuation with distance You might think that this shading model is missing one important component. It doesn't take  into account the effect of the distance to the light source. In fact, it is known that the intensity  of radiation from a source falls off in proportion to the inverse square of the distance from the  source. So why not include this in our model?  It would be fairly simple to do so, however, the visual results are often less than appealing. It  tends to exaggerate the distance effects and create unrealistic looking images. Remember, our  equation is just an approximation of the physics involved and is not a truly realistic model, so it  is not surprising that adding a term based on a strict physical law produces unrealistic results.  In the OpenGL fixed-function pipeline, it was possible to turn on distance attenuation using  the glLight function. If desired, it would be straightforward to add a few uniform variables to  our shader to produce the same effect.  See also   f The Shading with a directional light source recipe in Chapter 3, Lighting, Shading,    f The Using per-fragment shading for improved realism recipe in Chapter 3, Lighting,    f The Using the halfway vector for improved performance recipe in Chapter 3, Lighting,   and Optimization  Shading, and Optimization  Shading, and Optimization  Using functions in shaders The GLSL supports functions that are syntactically similar to C functions. However, the calling  conventions are somewhat different. In the following example, we'll revisit the ADS shader  using functions to help provide abstractions for the major steps.  Getting ready As with previous recipes, provide the vertex position at attribute location 0 and the vertex  normal at attribute location 1. Uniform variables for all of the ADS coefficients should be set  from the OpenGL side, as well as the light position and the standard matrices.  71   How to do it... To implement ADS shading using functions, use the following code:  1.  Use the following vertex shader:  layout  location = 0  in vec3 VertexPosition; layout  location = 1  in vec3 VertexNormal;  out vec3 LightIntensity;  struct LightInfo {     vec4 Position;    Light position in eye coords.     vec3 La;          Ambient light intensity     vec3 Ld;          Diffuse light intensity     vec3 Ls;          Specular light intensity }; uniform LightInfo Light;  struct MaterialInfo {     vec3 Ka;               Ambient reflectivity     vec3 Kd;               Diffuse reflectivity     vec3 Ks;               Specular reflectivity     float Shininess;       Specular shininess factor }; uniform MaterialInfo Material;  uniform mat4 ModelViewMatrix; uniform mat3 NormalMatrix; uniform mat4 ProjectionMatrix; uniform mat4 MVP;  void getEyeSpace  out vec3 norm, out vec4 position   {     norm = normalize  NormalMatrix * VertexNormal ;     position = ModelViewMatrix * vec4 VertexPosition,1.0 ; }  vec3 phongModel  vec4 position, vec3 norm   {     vec3 s = normalize vec3 Light.Position - position  ;     vec3 v = normalize -position.xyz ;     vec3 r = reflect  -s, norm  ;     vec3 ambient = Light.La * Material.Ka;     float sDotN = max  dot s,norm , 0.0  ;     vec3 diffuse = Light.Ld * Material.Kd * sDotN;     vec3 spec = vec3 0.0 ;  72       if  sDotN > 0.0           spec = Light.Ls * Material.Ks *          pow  max  dot r,v , 0.0  , Material.Shininess  ;      return ambient + diffuse + spec; }  void main   {     vec3 eyeNorm;     vec4 eyePosition;         Get the position and normal in eye space     getEyeSpace eyeNorm, eyePosition ;         Evaluate the lighting equation.     LightIntensity = phongModel  eyePosition, eyeNorm  ;      gl_Position = MVP * vec4 VertexPosition,1.0 ; }  2.  Use the following fragment shader:  in vec3 LightIntensity;  layout  location = 0   out vec4 FragColor;  void main   {     FragColor = vec4 LightIntensity, 1.0 ; }  3.  Compile and link both shaders within the OpenGL application, and install the shader   program prior to rendering.  How it works... In GLSL functions, the evaluation strategy is "call by value-return"  also called "call by   copy-restore" or "call by value-result" . Parameter variables can be qualified with in, out, or  inout. Arguments corresponding to input parameters  those qualified with in or inout  are  copied into the parameter variable at call time, and output parameters  those qualified with  out or inout  are copied back to the corresponding argument before the function returns.   If a parameter variable does not have any of the three qualifiers, the default qualifier is in.  73   We've created two functions in the vertex shader. The first, named getEyeSpace, transforms  the vertex position and vertex normal into eye space, and returns them via output parameters.  In the main function, we create two uninitialized variables  eyeNorm and eyePosition  to  store the results, and then call the function with the variables as the function's arguments.  The function stores the results into the parameter variables  norm and position  which are  copied into the arguments before the function returns.  The second function, phongModel, uses only input parameters. The function receives the  eye-space position and normal, and computes the result of the ADS shading equation. The  result is returned by the function and stored in the shader output variable LightIntensity.  There's more... Since it makes no sense to read from an output parameter variable, output parameters  should only be written to within the function. Their value is undefined.  Within a function, writing to an input-only parameter  qualified with in  is allowed. The  function's copy of the argument is modified, and changes are not reflected in the argument.  The const qualifier The additional qualifier const can be used with input-only parameters  not with out or  inout . This qualifier makes the input parameter read-only, so it cannot be written to within  the function.  Function overloading Functions can be overloaded by creating multiple functions with the same name, but with  different number and or type of parameters. As with many languages, two overloaded  functions may not differ in return type only.  Passing arrays or structures to a function It should be noted that when passing arrays or structures to functions, they are passed by  value. If a large array or structure is passed, it can incur a large copy operation which may not  be desired. It would be a better choice to declare these variables in the global scope.   f The Implementing per-vertex ambient, diffuse, and specular  ADS  shading recipe  See also  74   Implementing two-sided shading When rendering a mesh that is completely closed, the back faces of polygons are hidden.  However, if a mesh contains holes, it might be the case that the back faces would become  visible. In this case, the polygons may be shaded incorrectly due to the fact that the normal  vector is pointing in the wrong direction. To properly shade those back faces, one needs to  invert the normal vector and compute the lighting equations based on the inverted normal.  The following screenshot shows a teapot with the lid removed. On the left, the ADS lighting  model is used. On the right, the ADS model is augmented with the two-sided rendering  technique discussed in this recipe.  In this recipe, we'll look at an example that uses the ADS model discussed in the previous  recipes, augmented with the ability to correctly shade back faces.  Getting ready The vertex position should be provided in attribute location 0 and the vertex normal in  attribute location 1. As in previous examples, the lighting parameters must be provided   to the shader via uniform variables.  75   How to do it... To implement a shader pair that uses the ADS shading model with two-sided lighting, use the  following steps:  1.  Use the following code for the vertex shader:  layout  location = 0  in vec3 VertexPosition; layout  location = 1  in vec3 VertexNormal;  out vec3 FrontColor; out vec3 BackColor;  struct LightInfo {     vec4 Position;    Light position in eye coords.     vec3 La;          Ambient light intensity     vec3 Ld;          Diffuse light intensity     vec3 Ls;          Specular light intensity }; uniform LightInfo Light;  struct MaterialInfo {     vec3 Ka;               Ambient reflectivity     vec3 Kd;               Diffuse reflectivity     vec3 Ks;               Specular reflectivity     float Shininess;       Specular shininess factor }; uniform MaterialInfo Material;  uniform mat4 ModelViewMatrix; uniform mat3 NormalMatrix; uniform mat4 ProjectionMatrix; uniform mat4 MVP;  vec3 phongModel  vec4 position, vec3 normal   {        The ADS shading calculations go here  "Implementing        per-vertex ambient, diffuse, and specular  ADS         shading"      … }  void main   {     vec3 tnorm = normalize  NormalMatrix * VertexNormal ;     vec4 eyeCoords = ModelViewMatrix *                      vec4 VertexPosition,1.0 ;  76       FrontColor = phongModel  eyeCoords, tnorm  ;     BackColor = phongModel  eyeCoords, -tnorm  ;      gl_Position = MVP * vec4 VertexPosition,1.0 ; }  2.  Use the following for the fragment shader:  in vec3 FrontColor; in vec3 BackColor;  layout  location = 0   out vec4 FragColor;  void main   {     if  gl_FrontFacing   {         FragColor = vec4 FrontColor, 1.0 ;     } else {         FragColor = vec4 BackColor, 1.0 ;     } }  3.  Compile and link both shaders within the OpenGL application, and install the shader   program prior to rendering.  How it works... In the vertex shader, we compute the lighting equation using both the vertex normal and the  inverted version, and pass each resultant color to the fragment shader. The fragment shader  chooses and applies the appropriate color depending on the orientation of the face.  The vertex shader is a slightly modified version of the vertex shader presented in the  Implementing per-vertex ambient, diffuse, and specular  ADS  shading recipe of this chapter.  The evaluation of the shading model is placed within a function named phongModel. The  function is called twice, first using the normal vector  transformed into eye coordinates , and  second using the inverted normal vector. The combined results are stored in FrontColor  and BackColor, respectively.  Note that there are a few aspects of the shading model that  are independent of the orientation of the normal vector   such as the ambient component . One could optimize this  code by rewriting it so that the redundant calculations are  only done once. However, in this recipe we compute the  entire shading model twice in the interest of making things  clear and readable.  77   In the fragment shader, we determine which color to apply based on the value of the built-in  variable gl_FrontFacing. This is a bool value that indicates whether the fragment is part  of a front or back facing polygon. Note that this determination is based on the winding of the  polygon, and not the normal vector.  A polygon is said to have counter-clockwise winding if the  vertices are specified in counter-clockwise order as viewed from the front side of the polygon.   By default when rendering, if the order of the vertices appear on the screen in a counter- clockwise order, it indicates a front facing polygon, however, we can change this by calling  glFrontFace from the OpenGL program.  There's more... In the vertex shader we determine the front side of the polygon by the direction of the normal  vector, and in the fragment shader, the determination is based on the polygon's winding. For  this to work properly, the normal vector must be defined appropriately for the face determined  by the setting of glFrontFace.  Using two-sided rendering for debugging It can sometimes be useful to visually determine which faces are front facing and which are  back facing. For example, when working with arbitrary meshes, polygons may not be specified  using the appropriate winding. As another example, when developing a mesh procedurally,  it can sometimes be helpful to determine which faces are oriented in the proper direction in  order to help with debugging. We can easily tweak our fragment shader to help us solve these  kinds of problems by mixing a solid color with all back  or front  faces. For example, we could  change the else clause within our fragment shader to the following:  FragColor = mix  vec4 BackColor,1.0 ,                 vec4 1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0 , 0.7  ;  This would mix a solid red color with all back faces, helping them to stand out, as shown in the  following screenshot. In the screenshot, back faces are mixed with 70 percent red as shown  in the preceding code.  78   See also   f The Implementing per-vertex ambient, diffuse, and specular  ADS  shading recipe  Implementing flat shading Per-vertex shading involves computation of the shading model at each vertex and associating  the result  a color  with that vertex. The colors are then interpolated across the face of the  polygon to produce a smooth shading effect. This is also referred to as Gouraud shading. In  earlier versions of OpenGL, this per-vertex shading with color interpolation was the default  shading technique.  It is sometimes desirable to use a single color for each polygon so that there is no variation   of color across the face of the polygon, causing each polygon to have a flat appearance.   This can be useful in situations where the shape of the object warrants such a technique,  perhaps because the faces really are intended to look flat, or to help visualize the locations   of the polygons in a complex mesh. Using a single color for each polygon is commonly called  flat shading.  The following screenshot shows a mesh rendered with the ADS shading model. On the left,  Gouraud shading is used. On the right, flat shading is used.  In earlier versions of OpenGL, flat shading was enabled by calling the function  glShadeModel with the argument GL_FLAT. In which case, the computed color of the last  vertex of each polygon was used across the entire face.  In OpenGL 4, flat shading is facilitated by the interpolation qualifiers available for shader  input output variables.  79   How to do it... To modify the ADS shading model to implement flat shading, use the following steps:  1.  Use the same vertex shader as in the ADS example provided earlier. Change the   output variable LightIntensity as follows: layout  location = 0  in vec3 VertexPosition; layout  location = 1  in vec3 VertexNormal;  flat out vec3 LightIntensity;     the rest is identical to the ADS shader…  2.  Use the following code for the fragment shader:  flat in vec3 LightIntensity;  layout  location = 0   out vec4 FragColor;  void main   {     FragColor = vec4 LightIntensity, 1.0 ; }  3.  Compile and link both shaders within the OpenGL application, and install the shader   program prior to rendering.  How it works... Flat shading is enabled by qualifying the vertex output variable  and its corresponding  fragment input variable  with the flat qualifier. This qualifier indicates that no interpolation  of the value is to be done before it reaches the fragment shader. The value presented to the  fragment shader will be the one corresponding to the result of the invocation of the vertex  shader for either the first or last vertex of the polygon. This vertex is called the provoking  vertex, and can be configured using the OpenGL function glProvokingVertex. For  example, the call:  glProvokingVertex GL_FIRST_VERTEX_CONVENTION ;  This indicates that the first vertex should be used as the value for the flat shaded variable.   The argument GL_LAST_VERTEX_CONVENTION indicates that the last vertex should be used.   f The Implementing per-vertex ambient, diffuse, and specular  ADS  shading recipe  See also  80   Using subroutines to select shader  functionality In GLSL, a subroutine is a mechanism for binding a function call to one of a set of possible  function definitions based on the value of a variable. In many ways it is similar to function  pointers in C. A uniform variable serves as the pointer and is used to invoke the function.  The value of this variable can be set from the OpenGL side, thereby binding it to one of a few  possible definitions. The subroutine's function definitions need not have the same name, but  must have the same number and type of parameters and the same return type.  Subroutines therefore provide a way to select alternate implementations at runtime without  swapping shader programs and or recompiling, or using the if statements along with a  uniform variable. For example, a single shader could be written to provide several shading  algorithms intended for use on different objects within the scene. When rendering the scene,  rather than swapping shader programs  or using a conditional statement , we can simply  change the subroutine's uniform variable to choose the appropriate shading algorithm as  each object is rendered.  Since performance is crucial in shader programs, avoiding  a conditional statement or a shader swap can be very  valuable. With subroutines, we can implement the  functionality of a conditional statement or shader swap  without the computational overhead.  In this example, we'll demonstrate the use of subroutines by rendering a teapot twice. The  first teapot will be rendered with the full ADS shading model described earlier. The second  teapot will be rendered with diffuse shading only. A subroutine uniform will be used to choose  between the two shading techniques.  In the following screenshot, we see an example of a rendering that was created using  subroutines. The teapot on the left is rendered with the full ADS shading model, and the  teapot on the right is rendered with diffuse shading only. A subroutine is used to switch  between shader functionality.  81   Getting ready As with previous recipes, provide the vertex position at attribute location 0 and the vertex  normal at attribute location 1. Uniform variables for all of the ADS coefficients should be set  from the OpenGL side, as well as the light position and the standard matrices.  We'll assume that, in the OpenGL application, the variable programHandle contains the  handle to the shader program object.  How to do it... To create a shader program that uses a subroutine to switch between pure-diffuse and ADS  shading, use the following steps:  1.  Use the following code for the vertex shader:  subroutine vec3 shadeModelType  vec4 position, vec3 normal ; subroutine uniform shadeModelType shadeModel;  layout  location = 0  in vec3 VertexPosition; layout  location = 1  in vec3 VertexNormal;  out vec3 LightIntensity;  struct LightInfo {     vec4 Position;    Light position in eye coords.     vec3 La;          Ambient light intensity     vec3 Ld;          Diffuse light intensity     vec3 Ls;          Specular light intensity }; uniform LightInfo Light;  struct MaterialInfo {     vec3 Ka;               Ambient reflectivity     vec3 Kd;               Diffuse reflectivity     vec3 Ks;               Specular reflectivity     float Shininess;       Specular shininess factor }; uniform MaterialInfo Material;  uniform mat4 ModelViewMatrix; uniform mat3 NormalMatrix; uniform mat4 ProjectionMatrix; uniform mat4 MVP;  82   void getEyeSpace  out vec3 norm, out vec4 position   {     norm = normalize  NormalMatrix * VertexNormal ;     position = ModelViewMatrix * vec4 VertexPosition,1.0 ; }  subroutine  shadeModelType   vec3 phongModel  vec4 position, vec3 norm   {        The ADS shading calculations go here  see: "Using        functions in shaders," and "Implementing        per-vertex ambient, diffuse, and specular  ADS         shading"      … }  subroutine  shadeModelType   vec3 diffuseOnly  vec4 position, vec3 norm   {     vec3 s = normalize  vec3 Light.Position - position   ;     return         Light.Ld * Material.Kd * max  dot s, norm , 0.0  ; }  void main   {     vec3 eyeNorm;     vec4 eyePosition;         Get the position and normal in eye space     getEyeSpace eyeNorm, eyePosition ;         Evaluate the shading equation, calling one of        the functions: diffuseOnly or phongModel.     LightIntensity = shadeModel eyePosition, eyeNorm ;      gl_Position = MVP * vec4 VertexPosition,1.0 ; }  2.  Use the following code for the fragment shader:  in vec3 LightIntensity;  layout  location = 0   out vec4 FragColor;  void main   {     FragColor = vec4 LightIntensity, 1.0 ; }  83   3.   In the OpenGL application, compile and link the previous shaders into a shader  program, and install the program into the OpenGL pipeline.  4.  Within the render function of the OpenGL application, use the following code:  GLuint adsIndex =    glGetSubroutineIndex programHandle,                        GL_VERTEX_SHADER,"phongModel" ; GLuint diffuseIndex =     glGetSubroutineIndex programHandle,                        GL_VERTEX_SHADER, "diffuseOnly" ;  glUniformSubroutinesuiv  GL_VERTEX_SHADER, 1, &adsIndex ; ...    Render the left teapot  glUniformSubroutinesuiv  GL_VERTEX_SHADER, 1, &diffuseIndex ; ...    Render the right teapot  How it works... In this example, the subroutine is defined within the vertex shader. The first step involves  declaring the subroutine type:  subroutine vec3 shadeModelType  vec4 position, vec3 normal ;  This defines a new subroutine type with the name shadeModelType. The syntax is very  similar to a function prototype, in that it defines a name, a parameter list, and a return   type. As with function prototypes, the parameter names are optional.  After creating the new subroutine type, we declare a uniform variable of that type   named shadeModel:  subroutine uniform shadeModelType shadeModel;  This variable serves as our function pointer and will be assigned to one of the two possible  functions in the OpenGL application.  We declare two functions to be part of the subroutine by prefixing their definition with the  subroutine qualifier:  subroutine   shadeModelType    This indicates that the function matches the subroutine type, and therefore its header must  match the one in the subroutine type definition. We use this prefix for the definition of the  functions phongModel and diffuseOnly. The diffuseOnly function computes the  diffuse shading equation, and the phongModel function computes the complete ADS   shading equation.  84   We call one of the two subroutine functions by utilizing the subroutine uniform shadeModel  within the main function:  LightIntensity = shadeModel  eyePosition, eyeNorm  ;  Again, this call will be bound to one of the two functions depending on the value of the  subroutine uniform shadeModel, which we will set within the OpenGL application.  Within the render function of the OpenGL application, we assign a value to the subroutine  uniform with the following two steps. First, we query for the index of each subroutine function  using glGetSubroutineIndex. The first argument is the program handle. The second is the  shader stage. In this case, the subroutine is defined within the vertex shader, so we use GL_ VERTEX_SHADER here. The third argument is the name of the subroutine. We query for each  function individually and store the indexes in the variables adsIndex and diffuseIndex.  Second, we select the appropriate subroutine function, To do so we need to set the value of the  subroutine uniform shadeModel by calling glUniformSubroutinesuiv. This function is  designed for setting multiple subroutine uniforms at once. In our case, of course, we are setting  only a single uniform. The first argument is the shader stage  GL_VERTEX_SHADER , the  second is the number of uniforms being set, and the third is a pointer to an array of subroutine  function indexes. Since we are setting a single uniform, we simply provide the address of the  GLuint variable containing the index, rather than a true array of values. Of course, we would  use an array if multiple uniforms were being set. In general, the array of values provided as the  third argument is assigned to subroutine uniform variables in the following way. The ith element  of the array is assigned to the subroutine uniform variable with index i. Since we have provided  only a single value, we are setting the subroutine uniform at index zero.  You may be wondering, "How do we know that our subroutine uniform is located at index zero?  We didn't query for the index before calling glUniformSubroutinesuiv!" The reason that  this code works is that we are relying on the fact that OpenGL will always number the indexes  of the subroutines consecutively starting at zero. If we had multiple subroutine uniforms, we  could  and should  query for their indexes using glGetSubroutineUniformLocation, and  then order our array appropriately.  glUniformSubroutinesuiv requires us to set all  subroutine uniform variables at once, in a single call. This is  so that they can be validated by OpenGL in a single burst.  There's more... Unfortunately, subroutine bindings get reset when a shader program is unbound  switched  out  from the pipeline, by calling glUseProgram or other technique. This requires us to call  glUniformSubroutinsuiv each time that we activate a shader program.  85   A subroutine function defined in a shader can match more than one subroutine type. The  subroutine qualifier can contain a comma-separated list of subroutine types. For example,   if a subroutine matched the types type1 and type2, we could use the following qualifier:  subroutine  type1, type2    This would allow us to use subroutine uniforms of differing types to refer to the same  subroutine function.  See also   f The Implementing per-vertex ambient, diffuse, and specular  ADS  shading recipe  f The Implementing diffuse, per-vertex shading with a single point light source recipe  Discarding fragments to create a   perforated look Fragment shaders can make use of the discard keyword to "throw away" fragments. Use of  this keyword causes the fragment shader to stop execution, without writing anything  including  depth  to the output buffer. This provides a way to create holes in polygons without using  blending. In fact, since fragments are completely discarded, there is no dependence on the  order in which objects are drawn, saving us the trouble of doing any depth sorting that might  have been necessary if blending was used.  In this recipe, we'll draw a teapot, and use the discard keyword to remove fragments  selectively, based on texture coordinates. The result will look like the following diagram:  86   Getting ready The vertex position, normal, and texture coordinates must be provided to the vertex shader  from the OpenGL application. The position should be provided at location 0, the normal at  location 1, and the texture coordinates at location 2. As in the previous examples, the lighting  parameters must be set from the OpenGL application via the appropriate uniform variables.  How to do it... To create a shader program that discards fragments based on a square lattice  as in the  preceding screenshot , use the following code:  1.  Use the following code for the vertex shader:  layout  location = 0  in vec3 VertexPosition; layout  location = 1  in vec3 VertexNormal; layout  location = 2  in vec2 VertexTexCoord;  out vec3 FrontColor; out vec3 BackColor; out vec2 TexCoord;  struct LightInfo {     vec4 Position;    Light position in eye coords.     vec3 La;          Ambient light intensity     vec3 Ld;          Diffuse light intensity     vec3 Ls;          Specular light intensity }; uniform LightInfo Light;  struct MaterialInfo {     vec3 Ka;               Ambient reflectivity     vec3 Kd;               Diffuse reflectivity     vec3 Ks;               Specular reflectivity     float Shininess;       Specular shininess factor };  uniform MaterialInfo Material;  uniform mat4 ModelViewMatrix; uniform mat3 NormalMatrix; uniform mat4 ProjectionMatrix; uniform mat4 MVP;  void getEyeSpace  out vec3 norm, out vec4 position   {  87       norm = normalize  NormalMatrix * VertexNormal ;     position = ModelViewMatrix * vec4 VertexPosition,1.0 ; }  vec3 phongModel  vec4 position, vec3 norm   {        The ADS shading calculation  see: "Implementing        per-vertex ambient, diffuse, and specular  ADS         shading"      … }  void main   {     vec3 eyeNorm;     vec4 eyePosition;      TexCoord = VertexTexCoord;         Get the position and normal in eye space     getEyeSpace eyeNorm, eyePosition ;      FrontColor = phongModel  eyePosition, eyeNorm  ;     BackColor = phongModel  eyePosition, -eyeNorm  ;      gl_Position = MVP * vec4 VertexPosition,1.0 ; }  2.  Use the following code for the fragment shader:  in vec3 FrontColor; in vec3 BackColor; in vec2 TexCoord;  layout  location = 0   out vec4 FragColor;  void main   {     const float scale = 15.0;      bvec2 toDiscard = greaterThan  fract TexCoord * scale ,                                    vec2 0.2,0.2   ;      if  all toDiscard            discard;          if  gl_FrontFacing    88           FragColor = vec4 FrontColor, 1.0 ;     else         FragColor = vec4 BackColor, 1.0 ; }  3.  Compile and link both shaders within the OpenGL application, and install the shader   program prior to rendering.  How it works... Since we will be discarding some parts of the teapot, we will be able to see through the  teapot to the other side. This will cause the back sides of some polygons to become visible.  Therefore, we need to compute the lighting equation appropriately for both sides of each face.  We'll use the same technique presented earlier in the two-sided shading recipe.  The vertex shader is essentially the same as in the two-sided shading recipe, with the main  difference being the addition of the texture coordinate. The differences are highlighted in  the previous listing. To manage the texture coordinate, we have an additional input variable,  VertexTexCoord, that corresponds to attribute location 2. The value of this input variable is  passed directly on to the fragment shader unchanged via the output variable TexCoord. The  ADS shading model is calculated twice, once using the given normal vector, storing the result  in FrontColor, and again using the reversed normal, storing that result in BackColor.  In the fragment shader, we calculate whether or not the fragment should be discarded based  on a simple technique designed to produce the lattice-like pattern shown in the preceding  screenshot. We first scale the texture coordinate by the arbitrary scaling factor scale. This  corresponds to the number of lattice rectangles per unit  scaled  texture coordinate. We  then compute the fractional part of each component of the scaled texture coordinate using  the built-in function fract. Each component is compared to 0.2 using the built-in function  greaterThan, and the result is stored in the bool vector toDiscard. The greaterThan  function compares the two vectors component-wise, and stores the Boolean results in the  corresponding components of the return value.  If both components of the vector toDiscard are true, then the fragment lies within the inside  of each lattice frame, and therefore we wish to discard this fragment. We can use the built-in  function all to help with this check. The function all will return true if all of the components  of the parameter vector are true. If the function returns true, we execute the discard  statement to reject the fragment.  In the else branch, we color the fragment based on the orientation of the polygon, as in the  Implementing two-sided shading recipe presented earlier.  See also   f The Implementing two-sided shading recipe  89    3  Lighting, Shading,   and Optimization  In this chapter, we will cover:   f Shading with multiple positional lights  f Shading with a directional light source  f Using per-fragment shading for improved realism  f Using the halfway vector for improved performance  f Simulating a spotlight  f Creating a cartoon shading effect  f Simulating fog  f Configuring the depth test  Introduction In Chapter 2, The Basics of GLSL Shaders, we covered a number of techniques for  implementing some of the shading effects that were produced by the former fixed-function  pipeline. We also looked at some basic features of GLSL such as functions and subroutines.  In this chapter, we'll move beyond the shading model introduced in Chapter 2, The Basics of  GLSL Shaders, and see how to produce shading effects such as spotlights, fog, and cartoon  style shading. We'll cover how to use multiple light sources, and how to improve the realism of  the results with a technique called per-fragment shading.  We'll also see techniques for improving the efficiency of the shading calculations by using the  so-called "halfway vector" and directional light sources.   Finally, we'll cover how to fine-tune the depth test by configuring the early depth test  optimization.  Shading with multiple positional lights When shading with multiple light sources, we need to evaluate the shading equation for each  light and sum the results to determine the total light intensity reflected by a surface location.  The natural choice is to create uniform arrays to store the position and intensity of each light.  We'll use an array of structures so that we can store the values for multiple lights within a  single uniform variable.  The following figure shows a "pig" mesh rendered with five light sources of different colors.  Note the multiple specular highlights.  Getting ready Set up your OpenGL program with the vertex position in attribute location zero, and the normal  in location one.  How to do it... To create a shader program that renders using the ADS  Phong  shading model with multiple  light sources, use the following steps:  1.  Use the following vertex shader:  layout  location = 0  in vec3 VertexPosition; layout  location = 1  in vec3 VertexNormal;  92   out vec3 Color;  struct LightInfo {   vec4 Position;     Light position in eye coords.   vec3 Intensity;    Light intensity }; uniform LightInfo lights[5];     Material parameters uniform vec3 Kd;               Diffuse reflectivity uniform vec3 Ka;               Ambient reflectivity uniform vec3 Ks;               Specular reflectivity uniform float Shininess;       Specular shininess factor  uniform mat4 ModelViewMatrix; uniform mat3 NormalMatrix; uniform mat4 MVP;  vec3 ads  int lightIndex, vec4 position, vec3 norm   {   vec3 s = normalize  vec3 lights[lightIndex].Position –                             position   ;   vec3 v = normalize vec3 -position  ;   vec3 r = reflect  -s, norm  ;   vec3 I = lights[lightIndex].Intensity;   return         I *   Ka +         Kd * max  dot s, norm , 0.0   +         Ks * pow  max  dot r,v , 0.0  , Shininess    ; } void main   {   vec3 eyeNorm = normalize  NormalMatrix * VertexNormal ;   vec4 eyePosition = ModelViewMatrix *                       vec4 VertexPosition,1.0 ;       Evaluate the lighting equation for each light   Color = vec3 0.0 ;   for  int i = 0; i < 5; i++       Color += ads  i, eyePosition, eyeNorm  ;    gl_Position = MVP * vec4 VertexPosition,1.0 ; }  93   2.  Use the following simple fragment shader:  in vec3 Color;  layout  location = 0   out vec4 FragColor;  void main   {   FragColor = vec4 Color, 1.0 ; }  3.   In the OpenGL application, set the values for the lights array in the vertex shader.  For each light, use something similar to the following code. This example uses the  C++ shader program class  prog is a GLSLProgram object . prog.setUniform "lights[0].Intensity",                 vec3 0.0f,0.8f,0.8f   ; prog.setUniform "lights[0].Position", position  ; Update the array index as appropriate for each light.  How it works... Within the vertex shader, the lighting parameters are stored in the uniform array lights. Each  element of the array is a struct of type LightInfo. This example uses five lights. The light  intensity is stored in the Intensity field, and the position in eye coordinates is stored in the  Position field.  The rest of the uniform variables are essentially the same as in the ADS  ambient, diffuse,  and specular  shader presented in Chapter 2, The Basics of GLSL Shaders.  The ads function is responsible for computing the shading equation for a given light source.  The index of the light is provided as the first parameter lightIndex. The equation is  computed based on the values in the lights array at that index.  In the main function, a for loop is used to compute the shading equation for each light, and  the results are summed into the shader output variable Color.  The fragment shader simply applies the interpolated color to the fragment.   f The Implementing per-vertex ambient, diffuse, and specular  ADS  shading recipe in   Chapter 2, The Basics of GLSL shaders   f The Shading with a directional light source recipe  See also  94   Shading with a directional light source A core component of a shading equation is the vector that points from the surface location  towards the light source  s in previous examples . For lights that are extremely far away, there  is very little variation in this vector over the surface of an object. In fact, for very distant light  sources, the vector is essentially the same for all points on a surface.  Another way of thinking  about this is that the light rays are nearly parallel.  Such a model would be appropriate for a  distant, but powerful, light source such as the sun. Such a light source is commonly called a  directional light source because it does not have a specific position, only a direction.  Of course, we are ignoring the fact that, in reality, the intensity  of the light decreases with the square of the distance from the  source. However, it is not uncommon to ignore this aspect for  directional light sources.  If we are using a directional light source, the direction towards the source is the same for  all points in the scene. Therefore, we can increase the efficiency of our shading calculations  because we no longer need to recompute the direction towards the light source for each  location on the surface.  Of course, there is a visual difference between a positional light source and a directional one.  The following figures show a torus rendered with a positional light  left  and a directional light   right . In the left figure, the light is located somewhat close to the torus. The directional light  covers more of the surface of the torus due to the fact that all of the rays are parallel.  In previous versions of OpenGL, the fourth component of the light position was used to  determine whether or not a light was considered directional. A zero in the fourth component  indicated that the light source was directional and the position was to be treated as a  direction towards the source  a vector . Otherwise, the position was treated as the actual  location of the light source. In this example, we'll emulate the same functionality.  95   Getting ready Set up your OpenGL program with the vertex position in attribute location zero, and the vertex  normal in location one.  How to do it... To create a shader program that implements ADS shading using a directional light source, use  the following code:  1.  Use the following vertex shader:  layout  location = 0  in vec3 VertexPosition; layout  location = 1  in vec3 VertexNormal;  out vec3 Color;  uniform vec4 LightPosition; uniform vec3 LightIntensity;  uniform vec3 Kd;               Diffuse reflectivity uniform vec3 Ka;               Ambient reflectivity uniform vec3 Ks;               Specular reflectivity uniform float Shininess;       Specular shininess factor  uniform mat4 ModelViewMatrix; uniform mat3 NormalMatrix; uniform mat4 ProjectionMatrix; uniform mat4 MVP;  vec3 ads  vec4 position, vec3 norm   {   vec3 s;   if  LightPosition.w == 0.0       s = normalize vec3 LightPosition  ;   else     s = normalize vec3 LightPosition - position  ;   vec3 v = normalize vec3 -position  ;   vec3 r = reflect  -s, norm  ;   return     LightIntensity *   Ka +                      Kd * max  dot s, norm , 0.0   +                      Ks * pow  max  dot r,v , 0.0  ,                        Shininess    ; }  96   void main   {   vec3 eyeNorm = normalize  NormalMatrix * VertexNormal ;   vec4 eyePosition = ModelViewMatrix *                       vec4 VertexPosition,1.0 ;       Evaluate the lighting equation   Color = ads  eyePosition, eyeNorm  ;   gl_Position = MVP * vec4 VertexPosition,1.0 ; }  2.  Use the same simple fragment shader from the previous recipe:  in vec3 Color;  layout  location = 0   out vec4 FragColor;  void main   {   FragColor = vec4 Color, 1.0 ; }  How it works... Within the vertex shader, the fourth coordinate of the uniform variable LightPosition is used  to determine whether or not the light is to be treated as a directional light. Inside the ads  function, which is responsible for computing the shading equation, the value of the vector s  is determined based on whether or not the fourth coordinate of LightPosition is zero. If the  value is zero, LightPosition is normalized and used as the direction towards the light source.  Otherwise, LightPosition is treated as a location in eye coordinates, and we compute the  direction towards the light source by subtracting the vertex position from LightPosition and  normalizing the result.  There's more... There is a slight efficiency gain when using directional lights due to the fact that there is no  need to recompute the light direction for each vertex. This saves a subtraction operation,  which is a small gain, but could accumulate when there are several lights, or when the lighting  is computed per-fragment.  See also   f The Implementing per-vertex ambient, diffuse, and specular  ADS  shading recipe in   Chapter 2, The Basics of GLSL Shaders.   f The Using per-fragment shading for improved realism recipe  97   Using per-fragment shading for improved  realism When the shading equation is evaluated within the vertex shader  as we have done in  previous recipes , we end up with a color associated with each vertex. That color is then  interpolated across the face, and the fragment shader assigns that interpolated color to the  output fragment. As mentioned previously  the Implementing flat shading recipe in Chapter  2, The Basics of GLSL Shaders , this technique is often called Gouraud shading. Gouraud  shading  like all shading techniques  is an approximation, and can lead to some less than  desirable results when; for example, the reflection characteristics at the vertices have little  resemblance to those in the center of the polygon. For example, a bright specular highlight  may reside in the center of a polygon, but not at its vertices. Simply evaluating the shading  equation at the vertices would prevent the specular highlight from appearing in the rendered  result. Other undesirable artifacts, such as edges of polygons, may also appear when Gouraud  shading is used, due to the fact that color interpolation is less physically accurate.  To improve the accuracy of our results, we can move the computation of the shading equation  from the vertex shader to the fragment shader. Instead of interpolating color across the  polygon, we interpolate the position and normal vector, and use these values to evaluate the  shading equation at each fragment. This technique is often called Phong shading or Phong  interpolation. The results from Phong shading are much more accurate and provide more  pleasing results, but some undesirable artifacts may still appear.  The following figure shows the difference between Gouraud and Phong shading. The scene  on the left is rendered with Gouraud  per-vertex  shading, and on the right is the same scene  rendered using Phong  per-fragment  shading. Underneath the teapot is a partial plane, drawn  with a single quad. Note the difference in the specular highlight on the teapot, as well as the  variation in the color of the plane beneath the teapot.  In this example, we'll implement Phong shading by passing the position and normal from the  vertex shader to the fragment shader, and then evaluate the ADS shading model within the  fragment shader.  98   Getting ready Set up your OpenGL program with the vertex position in attribute location zero, and the  normal in location one. Your OpenGL application must also provide the values for the uniform  variables Ka, Kd, Ks, Shininess, LightPosition, and LightIntensity, the first four  of which are the standard material properties  reflectivities  of the ADS shading model. The  latter two are the position of the light in eye coordinates, and the intensity of the light source,  respectively. Finally, the OpenGL application must also provide the values for the uniforms  ModelViewMatrix, NormalMatrix, ProjectionMatrix, and MVP.  How to do it... To create a shader program that can be used for implementing per-fragment  or Phong   shading using the ADS shading model, use the following steps:  1.  Use the following code for the vertex shader:  layout  location = 0  in vec3 VertexPosition; layout  location = 1  in vec3 VertexNormal;  out vec3 Position; out vec3 Normal;  uniform mat4 ModelViewMatrix; uniform mat3 NormalMatrix; uniform mat4 ProjectionMatrix; uniform mat4 MVP;  void main   {     Normal = normalize  NormalMatrix * VertexNormal ;     Position = vec3  ModelViewMatrix *                      vec4 VertexPosition,1.0   ;     gl_Position = MVP * vec4 VertexPosition,1.0 ; }  2.  Use the following code for the fragment shader:  in vec3 Position; in vec3 Normal;  uniform vec4 LightPosition; uniform vec3 LightIntensity; uniform vec3 Kd;               Diffuse reflectivity uniform vec3 Ka;               Ambient reflectivity uniform vec3 Ks;               Specular reflectivity uniform float Shininess;       Specular shininess factor  99   layout  location = 0   out vec4 FragColor;  vec3 ads    {   vec3 n = normalize  Normal  ;   vec3 s = normalize  vec3 LightPosition  - Position  ;   vec3 v = normalize vec3 -Position  ;   vec3 r = reflect  -s, n  ;   return     LightIntensity *         Ka +       Kd * max  dot s, n , 0.0   +       Ks * pow  max  dot r,v , 0.0  , Shininess    ; }  void main   {   FragColor = vec4 ads  , 1.0 ; }  How it works... The vertex shader has two output variables: Position and Normal. In the main function,  we convert the vertex normal to eye coordinates by transforming with the normal matrix, and  then store the converted value in Normal. Similarly, the vertex position is converted to eye  coordinates by transforming it by the model-view matrix, and the converted value is stored   in Position.  The values of Position and Normal are automatically interpolated and provided to the  fragment shader via the corresponding input variables. The fragment shader then computes  the standard ADS shading equation using the values provided. The result is then stored in the  output variable, FragColor.  There's more... Evaluating the shading equation within the fragment shader produces more accurate  renderings. However, the price we pay is in the evaluation of the shading model for each  pixel of the polygon, rather than at each vertex. The good news is that with modern graphics  cards, there may be enough processing power to evaluate all of the fragments for a polygon in  parallel. This can essentially provide nearly equivalent performance for either per-fragment or  per-vertex shading.  See also  100   f The Implementing per-vertex ambient, diffuse, and specular  ADS  shading recipe in   Chapter 2, The Basics of GLSL Shaders   Using the halfway vector for improved  performance As covered in the Implementing per-vertex ambient, diffuse, and specular  ADS  shading  recipe in Chapter 2, The Basics of GLSL Shaders, the specular term in the ADS shading  equation involves the dot product of the vector of pure reflection  r , and the direction   towards the viewer  v .  In order to evaluate the above equation, we need to find the vector of pure reflection  r , which  is the reflection of the vector towards the light source  s  about the normal vector  n .  This equation is implemented by the GLSL function: reflect.  The above equation requires a dot product, an addition, and a couple of multiplication  operations. We can gain a slight improvement in the efficiency of the specular calculation by  making use of the following observation. When v is aligned with r, the normal vector  n  must  be halfway between v and s.  Let's define the halfway vector  h  as the vector that is halfway between v and s, where h is  normalized after the addition:  The following diagram shows the relative positions of the halfway vector and the others:  h  n  r  v  s  101   We can then replace the dot product in the equation for the specular component, with the dot  product of h and n.  Computing h requires fewer operations than it takes to compute r, so we should expect some  efficiency gain by using the halfway vector. The angle between the halfway vector and the  normal vector is proportional to the angle between the vector of pure reflection  r  and the  vector towards the viewer  v  when all vectors are coplanar. Therefore, we expect that the  visual results will be similar, although not exactly the same.  Getting ready Start by utilizing the same shader program that was presented in the recipe, Using   per-fragment shading for improved realism, and set up your OpenGL program as   described there.  How to do it... Using the same shader pair as in the recipe, Using per-fragment shading for improved  realism, replace the ads function in the fragment shader with the following code:  vec3 ads    {     vec3 n = normalize  Normal  ;     vec3 s = normalize  vec3 LightPosition  - Position  ;     vec3 v = normalize vec3 -Position  ;     vec3 h = normalize  v + s  ;      return         LightIntensity *               Ka +              Kd * max  dot s, Normal , 0.0   +              Ks * pow max dot h,n ,0.0 , Shininess    ; }  How it works... We compute the halfway vector by summing the direction towards the viewer  v , and the  direction towards the light source  s , and normalizing the result. The value for the halfway  vector is then stored in h.  102   The specular calculation is then modified to use the dot product between h and the normal  vector  Normal . The rest of the calculation is unchanged.  There's more... The halfway vector provides a slight improvement in the efficiency of our specular calculation,  and the visual results are quite similar. The following figure shows the teapot rendered using  the halfway vector  right , versus the same rendering using the equation provided in the  Implementing per-vertex ambient, diffuse, and specular  ADS  shading recipe in Chapter 2, The  Basics of GLSL Shaders  left . The halfway vector produces a larger specular highlight, but the  visual impact is not substantially different. If desired, we could compensate for the difference  in the size of the specular highlight by increasing the value of the exponent Shininess.  See also   f The Using per-fragment shading for improved realism recipe  Simulating a spotlight The fixed function pipeline had the ability to define light sources as spotlights. In such a  configuration, the light source was considered to be one that only radiated light within a cone,  the apex of which was located at the light source. Additionally, the light was attenuated so  that it was maximal along the axis of the cone and decreased towards the outside edges. This  allowed us to create light sources that had a similar visual effect to a real spotlight.  103   The following figure shows a teapot and a torus rendered with a single spotlight. Note the  slight decrease in the intensity of the spotlight from the center towards the outside edge.  In this recipe, we'll use a shader to implement a spotlight effect similar to that produced by  the fixed-function pipeline.  P  c  d  The spotlight's cone is defined by a spotlight direction  d in the preceding figure , a cutoff  angle  c in the preceding figure , and a position  P in the preceding figure . The intensity of the  spotlight is considered to be strongest along the axis of the cone, and decreases as you move  towards the edges.  Getting ready Start with the same vertex shader from the recipe, Using per-fragment shading for improved  realism. Your OpenGL program must set the values for all uniform variables defined in that  vertex shader as well as the fragment shader shown below.  104   How to do it... To create a shader program that uses the ADS shading model with a spotlight, use the  following code for the fragment shader:  in vec3 Position; in vec3 Normal;  struct SpotLightInfo {   vec4 position;     Position in eye coords.   vec3 intensity;    Amb., Diff., and Specular intensity   vec3 direction;    Normalized direction of the spotlight    float exponent;    Angular attenuation exponent   float cutoff;      Cutoff angle  between 0 and 90  }; uniform SpotLightInfo Spot;  uniform vec3 Kd;               Diffuse reflectivity uniform vec3 Ka;               Ambient reflectivity uniform vec3 Ks;               Specular reflectivity uniform float Shininess;       Specular shininess factor  layout  location = 0   out vec4 FragColor;  vec3 adsWithSpotlight    {   vec3 s = normalize  vec3  Spot.position  - Position  ;   float angle = acos  dot -s, Spot.direction   ;   float cutoff = radians  clamp  Spot.cutoff, 0.0, 90.0    ;   vec3 ambient = Spot.intensity * Ka;    if  angle < cutoff   {     float spotFactor = pow  dot -s, Spot.direction ,                             Spot.exponent  ;   vec3 v = normalize vec3 -Position  ;   vec3 h = normalize  v + s  ;   return     ambient +     spotFactor * Spot.intensity *         Kd * max  dot s, Normal , 0.0   +       Ks * pow max dot h,Normal , 0.0 ,Shininess  ;   } else {     return ambient;     } }  void main   {   FragColor = vec4 adsWithSpotlight  , 1.0 ; }  105   How it works... The structure SpotLightInfo defines all of the configuration options for the spotlight.  We declare a single uniform variable named Spot to store the data for our spotlight. The  position field defines the location of the spotlight in eye coordinates. The intensity field  is the intensity  ambient, diffuse, and specular  of the spotlight. If desired, you could break  this into three variables. The direction field will contain the direction that the spotlight is  pointing, which defines the center axis of the spotlight's cone. This vector should be specified  in eye coordinates. Within the OpenGL program it should be transformed by the normal  matrix in the same way that normal vectors would be transformed. We could do so within the  shader; however, within the shader, the normal matrix would be specified for the object being  rendered. This may not be the appropriate transform for the spotlight's direction.  The exponent field defines the exponent that is used when calculating the angular  attenuation of the spotlight. The intensity of the spotlight is decreased in proportion to the  cosine of the angle between the vector from the light to the surface location  the negation of  the variable s  and the direction of the spotlight. That cosine term is then raised to the power  of the variable exponent. The larger the value of this variable, the faster the intensity of the  spotlight is decreased. This is quite similar to the exponent in the specular shading term.  The cutoff field defines the angle between the central axis and the outer edge of the  spotlight's cone of light. We specify this angle in degrees, and clamp its value between   0 and 90.  The function, adsWithSpotlight, computes the standard ambient, diffuse, and specular   ADS  shading equation, using a spotlight as the light source. The first line computes the  vector from the surface location to the spotlight's position  s . Next, the spotlight's direction is  normalized and stored within spotDir. The angle between spotDir and the negation of s  is then computed and stored in the variable angle. The cutoff variable stores the value of  Spot.cutoff after it has been clamped between 0 and 90, and converted from degrees to  radians. Next, the ambient lighting component is computed and stored in the ambient variable.  We then compare the value of the angle variable with that of the cutoff variable. If angle  is less than cutoff, then the surface point is within the spotlight's cone. Otherwise the  surface point only receives ambient light, so we return only the ambient component.  If angle is less than cutoff, we compute the spotFactor variable by raising the dot  product of –s and spotDir to the power of Spot.exponent. The value of spotFactor is  used to scale the intensity of the light so that the light is maximal in the center of the cone,  and decreases as you move towards the edges. Finally, the ADS shading equation is computed  as usual, but the diffuse and specular terms are scaled by spotFactor.  106   See also   f The Using per-fragment shading for improved realism recipe  f The Implementing per-vertex ambient, diffuse, and specular shading  ADS  recipe in   Chapter 2, The Basics of GLSL Shaders  Creating a cartoon shading effect Toon shading  also called Celshading  is a non-photorealistic technique that is intended to  mimic the style of shading often used in hand-drawn animation. There are many different  techniques that are used to produce this effect. In this recipe, we'll use a very simple  technique that involves a slight modification to the ambient and diffuse shading model.  The basic effect is to have large areas of constant color with sharp transitions between them.  This simulates the way that an artist might shade an object using strokes of a pen or brush.  The following figure shows an example of a teapot and torus rendered with toon shading.  The technique presented here involves computing only the ambient and diffuse components  of the typical ADS shading model, and quantizing the cosine term of the diffuse component.   In other words, the value of the dot product normally used in the diffuse term is restricted to   a fixed number of possible values. The following table illustrates the concept for four levels:  Cosine of the Angle between s and n Between 1 and 0.75 Between 0.75 and 0.5 Between 0.5 and 0.25 Between 0.25 and 0.0  Value used 0.75 0.5 0.25 0.0  107   In the preceding table, s is the vector towards the light source and n is the normal vector at  the surface. By restricting the value of the cosine term in this way, the shading displays strong  discontinuities from one level to another  see the preceding figure , simulating the pen strokes  of hand-drawn cel animation.  Getting ready Start with the same vertex shader from the Using per-fragment shading for improved realism  recipe. Your OpenGL program must set the values for all uniform variables defined in that  vertex shader as well as the fragment shader code described below.  How to do it... To create a shader program that produces a toon shading effect, use the following   fragment shader:  in vec3 Position; in vec3 Normal;  struct LightInfo {   vec4 position;   vec3 intensity; }; uniform LightInfo Light;  uniform vec3 Kd;               Diffuse reflectivity uniform vec3 Ka;               Ambient reflectivity  const int levels = 3; const float scaleFactor = 1.0   levels; layout  location = 0   out vec4 FragColor; vec3 toonShade    {   vec3 s = normalize  Light.position.xyz - Position.xyz  ;   float cosine = max  0.0, dot  s, Normal    ;   vec3 diffuse = Kd * floor  cosine * levels   *                   scaleFactor;    return Light.intensity *  Ka + diffuse ; }  void main   {   FragColor = vec4 toonShade  , 1.0 ; }  108   How it works... The constant variable, levels, defines how many distinct values will be used in the diffuse  calculation. This could also be defined as a uniform variable to allow for configuration from the  main OpenGL application. We will use this variable to quantize the value of the cosine term in  the diffuse calculation.  The toonShade function is the most significant part of this shader. We start by computing  s, the vector towards the light source. Next, we compute the cosine term of the diffuse  component by evaluating the dot product of s and Normal. The next line quantizes that value  in the following way. Since the two vectors are normalized, and we have removed negative  values with the max function, we are sure that the value of cosine is between zero and one.  By multiplying this value by levels and taking the floor, the result will be an integer between 0  and levels –1. When we divide that value by levels  by multiplying by scaleFactor , we scale  these integral values to be between zero and one again. The result is a value that can be one  of levels possible values spaced between zero and one. This result is then multiplied by Kd,  the diffuse reflectivity term.  Finally, we combine the diffuse and ambient components together to get the final color for   the fragment.  There's more... When quantizing the cosine term, we could have used ceil instead of floor. Doing so would  have simply shifted each of the possible values up by one level. This would make the levels of  shading slightly brighter.  The typical cartoon style seen in most cel animation includes black outlines around the  silhouettes and along other edges of a shape. The shading model presented here does not  produce those black outlines. There are several techniques for producing them, and we'll look  at one later on in this book.

The amount of influence of the fog color is determined by the distance from the camera.  We could use either a linear relationship between the distance and the amount of fog color, or  we could use a non-linear relationship such as an exponential one.  The following figure shows four teapots rendered with a fog effect produced by mixing the fog  color in a linear relationship with distance.  To define this linear relationship we can use the following equation:  In the preceding equation, dmin is the distance from the eye where the fog is minimal  no fog  contribution , and dmax is the distance where the fog color obscures all other colors in the  scene. The variable z represents the distance from the eye. The value f is the fog factor. A  fog factor of zero represents 100 percent fog, and a factor of one represents no fog. Since fog  typically looks thickest at large distances, the fog factor is minimal when z is equal to dmax,  and maximal when z is equal to dmin.  Since the fog is applied by the fragment shader, the effect  will only be visible on the objects that are rendered. It will not  appear on any "empty" space in the scene  the background .  To help make the fog effect consistent, you should use a  background color that matches the maximum fog color.  110   Getting ready Start with the same vertex shader from the Using per-fragment shading for improved realism  recipe. Your OpenGL program must set the values for all uniform variables defined in that  vertex shader as well as the fragment shader shown in the following section.  How to do it... To create a shader that produces a fog-like effect, use the following code for the   fragment shader:  in vec3 Position; in vec3 Normal;  struc tLightInfo {   vec4 position;   vec3 intensity; }; uniform LightInfo Light;  struct FogInfo {   float maxDist;   float minDist;   vec3 color; }; uniform FogInfo Fog;  uniform vec3 Kd;               Diffuse reflectivity uniform vec3 Ka;               Ambient reflectivity uniform vec3 Ks;               Specular reflectivity uniform float Shininess;       Specular shininess factor  layout  location = 0   out vec4 FragColor;  vec3 ads    {       … The ADS shading algorithm  }  void main   {   float dist = abs  Position.z  ;   float fogFactor =  Fog.maxDist - dist                            Fog.maxDist - Fog.minDist ;   fogFactor = clamp  fogFactor, 0.0, 1.0  ;   vec3 shadeColor = ads  ;   vec3 color = mix  Fog.color, shadeColor, fogFactor  ;    FragColor = vec4 color, 1.0 ; }  111   How it works... In this shader, the ads function is exactly the same as the one used in the recipe Using the  halfway vector for improved performance. The part of this shader that deals with the fog effect  lies within the main function.  The uniform variable Fog contains the parameters that define the extent and color of the fog.  The minDist field is the distance from the eye to the fog's starting point, and maxDist is the  distance to the point where the fog is maximal. The color field is the color of the fog.  The dist variable is used to store the distance from the surface point to the eye position.   The z coordinate of the position is used as an estimate of the actual distance. The fogFactor  variable is computed using the preceding equation. Since dist may not be between minDist  and maxDist, we clamp the value of fogFactor to be between zero and one.  We then call the ads function to evaluate the basic ADS shading model. The result of this is  stored in the shadeColor variable.  Finally, we mix shadeColor and Fog.color together based on the value of fogFactor,  and the result is used as the fragment color.  There's more... In this recipe, we used a linear relationship between the amount of fog color and the distance  from the eye. Another choice would be to use an exponential relationship. For example, the  following equation could be used:  In the above equation, d represents the density of the fog. Larger values would create   "thicker" fog. We could also square the exponent to create a slightly different relationship    a faster increase in the fog with distance .  Computing distance from the eye In the above code, we used the absolute value of the z coordinate as the distance from the  camera. This may cause the fog to look a bit unrealistic in certain situations. To compute a  more precise distance, we could replace the line:  float dist = abs  Position.z  ;  with the following:  112  float dist = length  Position.xyz  ;   Of course, the latter version requires a square root, and therefore would be a bit slower   in practice.  See also   f The Using per-fragment shading for improved realism recipe  f The Implementing per-vertex ambient, diffuse, and specular  ADS  shading recipe in   Chapter 2, The Basics of GLSL Shaders  Configuring the depth test GLSL 4 provides the ability to configure how the depth test is performed. This gives us  additional control over how and when fragments are tested against the depth buffer.  Many OpenGL implementations automatically provide an optimization known as the early  depth test or early fragment test. With this optimization, the depth test is performed before  the fragment shader is executed. Since fragments that fail the depth test will not appear on  the screen  or the framebuffer , there is no point in executing the fragment shader at all for  those fragments and we can save some time by avoiding the execution.  The OpenGL specification, however, states that the depth test is performed after the fragment  shader. This means that if an implementation wishes to use the early depth test optimization,  it must be careful. The implementation must make sure that if anything within the fragment  shader might change the results of the depth test, then it should avoid using the early   depth test.  For example, a fragment shader can change the depth of a fragment by writing to the output  variable, gl_FragDepth. If it does so, then the early depth test cannot be performed  because, of course, the final depth of the fragment is not known prior to the execution of  the fragment shader. However, the GLSL provides ways to notify the pipeline roughly how the  depth will be modified, so that the implementation may determine when it might be ok to use  the early depth test.  Another possibility is that the fragment shader might conditionally discard the fragment using  the discard keyword. If there is any possibility that the fragment may be discarded, some  implementations may not perform the early depth test.  There are also certain situations where we want to rely on the early depth test. For example,  if the fragment shader writes to memory other than the framebuffer  with image load store,  shader storage buffers, or other incoherent memory writing , we might not want the fragment  shader to execute for fragments that fail the depth test. This would help us to avoid writing  data for fragments that fail. The GLSL provides a technique for forcing the early depth   test optimization.  113   How to do it... To ask the OpenGL pipeline to always perform the early depth test optimization, use the  following layout qualifier in your fragment shader:  layout early_fragment_tests  in;  If your fragment shader will modify the fragment's depth, but you still would like to take  advantage of the early depth test when possible, use the following layout qualifier in a  declaration of gl_FragDepth within your fragment shader:  layout  depth_*  out float gl_FragDepth;  Where, depth_* is one of the following: depth_any, depth_greater, depth_less,   or depth_unchanged.  How it works... The following statement forces the OpenGL implementation to always perform the early   depth test:  layout early_fragment_tests  in;  We must keep in mind that if we attempt to modify the depth anywhere within the shader   by writing to gl_FragDepth, the value that is written will be ignored.  If your fragment shader needs to modify the depth value, then we can't force early fragment  tests. However, we can help the pipeline to determine when it can still apply the early test.  We do so by using one of the layout qualifiers for gl_FragDepth as shown above. This  places some limits on how the value will be modified. The OpenGL implementation can then  determine if the fragment shader can be skipped. If it can be determined that the depth  will not be changed in such a way that it would cause the result of the test to change, the  implementation can still use the optimization.  The layout qualifier for the output variable gl_FragDepth tells the OpenGL implementation  specifically how the depth might change within the fragment shader. The qualifier depth_any  indicates that it could change in any way. This is the default.  The other qualifiers describe how the value may change with respect to gl_FragCoord.z.   f depth_greater: This fragment shader promises to only increase the depth.  f depth_less: This fragment shader promises to only decrease the depth.  f depth_unchanged: This fragment shader promises not to change the depth. If it   writes to gl_FragDepth, the value will be equal to gl_FragCoord.z.  114   If you use one of these qualifiers, but then go on to modify the depth in an incompatible way,  the results are undefined. For example, if you declare gl_FragDepth with depth_greater,  but decrease the depth of the fragment, the code will compile and execute, but you shouldn't  expect to see accurate results.  If your fragment shader writes to gl_FragDepth, then it  must be sure to write a value in all circumstances. In other  words, it must write a value no matter which branches are  taken within the code.

The use of textures within a shader opens up a huge range of  possibilities. Beyond just using textures as sources of color information, they can be used for  things like depth information, shading parameters, displacement maps, normal vectors, or  other vertex data. The list is virtually endless. Textures are among the most widely used tools  for advanced effects in OpenGL programs, and that isn't likely to change anytime soon.  In OpenGL 4, we now have the ability to read and write to memory  via buffer textures, shader storage buffer objects, and image  textures  image load store . This further muddies the waters of  what exactly defines a texture. In general, we might just think of it  as a buffer of data that may or may not contain an image.   OpenGL 4.2 introduced immutable storage textures. Despite what the term may imply,  immutable storage textures are not textures that can't change. Instead, the term immutable  refers to the fact that, once the texture is allocated, the storage cannot be changed. That is,  the size, format, and number of layers are fixed, but the texture content itself can be modified.  The word immutable refers to the allocation of the memory, not the contents of the memory.  Immutable storage textures are preferable in the vast majority of cases because of the  fact that many run-time  draw-time  consistency checks can be avoided, and you include a  certain degree of "type safety," since we can't accidentally change the allocation of a texture.  Throughout this book, we'll use immutable storage textures exclusively.  Immutable storage textures are allocated using the glTexStorage*  functions. If you're experienced with textures, you might be accustomed to  using glTexImage* functions, which are still supported, but create mutable  storage textures.  In this chapter, we'll look at some basic and advanced texturing techniques. We'll start with  the basics, just applying color textures, and move on to using textures as normal maps and  environment maps. With environment maps, we can simulate things like reflection and  refraction. We'll see an example of projecting a texture onto objects in a scene similar to  the way that a slide projector projects an image. Finally, we'll wrap up with an example of  rendering directly to a texture using framebuffer objects  FBOs  and then applying that  texture to an object.  Applying a 2D texture In GLSL, applying a texture to a surface involves accessing texture memory to retrieve a color  associated with a texture coordinate, and then applying that color to the output fragment.  The application of the color to the output fragment could involve mixing the color with the  color produced by a shading model, simply applying the color directly, using the color in the  reflection model, or some other mixing process. In GLSL, textures are accessed via sampler  variables. A sampler variable is a "handle" to a texture unit. It is typically declared as a uniform  variable within the shader and initialized within the main OpenGL application to point to the  appropriate texture unit.  In this recipe, we'll look at a simple example involving the application of a 2D texture to a  surface as shown in the following image. We'll use the texture color to scale the color provided  by the ambient, diffuse, and specular  ADS  reflection model. The following image shows the  results of a brick texture applied to a cube. The texture is shown on the right and the rendered  result is on the left.  118   Getting ready Set up your OpenGL application to provide the vertex position in attribute location 0, the  vertex normal in attribute location 1, and the texture coordinate in attribute location 2. The  parameters for the ADS reflection model are declared again as uniform variables within the  shader, and must be initialized from the OpenGL program. Make the handle to the shader  available in a variable named programHandle.  How to do it... To render a simple shape with a 2D texture, use the following steps:  1.   In your initialization of the OpenGL application, use the following code to load the  texture.  The following makes use of a simple TGA image loader, provided with the  sample code.  GLint width, height; GLubyte * data = TGAIO::read "brick1.tga", width, height ;     Copy file to OpenGL glActiveTexture GL_TEXTURE0 ; GLuint tid; glGenTextures 1, &tid ; glBindTexture GL_TEXTURE_2D, tid ; glTexStorage2D GL_TEXTURE_2D, 1, GL_RGBA8, w, h ; glTexSubImage2D GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, 0, 0, width, height,                    GL_RGBA, GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, data ; glTexParameteri GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER,                  GL_LINEAR ; glTexParameteri GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER,                  GL_LINEAR ;  119   delete [] data;     Set the Tex1 sampler uniform to refer to texture unit 0 int loc = glGetUniformLocation programHandle, "Tex1" ; if  loc >= 0     glUniform1i loc, 0 ;  2.  Use the following code for the vertex shader:  layout  location = 0  in vec3 VertexPosition; layout  location = 1  in vec3 VertexNormal; layout  location = 2  in vec2 VertexTexCoord;  out vec3 Position; out vec3 Normal; out vec2 TexCoord;  uniform mat4 ModelViewMatrix; uniform mat3 NormalMatrix; uniform mat4 ProjectionMatrix; uniform mat4 MVP;  void main   {   TexCoord = VertexTexCoord;   Normal = normalize  NormalMatrix * VertexNormal ;   Position = vec3  ModelViewMatrix *                      vec4 VertexPosition,1.0   ;    gl_Position = MVP * vec4 VertexPosition,1.0 ; }  3.  Use the following code for the fragment shader:  in vec3 Position; in vec3 Normal; in vec2 TexCoord;  uniform sampler2D Tex1;  struct LightInfo {   vec4 Position;     Light position in eye coords.   vec3 Intensity;    A,D,S intensity };  120   uniform LightInfo Light;  struct MaterialInfo {   vec3 Ka;               Ambient reflectivity   vec3 Kd;               Diffuse reflectivity   vec3 Ks;               Specular reflectivity   float Shininess;       Specular shininess factor }; uniform MaterialInfo Material;  layout  location = 0   out vec4 FragColor;  void phongModel  vec3 pos, vec3 norm,     out vec3 ambAndDiff, out vec3 spec   {        Compute the ADS shading model here, return ambient        and diffuse color in ambAndDiff, and return specular        color in spec    } void main   {   vec3 ambAndDiff, spec;   vec4 texColor = texture  Tex1, TexCoord  ;   phongModel Position, Normal, ambAndDiff, spec ;   FragColor = vec4 ambAndDiff, 1.0  * texColor +                  vec4 spec, 1.0 ; }  How it works... The first code segment demonstrates the steps needed to load the texture from a file, copy  the texture data to OpenGL memory, and initialize the sampler variable within the GLSL  program. The first step, loading the texture image file, is accomplished via a simple TGA image  loader that is provided along with the example code  TGAIO::read   . It reads the image  data from a file in the TGA format, and stores the data into an array of unsigned bytes in RGBA  order. The width and height of the image are returned via the last two parameters. We keep a  pointer to the image data, simply named data.  121   The TGA format is simple and easy to understand, it is free of any  encumbering patents, and supports true color images with an  alpha channel. This makes it a very convenient format for texture  reading writing. If your images are not in that format, just grab  a copy of ImageMagick and convert. However, the TGA format is  not very memory efficient. If you want to load images stored in  other formats, there are a variety of other options. For example,  check out ResIL  http:  resil.sourceforge.net  , or  Freeimage  http:  freeimage.sourceforge.net  .  Experienced OpenGL programmers should be familiar with the next part of the code. First,  we call glActiveTexture to set the current active texture unit to GL_TEXTURE0  the first  texture unit, also called a texture channel . The subsequent texture state calls will be effective  on texture unit zero. The next two lines involve creating a new texture object by calling  glGenTextures.. The handle for the new texture object is stored in the variable tid.   Then, we call glBindTexture to bind the new texture object to the GL_TEXTURE_2D target.  Once the texture is bound to that target, we allocate immutable storage for the texture   with glTexStorage2D. After that, we copy the data for that texture into the texture object  using glTexSubImage2D. The last argument to this function is a pointer to the raw data for  the image.  The next steps involve setting the magnification and minimization filters for the texture object  using glTexParameteri. For this example, we'll use GL_LINEAR.  The texture filter setting determines whether any interpolation  will be done prior to returning the color from the texture. This  setting can have a strong effect on the quality of the results.  In this example, GL_LINEAR indicates that it will return a  weighted average of the four texels that are nearest to the texture  coordinates. For details on the other filtering options, see the  OpenGL documentation for glTexParameteri: http:  www. opengl.org wiki GLAPI glTexParameter.  Next, we delete the texture data pointed to by data. There's no need to hang on to this,  because it was copied into texture memory via glTexSubImage2D.  Finally, we set the uniform variable Tex1 in the GLSL program to zero. This is our sampler  variable. Note that it is declared within the fragment shader with type sampler2D. Setting its  value to zero indicates to the OpenGL system that the variable should refer to texture unit zero   the same one selected previously with glActiveTexture .  The vertex shader is very similar to the one used in previous examples except for the addition  of the texture coordinate input variable VertexTexCoord, which is bound to attribute  location 2. Its value is simply passed along to the fragment shader by assigning it to the  shader output variable TexCoord.  122   The fragment shader is also very similar to those used in the recipes of previous chapters.  The important parts for the purpose of this recipe involve the variable Tex1. Tex1 is a  sampler2D variable that was assigned by the OpenGL program to refer to texture unit zero.  In the main function, we use that variable along with the texture coordinate  TexCoord   to access the texture. We do so by calling the built-in function texture. This is a general  purpose function, used to access a texture. The first parameter is a sampler variable  indicating which texture unit is to be accessed, and the second parameter is the texture  coordinate used to access the texture. The return value is a vec4 containing the color  obtained by the texture access  stored in texColor , which in this case is an interpolated  value with the four nearest texture values  texels .  Next, the shading model is evaluated by calling phongModel and the results are returned in  the parameters ambAndDiff and spec. The variable ambAndDiff contains only the ambient  and diffuse components of the shading model. A color texture is often only intended to affect  the diffuse component of the shading model and not the specular. So we multiply the texture  color by the ambient and diffuse components and then add the specular. The final sum is  then applied to the output fragment FragColor.  There's more... There are several choices that could be made when deciding how to combine the texture color  with other colors associated with the fragment. In this example, we decided to multiply the  colors, but one could have chosen to use the texture color directly, or to mix them in some way  based on the alpha value.  Another choice would be to use the texture value as the value of the diffuse and or specular  reflectivity coefficient s  in the Phong reflection model. The choice is up to you!  Specifying the sampler binding within GLSL As of OpenGL 4.2, we now have the ability to specify the default value of the sampler's binding   the value of the sampler uniform  within GLSL. In the previous example, we of set the value of  the uniform variable from the OpenGL side using the following code:  int loc = glGetUniformLocation programHandle, "Tex1" ; if  loc >= 0     glUniform1i loc, 0 ;  Instead, if we're using OpenGL 4.2, we can specify the default value within the shader, using  the layout qualifier as shown in the following statement:  layout  binding=0  uniform sampler2D Tex1;  Thus simplifying the code on the OpenGL side, and making one less thing we need to worry  about. The example code that accompanies this book uses this technique to specify the value  of Tex1, so take a look there for a more complete example. We'll also use this layout qualifier  in the following recipes.  123   See also   f For more information about sending data to a shader via vertex attributes refer the  Sending data to a shader using vertex attributes and vertex buffer objects recipe in  Chapter 1, Getting Started with GLSL   f The Using per-fragment shading for improved realism recipe in Chapter 3, Lighting,   Shading and Optimization  Applying multiple textures The application of multiple textures to a surface can be used to create a wide variety of  effects. The base layer texture might represent the "clean" surface and the second layer could  provide additional detail such as shadow, blemishes, roughness, or damage. In many games,  so-called light maps are applied as an additional texture layer to provide the information  about light exposure, effectively producing shadows and shading without the need to  explicitly calculate the reflection model. These kinds of textures are sometimes referred to as  "prebaked" lighting.  In this recipe, we'll demonstrate this multiple texture technique by applying two layers of  texture. The base layer will be a fully opaque brick image, and the second layer will be one  that is partially transparent. The non-transparent parts look like moss that has grown on the  bricks beneath.  The following image shows an example of multiple textures. The textures on the left are  applied to the cube on the right. The base layer is the brick texture, and the moss texture is  applied on top. The transparent parts of the moss texture reveal the brick texture underneath.  124   Getting ready Set up your OpenGL application to provide the vertex position in attribute location 0, the  vertex normal in attribute location 1, and the texture coordinate in attribute location 2. The  parameters for the Phong reflection model are declared as uniform variables within the  shader and must be initialized from the OpenGL program.  How to do it... To render objects with multiple textures, use the following steps:  1.   In the initialization section of your OpenGL program, load the two images into texture  memory in the same way as indicated in the previous recipe Applying a 2D texture.  Make sure that the brick texture is loaded into texture unit 0 and the moss texture is  in texture unit 1. Use the following code to do this: GLuint texIDs[2]; GLint w, h; glGenTextures 2, texIDs ;     Load brick texture file GLubyte * brickImg = TGAIO::read "brick1.tga", w, h ;     Copy brick texture to OpenGL glActiveTexture GL_TEXTURE0 ; glBindTexture GL_TEXTURE_2D, texIDs[0] ; glTexStorage2D GL_TEXTURE_2D, 1, GL_RGBA8, w, h ; glTexSubImage2D GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, 0, 0, w, h, GL_RGBA,                  GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, brickImg ; glTexParameteri GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER,                  GL_LINEAR ; glTexParameteri GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER,                  GL_LINEAR ; delete [] brickImg;     Load moss texture file GLubyte * mossImg = TGAIO::read "moss.tga", w, h ;     Copy moss texture to OpenGL glActiveTexture GL_TEXTURE1 ; glBindTexture GL_TEXTURE_2D, texIDs[1] ; glTexStorage2D GL_TEXTURE_2D, 1, GL_RGBA8, w, h ; glTexSubImage2D GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, 0, 0, w, h, GL_RGBA,                  GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, mossImg ;  125   glTexParameteri GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER,                  GL_LINEAR ; glTexParameteri GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER,                  GL_LINEAR ;  delete [] mossImg;  2.  Use the vertex shader from the previous recipe Applying a 2D texture. 3.  Starting with the fragment shader from the recipe Applying a 2D texture, replace the   declaration of the sampler variable Tex1 with the following code: layout binding=0  uniform sampler2D BrickTex; layout binding=1  uniform sampler2D MossTex;  4.  Replace the main function in the fragment shader with the following code:  void main   {   vec3 ambAndDiff, spec;   vec4 brickTexColor = texture  BrickTex, TexCoord  ;   vec4 mossTexColor = texture  MossTex, TexCoord  ;   phongModel Position, Normal, ambAndDiff, spec ;   vec3 texColor = mix brickTexColor, mossTexColor,                        mossTexColor.a ;   FragColor = vec4 ambAndDiff, 1.0  * texColor +                      vec4 spec,1.0 ; }  How it works... The preceding code that loads the two textures into the OpenGL program is very similar to the  code from the previous recipe Applying a 2D texture. The main difference is that we load each  texture into a different texture unit. When loading the brick texture, we set the OpenGL state  such that the active texture unit is unit zero.  And when loading the second texture, we set the OpenGL state to texture unit one.  glActiveTexture GL_TEXTURE0 ;  glActiveTexture GL_TEXTURE1 ;  In step 3, we specify the texture binding for each sampler variable using the layout qualifier,  corresponding to the appropriate texture unit.  126   Within the fragment shader, we access the two textures using the corresponding uniform  variables, and store the results in brickTexColor and mossTexColor. The two colors are  blended together using the built-in function mix. The third parameter to the mix function  is the percentage used when mixing the two colors. The alpha value of the moss texture is  used for that parameter. This causes the result to be a linear interpolation of the two colors  based on the value of the alpha in the moss texture. For those familiar with OpenGL blending  functions, this is the same as the following blending function:  glBlendFunc  GL_SRC_ALPHA, GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA  ;  In this case, the moss color would be the source color, and the brick color would be the  destination color.  Finally, we multiply the result of the mix function by the ambient and diffuse components of  the Phong reflection model, add the specular component, and apply the result to the fragment.  There's more... In this example, we mixed the two texture colors together using the alpha value of the second  texture. This is just one of many options for mixing the texture colors. There are a number of  different choices here, and your choice will be dependent on the kind of texture data available  and the desired effect.  A popular technique is to use an additional vertex attribute to augment the amount of blending  between the textures. This additional vertex attribute would allow us to vary the blending factor  throughout a model. For example, we could vary the amount of moss that grows on a surface  by defining another vertex attribute, which would control the amount of blending between the  moss texture and the base texture. A value of zero might correspond to zero moss, up to a  value of one that would enable blending based on the texture's alpha value alone.  See also   f The Applying a 2D texture recipe  Using alpha maps to discard pixels To create the effect of an object that has holes, we could use a texture with an appropriate  alpha channel that contains information about the transparent parts of the object. However,  that requires us to make sure to make the depth buffer read-only, and render all of our  polygons from back to front in order to avoid blending problems. We would need to sort our  polygons based on the camera position and then render them in the correct order. What a pain!  127   With GLSL shaders, we can avoid all of this by using the discard keyword to completely  discard fragments when the alpha value of the texture map is below a certain value. By  completely discarding the fragments, there's no need to modify the depth buffer because  when discarded, they aren't evaluated against the depth buffer at all. We don't need to depth- sort our polygons because there is no blending.  The following image on the right shows the teapot with fragments discarded based upon the  texture on the left. The fragment shader discards fragments that correspond to texels that  have an alpha value below a certain threshold.  If we create a texture map that has an alpha channel, we can use the value of the alpha  channel to determine whether or not the fragment should be discarded. If the alpha value is  below a certain value, then the pixel is discarded.  As this will allow the viewer to see within the object, possibly making some back faces visible,  we'll need to use two-sided lighting when rendering the object.  Getting ready  multiple textures.  texture unit 1.  1.  Start with the same shader pair and set up from the previous recipe, Applying   2.  Load the base texture for the object into texture unit 0, and your alpha map into   128   How to do it... To discard fragments based on alpha data from a texture, use the following steps:  1.  Use the same vertex and fragment shaders from the recipe Applying multiple   textures. However, make the following modifications to the fragment shader.  2.  Replace the sampler2D uniform variables with the following:  layout binding=0  uniform sampler2D BaseTex; layout binding=1  uniform sampler2D AlphaTex;  3.  Replace the contents of the main function with the following code:  void main   {   vec4 baseColor = texture  BaseTex, TexCoord  ;   vec4 alphaMap = texture  AlphaTex, TexCoord  ;    if alphaMap.a < 0.15       discard;   else {     if  gl_FrontFacing   {       FragColor = vec4 phongModel Position,Normal ,1.0   *                   baseColor;     } else {       FragColor = vec4 phongModel Position,-Normal ,1.0  *                   baseColor;     }   } }  How it works... Within the main function of the fragment shader, we access the base color texture, and store  the result in baseColor. We access the alpha map texture and store the result in alphaMap.  If the alpha component of alphaMap is less than a certain value  0.15 in this example , then  we discard the fragment using the discard keyword.  Otherwise, we compute the Phong lighting model using the normal vector oriented appropriately,  depending on whether or not the fragment is a front facing fragment. The result of the Phong  model is multiplied by the base color from BaseTex.  129   There's more... This technique is fairly simple and straightforward, and is a nice alternative to traditional  blending techniques. It is a great way to make holes in objects or to present the appearance  of decay. If your alpha map has a gradual change in the alpha throughout the map,  for  example, an alpha map where the alpha values make a smoothly varying height field  then  it can be used to animate the decay of an object. We could vary the alpha threshold  0.15 in  the preceding example  from 0.0 to 1.0 to create an animated effect of the object gradually  decaying away to nothing.  See also   f The Applying multiple textures recipe  Using normal maps Normal mapping is a technique for "faking" variations in a surface that doesn't really exist  in the geometry of the surface. It is useful for producing surfaces that have bumps, dents,  roughness, or wrinkles without actually providing enough position information  vertices  to  fully define those deformations. The underlying surface is actually smooth, but is made to  appear rough by varying the normal vectors using a texture  the normal map . The technique is  closely related to bump mapping or displacement mapping. With normal maps, we modify the  normal vectors based on information that is stored in a texture. This creates the appearance  of a bumpy surface without actually providing the geometry of the bumps.  A normal map is a texture in which the data stored within the texture is interpreted as   normal vectors instead of colors. The normal vectors are typically encoded into the RGB  information of the normal map such that the red channel contains the x coordinate, the green  channel contains the y, and the blue channel contains the z coordinate. The normal map  can then be used as a "texture" in the sense that the texture values affect the normal vector  used in the reflection model rather than the color of the surface. This can be used to make  a surface look like it contains variations  bumps or wrinkles  that do not actually exist in the  geometry of the mesh.  The following images show an ogre mesh  courtesy of Keenan Crane  with and without a  normal map. The upper-left corner shows the base color texture for the ogre. In this example,  we use this texture as the diffuse reflectivity in the Phong reflection model. The upper right  shows the ogre with the color texture and default normal vectors. The bottom left is the  normal map texture. The bottom right shows the ogre with the color texture and normal map.  Note the additional detail in the wrinkles provided by the normal map.  130   A normal map can be produced in a number of ways. Many 3D modeling programs such  as Maya, Blender, or 3D Studio Max can generate normal maps. Normal maps can also be  generated directly from grayscale hightmap textures. There is a NVIDIA plugin for Adobe  Photoshop that provides this functionality  see http:  developer.nvidia.com  object photoshop_dds_plugins.html .  Normal maps are interpreted as vectors in a tangent space  also called the object local  coordinate system . In the tangent coordinate system, the origin is located at the surface  point and the normal to the surface is aligned with the z axis  0, 0, 1 . Therefore, the x and y  axes are at a tangent to the surface. The following image shows an example of the tangent  frames at two different positions on a surface.  131   The advantage of using such a coordinate system lies in the fact that the normal vectors  stored within the normal map can be treated as perturbations to the true normal, and  are independent of the object coordinate system. This saves us the need to transform the  normals, add the perturbed normal, and renormalize. Instead, we can use the value in the  normal map directly in the reflection model without any modification. To make all of this work, we need to evaluate the reflection model in tangent space. In order to  do so, we transform the vectors used in our reflection model into tangent space in the vertex  shader, and then pass them along to the fragment shader where the reflection model will be  evaluated. To define a transformation from the camera  eye  coordinate system to the tangent  space coordinate system, we need three normalized, co-orthogonal vectors  defined in eye  coordinates  that define the tangent space system. The z axis is defined by the normal vector   n , the x axis is defined by a vector called the tangent vector  t , and the y axis is often called  the binormal vector  b . A point P, defined in eye coordinates, could then be transformed into  tangent space by multiplying by the following matrix:  In the preceding equation, S is the point in tangent space and P is the point in eye  coordinates. In order to apply this transformation within the vertex shader, the OpenGL  program must provide at least two of the three vectors that define the object local system  along with the vertex position. The usual situation is to provide the normal vector  n  and the  tangent vector  t . If the tangent vector is provided, the binormal vector can be computed as  the cross product of the tangent and normal vectors.  Tangent vectors are sometimes included as additional data in mesh data structures. If the  tangent data is not available, we can approximate the tangent vectors by deriving them from  the variation of the texture coordinates across the surface  see Computing Tangent Space  Basis Vectors for an Arbitrary Mesh, Eric Lengyel, Terathon Software 3D Graphics Library,  2001, at http:  www.terathon.com code tangent.html .  One must take care that the tangent vectors are consistently  defined across the surface. In other words, the direction of the  tangent vectors should not vary greatly from one vertex to its  neighboring vertex. Otherwise, it can lead to ugly shading artifacts.  In the following example, we'll read the vertex position, normal vector, tangent vector, and  texture coordinate in the vertex shader. We'll transform the position, normal, and tangent to eye  space, and then compute the binormal vector  in eye space . Next, we'll compute the viewing  direction  v  and the direction towards the light source  s  in eye space, and then transform  them to tangent space. We'll pass the tangent space v and s vectors and the  unchanged   texture coordinate to the fragment shader, where we'll evaluate the Phong reflection model,  using the tangent space vectors and the normal vector retrieved from the normal map.  132   Getting ready Set up your OpenGL program to provide the position in attribute location 0, the normal in  attribute location 1, the texture coordinate in location 2, and the tangent vector in location 3.  For this example, the fourth coordinate of the tangent vector should contain the "handedness"  of the tangent coordinate system  either -1 or +1 . This value will be multiplied by the result of  the cross product.  Load the normal map into texture unit one and the color texture into texture unit zero.  How to do it... To render an image using normal mapping, use the following shaders:  1.  Use the following code for the vertex shader:  layout  location = 0  in vec3 VertexPosition; layout  location = 1  in vec3 VertexNormal; layout  location = 2  in vec2 VertexTexCoord; layout  location = 3  in vec4 VertexTangent;  struct LightInfo {   vec4 Position;     Light position in eye coords.   vec3 Intensity;    A,D,S intensity }; uniform LightInfo Light;  out vec3 LightDir; out vec2 TexCoord; out vec3 ViewDir;  uniform mat4 ModelViewMatrix; uniform mat3 NormalMatrix; uniform mat4 ProjectionMatrix; uniform mat4 MVP;  void main   {      Transform normal and tangent to eye space   vec3 norm = normalize NormalMatrix * VertexNormal ;   vec3 tang = normalize NormalMatrix *                            vec3 VertexTangent  ;      Compute the binormal   vec3 binormal = normalize  cross  norm, tang     *   133     VertexTangent.w;      Matrix for transformation to tangent space   mat3 toObjectLocal = mat3    tang.x, binormal.x, norm.x,   tang.y, binormal.y, norm.y,   tang.z, binormal.z, norm.z   ;      Get the position in eye coordinates   vec3 pos = vec3  ModelViewMatrix *                       vec4 VertexPosition,1.0   ;       Transform light dir. and view dir. to tangent space   LightDir = normalize  toObjectLocal *                            Light.Position.xyz - pos   ;   ViewDir = toObjectLocal * normalize -pos ;       Pass along the texture coordinate   TexCoord = VertexTexCoord;    gl_Position = MVP * vec4 VertexPosition,1.0 ; }  2.  Use the following code for the fragment shader:  in vec3 LightDir; in vec2 TexCoord; in vec3 ViewDir;  layout binding=0  uniform sampler2D ColorTex; layout binding=1  uniform sampler2D NormalMapTex;  struct LightInfo {   vec4 Position;     Light position in eye coords.   vec3 Intensity;    A,D,S intensity }; uniform LightInfo Light;  struct MaterialInfo {   vec3 Ka;               Ambient reflectivity   vec3 Ks;               Specular reflectivity   float Shininess;       Specular shininess factor }; uniform MaterialInfo Material;  layout  location = 0   out vec4 FragColor;  134   vec3 phongModel  vec3 norm, vec3 diffR   {    vec3 r = reflect  -LightDir, norm  ;   vec3 ambient = Light.Intensity * Material.Ka;   float sDotN = max  dot LightDir, norm , 0.0  ;   vec3 diffuse = Light.Intensity * diffR * sDotN;    vec3 spec = vec3 0.0 ;   if  sDotN > 0.0           spec = Light.Intensity * Material.Ks *                pow  max  dot r,ViewDir , 0.0  ,                         Material.Shininess  ;    return ambient + diffuse + spec; }  void main   {      Lookup the normal from the normal map   vec4 normal = 2.0 * texture  NormalMapTex, TexCoord   -                          1.0;       The color texture is used as the diff. reflectivity   vec4 texColor = texture  ColorTex, TexCoord  ;    FragColor = vec4  phongModel normal.xyz, texColor.rgb ,                        1.0  ; }  How it works... The vertex shader starts by transforming the vertex normal and the tangent vectors into eye  coordinates by multiplying by the normal matrix  and renormalizing . The binormal vector  is then computed as the cross product of the normal and tangent vectors. The result is  multiplied by the w coordinate of the vertex tangent vector, which determines the handedness  of the tangent space coordinate system. Its value will be either -1 or +1.  Next, we create the transformation matrix used to convert from eye coordinates to tangent  space and store the matrix in toObjectLocal. The position is converted to eye space and  stored in pos, and we compute the light direction by subtracting pos from the light position.  The result is multiplied by toObjectLocal to convert it into tangent space, and the final  result is normalized and stored in the output variable LightDir. This value is the direction  to the light source in tangent space, and will be used by the fragment shader in the Phong  reflection model.  135   Similarly, the view direction is computed and converted to tangent space by normalizing –pos  and multiplying by toObjectLocal. The result is stored in the output variable ViewDir.  The texture coordinate is passed to the fragment shader unchanged by just assigning it to the  output variable TexCoord.  In the fragment shader, the tangent space values for the light direction and view direction  are received in the variables LightDir and ViewDir. The phongModel function is slightly  modified from what has been used in previous recipes. The first parameter is the normal  vector, and the second is the diffuse reflectivity coefficient. The value for this will be taken  from the color texture. The function computes the Phong reflection model with the parameter  diffR, used as the diffuse reflectivity, and uses LightDir and ViewDir for the light and  view directions rather than computing them.  In the main function, the normal vector is retrieved from the normal map texture and stored  in the variable normal. Since textures store values that range from zero to one, and normal  vectors should have components that range from -1 to +1, we need to re-scale the value to  that range. We do so by multiplying the value by 2.0, and then subtracting 1.0.  The color texture is then accessed to retrieve the color to be used as the diffuse reflectivity  coefficient, and the result is stored in texColor. Finally, the phongModel function is called,  and is provided normal and texColor. The phongModel function evaluates the Phong  reflection model using LightDir, ViewDir, and norm, all of which are defined in tangent  space. The result is applied to the output fragment by assigning it to FragColor.  See also   f The Applying multiple textures recipe  f The Implementing per-vertex ambient, diffuse, and specular  ADS  shading recipe in   Chapter 2, The Basics of GLSL Shaders  Simulating reflection with cube maps Textures can be used to simulate a surface that has a component which is purely reflective  a  mirror-like surface such as chrome . In order to do so, we need a texture that is representative  of the environment surrounding the reflective object. This texture could then be mapped onto  the surface of the object in a way that represents how it would look when reflected off of the  surface. This general technique is known as environment mapping. In general, environment  mapping involves creating a texture that is representative of the environment and mapping it  onto the surface of an object. It is typically used to simulate the effects of reflection or refraction.  136   A cube map is one of the more common varieties of textures used in environment mapping. A  cube map is a set of six separate images that represent the environment projected onto each  of the six faces of a cube. The six images represent a view of the environment from the point  of view of a viewer located at the center of the cube. An example of a cube map is shown in  the following image. The images are laid out as if the cube was "unfolded" and laid flat. The  four images across the middle would make up the sides of the cube, and the top and bottom  images correspond to the top and bottom of the cube.  OpenGL provides built-in support for cube map textures  using the GL_TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP  target . The texture is accessed using a 3-dimensional texture coordinate  s, t, r . The texture  coordinate is interpreted as a direction vector from the center of the cube. The line defined  by the vector and the center of the cube is extended to intersect one of the faces of the cube.  The image that corresponds to that face is then accessed at the location of the intersection.  Truth be told, the conversion between the 3-dimensional texture  coordinate used to access the cube map, and the 2-dimensional  texture coordinate used to access the individual face image is  somewhat complicated. It can be non-intuitive and confusing.  A very good explanation can be found on NVIDIA's developer  website: http:  developer.nvidia.com content  cube-map-ogl-tutorial. However, the good news is that  if you are careful to orient your textures correctly within the  cube map, the details of the conversion can be ignored, and the  texture coordinate can be visualized as a 3-dimensional vector  as described previously.  In this example, we'll demonstrate using a cube map to simulate a reflective surface. We'll  also use the cube map to draw the environment around the reflective object  sometimes  called a skybox .  137   Getting ready Prepare the six images of the cube map. In this example, the images will have the following  naming convention. There is a base name  stored in variable baseFileName  followed by an  underscore, followed by one of the six possible suffixes  posx, negx, posy, negy, posz, or  negz , followed by the file extension  .tga . The suffixes posx, posy, and so on, indicate the  axis that goes through the center of the face  positive x, positive y, and so on .  Make sure that they are all square images  preferably with dimensions that are a power of 2 ,  and that they are all the same size. You will need to orient them appropriately for the way that  OpenGL accesses them. As mentioned previously, this can be a bit tricky. One way to do this is  to load the textures in their default orientation and draw the sky box  more on how to do that  follows . Then re-orient the textures  by trial and error  until they line up correctly. Alternatively,  take a close look at the conversion described in the NVIDIA link mentioned in the previous tip  and determine the proper orientation based on the texture coordinate conversions.  Set up your OpenGL program to provide the vertex position in attribute location 0, and the  vertex normal in attribute location 1.  This vertex shader requires the modeling matrix  the matrix that converts from object  coordinates to world coordinates  to be separated from the model-view matrix and provided to  the shader as a separate uniform. Your OpenGL program should provide the modeling matrix  in the uniform variable ModelMatrix.  The vertex shader also requires the location of the camera in world coordinates. Make sure that  your OpenGL program sets the uniform WorldCameraPosition to the appropriate value.  How to do it... To render an image with reflection based on a cube map, and also render the cube map itself,  carry out the following steps:  1.  Load the six images of the cube map into a single texture target using the following   code within the main OpenGL program: glActiveTexture GL_TEXTURE0 ;  GLuint texID; glGenTextures 1, &texID ; glBindTexture GL_TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP, texID ;  const char * suffixes[] = { "posx", "negx", "posy",                              "negy", "posz", "negz" }; GLuint targets[] = {   GL_TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_POSITIVE_X,   GL_TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_NEGATIVE_X,  138     GL_TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_POSITIVE_Y,   GL_TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_NEGATIVE_Y,   GL_TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_POSITIVE_Z,    GL_TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_NEGATIVE_Z }; GLint w,h; glTexStorage2D GL_TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP, 1, GL_RGBA8, 256, 256 ; for  int i = 0; i < 6; i++   {   string texName = string baseFileName  +                       "_" + suffixes[i] + ".tga";   GLubyte *data = TGAIO::read texName.c_str  , w, h ;   glTexSubImage2D targets[i], 0, 0, 0, w, h,                     GL_RGBA, GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, data ;   delete [] data; }     Typical cube map settings glTexParameteri GL_TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP, GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER,                  GL_LINEAR ; glTexParameteri GL_TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP, GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER,                  GL_LINEAR ; glTexParameteri GL_TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP, GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S,                  GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE ; glTexParameteri GL_TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP, GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_T,                  GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE ; glTexParameteri GL_TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP, GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_R,                  GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE ; 2.  Use the following code for the vertex shader:  layout  location = 0  in vec3 VertexPosition; layout  location = 1  in vec3 VertexNormal; layout  location = 2  in vec2 VertexTexCoord;  out vec3 ReflectDir;     The direction of the reflected ray uniform bool DrawSkyBox;     Are we drawing the sky box? uniform vec3 WorldCameraPosition; uniform mat4 ModelViewMatrix; uniform mat4 ModelMatrix; uniform mat3 NormalMatrix; uniform mat4 ProjectionMatrix; uniform mat4 MVP;  139   void main   {   if  DrawSkyBox   {     ReflectDir = VertexPosition;   } else {           Compute the reflected direction in world coords.     vec3 worldPos = vec3  ModelMatrix *                               vec4 VertexPosition,1.0   ;     vec3 worldNorm = vec3 ModelMatrix *                                vec4 VertexNormal, 0.0  ;     vec3 worldView = normalize  WorldCameraPosition –                                      worldPos  ;      ReflectDir = reflect -worldView, worldNorm  ;   }    gl_Position = MVP * vec4 VertexPosition,1.0 ; }  3.  Use the following code for the fragment shader:  in vec3 ReflectDir;      The direction of the reflected ray     The cube map layout binding=0  uniform samplerCube CubeMapTex;  uniform bool DrawSkyBox;       Are we drawing the sky box? uniform float ReflectFactor;   Amount of reflection uniform vec4 MaterialColor;    Color of the object's "Tint"   layout  location = 0   out vec4 FragColor;  void main   {      Access the cube map texture   vec4 cubeMapColor = texture CubeMapTex,ReflectDir ;   if  DrawSkyBox       FragColor = cubeMapColor;   else      FragColor = mix MaterialColor, CubeMapColor, ReflectFactor ;  }  140   4.   In the render portion of the OpenGL program, set the uniform DrawSkyBox to true,  and then draw a cube surrounding the entire scene, centered at the origin. This will  become the sky box. Following that, set DrawSkyBox to false, and draw the object s   within the scene.  How it works... In OpenGL, a cube map texture is actually six separate images. To fully initialize a cube map  texture, we need to bind to the cube map texture, and then load each image individually into  the six "slots" within that texture. In the preceding code  within the main OpenGL application ,  we start by binding to texture unit zero with glActiveTexture. Then we create a new  texture object by calling glGenTextures, and store its handle within the variable texID, and  then bind that texture object to the GL_TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP target using glBindTexture.  The following loop loads each texture file, and copies the texture data into OpenGL memory  using glTexSubImage2D. Note that the first argument to this function is the texture target,  which corresponds to GL_TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_POSITIVE_X, GL_TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_ NEGATIVE_X, and so on. After the loop is finished, the cube map texture should be fully  initialized with the six images.  Following this, we set up the cube map texture environment. We use linear filtering, and  we also set the texture wrap mode to GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE for all three of the texture  coordinate's components. This tends to work the best, avoiding the possibility of a border color  appearing between the cube edges.  Within the vertex shader, the main goal is to compute the direction of reflection and pass that  to the fragment shader to be used to access the cube map. The output variable ReflectDir  will store this result. If we are not drawing the sky box  the value of DrawSkyBox is false ,  then we can compute the reflected direction  in world coordinates  by reflecting the vector  towards the viewer about the normal vector.  We choose to compute the reflection direction in world coordinates  because, if we were to use eye coordinates, the reflection would  not change as the camera moved within the scene.  In the else branch within the main function, we start by converting the position to world  coordinates and storing in worldPos. We then do the same for the normal, storing the result  in worldNorm. Note that the ModelMatrix is used to transform the vertex normal. It is  important when doing this to use a value of 0.0 for the fourth coordinate of the normal, to  avoid the translation component of the model matrix affecting the normal. Also, the model  matrix must not contain any non-uniform scaling component; otherwise the normal vector will  be transformed incorrectly.  The direction towards the viewer is computed in world coordinates and stored in worldView.  141   Finally, we reflect worldView about the normal and store the result in the output variable  ReflectDir. The fragment shader will use this direction to access the cube map texture and  apply the corresponding color to the fragment. One can think of this as a light ray that begins  at the viewer's eye, strikes the surface, reflects off of the surface, and hits the cube map. The  color that the ray "sees" when it strikes the cube map is the color that we need for the object.  If we are drawing the sky box,  DrawSkyBox is true , then we use the vertex position as  the reflection direction. Why? Well, when the sky box is rendered, we want the location on  the sky box to correspond to the equivalent location in the cube map  the sky box is really  just a rendering of the cube map . In the fragment shader, ReflectDir will be used as the  texture coordinate to access the cube map. Therefore, if we want to access a position on the  cube map corresponding to a location on a cube centered at the origin, we need a vector that  points at that location. The vector we need is the position of that point minus the origin  which  is  0,0,0  . Hence, we just need the position of the vertex.  Sky boxes are often rendered with the viewer at the center of the  sky box and the sky box moving along with the viewer  so the viewer  is always at the center of the sky box . We have not done so in this  example; however, we could do so by transforming the sky box using  the rotational component of the view matrix  not the translational .  Within the fragment shader, we simply use the value of ReflectDir to access the cube   map texture.  vec4 cubeMapColor = texture CubeMapTex, ReflectDir   If we are drawing the sky box, we simply use the color unchanged. However, if we are not  drawing the sky box, then we'll mix the sky box color with some material color. This allows  us to provide some slight "tint" to the object. The amount of tint is adjusted by the variable  ReflectFactor. A value of 1.0 would correspond to zero tint  all reflection , and a value of  0.0 corresponds to no reflection. The following images show the teapot rendered with different  values of ReflectFactor. The teapot on the left uses a reflection factor of 0.5, the one on  the right uses a value of 0.85. The base material color is grey.  Cube map used is an image of  St. Peter's Basilica, Rome.  Paul Debevec.   142   There's more... There are two important points to keep in mind about this technique. First, the objects will  only reflect the environment map. They will not reflect the image of any other objects within  the scene. In order to do so, we would need to generate an environment map from the point of  view of each object by rendering the scene six times with the view point located at the center  of the object and the view direction in each of the six coordinate directions. Then we could use  the appropriate environment map for the appropriate object's reflections. Of course, if any of  the objects were to move relative to one another, we'd need to regenerate the environment  maps. All of this effort may be prohibitive in an interactive application.  The second point involves the reflections that appear on moving objects. In these shaders,  we compute the reflection direction and treat it as a vector emanating from the center  of the environment map. This means that regardless of where the object is located, the  reflections will appear as if the object is in the center of the environment. In other words, the  environment is treated as if it were "infinitely" far away. Chapter 19 of the book GPU Gems, by  Randima Fernando, Addison-Wesley Professional, 2009 has an excellent discussion of this  issue and provides some possible solutions for localizing the reflections.  See also   f The Applying a 2D texture recipe  Simulating refraction with cube maps Objects that are transparent cause the light rays that pass through them to bend slightly  at the interface between the object and the surrounding environment. This effect is called  refraction. When rendering transparent objects, we simulate that effect by using an  environment map, and mapping the environment onto the object is such a way as to mimic  the way that light would pass through the object. In other words, we can trace the rays from  the viewer, through the object  bending in the process , and along to the environment. Then  we can use that ray intersection as the color for the object.  As in the previous recipe, we'll do this using a cube map for the environment. We'll trace rays  from the viewer position, through the object, and finally intersect with the cube map.  143   The process of refraction is described by Snell's law, which defines the relationship between  the angle of incidence and the angle of refraction.  ai  normal  at  n1  n2  Snell's law describes the angle of incidence  ai  as the angle between the incoming light  ray and the normal to the surface, and the angle of refraction  at  as the angle between the  transmitted ray and the extended normal. The material through which the incident light ray  travels and the material containing the transmitted light ray are each described by an index of  refraction  n1 and n2 in the figure . The ratio between the two indices of refraction defines the  amount that the light ray will be bent at the interface.  Starting with Snell's law, and with a bit of mathematical effort, we can derive a formula for  the transmitted vector, given the ratio of the indices of refraction, the normal vector, and the  incoming vector.  However, there's no real need to do so, because GLSL provides a built-in function for computing  this transmitted vector called refract. We'll make use of that function within this example.  It is usually the case that for transparent objects, not all of the light is transmitted through the  surface. Some of the light is reflected. In this example, we'll model that in a very simple way,  and at the end of this recipe we'll discuss a more accurate representation.  Getting ready Set up your OpenGL program to provide the vertex position in attribute location 0 and the  vertex normal in attribute location 1. As with the previous recipe, we'll need to provide the  model matrix in the uniform variable ModelMatrix.  Load the cube map using the technique shown in the previous recipe. Place it in texture   unit zero.  144   Set the uniform variable WorldCameraPosition to the location of your viewer in world  coordinates. Set the value of the uniform variable Material.Eta to the ratio between the  index of refraction of the environment n1 and the index of refraction of the material n2    n1 n2 . Set the value of the uniform Material.ReflectionFactor to the fraction of   light that is reflected at the interface  a small value is probably what you want .  As with the preceding example, if you want to draw the environment, set the uniform   variable DrawSkyBox to true, then draw a large cube surrounding the scene, and then   set DrawSkyBox to false.  How to do it... To render an object with reflection and refraction as well as the cube map itself, carry out the  following steps:  1.  Use the following code within the vertex shader:  layout  location = 0  in vec3 VertexPosition; layout  location = 1  in vec3 VertexNormal;  out vec3 ReflectDir;     Reflected direction out vec3 RefractDir;     Transmitted direction  struct MaterialInfo {    float Eta;          Ratio of indices of refraction    float ReflectionFactor;    Percentage of reflected light }; uniform MaterialInfo Material;  uniform bool DrawSkyBox;  uniform vec3 WorldCameraPosition; uniform mat4 ModelViewMatrix; uniform mat4 ModelMatrix; uniform mat3 NormalMatrix; uniform mat4 ProjectionMatrix; uniform mat4 MVP;  void main   {     if  DrawSkyBox   {         ReflectDir = VertexPosition;     } else {         vec3 worldPos = vec3  ModelMatrix *   145                                 vec4 VertexPosition,1.0   ;         vec3 worldNorm = vec3 ModelMatrix *                                vec4 VertexNormal, 0.0  ;         vec3 worldView = normalize  WorldCameraPosition –                                      worldPos  ;          ReflectDir = reflect -worldView, worldNorm  ;         RefractDir = refract -worldView, worldNorm,                               Material.Eta  ;     }     gl_Position = MVP * vec4 VertexPosition,1.0 ; }  2.  Use the following code within the fragment shader:  in vec3 ReflectDir; in vec3 RefractDir;  layout binding=0  uniform samplerCube CubeMapTex; uniform bool DrawSkyBox; struct MaterialInfo {   float Eta;     Ratio of indices of refraction   float ReflectionFactor;    Percentage of reflected light }; uniform MaterialInfo Material;  layout  location = 0   out vec4 FragColor;  void main   {        Access the cube map texture     vec4 reflectColor = texture CubeMapTex, ReflectDir ;     vec4 refractColor = texture CubeMapTex, RefractDir ;      if  DrawSkyBox           FragColor = reflectColor;     else         FragColor = mix refractColor, reflectColor,                          Material.ReflectionFactor ; }  3.   In the render portion of the OpenGL program, set the uniform DrawSkyBox to true,  and then draw a cube surrounding the entire scene, centered at the origin. This  will become the sky box. Following that, set DrawSkyBox to false, and draw the  object s  within the scene.  146   How it works... Both shaders are quite similar to the shaders in the previous recipe.  The vertex shader computes the position, normal, and view direction in world coordinates   worldPos, worldNorm, and worldView . They are then used to compute the reflected  direction using the reflect function, and the result is stored in the output variable  ReflectDir. The transmitted direction is computed using the built-in function refract   which requires the ratio of the indices of refraction Material.Eta . This function makes  use of Snell's law to compute the direction of the transmitted vector which is then stored in  the output variable RefractDir.  In the fragment shader, we use the two vectors ReflectDir and RefractDir to access  the cube map texture. The color retrieved by the reflected ray is stored in reflectColor  and the color retrieved by the transmitted ray is stored in refractColor. We then mix those  two colors together based on the value of Material.ReflectionFactor. The result is a  mixture between the color of the reflected ray and the color of the transmitted ray.  The following image shows the teapot rendered with 10% reflection and 90% refraction.   Cubemap   Paul Debevec.   There's more... This technique has the same drawbacks that were discussed in the There's more... section of  the preceding recipe, Simulating reflection with cube maps.  Like most real-time techniques, this is a simplification of the real physics of the situation.  There are a number of things about the technique that could be improved to provide more  realistic looking results.  147   The Fresnel equations The amount of reflected light actually depends on the angle of incidence of the incoming  light. For example, when looking at the surface of a lake from the shore, much of the light  is reflected and it is easy to see reflections of the surrounding environment on the surface.  However, when floating on a boat on the surface of the lake and looking straight down, there  is less reflection and it is easier to see what lies below the surface. This effect is described by  the Fresnel equations  after Augustin-Jean Fresnel .  The Fresnel equations describe the amount of light that is reflected as a function of the angle  of incidence, the polarization of the light, and the ratio of the indices of refraction. If we ignore  the polarization, it is easy to incorporate the Fresnel equations into the preceding shaders. A  very good explanation of this can be found in the book The OpenGL Shading Language, 3rd  Edition, Randi J Rost, Addison-Wesley Professional, 2009.  Chromatic aberration White light is of course composed of many different individual wavelengths  or colors . The  amount that a light ray is refracted is actually wavelength dependent. This causes the effect  where a spectrum of colors can be observed at the interface between materials. The most  well-known example of this is the rainbow that is produced by a prism.  We can model this effect by using slightly different values of Eta for the red, green, and blue  components of the light ray. We would store three different values for Eta, compute three  different reflection directions  red, green, and blue , and use those three directions to look up  colors in the cube map. We take the red component from the first color, the green component  from the second, and the blue component for the third, and combine the three components  together to create the final color for the fragment.  Refracting through both sides of the object It is important to note that we have simplified things by only modeling the interaction of  the light with one of the boundaries of the object. In reality the light would be bent once  when entering the transparent object, and again when leaving the other side. However, this  simplification generally does not result in unrealistic looking results. As is often the case in  real-time graphics, we are more interested in a result that looks good than one that models  the physics accurately.

This technique is often  called projective texture mapping and produces a very nice effect.  The following images show an example of projective texture mapping. The flower texture on  the left  Stan Shebs via Wikimedia Commons  is projected onto the teapot and plane beneath.  To project a texture onto a surface, all we need to do is determine the texture coordinates  based on the relative position of the surface location and the source of the projection  the  "slide projector" . An easy way to do this is to think of the projector as a camera located  somewhere within the scene. In the same way that we would define an OpenGL camera, we  define a coordinate system centered at the projector's location, and a view matrix  V  that  converts coordinates to the projector's coordinate system. Next, we'll define a perspective  projection matrix  P  that converts the view frustum  in the projector's coordinate system  into  a cubic volume of size 2, centered at the origin. Putting these two things together, and adding  an additional matrix for rescaling and translating the volume to a volume of size one  shifted  so that the volume is centered at  0.5, 0.5, 0.5 , we have the following transformation matrix:  The goal here is basically to convert the view frustum to a range between 0 and 1 in x and  y. The preceding matrix can be used to do just that! It will convert world coordinates that lie  within the view frustum of the projector to a range between 0 and 1  homogeneous , which  can then be used to access the texture. Note that the coordinates are homogeneous and  need to be divided by the w coordinate before they can be used as a real position.  149   For more details on the mathematics of this technique, take a look  at the following white paper, written by Cass Everitt from NVIDIA: http:  developer.nvidia.com content projective- texture-mapping  In this example, we'll apply a single texture to a scene using projective texture mapping.  Getting ready Set up your OpenGL application to provide the vertex position in attribute location 0 and  the normal in attribute location 1. The OpenGL application must also provide the material  and lighting properties for the Phong reflection model  see the fragment shader given in the  following section . Make sure to provide the model matrix  for converting to world coordinates   in the uniform variable ModelMatrix.  How to do it... To apply a projected texture to a scene, use the following steps:  1.   In the OpenGL application, load the texture into texture unit zero. While the texture  object is bound to the GL_TEXTURE_2D target, use the following code to set the  texture's settings: glTexParameteri GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER,                   GL_LINEAR ; glTexParameteri GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER,                  GL_LINEAR ; glTexParameteri GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S,                  GL_CLAMP_TO_BORDER ; glTexParameteri GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_T,                   GL_CLAMP_TO_BORDER ;  2.  Also within the OpenGL application, set up your transformation matrix for the "slide   projector", and assign it to the uniform ProjectorMatrix. Use the following code to  do this. Note that this code makes use of the GLM libraries discussed in Chapter 1,  Getting Started with GLSL. vec3 projPos = vec3 2.0f,5.0f,5.0f ; vec3 projAt = vec3 -2.0f,-4.0f,0.0f ; vec3 projUp = vec3 0.0f,1.0f,0.0f ;  mat4 projView = glm::lookAt projPos, projAt, projUp ; mat4 projProj = glm::perspective 30.0f, 1.0f, 0.2f,                                   1000.0f ;  150   mat4 projScaleTrans = glm::translate vec3 0.5f   *                        glm::scale vec3 0.5f  ;  mat4 m = projScaleTrans * projProj * projView;     Set the uniform variable int loc =     glGetUniformLocation progHandle,"ProjectorMatrix" ; glUniformMatrix4fv loc, 1, GL_FALSE, &m[0][0] ;  3.  Use the following code for the vertex shader:  layout  location = 0  in vec3 VertexPosition; layout  location = 1  in vec3 VertexNormal;  out vec3 EyeNormal;          Normal in eye coordinates out vec4 EyePosition;        Position in eye coordinates out vec4 ProjTexCoord;  uniform mat4 ProjectorMatrix; uniform vec3 WorldCameraPosition; uniform mat4 ModelViewMatrix; uniform mat4 ModelMatrix; uniform mat3 NormalMatrix; uniform mat4 ProjectionMatrix; uniform mat4 MVP;  void main   {   vec4 pos4 = vec4 VertexPosition,1.0 ;    EyeNormal = normalize NormalMatrix * VertexNormal ;   EyePosition = ModelViewMatrix * pos4;   ProjTexCoord = ProjectorMatrix *  ModelMatrix * pos4 ;   gl_Position = MVP * pos4; }  4.  Use the following code for the fragment shader:  in vec3 EyeNormal;          Normal in eye coordinates in vec4 EyePosition;        Position in eye coordinates in vec4 ProjTexCoord;  layout binding=0  uniform sampler2D ProjectorTex;  151   struct MaterialInfo {   vec3 Kd;   vec3 Ks;   vec3 Ka;   float Shininess; }; uniform MaterialInfo Material;  struct LightInfo {   vec3 Intensity;   vec4 Position;      Light position in eye coordinates }; uniform LightInfo Light;  layout  location = 0   out vec4 FragColor;  vec3 phongModel  vec3 pos, vec3 norm   {   vec3 s = normalize vec3 Light.Position  - pos ;   vec3 v = normalize -pos.xyz ;   vec3 r = reflect  -s, norm  ;   vec3 ambient = Light.Intensity * Material.Ka;   float sDotN = max  dot s,norm , 0.0  ;   vec3 diffuse = Light.Intensity * Material.Kd * sDotN;   vec3 spec = vec3 0.0 ;   if  sDotN > 0.0       spec = Light.Intensity * Material.Ks *          pow  max  dot r,v , 0.0  , Material.Shininess ;    return ambient + diffuse + spec; }  void main   {   vec3 color = phongModel vec3 EyePosition , EyeNormal ;    vec4 projTexColor = vec4 0.0 ;   if  ProjTexCoord.z > 0.0       projTexColor = textureProj ProjectorTex,ProjTexCoord ;    FragColor = vec4 color,1.0  + projTexColor * 0.5; }  152   How it works... When loading the texture into the OpenGL application, we make sure to set the wrap mode  for the s and t directions to GL_CLAMP_TO_BORDER. We do this because if the texture  coordinates are outside of the range of zero to one, we do not want any contribution from  the projected texture. With this mode, using the default border color, the texture will return   0,0,0,0  when the texture coordinates are outside of the range between 0 and 1 inclusive.  The transformation matrix for the slide projector is set up in the OpenGL application. We start  by using the GLM function glm::lookAt to produce a view matrix for the projector. In this  example, we locate the projector at  5, 5, 5 , looking towards the point  -2, -4,0 , with an "up  vector" of  0, 1, 0 . This function works in a similar way to the gluLookAt function. It returns  a matrix for converting to the coordinate system located at  5, 5, 5 , and oriented based on  the second and third arguments.  Next, we create the projection matrix using glm::perspective, and the scale  translate matrix M  shown in the introduction to this recipe . These two matrices are  stored in projProj and projScaleTrans respectively. The final matrix is the product of  projScaleTrans, projProj, and projView, which is stored in m and assigned to the  uniform variable ProjectorTex.  In the vertex shader, we have three output variables EyeNormal, EyePosition, and  ProjTexCoord. The first two are the vertex normal and vertex position in eye coordinates.  We transform the input variables appropriately, and assign the results to the output variables  within the main function.  We compute ProjTexCoord by first transforming the position to world coordinates    by multiplying by ModelMatrix , and then applying the projector's transformation.  In the fragment shader, within the main function, we start by computing the Phong reflection  model and storing the result in the variable color. The next step is to look up the color from  the texture. First, however, we check the z coordinate of ProjTexCoord. If this is negative  then the location is behind the projector, so we avoid doing the texture lookup. Otherwise we  use textureProj to look up the texture value and store it in projTexColor.  The function textureProj is designed for accessing textures with coordinates that have  been projected. It will divide the coordinates of the second argument by its last coordinate  before accessing the texture. In our case, that is exactly what we want. We mentioned earlier  that after transforming by the projector's matrix we will be left with homogeneous coordinates,  so we need to divide by the w coordinate before accessing the texture. The textureProj  function will do exactly that for us.  Finally, we add the projected texture's color to the base color from the Phong model. We scale  the projected texture color slightly so that it is not overwhelming.  153   There's more... There's one big drawback to the technique presented here. There is no support for shadows  yet, so the projected texture will shine right through any objects in the scene and appear on  objects that are behind them  with respect to the projector . In later recipes, we will look at  some examples of techniques for handling shadows that could help to solve this problem.  See also   f The Implementing per-vertex ambient, diffuse, and specular  ADS  shading recipe in   Chapter 2, The Basics of GLSL Shaders   f The Applying a 2D texture recipe  Rendering to a texture Sometimes it makes sense to generate textures "on the fly" during the execution of the  program. The texture could be a pattern that is generated from some internal algorithm    a so-called procedural texture , or it could be that the texture is meant to represent another  portion of the scene. An example of the latter case might be a video screen where one can see  another part of the "world", perhaps via a security camera in another room. The video screen  could be constantly updated as objects move around in the other room, by re-rendering the  view from the security camera to the texture that is applied to the video screen!  In the following image, the texture appearing on the cube was generated by rendering a teapot  to an internal texture and then applying that texture to the faces of the cube.  154   In recent versions of OpenGL, rendering directly to textures has been greatly simplified with  the introduction of framebuffer objects  FBOs . We can create a separate rendering target  buffer  the FBO , attach our texture to that FBO, and render to the FBO in exactly the same  way that we would render to the default framebuffer. All that is required is to swap in the FBO,  and swap it out when we are done.  Basically, the process involves the following steps when rendering:  1.  Bind to the FBO. 2.  Render the texture. 3.  Unbind from the FBO  back to the default framebuffer . 4.  Render the scene using the texture.  There's actually not much that we need to do on the GLSL side in order to use this kind of  texture. In fact, the shaders will see it as any other texture. However, there are some important  points that we'll talk about regarding fragment output variables.  In this example, we'll cover the steps needed to create the FBO and its backing texture, and  how to set up a shader to work with the texture.  Getting ready For this example, we'll use the shaders from the previous recipe Applying a 2D texture, with  some minor changes. Set up your OpenGL program as described in that recipe. The only  change that we'll make to the shaders is changing the name of the sampler2D variable from  Tex1 to Texture.  How to do it... To render to a texture and then apply that texture to a scene in a second pass, use the  following steps:  1.  Within the main OpenGL program, use the following code to set up the    framebuffer object: GLuint fboHandle;     The handle to the FBO     Generate and bind the framebuffer glGenFramebuffers 1, &fboHandle ; glBindFramebuffer GL_FRAMEBUFFER, fboHandle ;     Create the texture object GLuint renderTex; glGenTextures 1, &renderTex ; glActiveTexture GL_TEXTURE0 ;     Use texture unit 0 glBindTexture GL_TEXTURE_2D, renderTex ;  155   glTexStorage2D GL_TEXTURE_2D, 1, GL_RGBA8, 512, 512 ; glTexParameteri GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER,                  GL_LINEAR ; glTexParameteri GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER,                  GL_LINEAR ;     Bind the texture to the FBO glFramebufferTexture2D GL_FRAMEBUFFER,GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENT0,                         GL_TEXTURE_2D, renderTex, 0 ;     Create the depth buffer GLuint depthBuf; glGenRenderbuffers 1, &depthBuf ; glBindRenderbuffer GL_RENDERBUFFER, depthBuf ; glRenderbufferStorage GL_RENDERBUFFER, GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT,                        512, 512 ;     Bind the depth buffer to the FBO glFramebufferRenderbuffer GL_FRAMEBUFFER,                            GL_DEPTH_ATTACHMENT,                           GL_RENDERBUFFER, depthBuf ;     Set the target for the fragment shader outputs GLenum drawBufs[] = {GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENT0}; glDrawBuffers 1, drawBufs ;     Unbind the framebuffer, and revert to default glBindFramebuffer GL_FRAMEBUFFER, 0 ;  2.  Use the following code to create a simple 1 x 1 texture that can be used as a    "non-texture texture". Note that we place this one in texture unit 1:    One pixel white texture GLuint whiteTexHandle; GLubyte whiteTex[] = { 255, 255, 255, 255 }; glActiveTexture GL_TEXTURE1 ; glGenTextures 1, &whiteTexHandle ; glBindTexture GL_TEXTURE_2D,whiteTexHandle ; glTexStorage2D GL_TEXTURE_2D, 1, GL_RGBA8, 1, 1 ; glTexSubImage2D GL_TEXTURE_2D,0,0,0,1,1,GL_RGBA,              GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE,whiteTex ; In your render function within the OpenGL program, use the following code, or  something similar:    Bind to texture's FBO glBindFramebuffer GL_FRAMEBUFFER, fboHandle ; glViewport 0,0,512,512 ;     Viewport for the texture  3.   156      Use the "white" texture here int loc = glGetUniformLocation programHandle, "Texture" ; glUniform1i loc, 1 ;     Setup the projection matrix and view matrix    for the scene to be rendered to the texture here.     Don't forget to match aspect ratio of the viewport.   renderTextureScene  ;     Unbind texture's FBO  back to default FB  glBindFramebuffer GL_FRAMEBUFFER, 0 ; glViewport 0,0,width,height ;     Viewport for main window     Use the texture that is associated with the FBO int loc = glGetUniformLocation programHandle, "Texture" ; glUniform1i loc, 0 ;     Reset projection and view matrices here  renderScene  ;  How it works... Let's start by looking at the code for creating the framebuffer object  the preceding step 1 . Our  FBO will be 512 pixels square because we intend to use it as a texture. We begin by generating  the FBO using glGenFramebuffers and binding the framebuffer to the GL_FRAMEBUFFER  target with glBindFramebuffer. Next, we create the texture object to which we will be  rendering, and use glActiveTexture to select texture unit zero. The rest is very similar to  creating any other texture. We allocate space for the texture using glTexStorage2D. We don't  need to copy any data into that space  using glTexSubImage2D , because we'll be writing to  that memory later when rendering to the FBO.  Next, we link the texture to the FBO by calling the function glFramebufferTexture2D. This  function attaches a texture object to an attachment point in the currently bound framebuffer  object. The first argument  GL_FRAMEBUFFER  indicates that the texture is to be attached  to the FBO currently bound to the GL_FRAMEBUFFER target. The second argument is the  attachment point. Framebuffer objects have several attachment points for color buffers,  one for the depth buffer, and a few others. This allows us to have several color buffers to  target from our fragment shaders. We'll see more about this later. We use GL_COLOR_ ATTACHMENT0 to indicate that this texture is linked to color attachment 0 of the FBO. The  third argument  GL_TEXTURE_2D  is the texture target, and the fourth  renderTex  is the  handle to our texture. The last argument  0  is the mip-map level of the texture that is being  attached to the FBO. In this case, we only have a single level, so we use a value of zero.  157   As we want to render to the FBO with depth testing, we need to also attach a depth buffer.  The next few lines of code create the depth buffer. The function glGenRenderbuffer  creates a renderbuffer object, and glRenderbufferStorage allocates space for the  renderbuffer. The second argument to glRenderbufferStorage indicates the internal  format for the buffer, and as we are using this as a depth buffer, we use the special format  GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT.  Next, the depth buffer is attached to the GL_DEPTH_ATTACHMENT attachment point of the  FBO using glFramebufferRenderbuffer.  The shader's output variables are assigned to the attachments of the FBO using  glDrawBuffers. The second argument to glDrawBuffers is an array indicating the FBO  buffers to be associated with the output variables. The ith element of the array corresponds to  the fragment shader output variable at location i. In our case, we only have one shader output  variable  FragColor  at location zero. This statement associates that output variable with  GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENT0.  The last statement in step 1 unbinds the FBO to revert back to the default framebuffer.  Step 2 creates a 1 x 1 white texture in texture unit one. We use this texture when rendering  the texture so that we don't need to change anything about our shader. As our shader  multiplies the texture color by the result of the Phong reflection model, this texture will  effectively work as a "non-texture" because multiplying will not change the color. When  rendering the texture, we want to use this "non-texture", but when rendering the scene, we'll  use the texture attached to the FBO.  This use of a 1 x 1 texture is certainly not necessary in general.  We use it here just so that we can draw to the FBO without a  texture being applied to the scene. If you have a texture that  should be applied, then that would be more appropriate here.  In step 3  within the render function , we bind to the FBO, use the "non-texture" in unit one,  and render the texture. Note that we need to be careful to set up the viewport  glViewport ,  and the view and projection matrices appropriately for our FBO. As our FBO is 512 x 512,  we use glViewport 0,0,512,512 . Similar changes should be made to the view and  projection matrices to match the aspect ratio of the viewport and set up the scene to be  rendered to the FBO.  Once we've rendered to the texture, we unbind from the FBO, reset the viewport, and the view  and projection matrices, use the FBO's texture  texture unit 0 , and draw the scene!  158   There's more... As FBOs have multiple color attachment points, we can have several output targets from our  fragment shaders. Note that so far, all of our fragment shaders have only had a single output  variable assigned to location zero. Hence, we set up our FBO so that its texture corresponds to  color attachment zero. In later chapters, we'll look at examples where we use more than one  of these attachments for things like deferred shading.  See also   f The Applying a 2D texture recipe  Using sampler objects Sampler objects were introduced in OpenGL 3.3, and provide a convenient way to specify  the sampling parameters for a GLSL sampler variable. The traditional way to specify the  parameters for a texture is to specify them using glTexParameter, typically at the time that  the texture is defined. The parameters define the sampling state  sampling mode, wrapping  and clamping rules, and so on.  for the associated texture. This essentially combines the  texture and its sampling state into a single object. If we wanted to sample from a single texture  in more than one way  with and without linear filtering for example , we'd have two choices. We  would either need to modify the texture's sampling state, or use two copies of the same texture.  In addition, we might want to use the same set of texture sampling parameters for multiple  textures. With what we've seen up until now, there's no easy way to do that. With sampler  objects we can specify the parameters once, and share them among several texture objects.  Sampler objects separate the sampling state from the texture object. We can create sampler  objects that define a particular sampling state and apply that to multiple textures or bind  different sampler objects to the same texture. A single sampler object can be bound to  multiple textures, which allows us to define a particular sampling state once and share it  among several texture objects.  Sampler objects are defined on the OpenGL side  not in GLSL , which makes it effectively  transparent to the GLSL.  159   In this recipe, we'll define two sampler objects and apply them to a single texture. The  following image shows the result. The same texture is applied to the two planes. On the left,  we use a sampler object set up for nearest-neighbor filtering, and on the right we use the  same texture with a sampler object set up for linear filtering.  Getting ready Will start with the same shaders used in the recipe Applying a 2D texture. The shader code  will not change at all, but we'll use sampler objects to change the state of the sampler  variable Tex1.  How to do it... To set up the texture object and the sampler objects, use the following steps.  1.  Create and fill the texture object in the usual way, but this time, we won't set any   sampling state using glTexParameter. GLuint texID; glGenTextures 1, &texID ; glBindTexture GL_TEXTURE_2D, texID ; glTexStorage2D GL_TEXTURE_2D, 1, GL_RGBA8, w, h ; glTexSubImage2D GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, 0, 0, w, h, GL_RGBA,     GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, data ;  2.  Bind the texture to texture unit 0, which is the unit that is used by the shader.  glActiveTexture GL_TEXTURE0 ; glBindTexture GL_TEXTURE_2D, texID ;  160   3.  Next, we create two sampler objects and assign their IDs to separate variables    for clarity: GLuint samplers[2]; glGenSamplers 2, samplers ; linearSampler = samplers[0]; nearestSampler = samplers[1];  4.  Set up linearSampler for linear interpolation:  glSamplerParameteri linearSampler, GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER,                      GL_LINEAR ; glSamplerParameteri linearSampler, GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER,                      GL_LINEAR ;  5.  Set up nearestSampler for nearest-neighbor sampling:  glSamplerParameteri nearestSampler, GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER,                      GL_NEAREST ; glSamplerParameteri nearestSampler, GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER,                      GL_NEAREST ;  6.  When rendering, we bind to each sampler object when needed:  glBindSampler 0, nearestSampler ;    Render objects that use nearest-neighbor sampling glBindSampler 0, linearSampler ;    Render objects that use linear sampling  How it works... Sampler objects are simple to use, and make it easy to switch between different sampling  parameters for the same texture, or use the same sampling parameters for different textures.  In steps 1 and 2, we create a texture and bind it to texture unit 0. Normally, we would set  the sampling parameters here using glTexParameteri, but in this case, we'll set them in  the sampler objects using glSamplerParameter. In step 3, we create the sampler objects  and assign their IDs to some variables. In steps 4 and 5, we set up the appropriate sampling  parameters using glSamplerParameter. This function is almost exactly the same as  glTexParameter except the first argument is the ID of the sampler object instead of the  texture target. This defines the sampling state for each of the two sampler objects  linear for  linearSampler and nearest for nearestSampler .  Finally, we use the sampler objects by binding them to the appropriate texture unit using  glBindSampler just prior to rendering. In step 6 we bind nearestSampler to texture  unit 0 first, render some objects, bind linearSampler to texture unit 0, and render some  more objects. The result here is that the same texture uses different sampling parameters by  binding different sampler objects to the texture unit during rendering.  161   See also   f The Applying a 2D texture recipe  162   5  Image Processing   and Screen   Space Techniques  In this chapter, we will cover:   f Applying an edge detection filter  f Applying a Gaussian blur filter  f Implementing HDR shading with tone mapping  f Creating a bloom effect  f Using gamma correction to improve image quality  f Using multisample anti-aliasing  f Using deferred shading  f Implementing order-independent transparency  Introduction In this chapter, we will focus on techniques that work directly with the pixels in a framebuffer.  These techniques typically involve multiple passes. An initial pass produces the pixel data and  subsequent passes apply effects or further process those pixels. To implement this we make  use of the ability provided in OpenGL for rendering directly to a texture or set of textures  refer  to the Rendering to a texture recipe in Chapter 4, Using Textures .   The ability to render to a texture, combined with the power of the fragment shader, opens up a  huge range of possibilities. We can implement image processing techniques such as brightness,  contrast, saturation, and sharpness by applying an additional process in the fragment shader  prior to output. We can apply convolution filters such as edge detection, smoothing  blur , or  sharpening. We'll take a closer look at convolution filters in the recipe on edge detection.  A related set of techniques involves rendering additional information to textures beyond  the traditional color information and then, in a subsequent pass, further processing that  information to produce the final rendered image. These techniques fall under the general  category that is often called deferred shading.  In this chapter, we'll look at some examples of each of the preceding techniques. We'll start  off with examples of convolution filters for edge detection, blur, and bloom. Then we'll move on  to the important topics of gamma correction and multisample anti-aliasing. Finally, we'll finish  with a full example of deferred shading.  Most of the recipes in this chapter involve multiple passes. In order to apply a filter that  operates on the pixels of the final rendered image, we start by rendering the scene to an  intermediate buffer  a texture . Then, in a final pass, we render the texture to the screen  by drawing a single full-screen quad, applying the filter in the process. You'll see several  variations on this theme in the following recipes.  Applying an edge detection filter Edge detection is an image processing technique that identifies regions where there is a  significant change in the brightness of the image. It provides a way to detect the boundaries of  objects and changes in the topology of the surface. It has applications in the field of computer  vision, image processing, image analysis, and image pattern recognition. It can also be used  to create some visually interesting effects. For example, it can make a 3D scene look similar  to a 2D pencil sketch as shown in the following image. To create this image, a teapot, and  torus were rendered normally, and then an edge detection filter was applied in a second pass.  164   The edge detection filter that we'll use here involves the use of a convolution filter, or  convolution kernel  also called a filter kernel . A convolution filter is a matrix that defines how  to transform a pixel by replacing it with the sum of the products between the values of nearby  pixels and a set of pre-determined weights. As a simple example, consider the following  convolution filter:  1  0  1  10  17  24  31  38  0  2  0  11  18  25  32  39  1  0  1  12  19  26  33  40  13  20  27  34  41  14  21  28  35  42  The 3 x 3 filter is shaded in gray superimposed over a hypothetical grid of pixels. The bold  faced numbers represent the values of the filter kernel  weights , and the non-bold faced  values are the pixel values. The values of the pixels could represent gray-scale intensity   or the value of one of the RGB components. Applying the filter to the center pixel in the   gray area involves multiplying the corresponding cells together and summing the results.   The result would be the new value for the center pixel  25 . In this case, the value would be   17 + 19 + 2 * 25 + 31 + 33  or 150.  Of course, in order to apply a convolution filter, we need access to the pixels of the original  image and a separate buffer to store the results of the filter. We'll achieve this here by using  a two-pass algorithm. In the first pass, we'll render the image to a texture; and then in the  second pass, we'll apply the filter by reading from the texture and send the filtered results to  the screen.  One of the simplest, convolution-based techniques for edge detection is the so-called Sobel  operator. The Sobel operator is designed to approximate the gradient of the image intensity   at each pixel. It does so by applying two 3 x 3 filters. The results of the two are the vertical   and horizontal components of the gradient. We can then use the magnitude of the gradient   as our edge trigger. When the magnitude of the gradient is above a certain threshold, then   we assume that the pixel is on an edge.  165   The 3 x 3 filter kernels used by the Sobel operator are shown in the following equation:  If the result of applying Sx is sx and the result of applying Sy is sy, then an approximation of  the magnitude of the gradient is given by the following equation:  If the value of g is above a certain threshold, we consider the pixel to be an edge pixel, and we  highlight it in the resulting image.  In this example, we'll implement this filter as the second pass of a two-pass algorithm. In the  first pass, we'll render the scene using an appropriate lighting model, but we'll send the result  to a texture. In the second pass, we'll render the entire texture as a screen-filling quad, and  apply the filter to the texture.  Getting ready Set up a framebuffer object  refer to the Rendering to a texture recipe in Chapter 4, Using  Textures  that has the same dimensions as the main window. Connect the first color  attachment of the FBO to a texture object in texture unit zero. During the first pass, we'll  render directly to this texture. Make sure that the mag and min filters for this texture are set to  GL_NEAREST. We don't want any interpolation for this algorithm.  Provide vertex information in vertex attribute zero, normals in vertex attribute one, and texture  coordinates in vertex attribute two.  The following uniform variables need to be set from the OpenGL application:   f Width: This is used to set the width of the screen window in pixels  f Height: This is used to set the height of the screen window in pixels  f EdgeThreshold: This is the minimum value of g squared required to be considered    "on an edge"   f RenderTex: This is the texture associated with the FBO  Any other uniforms associated with the shading model should also be set from the   OpenGL application.  166   How to do it... To create a shader program that applies the Sobel edge detection filter, use the   following steps:  1.  Use the following code for the vertex shader:  layout  location = 0  in vec3 VertexPosition; layout  location = 1  in vec3 VertexNormal;  out vec3 Position; out vec3 Normal; uniform mat4 ModelViewMatrix; uniform mat3 NormalMatrix; uniform mat4 ProjectionMatrix; uniform mat4 MVP;  void main   {     Normal = normalize  NormalMatrix * VertexNormal ;     Position = vec3  ModelViewMatrix *                       vec4 VertexPosition,1.0   ;      gl_Position = MVP * vec4 VertexPosition,1.0 ; }  2.  Use the following code for the fragment shader:  in vec3 Position; in vec3 Normal;     The texture containing the results of the first pass layout  binding=0   uniform sampler2D RenderTex;  uniform float EdgeThreshold;     The squared threshold     This subroutine is used for selecting the functionality    of pass1 and pass2. subroutine vec4 RenderPassType  ; subroutine uniform RenderPassType RenderPass;     Other uniform variables for the Phong reflection model    can be placed here…  layout  location = 0   out vec4 FragColor; const vec3 lum = vec3 0.2126, 0.7152, 0.0722 ;  167   vec3 phongModel  vec3 pos, vec3 norm   {        The code for the basic ADS shading model goes here… }     Approximates the brightness of a RGB value. float luminance  vec3 color   {   return dot lum, color ;   } subroutine  RenderPassType  vec4 pass1   {   return vec4 phongModel  Position, Normal  ,1.0 ; } subroutine  RenderPassType   vec4 pass2   {     ivec2 pix = ivec2 gl_FragCoord.xy ;   float s00 = luminance                texelFetchOffset RenderTex, pix, 0,                                 ivec2 -1,1  .rgb ;   float s10 = luminance                texelFetchOffset RenderTex, pix, 0,                                 ivec2 -1,0  .rgb ;   float s20 = luminance                texelFetchOffset RenderTex, pix, 0,                                 ivec2 -1,-1  .rgb ;   float s01 = luminance                texelFetchOffset RenderTex, pix, 0,                                 ivec2 0,1  .rgb ;   float s21 = luminance                texelFetchOffset RenderTex, pix, 0,                                ivec2 0,-1  .rgb ;   float s02 = luminance                texelFetchOffset RenderTex, pix, 0,                                 ivec2 1,1  .rgb ;   float s12 = luminance                texelFetchOffset RenderTex, pix, 0,                                 ivec2 1,0  .rgb ;   float s22 = luminance                texelFetchOffset RenderTex, pix, 0,                                 ivec2 1,-1  .rgb ;  168     float sx = s00 + 2 * s10 + s20 -  s02 + 2 * s12 + s22 ;   float sy = s00 + 2 * s01 + s02 -  s20 + 2 * s21 + s22 ;     float g = sx * sx + sy * sy;    if  g > EdgeThreshold   return vec4 1.0 ;   else return vec4 0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0 ; }  void main   {        This will call either pass1   or pass2       FragColor = RenderPass  ; }  In the render function of your OpenGL application, follow these steps for pass 1:  1.  Select the framebuffer object  FBO , and clear the color depth buffers. 2.  Select the pass1 subroutine function  refer to the Using subroutines to select shader   functionality recipe in Chapter 2, The Basics of GLSL Shaders .  3.  Set up the model, view, and projection matrices, and draw the scene.  For pass 2, carry out the following steps:  1.  Deselect the FBO  revert to the default framebuffer , and clear the color depth buffers. 2.  Select the pass2 subroutine function. 3.  Set the model, view, and projection matrices to the identity matrix. 4.  Draw a single quad  or two triangles  that fills the screen  -1 to +1 in x and y , with   texture coordinates that range from 0 to 1 in each dimension.  How it works... The first pass renders all of the scene's geometry sending the output to a texture. We select  the subroutine function pass1, which simply computes and applies the Phong reflection  model  refer to the Implementing per-vertex ambient, diffuse, and specular  ADS  shading  recipe in Chapter 2, The Basics of GLSL Shaders .  In the second pass, we select the subroutine function pass2, and render only a single quad  that covers the entire screen. The purpose of this is to invoke the fragment shader once for  every pixel in the image. In the pass2 function, we retrieve the values of the eight neighboring  pixels of the texture containing the results from the first pass, and compute their brightness by  calling the luminance function. The horizontal and vertical Sobel filters are then applied and  the results are stored in sx and sy.  169   The luminance function determines the brightness of an  RGB value by computing a weighted sum of the intensities. The  weights are from the ITU-R Recommendation Rec. 709. For  more details on this, see the Wikipedia entry for "luma".  We then compute the squared value of the magnitude of the gradient  in order to avoid the  square root  and store the result in g. If the value of g is greater than EdgeThreshold, we  consider the pixel to be on an edge, and we output a white pixel. Otherwise, we output a solid  black pixel.  There's more... The Sobel operator is somewhat crude, and tends to be sensitive to high frequency variations  in the intensity. A quick look at Wikipedia will guide you to a number of other edge detection  techniques that may be more accurate. It is also possible to reduce the amount of high  frequency variation by adding a "blur pass" between the render and edge detection passes.  The "blur pass" will smooth out the high frequency fluctuations and may improve the results   of the edge detection pass.  Optimization techniques The technique discussed here requires eight texture fetches. Texture accesses can be  somewhat slow, and reducing the number of accesses can result in substantial speed  improvements. Chapter 24 of GPU Gems: Programming Techniques, Tips and Tricks for   Real-Time Graphics, edited by Randima Fernando  Addison-Wesley Professional 2004 , has   an excellent discussion of ways to reduce the number of texture fetches in a filter operation   by making use of so-called "helper" textures.

As mentioned in the previous recipe, applying a blur filter prior to the  edge detection pass may improve the results by reducing the amount of high frequency  fluctuation across the image. The basic idea of any blur filter is to mix the color of a pixel with  that of nearby pixels using a weighted sum. The weights typically decrease with the distance  from the pixel  in 2D screen space  so that pixels that are far away contribute less than those  closer to the pixel being blurred.  A Gaussian blur uses the 2-dimensional Gaussian function to weight the contributions of the  nearby pixels.  The sigma squared term is the variance of the Gaussian, and determines the width of the  Gaussian curve. The Gaussian function is maximum at  0,0 , which corresponds to the  location of the pixel being blurred and its value decreases as x or y increases. The following  graph shows the two-dimensional Gaussian function with a sigma squared value of 4.0:  171   The following images show a portion of an image before  left  and after  right  the Gaussian  blur operation:  To apply a Gaussian blur, for each pixel, we need to compute the weighted sum of all pixels  in the image scaled by the value of the Gaussian function at that pixel  where the x and y  coordinates of each pixel are based on an origin located at the pixel being blurred . The   result of that sum is the new value for the pixel. However, there are two problems with the  algorithm so far:   f As this is a O n2  process  where n is the number of pixels in the image , it is likely to    f The weights must sum to one in order to avoid changing the overall brightness of    be too slow for real-time use  the image  As we sampled the Gaussian function at discrete locations, and didn't sum over the entire   infinite  bounds of the function, the weights almost certainly do not sum to one.  We can deal with both of the preceding problems by limiting the number of pixels that we blur  with a given pixel  instead of the entire image , and by normalizing the values of the Gaussian  function. In this example, we'll use a 9 x 9 Gaussian blur filter. That is, we'll only compute the  contributions of the 81 pixels in the neighborhood of the pixel being blurred.  Such a technique would require 81 texture fetches in the fragment shader, which is executed  once for each pixel. The total number of texture fetches for an image of size 800 x 600 would be  800 * 600 * 81 = 38,880,000. This seems like a lot, doesn't it? The good news is that we can  substantially reduce the number of texture fetches by doing the Gaussian blur in two passes.  The two-dimensional Gaussian function is actually just the product of two one-dimensional  Gaussians:  172   Where the one-dimensional Gaussian function is given by the following equation:  So if Cij is the color of the pixel at pixel location  i, j , the sum that we need to compute is given  by the following equation:  This can be re-written using the fact that the two-dimensional Gaussian is a product of two  one-dimensional Gaussians:  This implies that we can compute the Gaussian blur in two passes. In the first pass, we can  compute the sum over j  the vertical sum  in the preceding equation and store the results in a  temporary texture. In the second pass, we compute the sum over i  the horizontal sum  using  the results from the previous pass.  Now, before we look at the code, there is one important point that has to be addressed. As we  mentioned previously, the Gaussian weights must sum to one in order to be a true weighted  average. Therefore, we need to normalize our Gaussian weights as in the following equation:  The value of k in the preceding equation is just the sum of the raw Gaussian weights.  Phew! We've reduced the O n2  problem to one that is O n . OK, with that, let's move on to   the code.  173   We'll implement this technique using three passes and two textures. In the first pass, we'll  render the entire scene to a texture. Then, in the second pass, we'll apply the first  vertical   sum to the texture from the first pass and store the results in another texture. Finally, in the  third pass, we'll apply the horizontal sum to the texture from the second pass, and send the  results to the default framebuffer.  Getting ready Set up two framebuffer objects  refer to the Rendering to a texture recipe in Chapter 4, Using  Textures , and two corresponding textures. The first FBO should have a depth buffer because  it will be used for the first pass. The second FBO need not have a depth buffer because, in the  second and third passes, we'll only render a single screen-filling quad in order to execute the  fragment shader once for each pixel.  As with the previous recipe, we'll use a subroutine to select the functionality of each pass. The  OpenGL program should also set the following uniform variables:   f Width: This is used to set the width of the screen in pixels  f Height: This is used to set the height of the screen in pixels  f Weight[]: This is the array of normalized Gaussian weights  f Texture0: This is to set this to texture unit zero  f PixOffset[]: This is the array of offsets from the pixel being blurred  How to do it... To create a shader program that implements Gaussian blur, use the following code:  1.  Use the same vertex shader as was used in the previous recipe Applying an edge   detection filter.  2.  Use the following code for the fragment shader: in vec3 Position;     Vertex position in vec3 Normal;       Vertex normal layout binding=0  uniform sampler2D Texture0;  subroutine vec4 RenderPassType  ; subroutine uniform RenderPassType RenderPass;     Other uniform variables for the Phong reflection model    can be placed here… layout  location = 0   out vec4 FragColor;  uniform int PixOffset[5] = int[] 0,1,2,3,4 ; uniform float Weight[5];  174   vec3 phongModel  vec3 pos, vec3 norm   {        The code for the Phong reflection model goes here… }  subroutine  RenderPassType  vec4 pass1   {   return vec4 phongModel  Position, Normal  ,1.0 ; }  subroutine  RenderPassType   vec4 pass2   {   ivec2 pix = ivec2 gl_FragCoord.xy ;   vec4 sum = texelFetch Texture0, pix, 0  * Weight[0];   for  int i = 1; i < 5; i++     {     sum += texelFetchOffset  Texture0, pix, 0,                 ivec2 0,PixOffset[i]   * Weight[i];     sum += texelFetchOffset  Texture0, pix, 0,                  ivec2 0,-PixOffset[i]   * Weight[i];   }   return sum; }  subroutine  RenderPassType   vec4 pass3   {   ivec2 pix = ivec2 gl_FragCoord.xy ;   vec4 sum = texelFetch Texture0, pix, 0  * Weight[0];   for  int i = 1; i < 5; i++     {     sum += texelFetchOffset  Texture0, pix, 0,                  ivec2 PixOffset[i],0   * Weight[i];     sum += texelFetchOffset  Texture0, pix, 0,                  ivec2 -PixOffset[i],0   * Weight[i];   }   return sum; }  void main   {      This will call either pass1  , pass2  , or pass3     FragColor = RenderPass  ; }  175   3.   In the OpenGL application, compute the Gaussian weights for the offsets found in the  uniform variable PixOffset, and store the results in the array Weight. You could  use the following code to do so: char uniName[20]; float weights[5], sum, sigma2 = 4.0f;     Compute and sum the weights weights[0] = gauss 0,sigma2 ;    The 1-D Gaussian function sum = weights[0]; for  int i = 1; i < 5; i++   {   weights[i] = gauss i, sigma2 ;   sum += 2 * weights[i]; }     Normalize the weights and set the uniform for  int i = 0; i < 5; i++   {   snprintf uniName, 20, "Weight[%d]", i ;   prog.setUniform uniName, weights[i]   sum ; }  In the main render function, implement the following steps for pass 1:  1.  Select the render framebuffer, enable the depth test, and clear the color depth buffers. 2.  Select the pass1 subroutine function. 3.  Draw the scene.  Use the following steps for pass 2:  1.  Select the intermediate framebuffer, disable the depth test, and clear the color buffer. 2.  Select the pass2 subroutine function. 3.  Set the view, projection, and model matrices to the identity matrix. 4.  Bind the texture from pass 1 to texture unit zero. 5.  Draw a full-screen quad.  Use the following steps for pass 3:  1.  Deselect the framebuffer  revert to the default , and clear the color buffer. 2.  Select the pass3 subroutine function. 3.  Bind the texture from pass 2 to texture unit zero. 4.  Draw a full-screen quad.  176   How it works... In the preceding code for computing the Gaussian weights  code segment 3 , the function  named gauss computes the one-dimensional Gaussian function where the first argument is  the value for x and the second argument is sigma squared. Note that we only need to compute  the positive offsets because the Gaussian is symmetric about zero. As we are only computing  the positive offsets, we need to carefully compute the sum of the weights. We double all of the  non-zero values because they will be used twice  for the positive and negative offset .  The first pass  subroutine function pass1  renders the scene to a texture using the Phong  reflection model  refer to the Implementing per-vertex ambient, diffuse, and specular  ADS   shading recipe in Chapter 2, The Basics of GLSL Shaders .  The second pass  subroutine function pass2  applies the weighted vertical sum of the  Gaussian blur operation, and stores the results in yet another texture. We read pixels from  the texture created in the first pass, offset in the vertical direction by the amounts in the  PixOffset array. We sum using weights from the Weight array.  The dy term is the height   of a texel in texture coordinates.  We sum in both directions at the same time, a distance of  four pixels in each vertical direction.  The third pass  subroutine pass3  is very similar to the second pass. We accumulate the  weighted, horizontal sum using the texture from the second pass. By doing so, we are  incorporating the sums produced in the second pass into our overall weighted sum as  described earlier. Thereby, we are creating a sum over a 9 x 9 pixel area around the destination  pixel. For this pass, the output color goes to the default framebuffer to make up the final result.  There's more... We can further optimize the preceding technique to reduce the number of texture accesses  by half. If we make clever use of the automatic linear interpolation that takes place when  accessing a texture  when GL_LINEAR is the mag min mode , we can actually get information  about two texels with one texture access! A great blog post by Daniel Rákos describes the  technique in detail  visit http:  rastergrid.com blog 2010 09 efficient- gaussian-blur-with-linear-sampling  .  Of course, we can also adapt the preceding technique to blur a larger range of texels by  increasing the size of the arrays Weight and PixOffset and re-computing the weights,   and or we could use different values of sigma2 to vary the shape of the Gaussian.  177   See also   f Bilateral filtering: http:  people.csail.mit.edu sparis bf_course   f The Rendering to a texture recipe in Chapter 4, Using Textures  f The Applying an edge detection filter recipe  f The Using subroutines to select shader functionality recipe in Chapter 2, The Basics   of GLSL Shaders  Implementing HDR lighting with tone  mapping When rendering for most output devices  monitors or televisions , the device only supports  a typical color precision of 8 bits per color component, or 24 bits per pixel. Therefore, for a  given color component, we're limited to a range of intensities between 0 and 255. Internally,  OpenGL uses floating-point values for color intensities, providing a wide range of both values  and precision. These are eventually converted to 8 bit values by mapping the floating-point  range [0.0, 1.0] to the range of an unsigned byte [0, 255] before rendering.  Real scenes, however, have a much wider range of luminance. For example, light sources that  are visible in a scene, or direct reflections of them, can be hundreds to thousands of times  brighter than the objects that are illuminated by the source. When we're working with 8 bits  per channel, or the floating-point range [0.0, -1.0], we can't represent this range of intensities.  If we decide to use a larger range of floating point values, we can do a better job of internally  representing these intensities, but in the end, we still need to compress down to the 8-bit range.  The process of computing the lighting shading using a larger dynamic range is often referred  to as High Dynamic Range rendering  HDR rendering . Photographers are very familiar   with this concept. When a photographer wants to capture a larger range of intensities than  would normally be possible in a single exposure, he she might take several images with  different exposures to capture a wider range of values. This concept, called High Dynamic  Range imaging  HDR imaging , is very similar in nature to the concept of HDR rendering.   A post-processing pipeline that includes HDR is now considered a fundamentally essential  part of any game engine.  Tone mapping is the process of taking a wide dynamic range of values and compressing them  into a smaller range that is appropriate for the output device. In computer graphics, generally,  tone mapping is about mapping to the 8-bit range from some arbitrary range of values. The  goal is to maintain the dark and light parts of the image so that both are visible, and neither   is completely "washed out".  178   For example, a scene that includes a bright light source might cause our shading model to  produce intensities that are greater than 1.0. If we were to simply send that to the output  device, anything greater than 1.0 would be clamped to 255, and would appear white. The  result might be an image that is mostly white, similar to a photograph that is over exposed.   Or, if we were to linearly compress the intensities to the [0, 255] range, the darker parts might  be too dark, or completely invisible. With tone mapping, we want to maintain the brightness   of the light source, and also maintain detail in the darker areas.  This description just scratches the surface when it comes  to tone mapping and HDR rendering imaging. For more  details, I recommend the book High Dynamic Range  Imaging by Reinhard et al.  The mathematical function used to map from one dynamic range to a smaller range is called  the Tone Mapping Operator  TMO . These generally come in two "flavors", local operators  and global operators. A local operator determines the new value for a given pixel by using its  current value and perhaps the value of some nearby pixels. A global operator needs some  information about the entire image, in order to do its work. For example, it might need to  have the overall average luminance of all pixels in the image. Other global operators use a  histogram of luminance values over the entire image to help fine-tune the mapping.  In this recipe, we'll use a simple global operator that is described in the book Real Time  Rendering. This operator uses the log-average luminance of all pixels in the image. The log- average is determined by taking the logarithm of the luminance and averaging those values,  then converting back, as shown in the following equation:  Lw x, y  is the luminance of the pixel at  x, y . The 0.0001 term is included in order to avoid  taking the logarithm of zero for black pixels. This log-average is then used as part of the tone  mapping operator shown as follows:.  179   The a term in this equation is the key. It acts in a similar way to the exposure level in a camera.  The typical values for a range from 0.18 to 0.72. Since this tone mapping operator compresses  the dark and light values a bit too much, we'll use a modification of the previous equation that  doesn't compress the dark values as much, and includes a maximum luminance  Lwhite , a  configurable value that helps to reduce some of the extremely bright pixels.  This is the tone mapping operator that we'll use in this example. We'll render the scene to   a high-resolution buffer, compute the log-average luminance, and then apply the previous  tone-mapping operator in a second pass.  However, there's one more detail that we need to deal with before we can start implementing.  The previous equations all deal with luminance. Starting with an RGB value, we can compute  its luminance, but once we modify the luminance, how do we modify the RGB components to  reflect the new luminance, but without changing the hue  or chromaticity ?  The chromaticity is the perceived color, independent of the  brightness of that color. For example, grey and white are two  brightness levels for the same color.  The solution involves switching color spaces. If we convert the scene to a color space that  separates out the luminance from the chromaticity, then we can change the luminance value  independently. The CIE XYZ color space has just what we need. The CIE XYZ color space was  designed so that the Y component describes the luminance of the color, and the chromaticity  can be determined by two derived parameters  x and y . The derived color space is called the  CIE xyY space, and is exactly what we're looking for. The Y component contains the luminance  and the x and y components contain the chromaticity. By converting to the CIE xyY space,  we've factored out the luminance from the chromaticity allowing us to change the luminance  without affecting the perceived color.  So the process involves converting from RGB to CIE XYZ, then converting to CIE xyY, modifying  the luminance and reversing the process to get back to RGB. To convert from RGB to CIE XYZ   and vice-versa  can be described as a transformation matrix  refer to the code or the See also  section for the matrix .  The conversion from XYZ to xyY involves the following:  180   Finally, converting from xyY back to XYZ is done using the following equations:  The following images show an example of the results of this tone mapping operator. The left  image shows the scene rendered without any tone mapping. The shading was deliberately  calculated with a wide dynamic range using three strong light sources. The scene appears  "blown out" because any values that are greater than 1.0 simply get clamped to the maximum  intensity. The image on the right uses the same scene and the same shading, but with the  previous tone mapping operator applied. Note the recovery of the specular highlights from the  "blown-out" areas on the sphere and teapot.  Getting ready The steps involved are the following:  1.  Render the scene to a high-resolution texture. 2.  Compute the log-average luminance  on the CPU . 3.  Render a screen-filling quad to execute the fragment shader for each screen pixel. In  the fragment shader, read from the texture created in step 1, apply the tone mapping  operator, and send the results to the screen.  To get set up, create a high-res texture  using GL_RGB32F or similar format  attached to a  framebuffer with a depth attachment. Set up your fragment shader with a subroutine for each  pass. The vertex shader can simply pass through the position and normal in eye coordinates.  181   How to do it... To implement HDR tone mapping, we'll use the following steps:  1.   In the first pass we want to just render the scene to the high-resolution texture. Bind  to the framebuffer that has the texture attached and render the scene normally.  Apply whatever shading equation strikes your fancy.  2.  Compute the log average luminance of the pixels in the texture. To do so, we'll pull    the data from the texture and loop through the pixels on the CPU side. We do this on  the CPU for simplicity, a GPU implementation, perhaps with a compute shader, would  be faster. GLfloat *texData = new GLfloat[width*height*3]; glActiveTexture GL_TEXTURE0 ; glBindTexture GL_TEXTURE_2D, hdrTex ; glGetTexImage GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, GL_RGB, GL_FLOAT, texData ; float sum = 0.0f; int size = width*height; for  int i = 0; i < size; i++   {   float lum = computeLuminance           texData[i*3+0], texData[i*3+1], texData[i*3+2]  ;   sum += logf  lum + 0.00001f  ; } delete [] texData; float logAve = expf  sum   size  ;  3.  Set the AveLum uniform variable using logAve. Switch back to the default frame   buffer, and draw a screen-filling quad. In the fragment shader, apply the tone  mapping operator to the values from the texture produced in step 1.    Retrieve high-res color from texture vec4 color = texture  HdrTex, TexCoord  ;         Convert to XYZ vec3 xyzCol = rgb2xyz * vec3 color ;     Convert to xyY float xyzSum = xyzCol.x + xyzCol.y + xyzCol.z; vec3 xyYCol = vec3 0.0 ; if  xyzSum > 0.0       Avoid divide by zero    xyYCol = vec3  xyzCol.x   xyzSum,                    xyzCol.y   xyzSum, xyzCol.y ;     Apply the tone mapping operation to the luminance       xyYCol.z or xyzCol.y  float L =  Exposure * xyYCol.z    AveLum;  182   L =  L *   1 + L    White * White         1 + L  ;     Using the new luminance, convert back to XYZ if  xyYCol.y > 0.0   {   xyzCol.x =  L * xyYCol.x     xyYCol.y ;   xyzCol.y = L;   xyzCol.z =  L *  1 - xyYCol.x - xyYCol.y   xyYCol.y; }     Convert back to RGB and send to output buffer FragColor = vec4  xyz2rgb * xyzCol, 1.0 ;  How it works... In the first step, we render the scene to an HDR texture. In step 2, we compute the log-average  luminance by retrieving the pixels from the texture and doing the computation on the CPU   OpenGL side .  In step 3, we render a single screen-filling quad to execute the fragment shader for each   screen pixel. In the fragment shader, we retrieve the HDR value from the texture and apply  the tone-mapping operator. There are two "tunable" variables in this calculation. The variable  Exposure corresponds to the a term in the tone mapping operator, and the variable White  corresponds to Lwhite. For the previous image, we used values of 0.35 and 0.928 respectively.  There's more... Tone mapping is not an exact science. Often, it is a process of experimenting with the  parameters until you find something that works well and looks good.  We could improve the efficiency of the previous technique by implementing step 2 on the GPU  using compute shaders  refer to Chapter 10, Using Compute Shaders  or some other clever  technique. For example, we could write the logarithms to a texture, then iteratively downsample  the full frame to a 1 x 1 texture. The final result would be available in that single pixel. However,  with the flexibility of the compute shader, we could optimize this process even more.

This effect has its basis in the way  that cameras and the human visual system perceive areas of high contrast. Sources of bright  light "bleed" into other areas of the image due to the so-called Airy disc, which is a diffraction  pattern produced by light that passes through an aperture.  The following image shows a bloom effect in the animated film Elephant's Dream    2006,  Blender Foundation   Netherlands Media Art Institute   www.elephantsdream.org . The  bright white color from the light behind the door "bleeds" into the darker parts of the image.  Producing such an effect within an artificial CG rendering requires determining which parts of  the image are bright enough, extracting those parts, blurring, and re-combining with the original  image. Typically, the bloom effect is associated with HDR  High Dynamic Range  rendering. With  HDR rendering, we can represent a larger range of intensities for each pixel  without quantizing  artifacts . The bloom effect is more accurate when used in conjunction with HDR rendering due  to the fact that a wider range of brightness values can be represented.  Despite the fact that HDR produces higher quality results, it is still possible to produce a  bloom effect when using standard  non-HDR  color values. The result may not be as effective,  but the principles involved are similar for either situation.  In the following example, we'll implement a bloom effect using five passes, consisting of four  major steps:  In the first pass, we will render the scene to an HDR texture.  1.  2.  The second pass will extract the parts of the image that are brighter than a certain   threshold value. We'll refer to this as the bright-pass filter. We'll also downsample to a  lower resolution buffer when applying this filter. We do so because we will gain additional  blurring of the image when we read back from this buffer using a linear sampler.  184   3.  The third and fourth passes will apply the Gaussian blur to the bright parts  refer to   4.   the Applying a Gaussian blur filter recipe in this chapter . In the fifth pass, we'll apply tone mapping and add the tone-mapped result to the  blurred bright-pass filter results.  The following diagram summarizes the process. The upper-left shows the scene rendered  to an HDR buffer, with some of the colors out of gamut, causing much of the image to be  "blown-out". The bright-pass filter produces a smaller  about a quarter or an eighth of the  original size  image with only pixels that correspond to a luminance that is above a threshold.  The pixels are shown as white because they have values that are greater than one in this  example. A two-pass Gaussian blur is applied to the downsampled image, and tone mapping  is applied to the original image. The final image is produced by combining the tone-mapped  image with the blurred bright-pass filter image. When sampling the latter, we use a linear filter  to get additional blurring. The final result is shown at the bottom. Note the bloom on the bright  highlights on the sphere and the back wall.  185   Getting ready For this recipe, we'll need two framebuffer objects, each associated with a texture. The first  will be used for the original HDR render, the second will be used for the two passes of the  Gaussian blur operation. In the fragment shader, we'll access the original render via the  variable HdrTex, and the two stages of the Gaussian blur will be accessed via BlurTex.  The uniform variable LumThresh is the minimum luminance value used in the second pass.  Any pixels greater than that value will be extracted and blurred in the following passes.  Use a vertex shader that passes through the position and normal in eye coordinates.  How to do it... To generate a bloom effect, use the following steps:  In the first pass, render the scene to the framebuffer with a high-res backing texture. In the second pass, switch to a framebuffer containing a high-res texture that is  smaller than the size of the full render. In the example code, we use a texture that is  one-eighth the size. Draw a full screen quad to initiate the fragement shader for each  pixel, and in the fragment shader sample from the high-res texture, and write only  those values that are larger than LumThresh. Otherwise, color the pixel black. vec4 val = texture HdrTex, TexCoord ; if  luminance val.rgb  > LumThresh       FragColor = val; else     FragColor = vec4 0.0 ;  In the third and fourth passes, apply the Gaussian blur to the results of the second  pass. This can be done with a single framebuffer and two textures. "Ping-pong"  between them, reading from one and writing to the other. For details, refer to the  Applying a Gaussian blur filter recipe in this chapter. In the fifth and final pass, switch to linear filtering from the texture that was   produced in the fourth pass. Switch to the default frame buffer  the screen .   Apply the tone-mapping operator from the Implementing HDR lighting with tone  mapping recipe to the original image texture  HdrTex , and combine the results   with the blurred texture from step 3. The linear filtering and magnification should  provide an additional blur.     Retrieve high-res color from texture vec4 color = texture  HdrTex, TexCoord  ;     Apply tone mapping to color, result is toneMapColor …  1.  2.   3.   4.   186             Combine with blurred texture            vec4 blurTex = texture BlurTex1, TexCoord ;  FragColor = toneMapColor + blurTex;  How it works... Due to space constraints, I haven't show the entire fragment shader code here. The code is  available from the GitHub repository. The fragment shader is implemented with five subroutine  methods, one for each pass. The first pass renders the scene normally to the HDR texture.  During this pass, the active framebuffer object  FBO  is the one associated with the texture  corresponding to HdrTex, so output is sent directly to that texture.  The second pass reads from HdrTex, and writes out only pixels that have a luminance above  the threshold value LumThresh. The value is  0,0,0,0  for pixels that have a brightness  luma   value below LumThresh. The output goes to the second framebuffer, which contains a much  smaller texture  one-eighth the size of the original .  The third and fourth passes apply the basic Gaussian blur operation  refer to the Applying a  Gaussian blur filter recipe in this chapter . In these passes, we "ping-pong" between BlurTex1  and BlurTex2, so we must be careful to swap the appropriate texture into the framebuffer.  In the fifth pass, we switch back to the default framebuffer, and read from HdrTex and  BlurTex1. BlurTex1 contains the final blurred result from step four, and HdrTex contains  the original render. We apply tone mapping to the results of HdrTex and add to BlurTex1.  When pulling from BlurTex1, we are applying a linear filter, gaining additional blurring.  There's more... Note that we applied the tone-mapping operator to the original rendered image, but not to the  blurred bright-pass filter image. One could choose apply the TMO to the blurred image as well,  but in practice, it is often not necessary.  We should keep in mind that the bloom effect can also be visually distracting if it is overused.  A little goes a long way.

Lighting and shading calculations are performed, and the results are sent  directly to the output buffer without modification. However, when we do this, we may produce  results that don't quite end up looking the way we might expect they should. This may be due  to the fact that computer monitors  both the old CRT and the newer LCD  have a non-linear  response to pixel intensity. For example, without gamma correction, a grayscale value of 0.5 will  not appear half as bright as a value of 1.0. Instead, it will appear to be darker than it should.  The lower curve in the following graph shows the response curves of a typical monitor  gamma  of 2.2 . The x axis is the intensity, and the y axis is the perceived intensity. The dashed line  represents a linear set of intensities. The upper curve represents gamma correction applied to  linear values. The lower curve represents the response of a typical monitor. A grayscale value  of 0.5 would appear to have a value of 0.218 on a screen that had a similar response curve.  The non-linear response of a typical monitor can usually be modeled using a simple power  function. The perceived intensity  P  is proportional to the pixel intensity  I  raised to a power  that is usually called "gamma".  Depending on the display device, the value of gamma is usually somewhere between 2.0 and  2.4. Some kind of monitor calibration is often needed to determine a precise value.  188   In order to compensate for this non-linear response, we can apply gamma correction before  sending our results to the output framebuffer. Gamma correction involves raising the pixel  intensities to a power that will compensate for the monitor's non-linear response to achieve a  perceived result that appears linear. Raising the linear-space values to the power of 1 gamma  will do the trick.  When rendering, we can do all of our lighting and shading computations ignoring the fact  that the monitor's response curve is non-linear. This is sometimes referred to as "working in  linear space". When the final result is to be written to the output framebuffer, we can apply the  gamma correction by raising the pixel to the power of 1 gamma just before writing. This is an  important step that will help to improve the look of the rendered result.  As an example, consider the following images. The image on the left is the mesh rendered  without any consideration of gamma at all. The reflection model is computed and the results  are directly sent to the framebuffer. On the right is the same mesh with gamma correction  applied to the color just prior to output.  The obvious difference is that the left image appears much darker than the image on the  right. However, the more important distinction is the variations from light to dark across the  face. While the transition at the shadow terminator seems stronger than before, the variations  within the lighted areas are less extreme.  Applying gamma correction is an important technique, and can be effective in improving the  results of a lighting model.  189   How to do it... Adding gamma correction to an OpenGL program can be as simple as carrying out the  following steps:  1.  Set up a uniform variable named Gamma and set it to an appropriate value for    your system.  2.  Use the following code or something similar in a fragment shader:  vec3 color = lightingModel  …  ; FragColor = vec4  pow  color, vec3 1.0 Gamma   , 1.0  ;  If your shader involves texture data, care must be taken to make sure that the texture data  is not already gamma-corrected so that you don't apply gamma correction twice  refer to the  There's more… section of this recipe .  How it works... The color determined by the lighting shading model is computed and stored in the variable  color. We think of this as computing the color in "linear space". There is no consideration of  the monitor's response during the calculation of the shading model  assuming that we don't  access any texture data that might already be gamma-corrected .  To apply the correction, in the fragment shader, we raise the color of the pixel to the power of  1.0   Gamma, and apply the result to the output variable FragColor. Of course, the inverse of  Gamma could be computed outside the fragment shader to avoid the division operation.  We do not apply the gamma correction to the alpha component because it is typically   not desired.  There's more... The application of gamma correction is a good idea in general; however, some care must  be taken to make sure that computations are done within the correct "space". For example,  textures could be photographs or images produced by other imaging applications that apply  gamma correction before storing the data within the image file. Therefore, if we use a texture  in our application as a part of the lighting model and then apply gamma correction, we will be  effectively applying gamma correction twice to the data from the texture. Instead, we need to  be careful to "decode" the texture data, by raising to the power of gamma prior to using the  texture data in our lighting model.  There is a very detailed discussion about these and other issues surrounding gamma  correction in Chapter 24, The Importance of Being Linear in the book GPU Gems 3, edited  by Hubert Nguyen  Addison-Wesley Professional 2007 , and this is highly recommended  supplemental reading.  190   Using multisample anti-aliasing Anti-aliasing is the technique of removing or reducing the visual impact of aliasing artifacts  that are present whenever high-resolution or continuous information, is presented at a lower  resolution. In real-time graphics, aliasing often reveals itself in the jagged appearance of  polygon edges, or the visual distortion of textures that have a high degree of variation.  The following images show an example of aliasing artifacts at the edge of an object. On the  left, we see that the edge appears jagged. This occurs because each pixel is determined to  lie either completely inside the polygon, or completely outside it. If the pixel is determined to  be inside, it is shaded, otherwise it is not. Of course, this is not entirely accurate. Some pixels  lie directly on the edge of the polygon. Some of the screen area that the pixel encompasses  actually lies within the polygon and some lies outside. Better results could be achieved if  we were to modify the shading of a pixel based upon the amount of the pixel's area that lies  within the polygon. The result could be a mixture of the shaded surface's color with the color  outside the polygon, where the area that is covered by the pixel determines the proportions.  You might be thinking that this sounds like it would be prohibitively expensive to do. That may  be true; however, we can approximate the results by using multiple samples per pixel.  Multisample anti-aliasing involves evaluating multiple samples per pixel and combining the  results of those samples to determine the final value for the pixel. The samples are located  at various points within the pixel's extent. Most of these samples will fall inside the polygon;  but for pixels near a polygon's edge, some will fall outside. The fragment shader will typically  execute only once for each pixel as usual. For example, with 4x multisample anti-aliasing   MSAA , rasterization happens at four times the frequency. For each pixel, the fragment  shader is executed once and the result is scaled based on how many of the four samples fall  within the polygon.  The following image on the right shows the results when multisample anti-aliasing is used.  The inset image is a zoomed portion of the inside edge of a torus. On the left, the torus is  rendered without MSAA. The right-hand image shows the results with MSAA enabled:  191   OpenGL has supported multisampling for some time now, and it is nearly transparent to  use. It is simply a matter of turning it on or off. It works by using additional buffers to store  the subpixel samples as they are processed. Then the samples are combined together to  produce a final color for the fragment. Nearly all of this is automatic, and there is little that a  programmer can do to fine-tune the results. However, at the end of this recipe, we'll discuss  the interpolation qualifiers that can affect the results.  In this recipe, we'll see the code needed to enable multisample anti-aliasing in an   OpenGL application.  Getting ready The technique for enabling multisampling is unfortunately dependent on the window system  API. In this example, we'll demonstrate how it is done using GLFW. The steps will be similar in  GLUT or other APIs that support OpenGL.  How to do it... To make sure that the multisample buffers are created and available, use the following steps:  1.  When creating your OpenGL window, you need to select an OpenGL context that   supports MSAA. The following is how one would do so in GLFW: glfwWindowHint GLFW_SAMPLES, 8 ;  …    Other settings window = glfwCreateWindow  WIN_WIDTH, WIN_HEIGHT,                          "Window title", NULL, NULL  ;  2.  To determine whether multisample buffers are available and how many samples per- pixel are actually being used, you can use the following code  or something similar : GLint bufs, samples; glGetIntegerv GL_SAMPLE_BUFFERS, &bufs ; glGetIntegerv GL_SAMPLES, &samples ; printf "MSAA: buffers = %d samples = %d\n", bufs, samples ;  3.  To enable multisampling, use the following:  glEnable GL_MULTISAMPLE ;  4.  To disable multisampling, use the following:  glDisable GL_MULTISAMPLE ;  192   How it works... As just mentioned, the technique for creating an OpenGL context with multisample buffers is  dependent on the API used for interacting with the window system. The preceding example  demonstrates how it might be done using GLFW. Once the OpenGL context is created, it is easy  to enable multisampling by simply using the glEnable call shown in the preceding example.  Stay tuned, because in the next section, I'll discuss a subtle issue surrounding interpolation of  shader variables when multisample anti-aliasing is enabled.  There's more... There are two interpolation qualifiers within the GLSL that allow the programmer to fine-tune  some aspects of multisampling. They are: sample and centroid.  Before we can get into how sample and centroid work, we need a bit of background.  Let's consider the way that polygon edges are handled without multisampling. A fragment is  determined to be inside or outside of a polygon by determining where the center of that pixel  lies. If the center is within the polygon, the pixel is shaded, otherwise it is not. The following  image represents this behavior. It shows pixels near a polygon edge without MSAA. The line  represents the edge of the polygon. Gray pixels are considered to be inside the polygon. White  pixels are outside and are not shaded. The dots represent the pixel centers.  The values for the interpolated variables  the fragment shader's input variables  are  interpolated with respect to the center of each fragment, which will always be inside   the polygon.  193   When multisample anti-aliasing is enabled, multiple samples are computed per fragment at  various locations within the fragment's extent. If any of those samples lie within the polygon, then  the shader is executed at least once for that pixel  but not necessarily for each sample . As a  visual example, the following image represents pixels near a polygon's edge. The dots represent  the samples. The dark samples lie within the polygon and the white samples lie outside the  polygon. If any sample lies within the polygon, the fragment shader is executed  usually only  once  for that pixel. Note that for some pixels, the pixel centers lie outside the polygon. So with  MSAA, the fragment shader may execute slightly more often near the edges of polygons.  Now, here's the important point. The values of the fragment shader's input variables are normally  interpolated to the center of the pixel rather than to the location of any particular sample. In  other words, the value that is used by the fragment shader is determined by interpolating to the  location of the fragment's center, which may lie outside the polygon! If we are relying on the fact  that the fragment shader's input variables are interpolated strictly between their values at the  vertices  and not outside that range  then this might lead to unexpected results.  As an example, consider the following portion of a fragment shader:  in vec2 TexCoord;  layout  location = 0   out vec4 FragColor;  void main   {   vec3 yellow = vec3 1.0,1.0,0.0 ;   vec3 color = vec3 0.0 ;      black   if  TexCoord.s > 1.0       color = yellow;   FragColor = vec4  color , 1.0  ; }  194   This shader is designed to color the polygon black unless the s component of the texture  coordinate is greater than one. In that case, the fragment gets a yellow color. If we render  a square with texture coordinates that range from zero to one in each direction, we may get  the results shown in the following image on the left. The images show the enlarged edge of  a polygon where the s texture coordinate is about 1.0. Both images were rendered using the  preceding shader. The right-hand image was created using the centroid qualifier  more on  this later in this chapter .  The left image shows that some pixels along the edge have a lighter color  yellow if the image  is in full color . This is due to the fact that the texture coordinate is interpolated to the pixel's  center, rather than to any particular sample's location. Some of the fragments along the edge  have a center that lies outside of the polygon, and therefore end up with a texture coordinate  that is greater than one!  We can ask OpenGL to instead compute the value for the input variable by interpolating to  some location that is not only within the pixel, but also within the polygon. We can do so by  using the centroid qualifier as shown in the following code:  centroid in vec2 TexCoord;   The qualifier needs to also be included with the corresponding output variable in the vertex  shader.  When centroid is used with the preceding shader, we get the preceding image  shown on the right.  In general, we should use centroid or sample when we  know that the interpolation of the input variables should not  extend beyond the values of those variables at the vertices.  The sample qualifier forces OpenGL to interpolate the shader's input variables to the actual  location of the sample itself.  sample in vec2 TexCoord;  This, of course, requires that the fragment shader be executed once for each sample. This will  produce the most accurate results, but the performance hit may not be worthwhile, especially  if the visual results produced by centroid  or without the default  are good enough.  195   Using deferred shading Deferred shading is a technique that involves postponing  or "deferring"  the lighting shading  step to a second pass. We do this  among other reasons  in order to avoid shading a pixel  more than once. The basic idea is as follows:  1.   2.   In the first pass, we render the scene, but instead of evaluating the reflection model  to determine a fragment color, we simply store all of the geometry information   position, normal, texture coordinate, reflectivity, and so on  in an intermediate set of  buffers, collectively called the g-buffer  g for geometry . In the second pass, we simply read from the g-buffer, evaluate the reflection model,  and produce a final color for each pixel.  When deferred shading is used, we avoid evaluating the reflection model for a fragment  that will not end up being visible. For example, consider a pixel located in an area where two  polygons overlap. The fragment shader may be executed once for each polygon that covers  that pixel; however, the resulting color of only one of the two executions will end up being the  final color for that pixel  assuming that blending is not enabled . The cycles spent in evaluating  the reflection model for one of the two fragments are effectively wasted. With deferred  shading, the evaluation of the reflection model is postponed until all the geometry has been  processed, and the visible geometry is known at each pixel location. Hence, the reflection  model is evaluated only once for each pixel on the screen.  This allows us to do lighting in a  more efficient fashion. For example, we could use even hundreds of light sources because we  are only evaluating the lighting once per screen pixel.  Deferred shading is fairly simple to understand and work with. It can therefore help with the  implementation of complex lighting reflection models.  In this recipe, we'll go through a simple example of deferred shading. We'll store the following  information in our g-buffer: the position, normal, and diffuse color  the diffuse reflectivity .   In the second pass, we'll simply evaluate the diffuse lighting model using the data stored in  the g-buffer.  This recipe is meant to be a starting point for deferred shading. If  we were to use deferred shading in a more substantial  real-world   application, we'd probably need more components in our g-buffer.  It should be straightforward to extend this example to use more  complex lighting shading models.  196   Getting ready The g-buffer will contain three textures for storing the position, normal, and diffuse color.  There are three uniform variables that correspond to these three textures: PositionTex,  NormalTex, and ColorTex; these textures should be assigned to texture units 0, 1, and 2,  respectively. Likewise, the vertex shader assumes that position information is provided in vertex  attribute 0, the normal is provided in attribute 1, and the texture coordinate in attribute 2.  The fragment shader has several uniform variables related to light and material properties  that must be set from the OpenGL program. Specifically, the structures Light and Material  apply to the shading model used here.  You'll need a variable named deferredFBO  type GLuint  to store the handle to the FBO.  How to do it... To create a shader program that implements deferred shading  with diffuse shading only ,   use the following code:  1.  To create the framebuffer object that contains our g-buffer use the following code     or something similar : void createGBufTex GLenum texUnit, GLenum format,                     GLuint &texid   {     glActiveTexture texUnit ;     glGenTextures 1, &texid ;     glBindTexture GL_TEXTURE_2D, texid ;     glTexStorage2D GL_TEXTURE_2D,1,format,width,height ;     glTexParameteri GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER,                      GL_NEAREST ;     glTexParameteri GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER,                      GL_NEAREST ; } … GLuint depthBuf, posTex, normTex, colorTex;     Create and bind the FBO glGenFramebuffers 1, &deferredFBO ; glBindFramebuffer GL_FRAMEBUFFER, deferredFBO ;     The depth buffer glGenRenderbuffers 1, &depthBuf ; glBindRenderbuffer GL_RENDERBUFFER, depthBuf ; glRenderbufferStorage GL_RENDERBUFFER, GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT,                        width, height ;  197      The position, normal and color buffers createGBufTex GL_TEXTURE0, GL_RGB32F, posTex ;     Position createGBufTex GL_TEXTURE1, GL_RGB32F, normTex ;    Normal createGBufTex GL_TEXTURE2, GL_RGB8, colorTex ;     Color     Attach the images to the framebuffer glFramebufferRenderbuffer GL_FRAMEBUFFER,           GL_DEPTH_ATTACHMENT, GL_RENDERBUFFER, depthBuf ; glFramebufferTexture2D GL_FRAMEBUFFER,           GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENT0, GL_TEXTURE_2D, posTex, 0 ; glFramebufferTexture2D GL_FRAMEBUFFER,           GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENT1, GL_TEXTURE_2D, normTex, 0 ; glFramebufferTexture2D GL_FRAMEBUFFER,           GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENT2, GL_TEXTURE_2D, colorTex, 0 ;  GLenumdrawBuffers[] = {GL_NONE, GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENT0,           GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENT1,GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENT2}; glDrawBuffers 4, drawBuffers ;  2.  Use the following code for the vertex shader:  layout  location = 0   in vec3 VertexPosition; layout  location = 1   in vec3 VertexNormal; layout  location = 2   in vec2 VertexTexCoord;  out vec3 Position; out vec3 Normal; out vec2 TexCoord;  uniform mat4 ModelViewMatrix; uniform mat3 NormalMatrix; uniform mat4 ProjectionMatrix; uniform mat4 MVP; void main   {     Normal = normalize  NormalMatrix * VertexNormal ;     Position = vec3  ModelViewMatrix *                       vec4 VertexPosition,1.0   ;     TexCoord = VertexTexCoord;     gl_Position = MVP * vec4 VertexPosition,1.0 ; }  3.  Use the following code for the fragment shader:  struct LightInfo {   vec4 Position;     Light position in eye coords.   vec3 Intensity;    Diffuse intensity };  198   uniform LightInfo Light; struct MaterialInfo {   vec3 Kd;               Diffuse reflectivity }; uniform MaterialInfo Material;  subroutine void RenderPassType  ; subroutine uniform RenderPassType RenderPass;     The g-buffer textures layout binding = 0  uniform sampler2D PositionTex; layout binding = 1  uniform sampler2D NormalTex; layout binding = 2  uniform sampler2D ColorTex; in vec3 Position; in vec3 Normal; in vec2 TexCoord;  layout  location = 0  out vec4 FragColor; layout  location = 1  out vec3 PositionData; layout  location = 2  out vec3 NormalData; layout  location = 3  out vec3 ColorData;  vec3 diffuseModel  vec3 pos, vec3 norm, vec3 diff   {   vec3 s = normalize vec3 Light.Position  - pos ;   float sDotN = max  dot s,norm , 0.0  ;   vec3 diffuse = Light.Intensity * diff * sDotN;    return diffuse; }  subroutine  RenderPassType  void pass1   {        Store position, norm, and diffuse color in g-buffer     PositionData = Position;     NormalData = Normal;     ColorData = Material.Kd; }  subroutine RenderPassType  void pass2   {        Retrieve position, normal and color information from         the g-buffer textures     vec3 pos = vec3  texture  PositionTex, TexCoord    ;  199       vec3 norm = vec3  texture  NormalTex, TexCoord    ;     vec3 diffColor = vec3  texture ColorTex, TexCoord   ;      FragColor=vec4 diffuseModel pos,norm,diffColor , 1.0 ; }  void main   {        This will call either pass1 or pass2     RenderPass  ; }  In the render function of the OpenGL application, use the following steps for pass 1:  1.  Bind to the framebuffer object deferredFBO. 2.  Clear the color depth buffers, select the pass1 subroutine function, and enable the   depth test  if necessary .  3.  Render the scene normally.  Use the following steps for pass 2:  1.  Revert to the default FBO  bind to framebuffer 0 . 2.  Clear the color buffer, select the pass2 subroutine function, and disable the depth   test  if desired .  3.  Render a screen-filling quad  or two triangles  with texture coordinates that range   from zero to one in each direction.  How it works... When setting up the framebuffer object  FBO  for the g-buffer, we use textures with internal  format GL_RGB32F for the position and normal components. As we are storing geometry  information, rather than simply color information, there is a need to use a higher resolution   that is more bits per pixel . The buffer for the diffuse reflectivity just uses GL_RGB8 since we  don't need the extra resolution for these values.  The three textures are then attached to the framebuffer at color attachments 0, 1, and 2  using glFramebufferTexture2D. They are then connected to the fragment shader's output  variables with the call to glDrawBuffers.  glDrawBuffers 4, drawBuffers ;  The array drawBuffers indicates the relationship between the framebuffer's components  and the fragment shader's output variable locations. The ith item in the array corresponds to  the ith output variable location. This call sets color attachments 0, 1, and 2 to output variable  locations 1, 2, and 3, respectively.  Note that the fragment shader's corresponding variables  are PositionData, NormalData, and ColorData.   200   The vertex shader is a basic "pass-through" shader. It just converts the position and normal  to eye  camera  coordinates and passes them along to the fragment shader. The texture  coordinate is passed through unchanged.  During pass 2, it is not strictly necessary to convert and pass through  the normal and position, as they will not be used in the fragment  shader at all. However, to keep things simple, I did not include this  optimization. It would be a simple matter to add a subroutine to the  vertex shader in order to "switch off" the conversion during pass 2.   Of course, we need to set gl_Position regardless.   In the fragment shader, the functionality depends on the value of the subroutine variable  RenderPass. It will either call pass1 or pass2, depending on its value. In the pass1  function, we store the values of Position, Normal, and Material.Kd in the appropriate  output variables, effectively storing them in the textures that we just talked about.  In the pass2 function, the values of the position, normal, and color are retrieved from  the textures, and used to evaluate the diffuse lighting model. The result is then stored in  the output variable FragColor. In this pass, FragColor should be bound to the default  framebuffer, so the results of this pass will appear on the screen.  There's more... In the graphics community, the relative advantages and disadvantages of deferred shading  are a source of much debate. Deferred shading is not ideal for all situations. It depends  greatly on the specific requirements of your application, and one needs to carefully evaluate  the benefits and drawbacks before deciding whether or not to use deferred shading.  Multi-sample anti-aliasing with deferred shading is possible in recent versions of OpenGL by  making use of GL_TEXTURE_2D_MULTISAMPLE.  Another consideration is that deferred shading can't do blending transparency very well. In fact,  blending is impossible with the basic implementation we saw some time ago. Additional buffers  with depth-peeling can help by storing additional layered geometry information in the g-buffer.  One notable advantage of deferred shading is that one can retain the depth information from  the first pass and access it as a texture during the shading pass. Having access to the entire  depth buffer as a texture can enable algorithms such as depth of field  depth blur , screen  space ambient occlusion, volumetric particles, and other similar techniques.  For much more information about deferred shading, refer to Chapter 9 in GPU Gems 2 edited  by Matt Pharr and Randima Fernando  Addison-Wesley Professional 2005  and Chapter 19 of  GPU Gems 3 edited by Hubert Nguyen  Addison-Wesley Professional 2007 . Both combined,  provide an excellent discussion of the benefits and drawbacks of deferred shading, and how  to make the decision of whether or not to use it in your application.  201   See also   f The Rendering to a texture recipe in Chapter 4, Using Textures  Implementing order-independent  transparency Transparency can be a difficult effect to do accurately in pipeline architectures like OpenGL.  The general technique is to draw opaque objects first, with the depth buffer enabled, then   to make the depth buffer read-only  using glDepthMask , disable the depth test, and draw  the transparent geometry. However, care must be taken to ensure that the transparent  geometry is drawn from "back to front". That is, objects farther from the viewer should be  drawn before the objects that are closer. This requires some sort of depth-sorting to take  place prior to rendering.  The following images show an example of a block of small, semi-transparent spheres with  some semi-transparent cubes placed evenly within them. On the right-hand side, the objects  are rendered in an arbitrary order, using standard OpenGL blending. The result looks incorrect  because objects are blended in an improper order. The cubes, which were drawn last, appear  to be on top of the spheres, and the spheres look "jumbled", especially in the middle of the  block. On the left, the scene is drawn using proper ordering, so objects appear to be oriented  correctly with respect to depth, and the overall look is more realistic looking.  202   Order Independent Transparency  OIT  means that we can draw objects in any order, and still get  accurate results. Depth sorting is done at some other level, perhaps within the fragment shader,  so that the programmer need not sort objects before rendering. There are a variety of techniques  for doing this; one of the most common technique is to keep a list of colors for each pixel, sort  them by depth, and then blend them together in the fragment shader. In this recipe we'll use this  technique to implement OIT making use of some of the newest features in OpenGL 4.3.  Shader storage buffer objects  SSBO  and image load store are some of the newest features  in OpenGL, introduced in 4.3 and 4.2, respectively. They allow arbitrary read write access to  data from within a shader. Prior to this, shaders were very limited in terms of what data they  could access. They could read from a variety of locations  textures, uniforms, and so on , but  writing was very limited. Shaders could only write to controlled, isolated locations such as  fragment shader outputs and transform feedback buffers. This was for very good reason. Since  shaders can execute in parallel and in a seemingly arbitrary order, it is very difficult to ensure  that data is consistent between instantiations of a shader. Data written by one shader instance  might not be visible to another shader instance whether or not that instance is executed  after the other. Despite this, there are good reasons for wanting to read and write to shared  locations. With the advent of SSBOs and image load store, that capability is now available to  us. We can create buffers and textures  called images  with read write access to any shader  instance. This is especially important for compute shaders, the subject of Chapter 10, Using  Compute Shaders. However, this power comes at a price. The programmer must now be very  careful to avoid the types of memory consistency errors that come along with writing to memory  that is shared among parallel threads. Additionally, the programmer must be aware of the  performance issues that come with synchronization between shader invocations.  For a more thorough discussion of the issues involved with memory  consistency and shaders, refer to Chapter 11, of The OpenGL  Programming Guide, 8th Edition. That chapter also includes  another similar implementation of OIT.  In this recipe, we'll use SSBOs and image load store to implement order-independent  transparency. We'll use two passes. In the first pass, we'll render the scene geometry and  store a linked list of fragments for each pixel. After the first pass, each pixel will have a  corresponding linked list containing all fragments that were written to that pixel including  their depth and color. In the second pass, we'll draw a full-screen quad to invoke the fragment  shader for each pixel. In the fragment shader, we'll extract the linked list for the pixel, sort the  fragments by depth  largest to smallest , and blend the colors in that order. The final color will  then be sent to the output device.  That's the basic idea, so let's dig into the details. We'll need three memory objects that are  shared among the fragment shader instances.  1.  An atomic counter: This is just an unsigned integer that we'll use to keep track of   the size of our linked list buffer. Think of this as the index of the first unused slot in  the buffer.  203   2.  A head-pointer texture that corresponds to the size of the screen: The texture will   store a single unsigned integer in each texel. The value is the index of the head of the  linked list for the corresponding pixel.  3.  A buffer containing all of our linked lists: Each item in the buffer will correspond to  a fragment, and contains a struct with the color and depth of the fragment as well as  an integer, which is the index of the next fragment in the linked list.  In order to understand how all of this works together, let's consider a simple example.  Suppose that our screen is 3 pixels wide and 3 pixels high. We'll have a head pointer texture  that is the same dimensions, and we'll initialize all of the texels to a special value that  indicates the end of the linked list  an empty list . In the following diagram, that value is  shown as an 'x', but in practice, we'll use 0xffffffff. The initial value of the counter is zero,  and the linked list buffer is allocated to a certain size, but treated as empty initially. The initial  state of our memory looks like the following diagram:  Now suppose that a fragment is rendered at the position  0,1  with a depth of 0.75. The  fragment shader will take the following steps:  1.   Increment the atomic counter. The new value will be 1, but we'll use the previous  value  0  as the index for our new node in the linked list.  2.  Update the head pointer texture at  0,1  with the previous value of the counter    0 . This is the index of the new head of the linked list at that pixel. Hold on to the  previous value that was stored there  x , we'll need that in the next step.  3.  Add a new value into the linked list buffer at the location corresponding to the previous   value of the counter  0 . Store here the color of the fragment and its depth. Store in  the "next" component the previous value of the head pointer texture at  0,1  that we  held on to in step 2. In this case, it is the special value indicating the end of the list.  204   After processing this fragment, the memory layout looks like the following:  Now, suppose another fragment is rendered at  0,1 , with a depth of 0.5. The fragment shader  will execute the same steps as the previous ones, resulting in the following memory layout:  205   We now have a 2-element linked list starting at index 1 and ending at index 0. Suppose, now  that we have three more fragments in the following order: a fragment at  1,1  with a depth  of 0.2, a fragment at  0,1  with a depth of 0.3, and a fragment at  1,1  with a depth of 0.4.  Following the same steps for each fragment, we get the following result:  The linked list at  0,1  consists of fragments{3, 1, 0} and the linked list at  1,1  contains  fragments {4, 2}.  Now, we must keep in mind that due to the highly parallel nature of GPUs, fragments can  be rendered in virtually any order. For example, fragments from two different polygons  might proceed through the pipeline in the opposite order as to when the draw instructions  for polygons were issued. As a programmer, we must not expect any specific ordering  of fragments. Indeed, instructions from separate instances of the fragment shader may  interleave in arbitrary ways. The only thing that we can be sure of is that the statements  within a particular instance of the shader will execute in order. Therefore, we need to convince  ourselves that any interleaving of the previous three steps will still result in a consistent state.  For example, suppose instance one executes steps 1 and 2, then another instance  another  fragment, perhaps at the same fragment coordinates  executes steps 1, 2, and 3, before  the first instance executes step 3. Will the result still be consistent? I think you can convince  yourself that it will be, even though the linked list will be broken for a short time during the  process. Try working through other interleavings and convince yourself that we're OK.  Not only can statements within separate instances of a shader  interleave with each other, but the subinstructions that make up  the statements can interleave.  For example, the subinstructions  for an increment operation consist of a load, increment, and a  store.  What's more, they could actually execute at exactly the  same time. Consequently, if we aren't careful, nasty memory  consistency issues can crop up. To help avoid this, we need to  make careful use of the GLSL support for atomic operations.  206   Recent versions of OpenGL  4.2 and 4.3  have introduced the tools that we need to make  this algorithm possible. OpenGL 4.2 introduced atomic counters and the ability to read and  write to arbitrary locations within a texture  called image load store . OpenGL 4.3 introduced  shader storage buffer objects. We'll make use of all three of these features in this example, as  well as the various atomic operations and memory barriers that go along with them.  Getting ready There's a bunch of setup needed here, so I'll go into a bit of detail with some code segments.  First, we'll set up a buffer for our atomic counter:  GLuint counterBuffer;   glGenBuffers 1, &counterBuffer ; glBindBufferBase GL_ATOMIC_COUNTER_BUFFER, 0, counterBuffer ; glBufferData GL_ATOMIC_COUNTER_BUFFER, sizeof GLuint , NULL,               GL_DYNAMIC_DRAW ;  Next, we create a buffer for our linked list storage:  GLuint llBuf; glGenBuffers 1, &llBuf ; glBindBufferBase GL_SHADER_STORAGE_BUFFER, 0, llBuf ; glBufferData GL_SHADER_STORAGE_BUFFER, maxNodes * nodeSize, NULL,               GL_DYNAMIC_DRAW ;  nodeSize in the previous code is the size of a struct NodeType  used in the fragment shader  in the later part of code . This is  computed based on the std430 layout. For details on the std430  layout, see the OpenGL specification document. For this example,  nodeSize is 5 * sizeof GLfloat  + sizeof GLuint .  We also need to create a texture to hold the list head pointers. We'll use 32-bit unsigned  integers, and bind it to image unit 0:  glGenTextures 1, &headPtrTex ; glBindTexture GL_TEXTURE_2D, headPtrTex ; glTexStorage2D GL_TEXTURE_2D, 1, GL_R32UI, width, height ;  glBindImageTexture 0, headPtrTex, 0, GL_FALSE, 0, GL_READ_WRITE,                     GL_R32UI ;  After we render each frame, we need to clear the texture by setting all texels to a value of  0xffffffff. To help with that, we'll create a buffer of the same size as the texture, with  each value set to our "clear value":  vector  headPtrClear width * height, 0xffffffff ;  GLuint clearBuf;  207   glGenBuffers 1, &clearBuf ; glBindBuffer GL_PIXEL_UNPACK_BUFFER, clearBuf ; glBufferData GL_PIXEL_UNPACK_BUFFER,               headPtrClear.size  *sizeof GLuint ,               &headPtrClear[0], GL_STATIC_COPY ;  That's all the buffers we'll need. Note the fact that we've bound the head pointer texture to  image unit 0, the atomic counter buffer to index 0 of the GL_ATOMIC_COUNTER_BUFFER  binding point  glBindBufferBase , and the linked list storage buffer to index 0 of the   GL_SHADER_STORAGE_BUFFER binding point. We'll refer back to that later.  Use a pass-through vertex shader that sends the position and normal along in eye coordinates.  How to do it... With all of the buffers set up, we need two render passes. Before the first pass, we want to  clear our buffers to default values  that is, empty lists , and to reset our atomic counter buffer  to zero.  glBindBuffer GL_PIXEL_UNPACK_BUFFER, clearBuf ; glBindTexture GL_TEXTURE_2D, headPtrTex ; glTexSubImage2D GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, 0, 0, width, height,                  GL_RED_INTEGER, GL_UNSIGNED_INT, NULL ; GLuint zero = 0; glBindBufferBase GL_ATOMIC_COUNTER_BUFFER, 0, counterBuffer ; glBufferSubData GL_ATOMIC_COUNTER_BUFFER, sizeof GLuint , &zero ;  In the first pass, we'll render the full scene geometry. Generally, we should render all the  opaque geometry first, and store the results in a texture. However, we'll skip that step for this  example to keep things simple and focused. Instead, we'll render only transparent geometry.  When rendering the transparent geometry, we need to make sure to put the depth buffer in  read-only mode  use glDepthMask . In the fragment shader, we add each fragment to the  appropriate linked list.  layout  early_fragment_tests  in;  define MAX_FRAGMENTS 75   in vec3 Position; in vec3 Normal;  struct NodeType {   vec4 color;   float depth;   uint next; };  208   layout binding=0, r32ui  uniform uimage2D headPointers; layout binding=0, offset=0  uniform atomic_uint                                           nextNodeCounter; layout binding=0, std430  buffer linkedLists {   NodeType nodes[]; }; uniform uint MaxNodes;  subroutine void RenderPassType  ; subroutine uniform RenderPassType RenderPass;  …  subroutine RenderPassType  void pass1   {      Get the index of the next empty slot in the buffer   uint nodeIdx = atomicCounterIncrement nextNodeCounter ;       Is there space left in the buffer?   if  nodeIdx < MaxNodes   {        Update the head pointer image     uint prevHead = imageAtomicExchange headPointers,                             ivec2 gl_FragCoord.xy , nodeIdx ;         Set the color and depth of this new node to the color        and depth of the fragment.  The next pointer points to the        previous head of the list.     nodes[nodeIdx].color = vec4 shadeFragment  , Kd.a ;     nodes[nodeIdx].depth = gl_FragCoord.z;     nodes[nodeIdx].next = prevHead;   } }  Before rendering the second pass, we need to be sure that all of the data has been written to  our buffers. In order to ensure that is indeed the case, we can use a memory barrier.  glMemoryBarrier  GL_ALL_BARRIER_BITS  ;  In the second pass, we don't render the scene geometry, just a single, screen-filling quad in  order to invoke the fragment shader for each screen pixel. In the fragment shader, we start by  copying the linked list for the fragment into a temporary array.  struct NodeType frags[MAX_FRAGMENTS]; int count = 0;  209      Get the index of the head of the list uint n = imageLoad headPointers, ivec2 gl_FragCoord.xy  .r;     Copy the linked list for this fragment into an array while  n != 0xffffffff && count < MAX_FRAGMENTS  {   frags[count] = nodes[n];   n = frags[count].next;   count++; }  Then, we sort the fragments using insertion sort:     Sort the array by depth  largest to smallest . for  uint i = 1; i < count; i++   {   struct NodeType toInsert = frags[i];   uint j = i;   while  j > 0 && toInsert.depth > frags[j-1].depth   {     frags[j] = frags[j-1];     j--;   }   frags[j] = toInsert; }  Finally, we blend the fragments "manually", and send the result to the output variable:     Traverse the array, and blend the colors. vec4 color = vec4 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0 ;     Background color for  int i = 0; i < count; i++   {    color = mix  color, frags[i].color, frags[i].color.a ; }       Output the final color FragColor = color;  How it works... To clear our buffers, prior to the first pass, we bind clearBuf to the GL_PIXEL_UNPACK_ BUFFER binding point, and call glTexSubImage2D to copy data from clearBuf to the the  head pointer texture.  Note that when a non-zero buffer is bound to GL_PIXEL_UNPACK_ BUFFER, glTexSubImage2D treats the last parameter as an offset into the buffer that is  bound there. Therefore, this will initiate a copy from clearBuf into headPtrTex. Clearing the  atomic counter is straightforward, but the use of glBindBufferBase may be a bit confusing.  If there can be several buffers bound to the binding point  at different indices , then how does  glBufferSubData know which buffer to target? It turns out that when we bind a buffer using  glBindBufferBase, it is also bound to the "generic" binding point as well.  210   In the fragment shader during the first pass, we start with the layout specification enabling the  early fragment test optimization.  layout  early_fragment_tests  in;  This is important because if any fragments are obscured by the opaque geometry, we don't  want to add them to a linked list. If the early fragment test optimization is not enabled, the  fragment shader may be executed for fragments that will fail the depth test, and hence will  get added to the linked list. The previous statement ensures that the fragment shader will not  execute for those fragments.  The definition of struct NodeType specifies the type of data that is stored in our linked list  buffer. We need to store color, depth, and a pointer to the next node in the linked list.  The next three statements declare the objects related to our linked list storage. The first,  headPointers, is the image object that stores the locations of the heads of each linked  list. The layout qualifier indicates that it is located at image unit 0  refer to the Getting ready  section of this recipe , and the data type is r32ui  red, 32-bit, unsigned integer . The second  object is our atomic counter nextNodeCounter. The layout qualifier indicates the index  within the GL_ATOMIC_COUTER_BUFFER binding point  refer to the Getting ready section  of this recipe , and the offset within the buffer at that location. Since we only have a single  value in the buffer, the offset is 0, but in general, you might have several atomic counters  located within a single buffer. Third is our linked-list storage buffer linkedLists. This is a  shader storage buffer object. The organization of the data within the object is defined within  the curly braces here. In this case, we just have an array of NodeType structures. The bounds  of the array can be left undefined, the size being limited by the underlying buffer object that  we created. The layout qualifiers define the binding and memory layout. The first, binding,  indicates that the buffer is located at index 0 within the GL_SHADER_STORAGE_BUFFER  binding point. The second, std430, indicates how memory is organized within the buffer. This  is mainly important when we want to read the data back from the OpenGL side. As mentioned  previously, this is documented in the OpenGL specification document.  The first step in the fragment shader during the first pass is to increment our atomic counter  using atomicCounterIncrement. This will increment the counter in such a way that there  is no possibility of memory consistency issues if another shader instance is attempting to  increment the counter at the same time.  An atomic operation is one that is isolated from other threads  and can be considered to be a single, uninterruptable  operation. Other threads cannot interleave with an atomic  operation. It is always a good idea to use atomic operations  when writing to shared data within a shader.  211   The return value of atomicCounterIncrement is the previous value of the counter. It is  the next unused location in our linked list buffer. We'll use this value as the location where  we'll store this fragment, so we store it in a variable named nodeIdx. It will also become the  new head of the linked list, so the next step is to update the value in the headPointers  image at this pixel's location gl_FragCoord.xy. We do so using another atomic operation:  imageAtomicExchange. This replaces the value within the image at the location specified  by the second parameter with the value of the third parameter. The return value is the  previous value of the image at that location. This is the previous head of our linked list. We  hold on to this value in prevHead, because we want to link our new head to that node,  thereby restoring the consistency of the linked list with our new node at the head.  Finally, we update the node at nodeIdx with the color and depth of the fragment, and set the  next value to the previous head of the list  prevHead . This completes the insertion of this  fragment into the linked list at the head of the list.  After the first pass is complete, we need to make sure that all changes are written to our shader  storage buffer and image object before proceeding. The only way to guarantee this is to use a  memory barrier. The call to glMemoryBarrier will take care of this for us. The parameter to  glMemoryBarrier is the type of barrier. We can "fine tune" the type of barrier to specifically  target the kind of data that we want to read. However, just to be safe, and for simplicity, we'll use  GL_ALL_BARRIER_BITS, which ensures that all possible data has been written.  In the second pass, we start by copying the linked list for the fragment into a temporary array.  We start by getting the location of the head of the list from the headPointers image using  imageLoad. Then we traverse the linked list with the while loop, copying the data into the  array frags.  Next, we sort the array by depth from largest to smallest, using the insertion sort algorithm.  Insertion sort works well on small arrays, so should be a fairly efficient choice here.  Finally, we combine all the fragments in order, using the mix function to blend them together  based on the value of the alpha channel. The final result is stored in the output variable  FragColor.  There's more... As mentioned previously, we've skipped anything that deals with opaque geometry. In  general, one would probably want to render any opaque geometry first, with the depth buffer  enabled, and store the rendered fragments in a texture. Then, when rendering the transparent  geometry, one would disable writing to the depth buffer, and build the linked list as shown  previously. Finally, you could use the value of the opaque texture as the background color  when blending the linked lists.  212   This is the first example in this book that makes use of reading and writing from to arbitrary   shared  storage from a shader. This capability, only recently introduced, has given us much  more flexibility, but that comes at a price. As indicated previously, we have to be very careful to  avoid memory consistency and coherence issues. The tools to do so include atomic operations  and memory barriers, and this example has just scratched the surface. There's much more  to come in Chapter 10, Using Compute Shaders when we look at compute shaders, and I  recommend you read through the memory chapter in the OpenGL Programming Guide for  much more detail than I can provide here.  See also   f Chapter 10, Using Compute Shaders  f OpenGL Development Cookbook by Muhammad Mobeen Movania has several   recipes in Chapter 6, GPU-based Alpha Blending and Global Illumination.  213    6  Using Geometry and  Tessellation Shaders  In this chapter, we will cover:   f Point sprites with the geometry shader  f Drawing a wireframe on top of a shaded mesh  f Drawing silhouette lines using the geometry shader  f Tessellating a curve  f Tessellating a 2D quad  f Tessellating a 3D surface  f Tessellating based on depth  Introduction Tessellation and geometry shaders are relatively new additions to the OpenGL pipeline, and  provide programmers with additional ways to modify geometry as it progresses through the  shader pipeline. Geometry shaders can be used to add, modify, or delete geometry, and  tessellation shaders can be configured to automatically generate geometry at various levels of  detail and to facilitate interpolation based on arbitrary input  patches .  In this chapter, we'll look at several examples of geometry and tessellation shaders in various  contexts. However, before we get into the recipes, let's investigate how all of this fits together.   The shader pipeline extended The following diagram shows a simplified view of the shader pipeline when the shader  program includes geometry and tessellation shaders:  The tessellation portion of the shader pipeline includes two stages: the tessellation control  shader  TCS , and the tessellation evaluation shader  TES . The geometry shader follows the  tessellation stages and precedes the fragment shader. The tessellation shader and geometry  shader are optional; however, when a shader program includes a tessellation or geometry  shader, a vertex shader must be included.  Other than the preceding requirement, all shaders are optional.  However, when a shader program does not include a vertex or  fragment shader, the results are undefined. When using a geometry  shader, there is no requirement that you also include a tessellation  shader and vice versa. It is rare to have a shader program that does  not include at least a fragment shader and a vertex shader.  The geometry shader The geometry shader  GS  is designed to execute once for each primitive. It has access to all  of the vertices of the primitive, as well as the values of any input variables associated with  each vertex. In other words, if a previous stage  such as the vertex shader  provides an output  variable, the geometry shader has access to the value of that variable for all vertices in the  primitive. As a result, the input variables within the geometry shader are always arrays.  216   The geometry shader can output zero, one, or more primitives. Those primitives need not  be of the same kind that were received by the geometry shader. However, the GS can only  output one primitive type. For example, a GS could receive a triangle, and output several line  segments as a line strip. Or a GS could receive a triangle and output zero or many triangles as  a triangle strip.  This enables the GS to act in many different ways. A GS could be responsible for culling   removing  geometry based on some criteria, such as visibility based on occlusions. It could  generate additional geometry to augment the shape of the object being rendered. The GS  could simply compute additional information about the primitive and pass the primitive   along unchanged. Or the GS could produce primitives that are entirely different from the   input geometry.  The functionality of the GS is centered around the two built-in functions, EmitVertex and  EndPrimitive. These two functions allow the GS to send multiple vertices and primitives  down the pipeline. The GS defines the output variables for a particular vertex, and then calls  EmitVertex. After that, the GS can proceed to re-define the output variables for the next  vertex, call EmitVertex again, and so on. After emitting all of the vertices for the primitive,  the GS can call EndPrimitive to let the OpenGL system know that all the vertices of the  primitive have been emitted. The EndPrimitive function is implicitly called when the  GS finishes execution. If a GS does not call EmitVertex at all, then the input primitive is  effectively dropped  it is not rendered .  In the following recipes, we'll examine a few examples of the geometry shader. In the Point  sprites with the geometry shader recipe, we'll see an example where the input primitive type  is entirely different than the output type. In the Drawing a wireframe on top of a shaded  mesh recipe, we'll pass the geometry along unchanged, but also produce some additional  information about the primitive to help in drawing wireframe lines. In the Drawing silhouette  lines using the geometry shader recipe, we'll see an example where the GS passes along the  input primitive, but generates additional primitives as well.  The tessellation shaders When the tessellation shaders are active, we can only render one kind of primitive: the  patch  GL_PATCHES . Rendering any other kind of primitive  such as triangles, or lines   while a tessellation shader is active is an error. The patch primitive is an arbitrary "chunk"  of geometry  or any information  that is completely defined by the programmer. It has no  geometrical interpretation beyond how it is interpreted within the TCS and TES. The number of  vertices within the patch primitive is also configurable. The maximum number of vertices per  patch is implementation dependent, and can be queried via the following command:  glGetIntegerv GL_MAX_PATCH_VERTICES, &maxVerts ;  We can define the number of vertices per patch with the following function:  glPatchParameteri  GL_PATCH_VERTICES, numPatchVerts  ;  217   A very common application of this is when the patch primitive consists of a set of control  points that define an interpolated surface or curve  such as a Bezier curve or surface .  However, there is no reason why the information within the patch primitive couldn't be used  for other purposes.  The patch primitive is never actually rendered, instead, it is used as additional information  for the TCS and TES. The primitives that actually make their way further down the pipeline  are created by the tessellation primitive generator  TPG , which lies between the TCS and  the TES. Think of the tessellation primitive generator as a configurable engine that produces  primitives based on a set of standard tessellation algorithms. The TCS and the TES have  access to the entire input patch, but have fundamentally different responsibilities. The TCS  is responsible for setting up the TPG, defining how the primitives should be generated by the  TPG  how many and what algorithm to use , and producing per-vertex output attributes. The  TES has the job of determining the position  and any other information  of each vertex of the  primitives that are produced by the TPG. For example, the TCS might tell the TPG to generate  a line strip consisting of 100 line segments, and the TES is responsible for determining the  position of each vertex of those 100 line segments. The TES would likely make use of the  information within the entire patch primitive in order to do so.  The TCS is executed once for each vertex in the output patch  specified in the TCS code . It  can compute additional information about the patch and pass it along to the TES using output  variables. However, the most important task of the TCS is to tell the TPG how many primitives  it should produce. It does this by defining tessellation levels via the gl_TessLevelInner  and gl_TessLevelOuter arrays. These arrays define the granularity of the tessellation  produced by the TPG.  The TPG generates primitives based on a particular algorithm  quads, isolines, or triangles .  Each algorithm produces primitives in a slightly different fashion, and we will see examples  of isolines and quads in the recipes in this chapter. Each vertex of the generated primitives  is associated with a position in parameter space  u, v, w . Each coordinate of this position is  a number that can range from zero to one. This coordinate can be used for evaluating the  location of the vertex, often by interpolation of the patch primitive's vertices. The primitive  generation algorithms produce vertices  and the associated parametric coordinates  in a  slightly different fashion. The tessellation algorithms for quads and isolines make use of only  the first two parametric coordinates: u and v. The following diagram illustrates the process for  an input and output patch consisting of four vertices. In the diagram, the TPG uses the quad  tessellation algorithm with inner and outer tessellation levels set at four.  218   The number of vertices in the input patch need not be the same  as the number of vertices in the output patch, although that will  be the case in all of the examples in this chapter.  The TES is executed once for each parameter-space vertex that is generated by the TPG.  Somewhat strangely, the TES is actually the shader that defines the algorithm used by the TPG.  It does so via its input layout qualifier. As stated above, its main responsibility is to determine  the position of the vertex  possibly along with other information, such as normal vector and  texture coordinate . Typically, the TES uses the parametric coordinate  u,v  provided by the TPG  along with the positions of all of the input patch vertices to do so. For example, when drawing  a curve, the patch might consist of four vertices, which are the control points for the curve.  The TPG would then generate 101 vertices to create a line strip  if the tessellation level was  set to 100 , and each vertex might have a u coordinate that ranged appropriately between zero  and one. The TES would then use that u coordinate along with the positions of the four patch  vertices to determine the position of the vertex associated with the shader's execution.   If all of this seems confusing, start with the Tessellating a curve recipe, and work your way  through the following recipes.  In the Tessellating a curve recipe, we'll go through a basic example where we use tessellation  shaders to draw a Bezier curve with four control points. In the Tessellating a 2D quad recipe,  we'll try to understand how the quad tessellation algorithm works by rendering a simple quad  and visualizing the triangles produced by the TPG. In the Tessellating a 3D surface recipe,  we'll use quad tessellation to render a 3D Bezier surface. Finally, in the Tessellating based on  depth recipe, we'll see how the tessellation shaders make it easy to implement level-of-detail   LOD  algorithms.  219   Point sprites with the geometry shader Point sprites are simple quads  usually texture mapped  that are aligned such that they are  always facing the camera. They are very useful for particle systems in 3D  refer to Chapter 9,  Particles Systems and Animation  or 2D games. The point sprites are specified by the OpenGL  application as single point primitives, via the GL_POINTS rendering mode. This simplifies the  process, because the quad itself and the texture coordinates for the quad are determined  automatically. The OpenGL side of the application can effectively treat them as point  primitives, avoiding the need to compute the positions of the quad vertices.  The following screenshot shows a group of point sprites. Each sprite is rendered as a point  primitive. The quad and texture coordinates are generated automatically  within the geometry  shader  and aligned to face the camera.  OpenGL already has built-in support for point sprites in the GL_POINTS rendering mode.  When rendering point primitives using this mode, the points are rendered as screen-space  squares that have a diameter  side length  as defined by the glPointSize function. In  addition, OpenGL will automatically generate texture coordinates for the fragments of   the square. These coordinates run from zero to one in each direction  left-to-right for s,  bottom-to-top for t , and are accessible in the fragment shader via the gl_PointCoord   built-in variable.  220   There are various ways to fine-tune the rendering of point sprites within OpenGL. One can define  the origin of the automatically generated texture coordinates using the glPointParameter  functions. The same set of functions also can be used to tweak the way that OpenGL defines the  alpha value for points when multisampling is enabled.  The built-in support for point sprites does not allow the programmer to rotate the screen-space  squares, or define them as different shapes such as rectangles or triangles. However, one  can achieve similar effects with creative use of textures and transformations of the texture  coordinates. For example, we could transform the texture coordinates using a rotation matrix to  create the look of a rotating object even though the geometry itself is not actually rotating. In  addition, the size of the point sprite is a screen-space size. In other words, the point size must  be adjusted with the depth of the point sprite if we want to get a perspective effect  sprites get  smaller with distance .  If these  and possibly other  issues make the default support for point sprites too limiting,   we can use the geometry shader to generate our point sprites. In fact, this technique is a   good example of using the geometry shader to generate different kinds of primitives than   it receives. The basic idea here is that the geometry shader will receive point primitives    in camera coordinates  and will output a quad centered at the point and aligned so that   it is facing the camera. The geometry shader will also automatically generate texture  coordinates for the quad.  If desired, we could generate other shapes such as hexagons, or we could rotate the quads  before they are output from the geometry shader. The possibilities are endless. Implementing  the primitive generation within the geometry shader gives us a great deal of flexibility, but  possibly at the cost of some efficiency. The default OpenGL support for point sprites is highly  optimized and is likely to be faster in general.  Before jumping directly into the code, let's take a look at some of the mathematics. In the  geometry shader, we'll need to generate the vertices of a quad that is centered at a point  and aligned with the camera's coordinate system  eye coordinates . Given the point location   P  in camera coordinates, we can generate the vertices of the corners of the quad by simply  translating P in a plane parallel to the x-y plane of the camera's coordinate system as shown  in the following figure:  221   The geometry shader will receive the point location in camera coordinates, and output the  quad as a triangle strip with texture coordinates. The fragment shader will then just apply the  texture to the quad.  Getting ready For this example, we'll need to render a number of point primitives. The positions can be sent  via attribute location 0. There's no need to provide normal vectors or texture coordinates for  this one.  The following uniform variables are defined within the shaders, and need to be set within the  OpenGL program:   f Size2: This should be half the width of the sprite's square  f SpriteTex: This is the texture unit containing the point sprite texture  As usual, uniforms for the standard transformation matrices are also defined within the  shaders, and need to be set within the OpenGL program.  How to do it... To create a shader program that can be used to render point primitives as quads, use the  following steps:  1.  Use the following code for the vertex shader:  layout  location = 0  in vec3 VertexPosition;  uniform mat4 ModelViewMatrix; uniform mat3 NormalMatrix; uniform mat4 ProjectionMatrix;  void main   {     gl_Position = ModelViewMatrix *                    vec4 VertexPosition,1.0 ; }  2.  Use the following code for the geometry shader:  layout  points   in; layout  triangle_strip, max_vertices = 4   out;  uniform float Size2;      Half the width of the quad  222   uniform mat4 ProjectionMatrix;  out vec2 TexCoord;  void main   {     mat4 m = ProjectionMatrix;     Reassign for brevity      gl_Position = m *  vec4 -Size2,-Size2,0.0,0.0  +                         gl_in[0].gl_Position ;     TexCoord = vec2 0.0,0.0 ;     EmitVertex  ;      gl_Position = m *  vec4 Size2,-Size2,0.0,0.0  +                         gl_in[0].gl_Position ;     TexCoord = vec2 1.0,0.0 ;     EmitVertex  ;      gl_Position = m *  vec4 -Size2,Size2,0.0,0.0  +                         gl_in[0].gl_Position ;     TexCoord = vec2 0.0,1.0 ;     EmitVertex  ;      gl_Position = m *  vec4 Size2,Size2,0.0,0.0  +                         gl_in[0].gl_Position ;     TexCoord = vec2 1.0,1.0 ;     EmitVertex  ;      EndPrimitive  ; }  3.  Use the following code for the fragment shader:  in vec2 TexCoord;     From the geometry shader  uniform sampler2D SpriteTex;  layout  location = 0   out vec4 FragColor;  void main   {     FragColor = texture SpriteTex, TexCoord ; }  4.  Within the OpenGL render function, render a set of point primitives.  223   How it works... The vertex shader is almost as simple as it can get. It converts the point's position to camera  coordinates by multiplying by the model-view matrix, and assigns the result to the built-in  output variable gl_Position.  In the geometry shader, we start by defining the kind of primitive that this geometry shader  expects to receive. The first layout statement indicates that this geometry shader will receive  point primitives.  layout  points   in;  The next layout statement indicates the kind of primitives produced by this geometry shader,  and the maximum number of vertices that will be output.  layout  triangle_strip, max_vertices = 4   out;  In this case, we want to produce a single quad for each point received, so we indicate that the  output will be a triangle strip with a maximum of four vertices.  The input primitive is available to the geometry shader via the built-in input variable gl_in.  Note that it is an array of structures. You might be wondering why this is an array since a point  primitive is only defined by a single position. Well, in general the geometry shader can receive  triangles, lines, or points  and possibly adjacency information . So, the number of values  available may be more than one. If the input were triangles, the geometry shader would have  access to three input values  associated with each vertex . In fact, it could have access to as  many as six values when triangles_adjacency is used  more on that in a later recipe .  The gl_in variable is an array of structs. Each struct contains  the following fields: gl_Position, gl_PointSize, and  gl_ClipDistance[]. In this example, we are only interested  in gl_Position. However, the others can be set in the vertex  shader to provide additional information to the geometry shader.  Within the main function of the geometry shader, we produce the quad  as a triangle strip  in  the following way. For each vertex of the triangle strip we execute the following steps:  1.  Compute the attributes for the vertex  in this case the position and texture   coordinate , and assign their values to the appropriate output variables    gl_Position and TexCoord . Note that the position is also transformed   by the projection matrix. We do this because the variable gl_Position must   be provided in clip coordinates to later stages of the pipeline.  2.  Emit the vertex  send it down the pipeline  by calling the built-in function   EmitVertex  .  224   Once we have emitted all vertices for the output primitive, we call EndPrimitive   to  finalize the primitive and send it along.  It is not strictly necessary to call EndPrimitive   in this case  because it is implicitly called when the geometry shader finishes.  However, like closing files, it is good practice to do so anyway.  The fragment shader is also very simple. It just applies the texture to the fragment using the   interpolated  texture coordinate provided by the geometry shader.  There's more... This example is fairly straightforward and is intended as a gentle introduction to geometry  shaders. We could expand on this by allowing the quad to rotate or to be oriented in different  directions. We could also use the texture to discard fragments  in the fragment shader  in  order to create point sprites of arbitrary shapes. The power of the geometry shader opens up  plenty of possibilities!  Drawing a wireframe on top of a shaded  mesh The preceding recipe demonstrated the use of a geometry shader to produce a different  variety of primitive than it received. Geometry shaders can also be used to provide additional  information to later stages. They are quite well suited to do so because they have access to all  of the vertices of the primitive at once, and can do computations based on the entire primitive  rather than a single vertex.  This example involves a geometry shader that does not modify the triangle at all. It essentially  passes the primitive along unchanged. However, it computes additional information about the  triangle that will be used by the fragment shader to highlight the edges of the polygon. The  basic idea here is to draw the edges of each polygon directly on top of the shaded mesh.  225   The following figure shows an example of this technique. The mesh edges are drawn on top of  the shaded surface by using information computed within the geometry shader.  There are many techniques for producing wireframe structures on top of shaded surfaces.  This technique comes from an NVIDIA whitepaper published in 2007. We make use of the  geometry shader to produce the wireframe and shaded surface in a single pass. We also  provide some simple anti-aliasing of the mesh lines that are produced, and the results are  quite nice  refer to the preceding figure .  To render the wireframe on top of the shaded mesh, we'll compute the distance from each  fragment to the nearest triangle edge. When the fragment is within a certain distance from  the edge, it will be shaded and mixed with the edge color. Otherwise, the fragment will be  shaded normally.  226   To compute the distance from a fragment to the edge, we use the following technique. In   the geometry shader, we compute the minimum distance from each vertex to the opposite  edge  also called the triangle altitude . In the following figure, the desired distances are   ha, hb, and hc.  We can compute these altitudes using the interior angles of the triangle, which can be  determined using the law of cosines. For example, to find ha, we use the interior angle at  vertex C  β .  The other altitudes can be computed in a similar way.  Note that β could be greater than 90  degrees, in which case, we would want the sine of 180-β. However, the sine of 180-β is the  same as the sine of β.   227   Once we have computed these triangle altitudes, we can create an output vector  an  "edge-distance" vector  within the geometry shader for interpolation across the triangle.  The components of this vector represent the distances from the fragment to each edge of  the triangle. The x component represents the distance from edge a, the y component is  the distance from edge b, and the z component is the distance from edge c. If we assign  the correct values to these components at the vertices, the hardware will automatically  interpolate them for us to provide the appropriate distances at each fragment. At vertex A the  value of this vector should be  ha, 0, 0  because the vertex A is at a distance of ha from edge  a and directly on edges b and c. Similarly, the value for vertex B is  0, hb, 0  and for vertex C  is  0, 0, hc . When these three values are interpolated across the triangle, we should have the  distance from the fragment to each of the three edges.  We will calculate all of this in screen space. That is, we'll transform the vertices to screen space  within the geometry shader before computing the altitudes. Since we are working in screen  space, there's no need  and it would be incorrect  to interpolate the values in a perspective  correct manner. So we need to be careful to tell the hardware to interpolate linearly.  Within the fragment shader, all we need to do is find the minimum of the three distances,  and if that distance is less than the line width, we mix the fragment color with the line color.  However, we'd also like to apply a bit of anti-aliasing while we're at it. To do so, we'll fade the  edge of the line using the GLSL smoothstep function.  We'll scale the intensity of the line in a two-pixel range around the edge of the line. Pixels that  are at a distance of one or less from the true edge of the line get 100 percent of the line color,  and pixels that are at a distance of one or more from the edge of the line get zero percent of  the line color. In between, we'll use the smoothstep function to create a smooth transition.  Of course, the edge of the line itself is a configurable distance  we'll call it Line.Width  from  the edge of the polygon.  Getting ready The typical setup is needed for this example. The vertex position and normal should be  provided in attributes zero and one respectively, and you need to provide the appropriate  parameters for your shading model. As usual, the standard matrices are defined as uniform  variables and should be set within the OpenGL application. However, note that this time we  also need the viewport matrix  uniform variable ViewportMatrix  in order to transform into  screen space.  There are a few uniforms related to the mesh lines that need to be set:   f Line.Width: This should be half the width of the mesh lines  f Line.Color: This is the color of the mesh lines  228   How to do it... To create a shader program that utilizes the geometry shader to produce a wireframe on top  of a shaded surface, use the following steps:  1.  Use the following code for the vertex shader:  layout  location = 0   in vec3 VertexPosition; layout  location = 1   in vec3 VertexNormal;  out vec3 VNormal; out vec3 VPosition;  uniform mat4 ModelViewMatrix; uniform mat3 NormalMatrix; uniform mat4 ProjectionMatrix; uniform mat4 MVP;  void main   {     VNormal = normalize  NormalMatrix * VertexNormal ;     VPosition = vec3 ModelViewMatrix *                       vec4 VertexPosition,1.0  ;     gl_Position = MVP * vec4 VertexPosition,1.0 ; }  2.  Use the following code for the geometry shader:  layout  triangles   in; layout  triangle_strip, max_vertices = 3   out;  out vec3 GNormal; out vec3 GPosition; noperspective out vec3 GEdgeDistance;  in vec3 VNormal[]; in vec3 VPosition[];  uniform mat4 ViewportMatrix;     Viewport matrix  void main   {        Transform each vertex into viewport space     vec3 p0 = vec3 ViewportMatrix *  gl_in[0].gl_Position                                 gl_in[0].gl_Position.w  ;     vec3 p1 = vec3 ViewportMatrix *  gl_in[1].gl_Position                                 gl_in[1].gl_Position.w  ;  229       vec3 p2 = vec3 ViewportMatrix *  gl_in[2].gl_Position                                gl_in[2].gl_Position.w  ;         Find the altitudes  ha, hb and hc      float a = length p1 - p2 ;     float b = length p2 - p0 ;     float c = length p1 - p0 ;     float alpha = acos   b*b + c*c - a*a     2.0*b*c   ;     float beta = acos   a*a + c*c - b*b     2.0*a*c   ;     float ha = abs  c * sin  beta    ;     float hb = abs  c * sin  alpha    ;     float hc = abs  b * sin  alpha    ;         Send the triangle along with the edge distances     GEdgeDistance = vec3  ha, 0, 0  ;     GNormal = VNormal[0];     GPosition = VPosition[0];     gl_Position = gl_in[0].gl_Position;     EmitVertex  ;      GEdgeDistance = vec3  0, hb, 0  ;     GNormal = VNormal[1];     GPosition = VPosition[1];     gl_Position = gl_in[1].gl_Position;     EmitVertex  ;      GEdgeDistance = vec3  0, 0, hc  ;     GNormal = VNormal[2];     GPosition = VPosition[2];     gl_Position = gl_in[2].gl_Position;     EmitVertex  ;      EndPrimitive  ; }  3.  Use the following code for the fragment shader:     *** Insert appropriate uniforms for the Phong model ***     The mesh line settings uniform struct LineInfo {   float Width;   vec4 Color; } Line;  in vec3 GPosition;  230   in vec3 GNormal; noperspective in vec3 GEdgeDistance;  layout  location = 0   out vec4 FragColor; vec3 phongModel  vec3 pos, vec3 norm   {       *** Phong model evaluation code goes here *** }  void main   {         The shaded surface color.     vec4 color=vec4 phongModel GPosition, GNormal , 1.0 ;         Find the smallest distance     float d = min  GEdgeDistance.x, GEdgeDistance.y  ;     d = min  d, GEdgeDistance.z  ;         Determine the mix factor with the line color     float mixVal = smoothstep  Line.Width – 1,                                Line.Width + 1, d  ;         Mix the surface color with the line color     FragColor = mix  Line.Color, color, mixVal  ; }  How it works... The vertex shader is pretty simple. It passes the normal and position along to the geometry  shader after converting them into camera coordinates. The built-in variable gl_Position  gets the position in clip coordinates. We'll use this value in the geometry shader to determine  the screen space coordinates.  In the geometry shader, we begin by defining the input and output primitive types for this shader.  layout  triangles   in; layout  triangle_strip, max_vertices = 3   out;  We don't actually change anything about the geometry of the triangle, so the input and   output types are essentially the same. We will output exactly the same triangle that was  received as input.  231   The output variables for the geometry shader are GNormal, GPosition, and  GEdgeDistance. The first two are simply the values of the normal and position in  camera coordinates, passed through unchanged. The third is the vector that will store the  distance to each edge of the triangle  described previously . Note that it is defined with the  noperspective qualifier.  noperspective out vec3 GEdgeDistance;  The noperspective qualifier indicates that the values are to be interpolated linearly, instead  of the default perspective correct interpolation. As mentioned previously, these distances are  in screen space, so it would be incorrect to interpolate them in a non-linear fashion.  Within the main function, we start by transforming the position of each of the three vertices of  the triangle from clip coordinates to screen space coordinates by multiplying with the viewport  matrix.  Note that it is also necessary to divide by the w coordinate as the clip coordinates are  homogeneous and may need to be converted back to true Cartesian coordinates.   Next, we compute the three altitudes ha, hb, and hc using the law of cosines as   described earlier.  Once we have the three altitudes, we set GEdgeDistance appropriately for the first vertex;  pass along GNormal, GPosition, and gl_Position unchanged; and emit the first vertex  by calling EmitVertex  . This finishes the vertex and emits the vertex position and all of  the per-vertex output variables. We then proceed similarly for the other two vertices of the  triangle, finishing the polygon by calling EndPrimitive  .  In the fragment shader, we start by evaluating the basic shading model and storing  the resulting color in color. At this stage in the pipeline, the three components of the  GEdgeDistance variable should contain the distance from this fragment to each of the three  edges of the triangle. We are interested in the minimum distance, so we find the minimum  of the three components and store that in the d variable. The smoothstep function is then  used to determine how much to mix the line color with the shaded color  mixVal .  float mixVal = smoothstep  Line.Width – 1,                            Line.Width + 1, d  ;  If the distance is less than Line.Width – 1, then smoothstep will return a value of 0, and  if it is greater than Line.Width + 1, it will return 1. For values of d that are in between the  two, we'll get a smooth transition. This gives us a value of 0 when inside the line, a value of 1  when outside the line, and in a two pixel area around the edge, we'll get a smooth variation  between 0 and 1. Therefore, we can use the result directly to mix the color with the line color.  Finally, the fragment color is determined by mixing the shaded color with the line color using  mixVal as the interpolation parameter.  232   There's more... This technique produces very nice looking results and has relatively few drawbacks. It is a  good example of how geometry shaders can be useful for tasks other than modification of  the actual geometry. In this case, we used the geometry shader simply to compute additional  information about the primitive as it was being sent down the pipeline.  This shader can be dropped in and applied to any mesh without any modification to the  OpenGL side of the application. It can be useful when debugging mesh issues or when  implementing a mesh modeling program.  Other common techniques for accomplishing this effect typically involve rendering the shaded  object and wireframe in two passes with a polygon offset  via the glPolygonOffset function   applied to avoid the "z-fighting", which takes place between the wireframe and the shaded  surface beneath. This technique is not always effective because the modified depth values  might not always be correct, or as desired, and it can be difficult to find the "sweet-spot" for  the polygon offset value. For a good survey of techniques, refer to Section 11.4.2 in Real Time  Rendering, third edition, by T Akenine-Moller, E Haines, and N Hoffman, AK Peters, 2008.

The whitepaper was listed as a Direct3D example, but of course our  implementation here is provided in OpenGL.   f The Creating shadows using shadow volumes and the geometry shader recipe in   Chapter 7, Shadows.   f The Implementing per-vertex ambient, diffuse, and specular  ADS  shading recipe in   Chapter 2, The Basics of GLSL Shaders.  Drawing silhouette lines using the   geometry shader When a cartoon or hand-drawn effect is desired, we often want to draw black outlines around  the edges of a model and along ridges or creases  silhouette lines . In this recipe, we'll discuss  one technique for doing this using the geometry shader, to produce the additional geometry  for the silhouette lines. The geometry shader will approximate these lines by generating small,  skinny quads aligned with the edges that make up the silhouette of the object.  233   The following figure shows the ogre mesh with black silhouette lines generated by the geometry  shader. The lines are made up of small quads that are aligned with certain mesh edges.  The technique shown in this recipe is based on a technique published in a recent blog post by  Philip Rideout  prideout.net blog ?p=54 . His implementation uses two passes  base  geometry and silhouette , and includes many optimizations, such as anti-aliasing and custom  depth testing  with g-buffers . To keep things simple, as our main goal is to demonstrate the  features of the geometry shader, we'll implement the technique using a single pass without  anti-aliasing or custom depth testing. If you are interested in adding these additional features,  refer to Philip's excellent blog posting.  One of the most important features of the geometry shader is that it allows us to provide  additional vertex information beyond just the primitive being rendered. When geometry  shaders were introduced into OpenGL, several additional primitive rendering modes were  also introduced. These "adjacency" modes allow additional vertex data to be associated with  each primitive. Typically, this additional information is related to the nearby primitives within a  mesh, but there is no requirement that this be the case  we could actually use the additional  information for other purposes if desired . The following list includes the adjacency modes  along with a short description:   f GL_LINES_ADJACENCY: This mode defines lines with adjacent vertices  four vertices   per line segment    f GL_LINE_STRIP_ADJACENCY: This mode defines a line strip with adjacent vertices    for n lines, there are n+3 vertices    f GL_TRIANGLES_ADJACENCY: This mode defines triangles along with vertices of   adjacent triangles  six vertices per primitive    f GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP_ADJACENCY: This mode defines a triangle strip along with   vertices of adjacent triangles  for n triangles, there are 2 n+2  vertices provided   234   For full details on each of these modes, check out the official OpenGL documentation. In  this recipe, we'll use the GL_TRIANGLES_ADJACENCY mode to provide information about  adjacent triangles in our mesh. With this mode, we provide six vertices per primitive. The  following diagram illustrates the locations of these vertices:  In the preceding diagram, the solid line represents the triangle itself, and the dotted lines  represent adjacent triangles. The first, third, and fifth vertices  0, 2, and 4  make up the  triangle itself. The second, fourth, and sixth are vertices that make up the adjacent triangles.  Mesh data is not usually provided in this form, so we need to preprocess our mesh to include  the additional vertex information. Typically, this only means expanding the element index array  by a factor of two. The position, normal, and texture coordinate arrays can remain unchanged.  When a mesh is rendered with adjacency information, the geometry shader has access to  all six vertices associated with a particular triangle. We can then use the adjacent triangles  to determine whether or not a triangle edge is part of the silhouette of the object. The  basic assumption is that an edge is a silhouette edge if the triangle is front facing and the  corresponding adjacent triangle is not front facing.  We can determine whether or not a triangle is front facing within the geometry shader by  computing the triangle's normal vector  using a cross product . If we are working within eye  coordinates  or clip coordinates , the z coordinate of the normal vector will be positive for front  facing triangles. Therefore, we only need to compute the z coordinate of the normal vector,  which should save a few cycles. For a triangle with vertices A, B, and C, the z coordinate of the  normal vector is given by the following equation:  Once we determine which edges are silhouette edges, the geometry shader will produce  additional skinny quads aligned with the silhouette edge. These quads, taken together,  will make up the desired dark lines  refer to the preceding figure . After generating all the  silhouette quads, the geometry shader will output the original triangle.  235   In order to render the mesh in a single pass with appropriate shading for the base mesh, and  no shading for the silhouette lines, we'll use an additional output variable. This variable will let  the fragment shader know when we are rendering the base mesh and when we are rendering  the silhouette edge.  Getting ready Set up your mesh data so that adjacency information is included. As just mentioned, this  probably requires expanding the element index array to include the additional information.  This can be done by passing through your mesh and looking for shared edges. Due to space  limitations, we won't go through the details here, but the blog post mentioned some time back  has some information about how this might be done. Also, the source code for this example  contains a simple  albeit not very efficient  technique.  The important uniform variables for this example are as follows:   f EdgeWidth: This is the width of the silhouette edge in clip  normalized device    coordinates   f PctExtend: This is a percentage to extend the quads beyond the edge  f LineColor: This is the color of the silhouette edge lines  As usual, there are also the appropriate uniforms for the shading model, and the   standard matrices.  How to do it... To create a shader program that utilizes the geometry shader to render silhouette edges, use  the following steps:  1.  Use the following code for the vertex shader:  layout  location = 0   in vec3 VertexPosition; layout  location = 1   in vec3 VertexNormal;  out vec3 VNormal; out vec3 VPosition;  uniform mat4 ModelViewMatrix; uniform mat3 NormalMatrix; uniform mat4 ProjectionMatrix; uniform mat4 MVP; void main   {     VNormal = normalize  NormalMatrix * VertexNormal ;  236       VPosition = vec3 ModelViewMatrix *                       vec4 VertexPosition,1.0  ;     gl_Position = MVP * vec4 VertexPosition,1.0 ; }  2.  Use the following code for the geometry shader:  layout  triangles_adjacency   in; layout  triangle_strip, max_vertices = 15   out;  out vec3 GNormal; out vec3 GPosition;     Which output primitives are silhouette edges flat out bool GIsEdge;  in vec3 VNormal[];      Normal in camera coords. in vec3 VPosition[];    Position in camera coords.  uniform float EdgeWidth;     Width of sil. edge in clip cds. uniform float PctExtend;     Percentage to extend quad  bool isFrontFacing  vec3 a, vec3 b, vec3 c   {     return   a.x * b.y - b.x * a.y  +               b.x * c.y - c.x * b.y  +              c.x * a.y - a.x * c.y   > 0; } void emitEdgeQuad  vec3 e0, vec3 e1   {     vec2 ext = PctExtend *  e1.xy - e0.xy ;     vec2 v = normalize e1.xy – e0.xy ;     vec2 n = vec2 -v.y, v.x  * EdgeWidth;         Emit the quad     GIsEdge = true;      This is part of the sil. edge      gl_Position = vec4  e0.xy - ext, e0.z, 1.0  ;      EmitVertex  ;     gl_Position = vec4  e0.xy - n - ext, e0.z, 1.0  ;      EmitVertex  ;     gl_Position = vec4  e1.xy + ext, e1.z, 1.0  ;      EmitVertex  ;     gl_Position = vec4  e1.xy - n + ext, e1.z, 1.0  ;     EmitVertex  ;  237       EndPrimitive  ; }  void main   {     vec3 p0 = gl_in[0].gl_Position.xyz                  gl_in[0].gl_Position.w;     vec3 p1 = gl_in[1].gl_Position.xyz                  gl_in[1].gl_Position.w;     vec3 p2 = gl_in[2].gl_Position.xyz                  gl_in[2].gl_Position.w;     vec3 p3 = gl_in[3].gl_Position.xyz                  gl_in[3].gl_Position.w;     vec3 p4 = gl_in[4].gl_Position.xyz                  gl_in[4].gl_Position.w;     vec3 p5 = gl_in[5].gl_Position.xyz                  gl_in[5].gl_Position.w;      if  isFrontFacing p0, p2, p4    {         if  ! isFrontFacing p0,p1,p2                         emitEdgeQuad p0,p2 ;         if  ! isFrontFacing p2,p3,p4                         emitEdgeQuad p2,p4 ;         if  ! isFrontFacing p4,p5,p0                         emitEdgeQuad p4,p0 ;     }      GNormal = VNormal[0];     GPosition = VPosition[0];     gl_Position = gl_in[0].gl_Position;     EmitVertex  ;     GNormal = VNormal[2];     GPosition = VPosition[2];     gl_Position = gl_in[2].gl_Position;     EmitVertex  ;      GNormal = VNormal[4];     GPosition = VPosition[4];     gl_Position = gl_in[4].gl_Position;     EmitVertex  ;      EndPrimitive  ; }  238         Output the original triangle     GIsEdge = false;    Triangle is not part of an edge.   3.  Use the following code for the fragment shader:    *** Light and material uniforms go here ****  uniform vec4 LineColor;     The sil. edge color  in vec3 GPosition;     Position in camera coords in vec3 GNormal;       Normal in camera coords.  flat in bool GIsEdge;    Whether or not we're drawing an edge  layout  location = 0   out vec4 FragColor;  vec3 toonShade    {       *** toon shading algorithm from Chapter 3 *** }  void main    {        If we're drawing an edge, use constant color,         otherwise, shade the poly.     if  GIsEdge   {         FragColor = LineColor;     } else {         FragColor = vec4  toonShade  , 1.0  ;     }  }  How it works... The vertex shader is a simple "pass-through" shader. It converts the vertex position and  normal to camera coordinates and sends them along, via VPosition and VNormal. These  will be used for shading within the fragment shader and will be passed along  or ignored  by  the geometry shader. The position is also converted to clip coordinates  or normalized device  coordinates  by transforming with the model-view projection matrix, and it is then assigned to  the built-in gl_Position.  The geometry shader begins by defining the input and output primitive types using the   layout directive.  layout  triangles_adjacency   in; layout  triangle_strip, max_vertices = 15   out;  This indicates that the input primitive type is triangles with adjacency information, and the  output type is triangle strips. This geometry shader will produce a single triangle  the original  triangle  and at most one quad for each edge. This corresponds to a maximum of 15 vertices  that could be produced, and we indicate that maximum within the output layout directive.  239   The output variable GIsEdge is used to indicate to the fragment shader whether or not the  polygon is an edge quad. The fragment shader will use this value to determine whether or  not to shade the polygon. There is no need to interpolate the value and since it is a Boolean,  interpolation doesn't quite make sense, so we use the flat qualifier.  The first few lines within the main function take the position for each of the six vertices  in clip  coordinates  and divides it by the fourth coordinate in order to convert from its homogeneous  representation to the true Cartesian value. This is necessary if we are using a perspective  projection, but is not necessary for orthographic projections.  Next, we determine whether the main triangle  defined by points 0, 2, and 4  is front facing.  The function isFrontFacing, returns whether or not the triangle defined by its three  parameters is front facing using the equation described previously. If the main triangle is front  facing, then we will emit a silhouette edge quad only if the adjacent triangle is not front facing.  The function emitEdgeQuad produces a quad that is aligned with an edge defined by the  points e0 and e1. It begins by computing ext, which is the vector from e0 to e1, scaled by  PctExtend  in order to slightly lengthen the edge quad . We lengthen the edge quad in order  to cover gaps that may appear between quads  we'll discuss this further in There's more… .  Note also that we drop the z coordinate here. As the points are defined in clip coordinates, and  we are going to produce a quad that is aligned with the x-y plane  facing the camera , we want to  compute the positions of the vertices by translating within the x-y plane. Therefore we can ignore  the z coordinate for now. We'll use its value unchanged in the final position of each vertex.  Next, the variable v is assigned to the normalized vector from e0 to e1. The variable n gets  a vector that is perpendicular to v  in 2D this can be achieved by swapping the x and y  coordinates and negating the new x coordinate . This is just a counter-clockwise 90 degree  rotation in 2D. We scale the vector n by EdgeWidth because we want the length of the vector  to be the same as the width of the quad. The two vectors ext and n will be used to determine  the vertices of the quad as shown in the following figure:  240   The four corners of the quad are given by: e0 – ext, e0 – n – ext, e1 + ext, and e1 –n + ext.  The z coordinate for the lower two vertices is the same as the z coordinate for e0, and the z  coordinate for the upper two vertices is the z coordinate for e1.  We then finish up the emitEdgeQuad function by setting GIsEdge to true in order to let  the fragment shader know that we are rendering a silhouette edge, and then emitting the  four vertices of the quad. The function ends with a call to EndPrimitive to terminate the  processing of the triangle strip for the quad.  Back within the main function, after producing the silhouette edges, we proceed by emitting  the original triangle unchanged. VNormal, VPosition, and gl_Position for vertices 0,  2, and 4 are passed along without any modification to the fragment shader. Each vertex is  emitted with a call to EmitVertex, and the primitive is completed with EndPrimitive.  Within the fragment shader we either shade the fragment  using the toon shading algorithm ,  or simply give the fragment a constant color. The GIsEdge input variable will indicate which  option to choose. If GIsEdge is true, then we are rendering a silhouette edge so the fragment  is given the line color. Otherwise, we are rendering a mesh polygon, so we shade the fragment  using the toon shading technique from Chapter 3, Lighting, Shading Effects, and Optimizations.  There's more... One of the problems with the preceding technique is that "feathering" can occur due to the  gaps between consecutive edge quads.  The preceding figure shows the feathering of a silhouette edge. The gaps between the  polygons can be filled with triangles, but in our example, we simply extend the length of each  quad to fill in the gap. This can, of course, cause artifacts if the quads are extended too far,  but in practice they haven't been very distracting in my experience.  241   A second issue is related to depth testing. If an edge polygon extends into another area of the  mesh, it can be clipped due to the depth test. The following is an example:  The edge polygon should extend vertically throughout the middle of the preceding figure, but  is clipped because it falls behind the part of the mesh that is nearby. This issue can be solved  by using custom depth testing when rendering the silhouette edges. Refer to the blog post  mentioned earlier for details on this technique. It may also be possible to turn depth testing  off when rendering the edges, being careful not to render any edges from the opposite side   of the model.

A Bezier curve is a parametric curve defined by four control points. The control points  define the overall shape of the curve. The first and last of the four points define the start and  end of the curve, and the middle points guide the shape of the curve, but do not necessarily  lie directly on the curve itself. The curve is defined by interpolating the four control points  using a set of blending functions. The blending functions define how much each control point  contributes to the curve for a given position along the curve. For Bezier curves, the blending  functions are known as the Bernstein polynomials.  In the preceding equation, the first term is the binomial coefficient function  shown in the  following equation , n is the degree of the polynomial, i is the polynomial number, and t is   the parametric parameter.  The general parametric form for the Bezier curve is then given as a sum of the products of the  Bernstein polynomials with the control points  Pi .  In this example, we will draw a cubic Bezier curve, which involves four control points  n = 3 .  And the cubic Bernstein polynomials are:  243   As stated in the introduction of this chapter, the tessellation functionality within OpenGL  involves two shader stages. They are the tessellation control shader  TCS  and the tessellation  evaluation shader  TES . In this example, we'll define the number of line segments for our  Bezier curve within the TCS  by defining the outer tessellation levels , and evaluate the Bezier  curve at each particular vertex location within the TES. The following screenshot shows  the output of this example for three different tessellation levels. The left figure uses three  line segments  level 3 , the middle uses level 5, and the right-hand figure is created with  tessellation level 30. The small squares are the control points.  The control points for the Bezier curve are sent down the pipeline as a patch primitive  consisting of four vertices. A patch primitive is a programmer-defined primitive type. Basically,  it is a set of vertices that can be used for anything that the programmer chooses. The TCS is  executed once for each vertex within the patch, and the TES is executed, a variable number  of times, depending on the number of vertices produced by the TPG. The final output of the  tessellation stages is a set of primitives. In our case, it will be a line strip.  Part of the job for the TCS is to define the tessellation level. In very rough terms, the tessellation  level is related to the number of vertices that will be generated. In our case, the TCS will be  generating a line strip, so the tessellation level is the number of line segments in the line  strip. Each vertex that is generated for this line strip will be associated with a tessellation  coordinate that will vary between zero and one. We'll refer to this as the u coordinate, and it will  correspond to the parametric parameter t in the preceding Bezier curve equation.  What we've looked at so far is not, in fact, the whole story.  Actually, the TCS will trigger a generation of a set of line strips  called isolines. Each vertex in this set of isolines will have a u  and a v coordinate. The u coordinate will vary from zero to one  along a given isoline, and v will be constant for each isoline.  The number of distinct values of u and v is associated with two  separate tessellation levels, the so-called "outer" levels. For  this example, however, we'll only generate a single line strip, so  the second tessellation level  for v  will always be one.  244   Within the TES, the main task is to determine the position of the vertex associated with this  execution of the shader. We have access to the u and v coordinates associated with the  vertex, and we also have  read-only  access to all of the vertices of the patch. We can then  determine the appropriate position for the vertex by using the parametric equation described  above, with u as the parametric coordinate  t in the preceding equation .  Getting ready The following are the important uniform variables for this example:   f NumSegments: This is the number of line segments to be produced.  f NumStrips: This is the number of isolines to be produced. For this example, this   should be set to one.   f LineColor: This is the color for the resulting line strip.  Set the uniform variables within the main OpenGL application. There are a total of four  shaders to be compiled and linked. They are the vertex, fragment, tessellation control,   and tessellation evaluation shaders.  How to do it... To create a shader program that will generate a Bezier curve from a patch of four control  points, use the following steps:  1.  Use the following code for the simple vertex shader:  layout  location = 0   in vec2 VertexPosition;  void main   {     gl_Position = vec4 VertexPosition, 0.0, 1.0 ; }  2.  Use the following code as the tessellation control shader:  layout  vertices=4   out;  uniform int NumSegments; uniform int NumStrips;  void main   {        Pass along the vertex position unmodified     gl_out[gl_InvocationID].gl_Position =                gl_in[gl_InvocationID].gl_Position;        Define the tessellation levels     gl_TessLevelOuter[0] = float NumStrips ;  245       gl_TessLevelOuter[1] = float NumSegments ; }  3.  Use the following code as the tessellation evaluation shader:  layout  isolines   in; uniform mat4 MVP;     projection * view * model  void main   {        The tessellation u coordinate     float u = gl_TessCoord.x;         The patch vertices  control points      vec3 p0 = gl_in[0].gl_Position.xyz;     vec3 p1 = gl_in[1].gl_Position.xyz;     vec3 p2 = gl_in[2].gl_Position.xyz;     vec3 p3 = gl_in[3].gl_Position.xyz;      float u1 =  1.0 - u ;     float u2 = u * u;         Bernstein polynomials evaluated at u     float b3 = u2 * u;     float b2 = 3.0 * u2 * u1;     float b1 = 3.0 * u * u1 * u1;     float b0 = u1 * u1 * u1;         Cubic Bezier interpolation     vec3 p = p0 * b0 + p1 * b1 + p2 * b2 + p3 * b3;      gl_Position = MVP * vec4 p, 1.0 ;  }  4.  Use the following code for the fragment shader:  uniform vec4 LineColor;  layout   location = 0   out vec4 FragColor;  void main   {     FragColor = LineColor; }  5.   It is important to define the number of vertices per patch within the OpenGL  application. You can do so using the glPatchParameter function: glPatchParameteri  GL_PATCH_VERTICES, 4 ;  246   6.  Render the four control points as a patch primitive within the OpenGL application's   render function: glDrawArrays GL_PATCHES, 0, 4 ;  How it works... The vertex shader is just a "pass-through" shader. It sends the vertex position along to the next  stage without any modification.  The tessellation control shader begins by defining the number of vertices in the output patch:  layout  vertices = 4  out;  Note that this is not the same as the number of vertices that will be produced by the  tessellation process. In this case, the patch is our four control points, so we use a value of four.  The main method within the TCS passes the input position  of the patch vertex  to the output  position without modification. The arrays gl_out and gl_in contain the input and output  information associated with each vertex in the patch. Note that we assign and read from  location gl_InvocationID in these arrays. The gl_InvocationID variable defines the  output patch vertex for which this invocation of the TCS is responsible. The TCS can access   all of the array gl_in, but should only write to the location in gl_out corresponding to   gl_InvocationID.  Next, the TCS sets the tessellation levels by assigning to the gl_TessLevelOuter array.  Note that the values for gl_TessLevelOuter are floating point numbers rather than  integers. They will be rounded up to the nearest integer and clamped automatically by the  OpenGL system.  The first element in the array defines the number of isolines that will be generated. Each  isoline will have a constant value for v. In this example, the value of gl_TessLevelOuter[0]  should be one. The second defines the number of line segments that will be produced in the  line strip. Each vertex in the strip will have a value for the parametric u coordinate that will vary  from zero to one.  In the TES, we start by defining the input primitive type using a layout declaration:  layout  isolines  in;  This indicates the type of subdivision that is performed by the tessellation primitive generator.  Other possibilities here include quads and triangles.  Within the main function of the TES, the variable gl_TessCoord contains the tessellation  u and v coordinates for this invocation. As we are only tessellating in one dimension, we only  need the u coordinate, which corresponds to the x coordinate of gl_TessCoord.  247   The next step accesses the positions of the four control points  all the points in our patch  primitive . These are available in the gl_in array.  The cubic Bernstein polynomials are then evaluated at u and stored in b0, b1, b2, and b3.  Next, we compute the interpolated position using the Bezier curve equation described some  time back. The final position is converted to clip coordinates and assigned to the output  variable gl_Position.  The fragment shader simply applies LineColor to the fragment.  There's more... There's a lot more to be said about tessellation shaders, but this example is intended to be a  simple introduction so we'll leave that for the following recipes. Next, we'll look at tessellation  across surfaces in two dimensions.  Tessellating a 2D quad One of the best ways to understand OpenGL's hardware tessellation is to visualize the  tessellation of a 2D quad. When linear interpolation is used, the triangles that are produced  are directly related to the tessellation coordinates  u,v  that are produced by the tessellation  primitive generator. It can be extremely helpful to draw a few quads with different inner and  outer tessellation levels, and study the triangles produced. We will do exactly that in this recipe.  When using quad tessellation, the tessellation primitive generator subdivides  u,v  parameter  space into a number of subdivisions based on six parameters. These are the inner tessellation  levels for u and v  inner level 0 and inner level 1 , and the outer tessellation levels for u and v  along both edges  outer levels 0 to 3 . These determine the number of subdivisions along the  edges of parameter space and internally. Let's look at each of these individually:   f Outer level 0  OL0 : This is the number of subdivisions along the v direction     f Outer level 1  OL1 : This is the number of subdivisions along the u direction     f Outer level 2  OL2 : This is the number of subdivisions along the v direction     f Outer level 3  OL3 : This is the number of subdivisions along the u direction    where u = 0  where v = 0  where u = 1  where v = 1   f Inner level 0  IL0 : This is the number of subdivisions along the u direction for     f Inner level 1  IL1 : This is the number of subdivisions along the v direction for all   all internal values of v  internal values of u  248   The following diagram represents the relationship between the tessellation levels and the  areas of parameter space that are affected by each. The outer levels defines the number of  subdivisions along the edges, and the inner levels define the number of subdivisions internally.  The six tessellation levels described some time back can be configured via the arrays   gl_TessLevelOuter and gl_TessLevelInner. For example, gl_TessLevelInner[0]  corresponds to IL0, gl_TessLevelOuter[2] corresponds to OL2, and so on.  If we draw a patch primitive that consists of a single quad  four vertices , and use linear  interpolation, the triangles that result can help us to understand how OpenGL does quad  tessellation. The following diagram shows the results for various tessellation levels:  249   When we use linear interpolation, the triangles that are produced represent a visual  representation of parameter  u, v  space. The x axis corresponds to the u coordinate and the  y axis corresponds to the v coordinate. The vertices of the triangles are the  u,v  coordinates  generated by the tessellation primitive generator. The number of subdivisions can be clearly  seen in the mesh of triangles. For example, when the outer levels are set to 2 and the inner  levels are set to 8, you can see that the outer edges have two subdivisions, but within the  quad, u and v are subdivided into 8 intervals.  Before jumping into the code, let's discuss linear interpolation. If the four corners of the quad  are as shown in the following figure, then any point within the quad can be determined by  linearly interpolating the four corners with respect to parameters u and v.  We'll let the tessellation primitive generator create a set of vertices with appropriate  parametric coordinates, and we'll determine the corresponding positions by interpolating   the corners of the quad using the preceding equation.  Getting ready The outer and inner tessellation levels will be determined by the uniform variables Inner and  Outer. In order to display the triangles, we will use the geometry shader described earlier in  this chapter.  Set up your OpenGL application to render a patch primitive consisting of four vertices in  counter clockwise order as shown in the preceding figure.  How to do it... To create a shader program that will generate a set of triangles using quad tessellation from a  patch of four vertices, use the following steps:  1.  Use the following code for the vertex shader:  layout  location = 0   in vec2 VertexPosition;  void main   {     gl_Position = vec4 VertexPosition, 0.0, 1.0 ; }  250   2.  Use the following code as the tessellation control shader:  layout  vertices=4   out;  uniform int Outer; uniform int Inner; void main   {        Pass along the vertex position unmodified     gl_out[gl_InvocationID].gl_Position =                 gl_in[gl_InvocationID].gl_Position;      gl_TessLevelOuter[0] = float Outer ;     gl_TessLevelOuter[1] = float Outer ;     gl_TessLevelOuter[2] = float Outer ;     gl_TessLevelOuter[3] = float Outer ;      gl_TessLevelInner[0] = float Inner ;     gl_TessLevelInner[1] = float Inner ; }  3.  Use the following code as the tessellation evaluation shader:  layout  quads, equal_spacing, ccw   in;  uniform mat4 MVP;  void main   {     float u = gl_TessCoord.x;     float v = gl_TessCoord.y;      vec4 p0 = gl_in[0].gl_Position;     vec4 p1 = gl_in[1].gl_Position;     vec4 p2 = gl_in[2].gl_Position;     vec4 p3 = gl_in[3].gl_Position;         Linear interpolation     gl_Position =         p0 *  1-u  *  1-v  +         p1 * u *  1-v  +         p3 * v *  1-u  +         p2 * u * v;         Transform to clip coordinates     gl_Position = MVP * gl_Position; }  251   4.  Use the geometry shader from the recipe, Drawing a wireframe on top of a    shaded mesh.  5.  Use the following code as the fragment shader:  uniform float LineWidth; uniform vec4 LineColor; uniform vec4 QuadColor;  noperspective in vec3 EdgeDistance;     From geom. shader  layout   location = 0   out vec4 FragColor;  float edgeMix   {       ** insert code here to determine how much of the edge       color to include  see recipe "Drawing a wireframe on       top of a shaded mesh" .  ** }  void main   {     float mixVal = edgeMix  ;      FragColor = mix  QuadColor, LineColor, mixVal  ;  }  6.  Within the render function of your main OpenGL program, define the number of   vertices within a patch: glPatchParameteri GL_PATCH_VERTICES, 4 ;  7.  Render the patch as four 2D vertices in counter clockwise order.  How it works... The vertex shader passes the position along to the TCS unchanged.  The TCS defines the number of vertices in the patch using the layout directive:  layout  vertices=4  out;  252   In the main function, it passes along the position of the vertex without modification, and sets  the inner and outer tessellation levels. All four of the outer tessellation levels are set to the  value of Outer, and both of the inner tessellation levels are set to Inner.  In the tessellation evaluation shader, we define the tessellation mode and other tessellation  parameters with the input layout directive:  layout   quads, equal_spacing, ccw   in;  The parameter quads indicates that the tessellation primitive generator should tessellate  the parameter space using quad tessellation as described some time back. The parameter  equal_spacing says that the tessellation should be performed such that all subdivisions  have equal length. The last parameter, ccw, indicates that the primitives should be generated  with counter clockwise winding.  The main function in the TES starts by retrieving the parametric coordinates for this vertex  by accessing the variable gl_TessCoord. Then we move on to read the positions of the four  vertices in the patch from the gl_in array. We store them in temporary variables to be used  in the interpolation calculation.  The built-in output variable gl_Position then gets the value of the interpolated point using  the preceding equation. Finally, we convert the position into clip coordinates by multiplying by  the model-view projection matrix.  Within the fragment shader, we give all fragments a color that is possibly mixed with a line  color in order to highlight the edges.  See also   f The Drawing a wireframe on top of a shaded mesh recipe  Tessellating a 3D surface As an example of tessellating a 3D surface, let's render  yet again  the "teapotahedron". It  turns out that the teapot's data set is actually defined as a set of 4 x 4 patches of control  points, suitable for cubic Bezier interpolation. Therefore, drawing the teapot really boils down  to drawing a set of cubic Bezier surfaces.  Of course, this sounds like a perfect job for tessellation shaders! We'll render each patch of  16 vertices as a patch primitive, use quad tessellation to subdivide the parameter space, and  implement the Bezier interpolation within the tessellation evaluation shader.  253   The following figure shows an example of the desired output. The left teapot is rendered   with inner and outer tessellation level 2, the middle uses level 4 and the right-hand   teapot uses tessellation level 16. The tessellation evaluation shader computes the Bezier  surface interpolation.  First, let's take a look at how cubic Bezier surface interpolation works. If our surface is defined  by a set of 16 control points  laid out in a 4 x 4 grid  Pij, with i and j ranging from 0 to 3, then  the parametric Bezier surface is given by the following equation:  The instances of B in the preceding equation are the cubic Bernstein polynomials  refer to the  previous recipe, Tessellating a 2D quad .  We also need to compute the normal vector at each interpolated location. To do so, we have to  compute the cross product of the partial derivatives of the preceding equation:  The partial derivatives of the Bezier surface boil down to the partial derivatives of the  Bernstein polynomials:  254   We'll compute the partials within the TES and compute the cross product to determine the  normal to the surface at each tessellated vertex.  Getting ready Set up your shaders with a vertex shader that simply passes the vertex position along without  any modification  you can use the same vertex shader as was used in the Tessellating a 2D  quad recipe . Create a fragment shader that implements whatever shading model you choose.  The fragment shader should receive the input variables TENormal and TEPosition, which  will be the normal and position in camera coordinates.  The uniform variable TessLevel should be given the value of the tessellation level desired.  All of the inner and outer levels will be set to this value.  How to do it... To create a shader program that creates Bezier patches from input patches of 16 control  points, use the following steps:  1.  Use the vertex shader from the Tessellating a 2D quad recipe. 2.  Use the following code for the tessellation control shader:  layout  vertices=16   out;  uniform int TessLevel;  void main   {        Pass along the vertex position unmodified     gl_out[gl_InvocationID].gl_Position =                   gl_in[gl_InvocationID].gl_Position;      gl_TessLevelOuter[0] = float TessLevel ;     gl_TessLevelOuter[1] = float TessLevel ;     gl_TessLevelOuter[2] = float TessLevel ;     gl_TessLevelOuter[3] = float TessLevel ;      gl_TessLevelInner[0] = float TessLevel ;     gl_TessLevelInner[1] = float TessLevel ; }  3.  Use the following code for the tessellation evaluation shader:  layout  quads   in; out vec3 TENormal;      Vertex normal in camera coords. out vec4 TEPosition;    Vertex position in camera coords  255   uniform mat4 MVP; uniform mat4 ModelViewMatrix; uniform mat3 NormalMatrix;  void basisFunctions out float[4] b, out float[4] db, float t  {     float t1 =  1.0 - t ;     float t12 = t1 * t1;         Bernstein polynomials     b[0] = t12 * t1;     b[1] = 3.0 * t12 * t;     b[2] = 3.0 * t1 * t * t;     b[3] = t * t * t;         Derivatives     db[0] = -3.0 * t1 * t1;     db[1] = -6.0 * t * t1 + 3.0 * t12;     db[2] = -3.0 * t * t + 6.0 * t * t1;     db[3] = 3.0 * t * t; }  void main   {     float u = gl_TessCoord.x;     float v = gl_TessCoord.y;         The sixteen control points     vec4 p00 = gl_in[0].gl_Position;     vec4 p01 = gl_in[1].gl_Position;     vec4 p02 = gl_in[2].gl_Position;     vec4 p03 = gl_in[3].gl_Position;     vec4 p10 = gl_in[4].gl_Position;     vec4 p11 = gl_in[5].gl_Position;     vec4 p12 = gl_in[6].gl_Position;     vec4 p13 = gl_in[7].gl_Position;     vec4 p20 = gl_in[8].gl_Position;     vec4 p21 = gl_in[9].gl_Position;     vec4 p22 = gl_in[10].gl_Position;     vec4 p23 = gl_in[11].gl_Position;     vec4 p30 = gl_in[12].gl_Position;     vec4 p31 = gl_in[13].gl_Position;     vec4 p32 = gl_in[14].gl_Position;     vec4 p33 = gl_in[15].gl_Position;        Compute basis functions     float bu[4], bv[4];      Basis functions for u and v     float dbu[4], dbv[4];    Derivitives for u and v  256       basisFunctions bu, dbu, u ;     basisFunctions bv, dbv, v ;         Bezier interpolation     TEPosition =      p00*bu[0]*bv[0] + p01*bu[0]*bv[1] + p02*bu[0]*bv[2] +       p03*bu[0]*bv[3] +      p10*bu[1]*bv[0] + p11*bu[1]*bv[1] + p12*bu[1]*bv[2] +       p13*bu[1]*bv[3] +      p20*bu[2]*bv[0] + p21*bu[2]*bv[1] + p22*bu[2]*bv[2] +       p23*bu[2]*bv[3] +      p30*bu[3]*bv[0] + p31*bu[3]*bv[1] + p32*bu[3]*bv[2] +       p33*bu[3]*bv[3];         The partial derivatives     vec4 du =      p00*dbu[0]*bv[0]+p01*dbu[0]*bv[1]+p02*dbu[0]*bv[2]+       p03*dbu[0]*bv[3]+      p10*dbu[1]*bv[0]+p11*dbu[1]*bv[1]+p12*dbu[1]*bv[2]+       p13*dbu[1]*bv[3]+      p20*dbu[2]*bv[0]+p21*dbu[2]*bv[1]+p22*dbu[2]*bv[2]+       p23*dbu[2]*bv[3]+      p30*dbu[3]*bv[0]+p31*dbu[3]*bv[1]+p32*dbu[3]*bv[2]+       p33*dbu[3]*bv[3];      vec4 dv =      p00*bu[0]*dbv[0]+p01*bu[0]*dbv[1]+p02*bu[0]*dbv[2]+       p03*bu[0]*dbv[3]+      p10*bu[1]*dbv[0]+p11*bu[1]*dbv[1]+p12*bu[1]*dbv[2]+       p13*bu[1]*dbv[3]+      p20*bu[2]*dbv[0]+p21*bu[2]*dbv[1]+p22*bu[2]*dbv[2]+       p23*bu[2]*dbv[3]+      p30*bu[3]*dbv[0]+p31*bu[3]*dbv[1]+p32*bu[3]*dbv[2]+       p33*bu[3]*dbv[3];         The normal is the cross product of the partials     vec3 n = normalize  cross du.xyz, dv.xyz   ;         Transform to clip coordinates     gl_Position = MVP * TEPosition;         Convert to camera coordinates     TEPosition = ModelViewMatrix * TEPosition;     TENormal = normalize NormalMatrix * n ; }  257   4.   Implement your favorite shading model within the fragment shader utilizing the  output variables from the TES.  5.  Render the Bezier control points as a 16-vertex patch primitive. Don't forget to set the   number of vertices per patch within the OpenGL application: glPatchParameteri GL_PATCH_VERTICES, 16 ;  How it works... The tessellation control shader starts by defining the number of vertices in the patch using the  layout directive:  layout  vertices=16   out;  It then simply sets the tessellation levels to the value of TessLevel. It passes the vertex  position along, without any modification.  The tessellation evaluation shader starts by using a layout directive to indicate the type of  tessellation to be used. As we are tessellating a 4 x 4 Bezier surface patch, quad tessellation  makes the most sense.  The basisFunctions function evaluates the Bernstein polynomials and their derivatives for  a given value of the parameter t. The results are returned in the output parameters b and db.  Within the main function, we start by assigning the tessellation coordinates to variables u and  v, and reassigning all 16 of the patch vertices to variables with shorter names  to shorten the  code that appears later .  We then call basisFunctions to compute the Bernstein polynomials and their derivatives at  u and at v, storing the results in bu, dbu, bv, and dbv.  The next step is the evaluation of the sums from the preceding equations for the position   TEPosition , the partial derivative with respect to u  du , and the partial derivative with  respect to v  dv .  We compute the normal vector as the cross product of du and dv.  Finally, we convert the position  TEPosition  to clip coordinates and assign the result to   gl_Position. We also convert it to camera coordinates before it is passed along to the  fragment shader.  The normal vector is converted to camera coordinates by multiplying with the NormalMatrix,  and the result is normalized and passed along to the fragment shader via TENormal.  See also  258   f The Tessellating a 2D quad recipe   Tessellating based on depth One of the greatest things about tessellation shaders is how easy it is to implement   level-of-detail  LOD  algorithms. LOD is a general term in computer graphics that refers to   the process of increasing decreasing the complexity of an object's geometry with respect  to the distance from the viewer  or other factors . As an object moves farther away from the  camera, less geometric detail is needed to represent the shape because the overall size of  the object becomes smaller. However, as the object moves closer to the camera, the object  fills more and more of the screen, and more geometric detail is needed to maintain the  desired appearance  smoothness or lack of other geometric artifacts .  The following figure shows a few teapots rendered with tessellation levels that depend on  distance from the camera. Each teapot is rendered using exactly the same code on the  OpenGL side. The TCS automatically varies the tessellation levels based on depth.  When tessellation shaders are used, the tessellation level is what determines the geometric  complexity of the object. As the tessellation levels can be set within the tessellation control  shader, it is a simple matter to vary the tessellation levels with respect to the distance from  the camera.  In this example, we'll vary the tessellation levels linearly  with respect to distance  between  a minimum level and a maximum level. We'll compute the "distance from the camera" as  the absolute value of the z coordinate in camera coordinates,  of course, this is not the true  distance, but should work fine for the purposes of this example . The tessellation level will  then be computed based on that value. We'll also define two additional values  as uniform  variables  MinDepth and MaxDepth. Objects that are closer to the camera than MinDepth  get the maximum tessellation level, and any objects that are further from the camera than  MaxDepth will get the minimum tessellation level. The tessellation level for objects in  between will be linearly interpolated.  259   Getting ready This program is nearly identical to the one in the Tessellating a 3D surface recipe. The only  difference lies within the TCS. We'll remove the uniform variable TessLevel, and add a few  new ones that are described as follows:   f MinTessLevel: This is the lowest desired tessellation level  f MaxTessLevel: This is the highest desired tessellation level  f MinDepth: This is the minimum "distance" from the camera, where the tessellation    f MaxDepth: This is the maximum "distance" from the camera, where the tessellation   level is maximal  level is at a minimum  Render your objects as 16-vertex patch primitives as indicated in the recipe, Tessellating   a 3D surface.  How to do it... To create a shader program that varies the tessellation level based on the depth, use the  following steps:  1.  Use the vertex shader and tessellation evaluation shader from the recipe, Tessellating   a 3D surface.  2.  Use the following code for the tessellation control shader:  layout  vertices=16   out;  uniform int MinTessLevel; uniform int MaxTessLevel; uniform float MaxDepth; uniform float MinDepth;  uniform mat4 ModelViewMatrix;  void main   {        Position in camera coordinates     vec4 p = ModelViewMatrix *                     gl_in[gl_InvocationID].gl_Position;         "Distance" from camera scaled between 0 and 1     float depth = clamp   abs p.z  - MinDepth                               MaxDepth – MinDepth , 0.0, 1.0  ;         Interpolate between min max tess levels  260       float tessLevel =            mix MaxTessLevel, MinTessLevel, depth ;      gl_TessLevelOuter[0] = float tessLevel ;     gl_TessLevelOuter[1] = float tessLevel ;     gl_TessLevelOuter[2] = float tessLevel ;     gl_TessLevelOuter[3] = float tessLevel ;      gl_TessLevelInner[0] = float tessLevel ;     gl_TessLevelInner[1] = float tessLevel ;      gl_out[gl_InvocationID].gl_Position =                    gl_in[gl_InvocationID].gl_Position; }  3.  As with the previous recipe, implement your favorite shading model within the   fragment shader.  How it works... The TCS takes the position and converts it to camera coordinates and stores the result in  the variable p. The absolute value of the z coordinate is then scaled and clamped so that the  result is between zero and one. If the z coordinate is equal to MaxDepth, the value of depth  will be 1.0, if it is equal to MinDepth, then depth will be 0.0. If z is between MinDepth and  MaxDepth, then depth will get a value between zero and one. If z is outside that range, it will  be clamped to 0.0 or 1.0 by the clamp function.  The value of depth is then used to linearly interpolate between MaxTessLevel and  MinTessLevel using the mix function. The result  tessLevel  is used to set the inner and  outer tessellation levels.  There's more... There is a somewhat subtle aspect to this example. Recall that the TCS is executed once  for each output vertex in the patch. Therefore, assuming that we are rendering cubic Bezier  surfaces, this TCS will be executed 16 times for each patch. Each time it is executed, the value  of depth will be slightly different because it is evaluated based on the z coordinate of the  vertex. You might be wondering, which of the 16 possible different tessellation levels will be  the one that is used? It doesn't make sense for the tessellation level to be interpolated across  the parameter space. What's going on?  The output arrays gl_TessLevelInner and gl_TessLevelOuter are per-patch output  variables. This means that only a single value will be used per-patch, similar to the way that  the flat qualifier works for fragment shader input variables. The OpenGL specification seems  to indicate that any of the values from each of the invocations of the TCS could be the value  that ends up being used.  261   See also   f DirectX 11 Terrain Tessellation at: http:  developer.download.nvidia.com  assets gamedev files sdk 11 TerrainTessellation_WhitePaper.pdf   f The Tessellating a 3D surface recipe  262   7  Shadows  In this chapter, we will cover:   f Rendering shadows with shadow maps  f Anti-aliasing shadow edges with PCF  f Creating soft shadow edges with random sampling  f Creating shadows using shadow volumes and the geometry shader  Introduction Shadows add a great deal of realism to a scene. Without shadows, it can be easy to misjudge  the relative location of objects, and the lighting can appear unrealistic, as light rays seem to  pass right through objects.  Shadows are important visual cues for realistic scenes, but can be challenging to produce  in an efficient manner in interactive applications. One of the most popular techniques for  creating shadows in real-time graphics is the shadow mapping algorithm  also called depth  shadows . In this chapter, we'll look at several recipes surrounding the shadow mapping  algorithm. We'll start with the basic algorithm, and discuss it in detail in the first recipe. Then  we'll look at a couple of techniques for improving the look of the shadows produced by the  basic algorithm.  We'll also look at an alternative technique for shadows called shadow volumes. Shadow  volumes produce near perfect hard-edged shadows, but are not well suited for creating  shadows with soft edges.   Rendering shadows with shadow maps One of the most common and popular techniques for producing shadows is called shadow  mapping. In its basic form, the algorithm involves two passes. In the first pass, the scene is  rendered from the point of view of the light source. The depth information from this pass is  saved into a texture called the shadow map. This map will help provide information about the  visibility of objects from the light's perspective. In other words, the shadow map stores the  distance  actually the pseudo-depth  from the light to whatever the light can "see". Anything  that is closer to the light than the corresponding depth stored in the map is lit; anything else  must be in shadow.  In the second pass, the scene is rendered normally, but each fragment's depth  from the  light's perspective  is first tested against the shadow map to determine whether or not the  fragment is in shadow. The fragment is then shaded differently depending on the result of  this test. If the fragment is in shadow, it is shaded with ambient lighting only; otherwise, it is  shaded normally.  The following figure shows an example of shadows produced by the basic shadow   mapping technique:  Let's look at each step of the algorithm in detail.  The first step is the creation of the shadow map. We set up our view matrix so that we are  rendering the scene as if the camera is located at the position of the light source, and is  oriented towards the shadow-casting objects. We set up a projection matrix such that the view  frustum encloses all objects that may cast shadows as well as the area where the shadows  will appear. We then render the scene normally and store the information from the depth  buffer in a texture. This texture is called the shadow map  or simply depth map . We can think  of it  roughly  as a set of distances from the light source to various surface locations.  264   Technically, these are depth values, not distances. A depth  value is not a true distance  from the origin , but can be  roughly treated as such for the purposes of depth testing.  The following figures represent an example of the basic shadow mapping setup. The left figure  shows the light's position and its associated perspective frustum. The right-hand figure shows  the corresponding shadow map. The grey scale intensities in the shadow map correspond to  the depth values  darker is closer .  Once we have created the shadow map and stored the map to a texture, we render the scene  again from the point of view of the camera. This time, we use a fragment shader that shades  each fragment based on the result of a depth test with the shadow map. The position of the  fragment is first converted into the coordinate system of the light source and projected using  the light source's projection matrix. The result is then biased  in order to get valid texture  coordinates  and tested against the shadow map. If the depth of the fragment is greater than  the depth stored in the shadow map, then there must be some surface that is between the  fragment and the light source. Therefore, the fragment is in shadow and is shaded using  ambient lighting only. Otherwise, the fragment must have a clear view to the light source, and  so it is shaded normally.  The key aspect here is the conversion of the fragment's 3D coordinates to the coordinates  appropriate for a lookup into the shadow map. As the shadow map is just a 2D texture, we  need coordinates that range from zero to one for points that lie within the light's frustum.  The light's view matrix will transform points in world coordinates to points within the light's  coordinate system. The light's projection matrix will transform points that are within the light's  frustum to homogeneous clip coordinates.  265   These are called clip coordinates because the built-in  clipping functionality takes place when the position  is defined in these coordinates. Points within the  perspective  or orthographic  frustum are transformed  by the projection matrix to the  homogeneous  space  that is contained within a cube centered at the origin,  with each side of length two. This space is called the  canonical viewing volume. The term "homogeneous"  means that these coordinates should not necessarily  be considered to be true Cartesian positions until they  are divided by their fourth coordinate. For full details  about homogeneous coordinates, refer to your favorite  textbook on computer graphics.  The x and y components of the position in clip coordinates are roughly what we need to  access the shadow map. The z coordinate contains the depth information that we can use to  compare with the shadow map. However, before we can use these values we need to do two  things. First, we need to bias them so that they range from zero to one  instead of -1 to 1 , and  second, we need to apply perspective division  more on this later .  To convert the value from clip coordinates to a range appropriate for use with a shadow map,  we need the x, y, and z coordinates to range from zero to one  for points within the light's  view frustum . The depth that is stored in an OpenGL depth buffer  and also our shadow  map  is simply a fixed or floating-point value between zero and one  typically . A value of zero  corresponds to the near plane of the perspective frustum, and a value of one corresponds to  points on the far plane. Therefore, if we are to use our z coordinate to accurately compare with  this depth buffer, we need to scale and translate it appropriately.  In clip coordinates  after perspective division  the z coordinate  ranges from -1 to 1. It is the viewport transformation that  among  other things  converts the depth to a range between zero and  one. Incidentally, if so desired, we can configure the viewport  transformation to use some other range for the depth values  say  between 0 and 100  via the glDepthRange function.  Of course, the x and y components also need to be biased between zero and one because  that is the appropriate range for texture access.  We can use the following "bias" matrix to alter our clip coordinates.  266   This matrix will scale and translate our coordinates such that the x, y, and z components range  from 0 to 1  after perspective division  for points within the light's frustum. Now, combining  the bias matrix with the light's view  Vl  and projection  Pl  matrices, we have the following  equation for converting positions in world coordinates  W  to homogeneous positions that can  be used for shadow map access  Q .  Finally, before we can use the value of Q directly, we need to divide by the fourth  w   component. This step is sometimes called "perspective division". This converts the position  from a homogeneous value to a true Cartesian position, and is always required when using   a perspective projection matrix.  In the following equation, we'll define a shadow matrix  S  that also includes the model matrix   M , so that we can convert directly from the modeling coordinates  C .  Note that W = MC,  because the model matrix takes modeling coordinates to world coordinates.   Here, S is the shadow matrix, the product of the model matrix with all of the   preceding matrices.  In this recipe, in order to keep things simple and clear, we'll cover only the basic shadow  mapping algorithm, without any of the usual improvements. We'll build upon this basic  algorithm in the following recipes. Before we get into the code, we should note that the  results will likely be less than satisfying. This is because the basic shadow mapping algorithm  suffers from significant aliasing artifacts. Nevertheless, it is still an effective technique  when combined with one of many techniques for anti-aliasing. We'll look at some of those  techniques in the recipes that follow.  Getting ready The position should be supplied in vertex attribute zero and the normal in vertex attribute one.  Uniform variables for the ADS shading model should be declared and assigned, as well as  uniforms for the standard transformation matrices. The ShadowMatrix variable should be  set to the matrix for converting from modeling coordinates to shadow map coordinates  S in  the preceding equation .  The uniform variable ShadowMap is a handle to the shadow map texture, and should be  assigned to texture unit zero.  267   How to do it... To create an OpenGL application that creates shadows using the shadow mapping technique,  use the following steps. We'll start by setting up a Framebuffer Object  FBO  to contain the  shadow map texture, and then move on to the required shader code:  1.   In the main OpenGL program, set up a FBO with a depth buffer only. Declare a  GLuint variable named shadowFBO to store the handle to this framebuffer. The  depth buffer storage should be a texture object. You can use something similar to the  following code to accomplish this: GLfloat border[]={1.0f,0.0f,0.0f,0.0f};    The shadowmap texture GLuint depthTex; glGenTextures 1,&depthTex ; glBindTexture GL_TEXTURE_2D,depthTex ; glTexStorage2D GL_TEXTURE_2D, 1, GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT24,                shadowMapWidth, shadowMapHeight ; glTexParameteri GL_TEXTURE_2D,GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER,                 GL_NEAREST ; glTexParameteri GL_TEXTURE_2D,GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER,                 GL_NEAREST ; glTexParameteri GL_TEXTURE_2D,GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S,                 GL_CLAMP_TO_BORDER ; glTexParameteri GL_TEXTURE_2D,GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_T,                 GL_CLAMP_TO_BORDER ; glTexParameterfv GL_TEXTURE_2D,GL_TEXTURE_BORDER_COLOR,                  border ;  glTexParameteri GL_TEXTURE_2D,GL_TEXTURE_COMPARE_MODE,                 GL_COMPARE_REF_TO_TEXTURE ; glTexParameteri GL_TEXTURE_2D,GL_TEXTURE_COMPARE_FUNC,                 GL_LESS ;    Assign the shadow map to texture unit 0 glActiveTexture GL_TEXTURE0 ; glBindTexture GL_TEXTURE_2D,depthTex ;    Create and set up the FBO glGenFramebuffers 1,&shadowFBO ; glBindFramebuffer GL_FRAMEBUFFER,shadowFBO ; glFramebufferTexture2D GL_FRAMEBUFFER,GL_DEPTH_ATTACHMENT,                        GL_TEXTURE_2D,depthTex,0 ; GLenum drawBuffers[]={GL_NONE}; glDrawBuffers 1,drawBuffers ;    Revert to the default framebuffer for now glBindFramebuffer GL_FRAMEBUFFER,0 ;  268   2.  Use the following code for the vertex shader:  layout  location=0  in vec3 VertexPosition; layout  location=1  in vec3 VertexNormal;  out vec3 Normal;     out vec3 Position;        Coordinate to be used for shadow map lookup out vec4 ShadowCoord;  uniform mat4 ModelViewMatrix; uniform mat3 NormalMatrix; uniform mat4 MVP; uniform mat4 ShadowMatrix;  void main   {     Position =  ModelViewMatrix *                  vec4 VertexPosition,1.0  .xyz;     Normal = normalize  NormalMatrix * VertexNormal  ;         ShadowMatrix converts from modeling coordinates        to shadow map coordinates.     ShadowCoord =ShadowMatrix * vec4 VertexPosition,1.0 ;      gl_Position = MVP * vec4 VertexPosition,1.0 ; }  3.  Use the following code for the fragment shader:     Declare any uniforms needed for your shading model uniform sampler2DShadow ShadowMap;  in vec3 Position; in vec3 Normal; in vec4 ShadowCoord;  layout  location = 0  out vec4 FragColor;  vec3 diffAndSpec   {       Compute only the diffuse and specular components of       the shading model. }  269   subroutine void RenderPassType  ; subroutine uniform RenderPassType RenderPass;  subroutine  RenderPassType  void shadeWithShadow   {   vec3 ambient = …;   compute ambient component here   vec3 diffSpec = diffAndSpec  ;       Do the shadow-map look-up   float shadow = textureProj ShadowMap, ShadowCoord ;       If the fragment is in shadow, use ambient light only.   FragColor = vec4 diffSpec * shadow + ambient, 1.0 ; } subroutine  RenderPassType  void recordDepth   {        Do nothing, depth will be written automatically }  void main   {      This will call either shadeWithShadow or recordDepth   RenderPass  ; }  Within the main OpenGL program, perform the following steps when rendering:  Pass 1  light source.  1.  Set the viewport, view, and projection matrices to those that are appropriate for the   2.  Bind to the framebuffer containing the shadow map  shadowFBO . 3.  Clear the depth buffer. 4.  Select the subroutine function recordDepth. 5.  Enable front-face culling. 6.  Draw the scene.  Pass 2  270  1.  Select the viewport, view, and projection matrices appropriate for the scene. 2.  Bind to the default framebuffer. 3.  Disable culling  or switch to back-face culling . 4.  Select the subroutine function shadeWithShadow. 5.  Draw the scene.   How it works... The first block of the preceding code demonstrates how to create a FBO for our shadow map  texture. The FBO contains only a single texture connected to its depth buffer attachment.  The first few lines of code create the shadow map texture. The texture is allocated using the  glTexStorage2D function with an internal format of GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT24.  We use GL_NEAREST for GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER and GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER here,  although GL_LINEAR could also be used, and might provide slightly better-looking results. We  use GL_NEAREST here so that we can see the aliasing artifacts clearly, and the performance  will be slightly better.  Next, the GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_* modes are set to GL_CLAMP_TO_BORDER. When a fragment  is found to lie completely outside of the shadow map  outside of the light's frustum , then  the texture coordinates for that fragment will be greater than one or less than zero. When  that happens, we need to make sure that those points are not treated as being in shadow.  When GL_CLAMP_TO_BORDER is used, the value that is returned from a texture lookup   for coordinates outside the 0..1 range  will be the border value. The default border value  is  0,0,0,0 . When the texture contains depth components, the first component is  treated as the depth value. A value of zero will not work for us here because a depth of zero  corresponds to points on the near plane. Therefore all points outside of the light's frustum  will be treated as being in shadow! Instead, we set the border color to  1,0,0,0  using the  glTexParameterfv function, which corresponds to the maximum possible depth.  The next two calls to glTexParameteri affect settings that are specific to depth textures.  The first call sets GL_TEXTURE_COMPARE_MODE to GL_COMPARE_REF_TO_TEXTURE. When  this setting is enabled, the result of a texture access is the result of a comparison, rather than  a color value retrieved from the texture. The third component of the texture coordinate  the  p component  is compared against the value in the texture at location  s,t . The result of the  comparison is returned as a single floating-point value. The comparison function that is used  is determined by the value of GL_TEXTURE_COMPARE_FUNC, which is set on the next line. In  this case, we set it to GL_LESS, which means that the result will be 1.0 if the p value of the  texture coordinate is less than the value stored at  s,t .  Other options include GL_LEQUAL,  GL_ALWAYS, GL_GEQUAL, and so on.   The next few lines create and set up the FBO. The shadow map texture is attached to the FBO  as the depth attachment with the glFramebufferTexture2D function. For more details  about FBOs, check out the Rendering to a texture recipe in Chapter 4, Using Textures.  The vertex shader is fairly simple. It converts the vertex position and normal to camera  coordinates and passes them along to the fragment shader via the output variables  Position and Normal. The vertex position is also converted into shadow map coordinates  using ShadowMatrix. This is the matrix S that we referred to in the previous section. It  converts a position from modeling coordinates to shadow coordinates. The result is sent to the  fragment shader via the output variable ShadowCoord.  271   As usual, the position is also converted to clip coordinates and assigned to the built-in output  variable gl_Position.  In the fragment shader, we provide different functionality for each pass. In the main function,  we call RenderPass, which is a subroutine uniform that will call either recordDepth or  shadeWithShadow. For the first pass  shadow map generation , the subroutine function  recordDepth is executed. This function does nothing at all! This is because we only need   to write the depth to the depth buffer. OpenGL will do this automatically  assuming that   gl_Position was set correctly by the vertex shader , so there is nothing for the fragment  shader to do.  During the second pass, the shadeWithShadow function is executed. We compute the  ambient component of the shading model and store the result in the ambient variable.   We then compute the diffuse and specular components and store those in the  diffuseAndSpec variable.  The next step is the key to the shadow mapping algorithm. We use the built-in texture   access function textureProj, to access the shadow map texture ShadowMap. Before using  the texture coordinate to access the texture, the textureProj function will divide the first  three components of the texture coordinate by the fourth component. Remember that this  is exactly what is needed to convert the homogeneous position  ShadowCoord  to a true  Cartesian position.  After this perspective division, the textureProj function will use the result to access  the texture. As this texture's sampler type is sampler2DShadow, it is treated as texture  containing depth values, and rather than returning a value from the texture, it returns the  result of a comparison. The first two components of ShadowCoord are used to access a  depth value within the texture. That value is then compared against the value of the third  component of ShadowCoord. When GL_NEAREST is the interpolation mode  as it is in our  case  the result will be 1.0 or 0.0. As we set the comparison function to GL_LESS, this will  return 1.0, if the value of the third component of ShadowCoord is less than the value within  the depth texture at the sampled location. This result is then stored in the variable shadow.  Finally, we assign a value to the output variable FragColor. The result of the shadow map  comparison  shadow  is multiplied by the diffuse and specular components, and the result is  added to the ambient component. If shadow is 0.0, that means that the comparison failed,  meaning that there is something between the fragment and the light source. Therefore, the  fragment is only shaded with ambient light. Otherwise, shadow is 1.0, and the fragment is  shaded with all three shading components.  When rendering the shadow map, note that we culled the front faces. This is to avoid the  z-fighting that can occur when front faces are included in the shadow map. Note that this  only works if our mesh is completely closed. If back faces are exposed, you may need to use  another technique  that uses glPolygonOffset  to avoid this. I'll talk a bit more about this  in the next section.  272   There's more... There's a number of challenging issues with the shadow mapping technique. Let's look at just  a few of the most immediate ones.  Aliasing As mentioned earlier, this algorithm often suffers from severe aliasing artifacts at the  shadow's edges. This is due to the fact that the shadow map is essentially projected onto the  scene when the depth comparison is made. If the projection causes the map to be magnified,  aliasing artifacts appear.  The following figure shows the aliasing of the shadow's edges:  The easiest solution is to simply increase the size of the shadow map. However, that may  not be possible due to memory, CPU speed, or other constraints. There is a large number  of techniques for improving the quality of the shadows produced by the shadow mapping  algorithm such as resolution-matched shadow maps, cascaded shadow maps, variance  shadow maps, perspective shadow maps and many others. In the following recipes, we'll look  at some ways to help soften and anti-alias the edges of the shadows.  273   Rendering back faces only for the shadow map When creating the shadow map, we only rendered back faces. This is because of the fact that  if we were to render front faces, points on certain faces would have nearly the same depth  as the shadow map's depth, which can cause fluctuations between light and shadow across  faces that should be completely lit. The following figure shows an example of this effect:  Since the majority of faces that cause this issue are those that are facing the light source,  we avoid much of the problem by only rendering back faces during the shadow map pass.  This of course will only work correctly if your meshes are completely closed. If that is not the  case, glPolygonOffset can be used to help the situation by offsetting the depth of the  geometry from that in the shadow map. In fact, even when back faces are only rendered when  generating the shadow map, similar artifacts can appear on faces that are facing away from  the light  back faces in the shadow map, but front from the camera's perspective . Therefore,  it is quite often the case that a combination of front-face culling and glPolygonOffset is  used when generating the shadow map.  See also   f The Rendering to a texture recipe in Chapter 4, Using Textures  f The Anti-aliasing shadow edges with PCF recipe  f The Creating soft shadow edges with random sampling recipe  Anti-aliasing shadow edges with PCF One of the simplest and most common techniques for dealing with the aliasing of shadow  edges is called percentage-closer filtering  PCF . The name comes from the concept of  sampling the area around the fragment and determining the percentage of the area that is  closer to the light source  in shadow . The percentage is then used to scale the amount of   diffuse and specular  shading that the fragment receives. The overall effect is a blurring of  the shadow's edges.  274   The basic technique was first published by Reeves et al in a 1987 paper  SIGGRAPH  Proceedings, Volume 21, Number 4, July 1987 . The concept involved transforming the  fragment's extents into shadow space, sampling several locations within that region, and  computing the percent that is closer than the depth of the fragment. The result is then used  to attenuate the shading. If the size of this filter region is increased, it can have the effect of  blurring the shadow's edges.  A common variant of the PCF algorithm involves just sampling a constant number of nearby  texels within the shadow map. The percent of those texels that are closer to the light is used  to attenuate the shading. This has the effect of blurring the shadow's edges. While the result  may not be physically accurate, the result is not objectionable to the eye.  The following figures show shadows rendered with PCF  right  and without PCF  left . Note that  the shadows in the right-hand image have fuzzier edges and the aliasing is less visible.  In this recipe, we'll use the latter technique, and sample a constant number of texels around  the fragment's position in the shadow map. We'll calculate an average of the resulting  comparisons and use that result to scale the diffuse and specular components.  We'll make use of OpenGL's built-in support for PCF, by using linear filtering on the depth  texture. When linear filtering is used with this kind of texture, the hardware can automatically  sample four nearby texels  execute four depth comparisons  and average the results  the  details of this are implementation dependent . Therefore, when linear filtering is enabled, the  result of the textureProj function can be somewhere between 0.0 and 1.0.  We'll also make use of the built-in functions for texture accesses with offsets. OpenGL  provides the texture access function textureProjOffset, which has a third parameter    the offset  that is added to the texel coordinates before the lookup comparison.  275   Getting ready Start with the shaders and FBO presented in the previous recipe, Rendering shadows with  shadow maps. We'll just make a few minor changes to the code presented there.  How to do it... To add the PCF technique to the shadow mapping algorithm, use the following steps:  1.  When setting up the FBO for the shadow map, make sure to use linear filtering on the   depth texture. Replace the corresponding lines with the following code: glTexParameteri GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER,                  GL_LINEAR ; glTexParameteri GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER,                      GL_LINEAR ;  2.  Use the following code for the shadeWithShadow function within the    fragment shader: subroutine  RenderPassType  void shadeWithShadow   {   vec3 ambient = vec3 0.2 ;   vec3 diffSpec = diffAndSpec  ;       The sum of the comparisons with nearby texels   float sum = 0;       Sum contributions from texels around ShadowCoord   sum += textureProjOffset ShadowMap, ShadowCoord,                             ivec2 -1,-1  ;   sum += textureProjOffset ShadowMap, ShadowCoord,                             ivec2 -1,1  ;   sum += textureProjOffset ShadowMap, ShadowCoord,                             ivec2 1,1  ;   sum += textureProjOffset ShadowMap, ShadowCoord,                             ivec2 1,-1  ;   float shadow = sum * 0.25;    FragColor = vec4 ambient + diffSpec * shadow,1.0 ; }  276   How it works... The first step enables linear filtering on the shadow map texture. When this is enabled, the  OpenGL driver can repeat the depth comparison on the four nearby texels within the texture.  The results of the four comparisons will be averaged and returned.  Within the fragment shader, we use the textureProjOffset function to sample the four  texels  diagonally  surrounding the texel nearest to ShadowCoord. The third argument is the  offset. It is added to the texel's coordinates  not the texture coordinates  before the lookup  takes place.  As linear filtering is enabled, each lookup will sample an additional four texels, for a total of 16  texels. The results are then averaged together and stored within the variable shadow.  As before, the value of shadow is used to attenuate the diffuse and specular components of  the lighting model.  There's more... An excellent survey of the PCF technique was written by Fabio Pellacini of Pixar, and can be  found in Chapter 11, Shadow Map Anti-aliasing of GPU Gems, edited by Randima Fernando,  Addison-Wesley Professional, 2004. If more details are desired, I highly recommend reading  this short, but informative, chapter.  Because of its simplicity and efficiency, the PCF technique is an extremely common method  for anti-aliasing the edges of shadows produced by shadow mapping. Since it has the effect  of blurring the edges, it can also be used to simulate soft shadows. However, the number of  samples must be increased with the size of the blurred edge  the penumbra  to avoid certain  artifacts. This can, of course, be a computational roadblock. In the next recipe, we'll look at a  technique for producing soft shadows by randomly sampling a larger region.  The penumbra is the region of a shadow where only a portion  of the light source is obscured.  See also   f The Rendering shadows with shadow maps recipe  277   Creating soft shadow edges with   random sampling The basic shadow mapping algorithm combined with PCF can produce shadows with soft  edges. However, if we desire blurred edges that are substantially wide  to approximate true  soft shadows  then a large number of samples is required. Additionally, there is a good deal of  wasted effort when shading fragments that are in the center of large shadows, or completely  outside of the shadow. For those fragments, all of the nearby shadow map texels will evaluate  to the same value. Therefore, the work of accessing and averaging those texels is essentially a  wasted effort.  The technique presented in this recipe is based on a chapter published in GPU Gems 2, edited  by Matt Pharr and Randima Fernando, Addison-Wesley Professional, 2005.  Chapter 17 by  Yury Uralsky . It provides an approach that can address both of the preceding issues to create  shadows with soft edges of various widths, while avoiding unnecessary texture accesses in  areas inside and outside of the shadow.  The basic idea is as follows:   f Instead of sampling texels around the fragment's position  in shadow map space    using a constant set of offsets, we use a random, circular pattern of offsets   f In addition, we sample only the outer edges of the circle first in order to determine   whether or not the fragment is in an area that is completely inside or outside of   the shadow  The following figure is a visualization of a possible set of shadow map samples. The center  of the cross-hairs is the fragment's location in the shadow map, and each x is a sample. The  samples are distributed randomly within a circular grid around the fragment's location  one  sample per grid cell .  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x x x x x  x x  278   Additionally, we vary the sample locations through a set of precomputed sample patterns. We  compute random sample offsets and store them in a texture prior to rendering. Then, in the  fragment shader, the samples are determined by first accessing the offset texture to grab a  set of offsets and use them to vary the fragment's position in the shadow map. The results are  then averaged together in a similar manner to the basic PCF algorithm.  The following figures show the difference between shadows using the PCF algorithm  left , and  the random sampling technique described in this recipe  right .  We'll store the offsets in a three-dimensional texture  n x n x d . The first two dimensions are  of arbitrary size, and the third dimension contains the offsets. Each  s,t  location contains  a list  size d  of random offsets packed into an RGBA color. Each RGBA color in the texture  contains two 2D offsets. The R and G channels contain the first offset, and the B and A  channels contain the second. Therefore, each  s,t  location contains a total of 2*d offsets.   For example, location  1, 1, 3  contains the sixth and seventh offset at location  1,1 . The  entire set of values at a given  s,t  comprise a full set of offsets.  We'll rotate through the texture based on the fragment's screen coordinates. The location within  the offset texture will be determined by taking the remainder of the screen coordinates divided  by the texture's size. For example, if the fragment's coordinates are  10.0,10.0  and the texture's  size is  4,4 , then we use the set of offsets located in the offset texture at location  2,2 .  Getting ready Start with the code presented in the Rendering shadows with shadow maps recipe.  There are three additional uniforms that need to be set. They are as follows:   f OffsetTexSize: This gives the width, height, and depth of the offset texture. Note   that the depth is same as the number of samples per fragment divided by two.   f OffsetTex: This is a handle to the texture unit containing the offset texture.  279    f Radius: This is the blur radius in pixels divided by the size of the shadow map   texture  assuming a square shadow map . This could be considered as the softness  of the shadow.  How to do it... To modify the shadow mapping algorithm and to use this random sampling technique, use the  following steps. We'll build the offset texture within the main OpenGL program, and make use  of it within the fragment shader:  1.  Use the following code within the main OpenGL program to create the offset texture.   This only needs to be executed once during the program initialization: void buildOffsetTex int size, int samplesU, int samplesV  {   int samples = samplesU * samplesV;   int bufSize = size * size * samples * 2;   float *data = new float[bufSize];    for  int i = 0; i< size; i++   {     for int j = 0; j < size; j++   {       for  int k = 0; k < samples; k += 2   {         int x1,y1,x2,y2;         x1 = k %  samplesU ;         y1 =  samples - 1 - k    samplesU;         x2 =  k+1  % samplesU;         y2 =  samples - 1 - k - 1    samplesU;          vec4 v;            Center on grid and jitter         v.x =  x1 + 0.5f  + jitter  ;         v.y =  y1 + 0.5f  + jitter  ;         v.z =  x2 + 0.5f  + jitter  ;         v.w =  y2 + 0.5f  + jitter  ;            Scale between 0 and 1         v.x  = samplesU;         v.y  = samplesV;         v.z  = samplesU;         v.w  = samplesV;            Warp to disk         int cell =   k 2  * size * size + j *                      size + i  * 4;         data[cell+0] = sqrtf v.y  * cosf TWOPI*v.x ;         data[cell+1] = sqrtf v.y  * sinf TWOPI*v.x ;         data[cell+2] = sqrtf v.w  * cosf TWOPI*v.z ;         data[cell+3] = sqrtf v.w  * sinf TWOPI*v.z ;  280         }     }   }    glActiveTexture GL_TEXTURE1 ;   GLuint texID;   glGenTextures 1, &texID ;    glBindTexture GL_TEXTURE_3D, texID ;   glTexStorage3D GL_TEXTURE_3D, 1, GL_RGBA32F, size, size,                  samples 2 ;   glTexSubImage3D GL_TEXTURE_3D, 0, 0, 0, 0, size, size,                   samples 2, GL_RGBA, GL_FLOAT, data ;   glTexParameteri GL_TEXTURE_3D, GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER,                      GL_NEAREST ;   glTexParameteri GL_TEXTURE_3D, GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER,                      GL_NEAREST ;    delete [] data; }     Return random float between -0.5 and 0.5 float jitter   {   return   float rand     RAND_MAX  - 0.5f; }  2.  Add the following uniform variables to the fragment shader:  uniform sampler3D OffsetTex; uniform vec3 OffsetTexSize;     width, height, depth  uniform float Radius;  3.  Use the following code for the shadeWithShadow function in the fragment shader:  subroutine  RenderPassType  void shadeWithShadow   {   vec3 ambient = vec3 0.2 ;   vec3 diffSpec = diffAndSpec  ;    ivec3 offsetCoord;   offsetCoord.xy = ivec2  mod  gl_FragCoord.xy,                           OffsetTexSize.xy    ;    float sum = 0.0;   int samplesDiv2 = int OffsetTexSize.z ;   vec4 sc = ShadowCoord;    for  int i = 0 ; i< 4; i++   {     offsetCoord.z = i;  281       vec4 offsets = texelFetch OffsetTex,offsetCoord,0  *                         Radius * ShadowCoord.w;      sc.xy = ShadowCoord.xy + offsets.xy;     sum += textureProj ShadowMap, sc ;     sc.xy = ShadowCoord.xy + offsets.zw;     sum += textureProj ShadowMap, sc ;   }   float shadow = sum   8.0;    if  shadow != 1.0 && shadow != 0.0   {     for  int i = 4; i< samplesDiv2; i++   {       offsetCoord.z = i;       vec4 offsets =          texelFetch OffsetTex, offsetCoord,0  *                    Radius * ShadowCoord.w;        sc.xy = ShadowCoord.xy + offsets.xy;       sum += textureProj ShadowMap, sc ;       sc.xy = ShadowCoord.xy + offsets.zw;       sum += textureProj ShadowMap, sc ;     }     shadow = sum   float samplesDiv2 * 2.0 ;   }   FragColor = vec4 diffSpec * shadow + ambient, 1.0 ; }  How it works... The buildOffsetTex function creates our three-dimensional texture of random offsets.  The first parameter, texSize, defines the width and height of the texture. To create the  preceding images, I used a value of 8. The second and third parameters, samplesU and  samplesV, define the number of samples in the u and v directions. I used a value of 4 and 8,  respectively, for a total of 32 samples. The u and v directions are arbitrary axes that are used  to define a grid of offsets. To help understand this, take a look at the following figure:  Centered offsets  Jittered offsets  Warped to Circular Grid  v  u  282   The offsets are initially defined to be centered on a grid of size samplesU x samplesV  4 x  4 in the preceding figure . The coordinates of the offsets are scaled such that the entire grid  fits in the unit cube  side length 1  with the origin in the lower left corner. Then each sample is  randomly jittered from its position to a random location inside the grid cell. Finally, the jittered  offsets are warped such that they surround the origin and lie within the circular grid shown on  the right.  The last step can be accomplished by using the v coordinate as the distance from the origin  and the u coordinate as the angle scaled from 0 to 360. The following equations should do  the trick:  Here, w is the warped coordinate. What we are left with is a set of offsets around the origin  that are a maximum distance of 1.0 from the origin. Additionally, we generate the data such  that the first samples are the ones around the outer edge of the circle, moving inside towards  the center. This will help us avoid taking too many samples when we are working completely  inside or outside of the shadow.  Of course, we also pack the samples in such a way that a single texel contains two samples.  This is not strictly necessary, but is done to conserve memory space. However, it does make  the code a bit more complex.  Within the fragment shader, we start by computing the ambient component of the shading  model separately from the diffuse and specular components. We access the offset texture at  a location based on the fragment's screen coordinates  gl_FragCoord . We do so by taking  the modulus of the fragment's position and the size of the offset texture. The result is stored  in the first two components of offsetCoord. This will give us a different set of offsets for  each nearby pixel. The third components of offsetCoord will be used to access a pair of  samples. The number of samples is the depth of the texture divided by two. This is stored in  samplesDiv2. We access the sample using the texelFetch function. This function allows  us to access a texel using the integer texel coordinates rather than the usual normalized  texture coordinates in the range 0…1.  The offset is retrieved and multiplied by Radius and the w component of ShadowCoord.  Multiplying by Radius simply scales the offsets so that they range from 0.0 to Radius. We  multiply by the w component because ShadowCoord is still a homogeneous coordinate,  and our goal is to use offsets to translate the ShadowCoord. In order to do so properly, we  need to multiply the offset by the w component. Another way of thinking of this is that the w  component will be cancelled when perspective division takes place.  283   Next, we use offsets to translate ShadowCoord and access the shadow map to do the depth  comparison using textureProj. We do so for each of the two samples stored in the texel,  once for the first two components of offsets and again for the last two. The result is added   to sum.  The first loop repeats this for the first eight samples. If the first eight samples are all 0.0 or  1.0, then we assume that all of the samples will be the same  the sample area is completely  in or out of the shadow . In that case, we skip the evaluation of the rest of the samples.  Otherwise, we evaluate the following samples and compute the overall average.  Finally the resulting average  shadow  is used to attenuate the diffuse and specular  components of the lighting model.  There's more... The use of a small texture containing a set of random offsets helps to blur the edges of the  shadow better than what we might achieve with the standard PCF technique that uses a  constant set of offsets. However, artifacts can still appear as repeated patterns within the  shadow edges because the texture is finite and offsets are repeated every few pixels. We  could improve this by also using a random rotation of the offsets within the fragment shader,  or simply compute the offsets randomly within the shader.  It should also be noted that this blurring of the edges may not be desired for all shadow  edges. For example, edges that are directly adjacent to the occluder, that is, creating the  shadow, should not be blurred. These may not always be visible, but can become so in certain  situations, such as when the occluder is a narrow object. The effect is to make the object  appear as if it is hovering above the surface. Unfortunately, there isn't an easy fix for this one.  See also   f The Rendering shadows with shadow maps recipe  Creating shadows using shadow volumes  and the geometry shader As we discovered in the previous recipes, one of the main problems with shadow maps is  aliasing. The problem essentially boils down to the fact that we are sampling the shadow  map s  at a different frequency  resolution  than we are using when rendering the scene.  To minimize the aliasing we can blur the shadow edges  as in the previous recipes , or try  to sample the shadow map at a frequency that is closer to the corresponding resolution in  projected screen space. There are many techniques that help with the latter; for more details,  I recommend the book Real-Time Shadows.  284   An alternate technique for shadow generation is called shadow volumes. The shadow volume  method completely avoids the aliasing problem that plagues shadow maps. With shadow  volumes, you get pixel-perfect hard shadows, without the aliasing artifacts of shadow maps.  The following figure shows a scene with shadows that are produced using the shadow   volume technique.  The shadow volume technique works by making use of the stencil buffer to mask out areas  that are in shadow. We do this by drawing the boundaries of the actual shadow volumes  more  on this below . A shadow volume is the region of space where the light source is occluded by  an object. For example, the following figures show a representation of the shadow volumes of  a triangle  left  and a sphere  right .  The boundaries of a shadow volume are made up of quads formed by extending the edges  of the object away from the light source. For a single triangle, the boundaries would consist  of three quads, extended from each edge, and triangular caps on each end. One cap is the  triangle itself and the other is placed at some distance from the light source. For an object  that consists of many triangles, such as the sphere above, the volume can be defined by the  so-called silhouette edges. These are edges that are on or near the boundary between the  shadow volume and the portion of the object that is lit. In general, a silhouette edge borders  a triangle that faces the light and another triangle that faces away from the light. To draw the  shadow volume, one would find all of the silhouette edges and draw extended quads for each  edge. The caps of the volume could be determined by making a closed polygon  or triangle fan   that includes all the points on the silhouette edges, and similarly on the far end of the volume.  285   The shadow volume technique works in the following way. Imagine a ray that originates at the  camera position and extends through a pixel on the near plane. Suppose that we follow that  ray and keep track of a counter that is incremented every time that it enters a shadow volume  and decremented each time that it exits a shadow volume. If we stop counting when we hit a  surface, that point on the surface is occluded  in shadow  if our count is non-zero, otherwise,  the surface is lit by the light source.  The following figure shows an example of this idea:  0  +1  +2 +1  0  The roughly horizontal line represents a surface that is receiving a shadow. The numbers  represent the counter for each camera ray. For example, the rightmost ray with value +1  has that value because the ray entered two volumes and exited one along the way from the  camera to the surface: 1 + 1 - 1 = 1. The rightmost ray has a value of zero at the surface  because it entered and exited both shadow volumes: 1 + 1 - 1 - 1 = 0.  This all sounds fine in theory, but how can we trace rays in OpenGL? The good news is that  we don't have to. The stencil buffer provides just what we need. With the stencil buffer, we  can increment decrement a counter for each pixel based on whether a front or back face is  rendered into that pixel. So we can draw the boundaries of all of the shadow volumes, then for  each pixel, increment the stencil buffer's counter when a front face is rendered to that pixel  and decrement when it is a back face.  The key here is to realize that each pixel in the rendered figure represents an eye-ray  as in the  above diagram . So for a given pixel, the value in the stencil buffer is the value that we would  get if we actually traced a ray through that pixel. The depth test helps to stop tracing when we  reach a surface.  The above is just a quick introduction to shadow volumes, a full  discussion is beyond the scope of this book. For more detail, a  great resource is Real Time Shadows by Eisemann et al.  286   In this recipe, we'll draw our shadow volumes with the help of the geometry shader. Rather  than computing the shadow volumes on the CPU side, we'll render the geometry normally, and  have the geometry shader produce the shadow volumes. In the Drawing silhouette lines using  the geometry shader recipe in Chapter 6, Using Geometry and Tessellation Shaders, we saw  how the geometry shader can be provided with adjacency information for each triangle. With  adjacency information, we can determine whether a triangle has a silhouette edge. If the triangle  faces the light, and a neighboring triangle faces away from the light, then the shared edge can  be considered a silhouette edge, and used to create a polygon for the shadow volume.  The entire process is done in three passes. They are as follows:   f Render the scene normally, but write the shaded color to two separate buffers.    We'll store the ambient component in one and the diffuse and specular components  in another.   f Set up the stencil buffer so that the stencil test always passes, and front faces cause   an increment and back faces cause a decrement. Make the depth buffer read-only,  and render only the shadow-casting objects. In this pass, the geometry shader will  produce the shadow volumes, and only the shadow volumes will be rendered to the  fragment shader.   f Set up the stencil buffer so the test succeeds when the value is equal to zero. Draw  a screen-filling quad, and combine the values of the two buffers from step one when  the stencil test succeeds.  That's the high-level view, and there are many details. Let's go through them in the   next sections.  Getting ready We'll start by creating our buffers. We'll use a framebuffer object with a depth attachment  and two color attachments. The ambient component can be stored in a renderbuffer  as  opposed to a texture  because we'll blit  a fast copy  it over to the default framebuffer  rather than reading from it as a texture. The diffuse + specular component will be stored in  a texture. Create the ambient buffer  ambBuf , a depth buffer  depthBuf , and a texture   diffSpecTex , then set up the FBO.  glGenFramebuffers 1, &colorDepthFBO ; glBindFramebuffer GL_FRAMEBUFFER, colorDepthFBO ; glFramebufferRenderbuffer GL_FRAMEBUFFER, GL_DEPTH_ATTACHMENT,                            GL_RENDERBUFFER, depthBuf ; glFramebufferRenderbuffer GL_FRAMEBUFFER, GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENT0,                            GL_RENDERBUFFER, ambBuf ; glFramebufferTexture2D GL_FRAMEBUFFER, GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENT1,                         GL_TEXTURE_2D, diffSpecTex, 0 ;  287   Set up the draw buffers so that we can write to the color attachments.  GLenum drawBuffers[] = {GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENT0,                          GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENT1}; glDrawBuffers 2, drawBuffers ;  How to do it... For the first pass, enable the framebuffer object that we set up above, and render the scene  normally. In the fragment shader, send the ambient component and the diffuse + specular  component to separate outputs.  layout  location = 0   out vec4 Ambient; layout  location = 1   out vec4 DiffSpec;  void shade    {      Compute the shading model, and separate out the ambient      component.   Ambient = …;      Ambient   DiffSpec = …;     Diffuse + specular } void main   { shade  ; }  In the second pass, we'll render our shadow volumes. We want to set up the stencil buffer so  that the test always succeeds, and that front faces cause an increment, and back faces cause  a decrement.  glClear GL_STENCIL_BUFFER_BIT ; glEnable GL_STENCIL_TEST ; glStencilFunc GL_ALWAYS, 0, 0xffff ; glStencilOpSeparate GL_FRONT, GL_KEEP, GL_KEEP, GL_INCR_WRAP ; glStencilOpSeparate GL_BACK, GL_KEEP, GL_KEEP, GL_DECR_WRAP ;  Also in this pass, we want to use the depth buffer from the first pass, but we want to use the  default frame buffer, so we need to copy the depth buffer over from the FBO used in the first  pass. We'll also copy over the color data, which should contain the ambient component.  glBindFramebuffer GL_READ_FRAMEBUFFER, colorDepthFBO ;  glBindFramebuffer GL_DRAW_FRAMEBUFFER,0 ; glBlitFramebuffer 0,0,width-1,height-1,0,0,width-1,height-1,            GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BITGL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT, GL_NEAREST ;  We don't want to write to the depth buffer or the color buffer in this pass, since our only goal is  to update the stencil buffer, so we'll disable writing for those buffers.  glColorMask GL_FALSE, GL_FALSE, GL_FALSE, GL_FALSE ;  glDepthMask GL_FALSE ;  288   Next, we render the shadow-casting objects with adjacency information. In the geometry  shader, we determine the silhouette edges and output only quads that define the shadow  volume boundaries.  layout  triangles_adjacency   in; layout  triangle_strip, max_vertices = 18   out;  in vec3 VPosition[]; in vec3 VNormal[];  uniform vec4 LightPosition;     Light position  eye coords  uniform mat4 ProjMatrix;        Proj. matrix  infinite far plane   bool facesLight  vec3 a, vec3 b, vec3 c   {   vec3 n = cross  b - a, c - a  ;   vec3 da = LightPosition.xyz - a;   vec3 db = LightPosition.xyz - b;   vec3 dc = LightPosition.xyz - c;   return dot n, da  > 0  dot n, db  > 0  dot n, dc  > 0;  }  void emitEdgeQuad  vec3 a, vec3 b   {   gl_Position = ProjMatrix * vec4 a, 1 ;   EmitVertex  ;     gl_Position = ProjMatrix * vec4 a - LightPosition.xyz, 0 ;   EmitVertex  ;   gl_Position = ProjMatrix * vec4 b, 1 ;   EmitVertex  ;   gl_Position = ProjMatrix * vec4 b - LightPosition.xyz, 0 ;   EmitVertex  ;   EndPrimitive  ; }  void main   {   if  facesLight VPosition[0], VPosition[2], VPosition[4]    {     if  ! facesLight VPosition[0],VPosition[1],VPosition[2]            emitEdgeQuad VPosition[0],VPosition[2] ;     if  ! facesLight VPosition[2],VPosition[3],VPosition[4]            emitEdgeQuad VPosition[2],VPosition[4] ;     if  ! facesLight VPosition[4],VPosition[5],VPosition[0]            emitEdgeQuad VPosition[4],VPosition[0] ;   } }  289   In the third pass, we'll set up our stencil buffer so that the test passes only when the value in  the buffer is equal to zero.  glStencilFunc GL_EQUAL, 0, 0xffff ; glStencilOp GL_KEEP, GL_KEEP, GL_KEEP ;  We want to enable blending so that our ambient component is combined with the diffuse   + specular when the stencil test succeeds.  glEnable GL_BLEND ;           glBlendFunc GL_ONE,GL_ONE ;  In this pass, we just draw a screen-filling quad, and output the diffuse + specular value. If  the stencil test succeeds, the value will be combined with the ambient component, which is  already in the buffer  we copied it over earlier using glBlitFramebuffer .  layout binding = 0  uniform sampler2D DiffSpecTex; layout location = 0  out vec4 FragColor;  void main   {   vec4 diffSpec = texelFetch DiffSpecTex, ivec2 gl_FragCoord , 0 ;   FragColor = vec4 diffSpec.xyz, 1 ; }  How it works... The first pass is fairly straightforward. We draw the entire scene normally, except we   separate the ambient color from the diffuse and specular color, and send the results to  different buffers.  The second pass is the core of the algorithm. Here we render only the objects that cast  shadows and let the geometry shader produce the shadow volumes. Thanks to the geometry  shader, we don't actually end up rendering the shadow-casting objects at all, only the  shadow volumes. However, before this pass, we need to do a bit of setup. We set up the  stencil test so that it increments when a front face is rendered and decrements for back  faces using glStencilOpSeparate, and the stencil test is configured to always succeed  using glStencilFunc. We also use glBlitFramebuffer to copy over the depth buffer  and  ambient  color buffer from the FBO used in the first pass. Since we want to only render  shadow volumes that are not obscured by geometry, we make the depth buffer read-only using  glDepthMask. Lastly, we disable writing to the color buffer using glColorMask because we  don't want to mistakenly overwrite anything in this pass.  290   The geometry shader does the work of producing the silhouette shadow volumes. Since  we are rendering using adjacency information  see the Drawing silhouette lines using  the geometry shader recipe in Chapter 6, Using Geometry and Tessellation Shaders , the  geometry shader has access to six vertices that define the current triangle being rendered  and the three neighboring triangles. The vertices are numbered from 0 to 5, and are available  via the input array named VPosition in this example. Vertices 0, 2, and 4 define the current  triangle and the others define the adjacent triangles as shown in the following figure:  5  4  0  3  1  2  The geometry shader starts by testing the main triangle  0, 2, 4  to see if it faces the light  source. We do so by computing the normal to the triangle  n  and the vector from each vertex  to the light source. Then we compute the dot product of n and each of the three light source  direction vectors  da, db, and dc . If any of the three are positive, then the triangle faces the  light source. If we find that triangle  0, 2, 4  faces the light, then we test each neighboring  triangle in the same way. If a neighboring triangle does not face the light source, then the edge  between them is a silhouette edge and can be used as an edge of a face of the shadow volume.  We create a shadow volume face in the emitEdgeQuad function. The points a and b define  the silhouette edge, one edge of the shadow volume face. The other two vertices of the face  are determined by extending a and b away from the light source. Here, we use a mathematical  trick that is enabled by homogeneous coordinates. We extend the face out to infinity by using  a zero in the w coordinate of the extended vertices. This effectively defines a homogeneous  vector, sometimes called a point at infinity. The x, y and z coordinates define a vector in the  direction away from the light source, and the w value is set to zero. The end result is that we  get a quad that extends out to infinity, away from the light source.  Note that this will only work properly if we use a modified  projection matrix that can take into account points defined  in this way. Essentially, we want a projection matrix with a  far plane set at infinity. GLM provides just such a projection  matrix via the function infinitePerspective.  We don't worry about drawing the caps of the shadow volume here. We don't need a cap at  the far end, because we've used the homogeneous trick described above, and the object itself  will serve as the cap on the near end.  291   In the third and final pass, we reset our stencil test to pass when the value in the stencil buffer  is equal to zero using glStencilFunc. Here we want to sum the ambient with the diffuse +  specular color when the stencil test succeeds, so we enable blending, and set the source and  destination blend functions to GL_ONE. We render just a single screen-filling quad, and output  the value from the texture that contains our diffuse + specular color. The stencil test will take  care of discarding fragments that are in shadow, and OpenGL's blending support will blend  the output with the ambient color for fragments that pass the test.  Remember that we copied  over the ambient color using glBlitFramebuffer earlier.   There's more... The technique described above is often referred to as the z-pass technique. It has one fatal  flaw. If the camera is located within a shadow volume, this technique breaks down because  the counts in the stencil buffer will be off by at least one. The common solution is to basically  invert the problem and trace a ray from infinity towards the view point. This is called the z-fail  technique or Carmack's reverse.  The "fail" and "pass" here refers to whether or not we are  counting when the depth test passes or fails.  Care must be taken when using z-fail because it is important to draw the caps of the  shadow volumes. However, the technique is very similar to z-pass. Instead of incrementing  decrementing when the depth test passes, we do so when the depth test fails. This effectively  "traces" a ray from infinity back towards the view point.  I should also note that the preceding code is not robust to degenerate triangles  triangles that  have sides that are nearly parallel , or non-closed meshes. One might need to take care in  such situations. For example, to better deal with degenerate triangles we could use another  technique for determining the normal to the triangle. We could also add additional code to  handle edges of meshes, or simply always use closed meshes.   f The Drawing silhouette lines using the geometry shader recipe in Chapter 6, Using   Geometry and Tessellation Shaders  See also  292   8  Using Noise in Shaders  In this chapter, we will cover:   f Creating a noise texture using GLM  f Creating a seamless noise texture  f Creating a cloud-like effect  f Creating a wood-grain effect  f Creating a disintegration effect  f Creating a paint-spatter effect  f Creating a night-vision effect  Introduction It's easy to use shaders to create a smooth-looking surface, but that is not always the desired  goal. If we want to create realistic-looking objects, we need to simulate the imperfections of  real surfaces. That includes things such as scratches, rust, dents, and erosion. It is somewhat  surprising how challenging it can be to make surfaces look like they have really been subjected  to these natural processes. Similarly, we sometimes want to represent natural surfaces such  as wood grain or natural phenomena such as clouds to be as realistic as possible without  giving the impression of being synthetic or exhibiting a repetitive pattern or structure.  Most effects or patterns in nature exhibit a certain degree of randomness and non-linearity.  Therefore, you might imagine that we could generate them by simply using random data.  However, random data such as the kind that is generated from a pseudorandom-number  generator is not very useful in computer graphics. There are two main reasons:   f First, we need data that is repeatable, so that the object will render in the same way  during each frame of the animation.  We could achieve this by using an appropriate  seed value for each frame, but that only solves half of the problem.     f Second, in order to model most of these natural phenomena, we actually need data   that is continuous, but still gives the appearance of randomness. Continuous data  more accurately represents many of these natural materials and phenomena. Purely  random data does not have this continuity property. Each value has no dependence  on the previous value.  Thanks to the groundbreaking work of Ken Perlin, we have the concept of noise  as it applies  to computer graphics . His work defined noise as a function that has certain qualities such as  the following:   f It is a continuous function  f It is repeatable  generates the same output from the same input   f It can be defined for any number of dimensions  f It does not have any regular patterns and gives the appearance of randomness  Such a noise function is a valuable tool for computer graphics and it can be used to create  an endless array of interesting effects. For instance, in this chapter, we'll use noise to create  clouds, wood, disintegration, and other effects.  Perlin noise is the noise function originally defined by Ken Perlin  see http:  mrl.nyu. edu ~perlin doc oscar.html . A full discussion of the details behind Perlin noise is  outside the scope of this book.  To use Perlin noise within a shader, we have the following three main choices:  1.  We can use the built-in GLSL noise functions. 2.  We can create our own GLSL noise functions. 3.  We can use a texture map to store pre-computed noise data.  At the time of writing, the GLSL noise functions are not implemented in some of the  commercial OpenGL drivers, and therefore cannot be relied upon to be available, so I have  decided not to use them in this chapter. As creating our own noise functions is a bit beyond  the scope of this book, and because choice 3 in the preceding list gives the best performance  on modern hardware, the recipes in this chapter will use the third approach  using a pre- computed noise texture .  Many books use a 3D noise texture rather than a 2D one, to  provide another dimension of noise that is available to the shaders.  To keep things simple, and to focus on using surface texture  coordinates, I've chosen to use a 2D noise texture in the recipes  within this chapter. If desired, it should be straightforward to extend  these recipes to use a 3D source of noise.  294   We'll start out with two recipes that demonstrate how to generate a noise texture using  GLM. Then we'll move on to several examples that use noise textures to produce natural and  artificial effects such as wood grain, clouds, electrical interference, splattering, and erosion.  The recipes in this chapter are meant to be a starting point for you to experiment with. They  are certainly not intended to be the definitive way of implementing any of these effects. One   of the best things about computer graphics is the element of creativity. Try tweaking the  shaders in these recipes to produce similar results and then try creating your own effects.  Most of all, have fun!

Implementing a proper noise generator from scratch can be a fairly daunting task. Luckily,  GLM provides some functions for noise generation that are straightforward and easy to use.  In this recipe, we'll use GLM to generate a 2D texture of noise values created using a  Perlin noise generator. GLM can generate 2D, 3D, and 4D Perlin noise via the function  glm::perlin.  It is common practice to use Perlin noise by summing the values of the noise function with  increasing frequencies and decreasing amplitudes. Each frequency is commonly referred to  as an octave  double the frequency . For example, in the following image, we show the results  of the 2D Perlin noise function sampled at four different octaves. The sampling frequencies  increase from left to right. The leftmost image is the function sampled at our base frequency,  and each image to the right shows the function sampled at twice the frequency of the one   to its left.  295   In mathematical terms, if our coherent 2D Perlin noise function is P x, y , then each previous  image represents the following equation.  Here i = 0, 1, 2, and 3 from left to right.  As mentioned previously, the common practice is to sum octaves together to get the final  result. We add each octave to the previous, scaling the amplitude down by some factor. So   for N octaves, we have the following sum.  Where a and b are tunable constants. The following images show the sum of 2, 3, and 4  octaves  left to right  with a = 1 and b = 2.  Summed noise involving higher octaves will have more high-frequency variation than noise  involving only lower octaves. However, it is possible to quickly reach frequencies that exceed  the resolution of the buffer used to store the noise data, so care must be taken not to do  unnecessary computation. In practice, it is both an art and a science. The previous equation  can be used as a starting point; feel free to tweak until you get the desired effect.  We'll store four noise values in a single 2D texture. We'll store Perlin noise with one octave in  the first component  red channel , two octaves in the green channel, three octaves in the blue,  and four octaves in the alpha channel.  Getting ready Make sure you have the GLM library installed and placed in the include path.  296   How to do it... To create a 2D noise texture with GLM, use the following steps:  1.   Include the GLM header that includes the noise functions. include    2.  Generate the noise data, using the previous equation:  GLubyte *data = new GLubyte[ width * height * 4 ];  float xFactor = 1.0f    width - 1 ; float yFactor = 1.0f    height - 1 ;  for  int row = 0; row < height; row++   {   for  int col = 0 ; col < width; col++   {     float x = xFactor * col;     float y = yFactor * row;     float sum = 0.0f;     float freq = a;     float scale = b;             Compute the sum for each octave     for  int oct = 0; oct < 4; oct++   {       glm::vec2 p x * freq, y * freq ;       float val = glm::perlin p    scale;       sum += val;       float result =  sum + 1.0f   2.0f;           Store in texture buffer       data[  row * width + col  * 4  + oct] =                      GLubyte    result * 255.0f  ;       freq *= 2.0f;      Double the frequency       scale *= b;        Next power of b     }   } }  3.  Load the data into an OpenGL texture.  GLuint texID; glGenTextures 1, &texID ;  glBindTexture GL_TEXTURE_2D, texID ; glTexStorage2D GL_TEXTURE_2D, 1, GL_RGBA8, width, height ; glTexSubImage2D GL_TEXTURE_2D,0,0,0,width,height,    GL_RGBA,GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE,data ;  delete [] data;  297   How it works... The GLM library provides 2D, 3D, and 4D coherent noise via the glm::perlin function. It  returns a float roughly between -1 and 1. We start by allocating a buffer named data to hold  the generated noise values.  Next, we loop over each texel and compute the x and y coordinates  normalized . Then we  loop over octaves. Here we compute the sum of the previous equation, storing the first term in  the first component, the first two terms in the second, and so on. The value is scaled into the  range from 0 to 1, then multiplied by 255 and cast to a byte.  The next few lines of code should be familiar. Texture memory is allocated with  glTexStorage2D and the data is loaded in to GPU memory using glTexSubImage2D.  Finally, the array named data is deleted, as it is no longer needed.  There's more... Rather than using unsigned byte values, we could get more resolution in our noise data by  using a floating-point texture. This might provide better results if the effect needs a high  degree of fine detail. The preceding code needs relatively few changes to achieve this. Just  use an internal format of GL_RGBA32F instead of GL_RGBA, and don't multiply by 255 when  storing the noise values in the array.  GLM also provides periodic Perlin noise via an overload of the glm::perlin function. This  makes it easy to create noise textures that tile without seams. We'll see how to use this in the  next recipe.  See also   f For general information about coherent noise, take a look at the book Graphics   Shaders, by Mike Bailey and Steve Cunningham   f The Applying a 2D texture recipe in Chapter 4, Using Textures  f The Creating a seamless noise texture recipe  Creating a seamless noise texture It can be particularly useful to have a noise texture that tiles well. If we simply create a noise  texture as a finite slice of noise values, then the values will not wrap smoothly across the  boundaries of the texture. This can cause hard edges  seams  to appear in the rendered  surface if the texture coordinates extend outside of the range of zero to one.  Fortunately, GLM provides a periodic variant of Perlin noise that can be used to create a  seamless noise texture.  298   The following image shows an example of regular  left  and periodic  right  4-octave Perlin  noise. Note that in the left image, the seams are clearly visible, while they are hidden in the  right image.  In this example, we'll modify the code from the previous recipe to produce a seamless   noise texture.  Getting ready For this recipe, we'll start with the code from the previous recipe, Creating a noise texture  using GLM.  How to do it... Modify the code from the previous recipe in the following way.  Within the innermost loop, instead of calling glm::perlin, we'll instead call the overload  that provides periodic Perlin noise. Replace the statement  float val = glm::perlin p    scale;  with the following:  float val = 0.0f; if  periodic   {   val = glm::perlin p, glm::vec2 freq     scale; } else {   val = glm::perlin p    scale; }  299   How it works... The second parameter to glm::perlin determines the period in x and y of the noise values.  We use freq as the period because we are sampling the noise in the range from 0 to freq  for each octave.  See also   f The Creating a noise texture using GLM recipe  Creating a cloud-like effect To create a texture that resembles a sky with clouds, we can use the noise values as a blending  factor between the sky color and the cloud color. As clouds usually have large scale structure,  it makes sense to use low octave noise. However, the large scale structure often has higher  frequency variations, so some contribution from higher octave noise may be desired.  The following image shows an example of clouds generated by the technique in this recipe:  To create this effect, we take the cosine of the noise value and use the result as the blending  factor between the cloud color.  Getting ready Set up your program to generate a seamless noise texture and make it available to the  shaders through the uniform sampler variable NoiseTex.  There are two uniforms in the fragment shader that can be assigned from the   OpenGL program:   f SkyColor: The background sky color  f CloudColor: The color of the clouds  300   How to do it... To create a shader program that uses a noise texture to create a cloud-like effect, use the  following steps:  1.  Set up your vertex shader to pass the texture coordinates to the fragment shader via   the variable TexCoord.  2.  Use the following code for the fragment shader:  define PI 3.14159265  layout  binding=0   uniform sampler2D NoiseTex;  uniform vec4 SkyColor = vec4  0.3, 0.3, 0.9, 1.0  ; uniform vec4 CloudColor = vec4  1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0  ;  in vec2 TexCoord;  layout   location = 0   out vec4 FragColor;  void main   {   vec4 noise = texture NoiseTex, TexCoord ;   float t =  cos  noise.g * PI   + 1.0    2.0;   vec4 color = mix  SkyColor, CloudColor, t  ;   FragColor = vec4  color.rgb , 1.0  ; }  How it works... We start by retrieving the noise value from the noise texture  variable noise . The green  channel contains two octave noises, so we use the value stored in that channel  noise.g .  Feel free to try out other channels and determine what looks right to you.  We use a cosine function to make a sharper transition between the cloud and sky color. The  noise value will be between zero and one, and the cosine of that value will range between  -1 and 1, so we add 1.0 and divide by 2.0. The result that is stored in t should again range  between zero and one. Without this cosine transformation, the clouds look a bit too spread  out over the sky. However, if that is the desired effect, one could remove the cosine and just  use the noise value directly.  Next, we mix the sky color and the cloud color using the value of t. The result is used as the  final output fragment color.  301   There's more... If you desire less clouds and more sky, you could translate and clamp the value of t prior to  using it to mix the cloud and sky colors. For example, you could use the following code:  float t =  cos  noise.g * PI   + 1.0     2.0; t = clamp  t – 0.25, 0.0, 1.0  ;  This causes the cosine term to shift down  toward negative values , and the clamp function  sets all negative values to zero. This has the effect of increasing the amount of sky and  decreasing the size and intensity of the clouds.

Then we'll take a slice of the log, and perturb the growth rings using noise from  our noise texture.  The following image illustrates our virtual "log". It is aligned with the y-axis, and extends  infinitely in all directions. The growth rings are aligned with integer distances from the y-axis.  Each ring is given a darker color with lighter color in between rings. Each growth ring spans a  narrow distance around the integer distances.  302   To take a "slice", we'll simply define a 2D region of the log's space based on the texture  coordinates. Initially, the texture coordinates define a square region, with coordinates ranging  from zero to one. We'll assume that the region is aligned with the x-y plane, so that the s  coordinate corresponds to x, the t coordinate corresponds to y, and the value of z is zero. We  can then transform this region in any way that suits our fancy, to create an arbitrary 2D slice.  After defining the slice, we'll determine the color based on the distance from the y-axis. However,  before doing so, we'll perturb that distance based on a value from the noise texture. The result  has a general look that is similar to real wood. The following image shows an example:  Getting ready Set up your program to generate a noise texture and make it available to the shaders through  the uniform variable NoiseTex.  There are three uniforms in the fragment shader that can be assigned from the OpenGL  program. They are as follows:   f LightWoodColor: The lightest wood color  f DarkWoodColor: The darkest wood color  f Slice: A matrix that defines the slice of the virtual "log" and transforms the default  region defined by the texture coordinates to some other arbitrary rectangular region  How to do it... To create a shader program that generates a wood-grain effect using a noise texture, use the  following steps:  1.  Set up your vertex shader to pass the texture coordinate to the fragment shader via   the variable TexCoord.  303   2.  Use the following code for the fragment shader:  layout binding=0  uniform sampler2D NoiseTex;  uniform vec4 DarkWoodColor = vec4  0.8, 0.5, 0.1, 1.0  ; uniform vec4 LightWoodColor = vec4  1.0, 0.75, 0.25, 1.0  ; uniform mat4 Slice;  in vec2 TexCoord;  layout   location = 0   out vec4 FragColor;  void main   {      Transform the texture coordinates to define the      "slice" of the log.   vec4 cyl = Slice * vec4  TexCoord.st, 0.0, 1.0  ;       The distance from the log's y axis.   float dist = length cyl.xz ;       Perturb the distance using the noise texture   vec4 noise = texture NoiseTex, TexCoord ;   dist += noise.b;       Determine the color as a mixture of the light and       dark wood colors.   float t = 1.0 – abs  fract  dist   * 2.0 – 1.0  ;   t = smoothstep  0.2, 0.5, t  ;   vec4 color = mix  DarkWoodColor, LightWoodColor, t  ;    FragColor = vec4  color.rgb , 1.0  ; }  How it works... The first line of the main function within the fragment shader expands the texture coordinates  to a 3D  homogeneous  value with a z coordinate of zero  s, t, 0, 1 , and then transforms  the value by the matrix Slice. This matrix can scale, translate, and or rotate the texture  coordinates to define the 2D region of the virtual "log".  One way to visualize this is to think of the slice as a 2D unit  square embedded in the "log" with its lower-left corner at the  origin. The matrix is then used to transform that square within  the log to define a slice through the log. For example, I might  just translate the square by  -0.5, -0.5, -0.5  and scale by 20  in x and y to get a slice through the middle of the log.  304   Next, the distance from the y-axis is determined by using the built-in length function   length cyl.xz  . This will be used to determine how close we are to a growth ring. The  color will be a light wood color if we are between growth rings, and a dark color when we are  close to a growth ring. However, before determining the color, we perturb the distance slightly  using a value from our noise texture by using the following line of code:  dist += noise.b;  The next step is just a bit of numerical trickery to determine the color based on how close we  are to a whole number. We start by taking the fractional part of the distance  fract dist  ,  multiplying by two, subtracting one, and taking the absolute value. As fract dist  is a value  between zero and one, multiplying by two, subtracting one, and taking the absolute value will  result in a value that is also between zero and one. However, the value will range from 1.0  when dist is 0.0, to 0.0 when dist is 0.5, and back to 1.0 when dist is 1.0  a "v" shape .  We then invert the "v" by subtracting from one, and storing the result in t. Next, we use the  smoothstep function to create a somewhat sharp transition between the light and dark  colors. In other words, we want a dark color when t is less than 0.2, a light color when it is  greater than 0.5, and a smooth transition in between. The result is used to mix the light and  dark colors via the GLSL mix function.  The smoothstep  a, b, x   function works in the following  way. It returns 0.0 when x = b and uses Hermite  interpolation between 0 and 1 when x is between a and b.  The result of all of this is a narrow band of the dark color around integer distances, and a light  color in between, with a rapid, but smooth transition.  Finally, we simply apply the final color to the fragment.  There's more... A book-matched pair of boards is a pair that is cut from the same log and then glued together.  The result is a larger board that has symmetry in the grain from one side to the other. We can  approximate this effect by mirroring the texture coordinate. For example, we could use the  following in place of the first line of the preceding main function:  vec2 tc = TexCoord; if  tc.s > 0.5   tc.s = 1.0 – tc.s; vec4 cyl = Slice * vec4  tc, 0.0, 1.0  ;  305   The following image shows an example of the results:  See also   f The Creating a noise texture using GLM recipe  Creating a disintegration effect It is straightforward to use the GLSL discard keyword in combination with noise to simulate  erosion or decay. We can simply discard fragments that correspond to a noise value that  is above or below a certain threshold. The following image shows a teapot with this effect.  Fragments are discarded when the noise value corresponding to the texture coordinate is  outside a certain threshold range.  306   Getting ready Set up your OpenGL program to provide position, normal, and texture coordinates to the  shader. Be sure to pass the texture coordinate along to the fragment shader. Set up any  uniforms needed to implement the shading model of your choice.  Create a seamless noise texture  see Creating a seamless noise texture , and place it in the  appropriate texture channel.  The following uniforms are defined in the fragment shader, and should be set via the   OpenGL program:   f NoiseTex: The noise texture.  f LowThreshold: Fragments are discarded if the noise value is below this value.  f HighThreshold: Fragments are discarded if the noise value is above this value.  How to do it... To create a shader program that provides a disintegration effect, use the following steps:  1.  Create a vertex shader that sends the texture coordinate to the fragment shader via   the output variable TexCoord. It should also pass the position and normal to the  fragment shader through the variables Position and Normal.  2.  Use the following code for the fragment shader:     Insert uniforms needed for the Phong shading model  layout binding=0  uniform sampler2D NoiseTex;  in vec4 Position; in vec3 Normal; in vec2 TexCoord;  uniform float LowThreshold; uniform float HighThreshold;  layout   location = 0   out vec4 FragColor;  vec3 phongModel   {      Compute Phong shading model… } void main   {  307        Get the noise value at TexCoord   vec4 noise = texture  NoiseTex, TexCoord  ;       If the value is outside the threshold, discard   if  noise.a   HighThreshold      discard;       Color the fragment using the shading model   vec3 color = phongModel  ;   FragColor = vec4  color , 1.0  ; }  How it works... The fragment shader starts by retrieving a noise value from the noise texture  NoiseTex ,  and storing the result in the variable noise. We want noise that has a large amount of   high-frequency fluctuation, so we choose four-octave noise, which is stored in the alpha  channel  noise.a .  We then discard the fragment if the noise value is below LowThreshold or above  HighThreshold. As the discard keyword causes the execution of the shader to stop,   the following statements will not execute if the fragment is discarded.  The discard operation can have a performance impact due  to how it might affect early depth tests.  Finally, we compute the shading model and apply the result to the fragment.  See also   f The Creating a seamless noise texture recipe  308   Creating a paint-spatter effect Using high-frequency noise, it is easy to create the effect of random spatters of paint on the  surface of an object. The following image shows an example:  We use the noise texture to vary the color of the object, with a sharp transition between the  base color and the paint color. We'll use either the base color or paint color as the diffuse  reflectivity of the shading model. If the noise value is above a certain threshold, we'll use the  paint color; otherwise, we'll use the base color of the object.  Getting ready Start with a basic setup for rendering using the Phong shading model  or whatever model you  prefer . Include texture coordinates and pass them along to the fragment shader.  There are a couple of uniform variables that define the parameters of the paint spatters:   f PaintColor: The color of the paint spatters  f Threshold: The minimum noise value where a spatter will appear  Create a noise texture with high-frequency noise.  Make your noise texture available to the fragment shader via the uniform sampler variable  NoiseTex.  309   How to do it... To create a shader program that generates a paint-spatter effect, use the following steps:  1.  Create a vertex shader that sends the texture coordinates to the fragment shader   via the output variable TexCoord. It should also pass the position and normal to the  fragment shader through the variables Position and Normal.  2.  Use the following code for the fragment shader:     Uniforms for the Phong shading model uniform struct LightInfo {   vec4 Position;   vec3 Intensity; } Light;  uniform struct MaterialInfo {   vec3 Ka;   vec3 Kd;   vec3 Ks;   float Shininess; } Material;     The noise texture layout binding=0  uniform sampler2D NoiseTex;    Input from the vertex shader in vec4 Position; in vec3 Normal; in vec2 TexCoord;     The paint-spatter uniforms uniform vec3 PaintColor = vec3 1.0 ; uniform float Threshold = 0.65;  layout   location = 0   out vec4 FragColor;  vec3 phongModel vec3 kd  {      Evaluate the Phong shading model }  void main   {   vec4 noise = texture  NoiseTex, TexCoord  ;   vec3 color = Material.Kd;   if  noise.g> Threshold   color = PaintColor;   FragColor = vec4  phongModel color  , 1.0  ; }  310   How it works... The main function of the fragment shader retrieves a noise value from NoiseTex, and stores  it in the variable noise. The next two lines set the variable color to either the base diffuse  reflectivity  Material.Kd  or PaintColor, depending on whether or not the noise value is  greater than the threshold value  Threshold . This will cause a sharp transition between the  two colors and the size of the spatters will be related to the frequency of the noise.  Finally, the Phong shading model is evaluated using color as the diffuse reflectivity.   The result is applied to the fragment.  There's more... As indicated in the Creating a noise texture using GLM recipe using lower-frequency noise  will cause the spatters to be larger in size and more spread out. A lower threshold will also  increase the size without spreading over the surface, but as the threshold gets lower, it starts  to look more uniform and less like random spattering.  See also   f The Creating a seamless noise texture recipe  Creating a night-vision effect Noise can be useful to simulate static or other kinds of electronic interference effects. This  recipe is a fun example of that. We'll create the look of night-vision goggles with some noise  thrown in to simulate some random static in the signal. Just for fun, we'll also outline the  scene in the classic "binocular" view. The following image shows an example:  311   We'll apply the night-vision effect as a second pass to the rendered scene. The first pass will  render the scene to a texture  see Chapter 4, Using Textures , and the second pass will apply  the night-vision effect.  Getting ready Create a Framebuffer Object  FBO  for the first pass. Attach a texture to the first color  attachment of the FBO. For more information on how to do this, see Chapter 4, Using Textures.  Create and assign any uniform variables needed for the shading model. Set the following  uniforms defined in the fragment shader:   f Width: The width of the viewport in pixels  f Height: The height of the viewport in pixels  f Radius: The radius of each circle in the "binocular" effect  in pixels   f RenderTex: The texture containing the render from the first pass  f NoiseTex: The noise texture  f RenderPass: The subroutine uniform used to select the functionality for each pass  Create a noise texture with high-frequency noise, and make it available to the shader via  NoiseTex. Associate the texture with the FBO available via RenderTex.  How to do it... To create a shader program that generates a night-vision effect, use the following steps:  1.  Set up your vertex shader to pass along the position, normal, and texture coordinates   via the variables Position, Normal, and TexCoord respectively.  2.  Use the following code for the fragment shader:  in vec3 Position; in vec3 Normal; in vec2 TexCoord;  uniform int Width; uniform int Height; uniform float Radius; layout binding=0  uniform sampler2D RenderTex; layout binding=1  uniform sampler2D NoiseTex;  subroutine vec4 RenderPassType  ; subroutine uniform RenderPassType RenderPass;     Define any uniforms needed for the shading model.  312   layout  location = 0   out vec4 FragColor;  vec3 phongModel  vec3 pos, vec3 norm   {      Compute the Phong shading model }     Returns the relative luminance of the color value float luminance  vec3 color   {   return dot  color.rgb, vec3 0.2126, 0.7152, 0.0722   ; }  subroutine  RenderPassType  vec4 pass1   {   return vec4 phongModel  Position, Normal  ,1.0 ; }  subroutine  RenderPassType   vec4 pass2   {   vec4 noise = texture NoiseTex, TexCoord ;   vec4 color = texture RenderTex, TexCoord ;   float green = luminance  color.rgb  ;    float dist1 = length gl_FragCoord.xy –         vec2 Width*0.25, Height*0.5  ;   float dist2 = length gl_FragCoord.xy –         vec2 3.0*Width*0.25, Height*0.5  ;   if  dist1 > Radius && dist2 > Radius   green = 0.0;    return vec4 0.0, green * clamp noise.a + 0.25, 0.0, 1.0 ,        0.0 ,1.0 ; }  void main   {      This will call either pass1   or pass2     FragColor = RenderPass  ; }  3.   In the render function of your OpenGL program, use the following steps:  1.  Bind to the FBO that you set up for rendering the scene to a texture. 2.  Select the pass1 subroutine function in the fragment shader via   RenderPass.  3.  Render the scene.  313   4.  Bind to the default FBO. 5.  Select the pass2 subroutine function in the fragment shader via   RenderPass.  6.  Draw a single quad that fills the viewport using texture coordinates that   range from 0 to 1 in each direction.  How it works... The fragment shader is broken into two subroutine functions, one for each pass. Within the  pass1 function, we simply apply the Phong shading model to the fragment. The result is  written to the FBO, which contains a texture to be used in the second pass.  In the second pass, the pass2 function is executed. We start by retrieving a noise value   noise , and the color from the render texture from the first pass  color . Then we compute  the luminance value for the color and store that result in the variable green. This will  eventually be used as the green component of the final color.  The next step involves determining whether or not the fragment is inside the "binocular"  lenses. We compute the distance to the center of the left lens  dist1 , which is located in the  viewport halfway from top to bottom and one-quarter of the way from left to right. The right  lens is located at the same vertical location, but three-quarters of the way from left to right.  The distance from the center of the right-hand lens is stored in dist2. If both dist1 and  dist2 are greater than the radius of the virtual lenses, then we set green to zero.  Finally, we return the final color, which has only a green component; the other two are set to  zero. The value of green is multiplied by the noise value in order to add some noise to the  image to simulate random interference in the signal. We add 0.25 to the noise value and  clamp it between zero and one, in order to brighten the overall image. I have found that it  appeared a bit too dark if the noise value wasn't biased in this way.  There's more... It would make this shader even more effective if the noise varied in each frame during  animation to simulate interference that is constantly changing. We can accomplish this  roughly by modifying the texture coordinates used to access the noise texture in a time- dependent way. See the blog post mentioned in See also section for an example.

Since they have the ability to transform the vertex positions, they can be  used to implement animation directly within the shaders themselves. This can provide a bump  in efficiency if the animation algorithm can be parallelized appropriately for execution within  the shader.  If a shader is to help with animation, it must not only compute the positions, but often we  need to write the updated positions for use in the next frame. Shaders were not originally  designed to write to arbitrary buffers  except of course the framebuffer . However, with recent  versions, OpenGL provides the ability to do so via shader storage buffer objects and image  load store. As of OpenGL 3.0, we can also send the values of the vertex or geometry shader's  output variables to an arbitrary buffer  or buffers . This feature is called Transform Feedback,  and is particularly useful for particle systems.   In this chapter, we'll look at several examples of animation within shaders, focusing mostly  on particle systems. The first example, animating with vertex displacement, demonstrates  animation by transforming the vertex positions of an object based on a time-dependent  function. In the Creating a particle fountain recipe, we create a simple particle system under  constant acceleration. In the Creating a particle system using transform feedback recipe  there is an example illustrating how to use OpenGL's transform feedback functionality within  a particle system. The Creating a particle system using instanced particles recipe shows you  how to animate many complex objects using instanced rendering.  The last two recipes demonstrate some particle systems for simulating complex real  phenomena such as smoke and fire.  Animating a surface with vertex  displacement A straightforward way to leverage shaders for animation is to simply transform the vertices  within the vertex shader based on some time-dependent function. The OpenGL application  supplies static geometry, and the vertex shader modifies the geometry using the current time   supplied as a uniform variable . This moves the computation of the vertex position from the  CPU to the GPU, and leverages whatever parallelism the graphics driver makes available.  In this example, we'll create a waving surface by transforming the vertices of a tessellated  quad based on a sine wave. We'll send down the pipeline a set of triangles that make up a flat  surface in the x-z plane. In the vertex shader we'll transform the y-coordinate of each vertex  based on a time-dependent sine function, and compute the normal vector of the transformed  vertex. The following image shows the desired result.  You'll have to imagine that the waves  are travelling across the surface from left to right .  316   Alternatively, we could use a noise texture to animate the vertices   that make up the surface  based on a random function.  See  Chapter 8, Using Noise in Shaders, for details on noise textures .  Before we jump into the code, let's take a look at the mathematics that we'll need.  We'll transform the y-coordinate of the surface as a function of the current time and the  modeling x-coordinate. To do so, we'll use the basic plane wave equation as shown in the  following diagram:  Where A is the wave's amplitude  the height of the peaks , lambda  λ  is the wavelength  the  distance between successive peaks , and v is the wave's velocity. The previous image shows  an example of the wave when t = 0 and the wavelength is equal to one. We'll configure these  coefficients through uniform variables.  In order to render the surface with proper shading, we also need the normal vector at the  transformed location. We can compute the normal vector using the  partial  derivative of the  previous function. The result is the following equation:  Of course, the previous vector should be normalized before using it in our shading model.  Getting ready Set up your OpenGL application to render a flat, tessellated surface in the x-z plane. The  results will look better if you use a large number of triangles. Also, keep track of the animation  time using whatever method you prefer. Provide the current time to the vertex shader via the  uniform variable Time.  317   The other important uniform variables are the coefficients of the previous wave equation.  Set up your program to provide appropriate uniform variables for your chosen shading model.   f K: It is the wavenumber  2π λ .  f Velocity: It is the wave's velocity.  f Amp: It is the wave's amplitude.  How to do it... Use the following steps:  1.  Use the following code for the vertex shader:  layout  location = 0  in vec3 VertexPosition; out vec4 Position; out vec3 Normal; uniform float Time;     The animation time    Wave parameters uniform float K;           Wavenumber uniform float Velocity;    Wave's velocity uniform float Amp;         Wave's amplitude uniform mat4 ModelViewMatrix; uniform mat3 NormalMatrix; uniform mat4 MVP; void main   {   vec4 pos = vec4 VertexPosition,1.0 ;      Translate the y coordinate   float u = K *  pos.x - Velocity * Time ;   pos.y = Amp * sin  u  ;      Compute the normal vector   vec3 n = vec3 0.0 ;   n.xy = normalize vec2 -K * Amp *cos  u  , 1.0  ;      Send position and normal  in camera cords  to frag.   Position = ModelViewMatrix * pos;   Normal = NormalMatrix * n;      The position in clip coordinates   gl_Position = MVP * pos; }  318   2.  Create a fragment shader that computes the fragment color based on the variables  Position and Normal using whatever shading model you choose  see the Using  per-fragment shading for improved realism recipe in Chapter 3, Lighting, Shading,  and Optimizations .  How it works... The vertex shader takes the position of the vertex and updates the y-coordinate using the  wave equation discussed previously. After the first three statements, the variable pos is just   a copy of the input variable VertexPosition with the modified y-coordinate. We then compute the normal vector using the previous equation, normalize the result and  store it in the variable n. Since the wave is really just a two-dimensional wave  doesn't depend  on z , the z component of the normal vector will be zero.  Finally we pass along the new position and normal to the fragment shader after converting  to camera coordinates. As usual, we also pass the position in clip coordinates to the built-in  variable gl_Position.  There's more... Modifying the vertex position within the vertex shader is a straightforward way to offload some  computation from the CPU to the GPU. It also eliminates the possible need to transfer vertex  buffers between the GPU memory and main memory in order to modify the positions.  The main disadvantage is that the updated positions are not available on the CPU side.  For example, they might be needed for additional processing  such as collision detection .  However, there are a number of ways to provide this data back to the CPU. One technique  might be clever use of FBOs to receive the updated positions from the fragment shader. In a  following recipe, we'll look at another technique that makes use of a newer OpenGL feature  called transform feedback.  See also   f The Using per-fragment shading for improved realism recipe in Chapter 3, Lighting,   Shading, and Optimization  319   Creating a particle fountain In computer graphics, a particle system is a group of objects that are used to simulate a variety  of "fuzzy" systems like smoke, liquid spray, fire, explosions, or other similar phenomena. Each  particle is considered to be a point object with a position, but no size. Often, they are rendered  as point sprites  using the GL_POINTS primitive mode , but could also be rendered as camera  aligned quads or triangles. Each particle has a lifetime: it is born, animates according to a set  of rules, and then dies. The particle can then be resurrected and go through the entire process  again. Generally particles do not interact with other particles, or reflect light. The particle is  often rendered as a single, textured, camera-facing quad with transparency.  During the lifetime of a particle, it is animated according to a set of rules. These rules often  include the basic kinematic equations that define the movement of a particle that is subjected  to constant acceleration  such as a gravitational field . In addition, we might take into account  things like wind, friction or other factors. The particle may also change shape or transparency  during its lifetime. Once the particle has reached a certain age  or position , it is considered to  be "dead" and can be "recycled" and used again.  In this example, we'll implement a relatively simple particle system that has the look of a  fountain of water. For simplicity, the particles in this example will not be "recycled." Once they  have reached the end of their lifetime, we'll draw them as fully transparent so that they are  effectively invisible. This gives the fountain a finite lifetime, as if it only has a limited supply of  material. In later recipes, we'll see some ways to improve this system by recycling particles.  The following sequence of images shows several successive frames from the output of this  simple particle system.  To animate the particles, we'll use the standard kinematics equation for objects under  constant acceleration.  The previous equation describes the position of a particle at time t. P0 is the initial position, v0  is the initial velocity, and a is the acceleration.  320   We'll define the initial position of all particles to be the origin  0,0,0 . The initial velocity will  be determined randomly within a range of values. Each particle will be created at a slightly  different time, so the time that we use in the previous equation will be relative to the start  time for the particle.  Since the initial position is the same for all particles, we won't need to provide it as an   input attribute to the shader. Instead, we'll just provide two other vertex attributes: the initial  velocity and the start time  the particle's time of "birth" . Prior to the particle's birth time, we'll  render it completely transparent. During its lifetime, the particle's position will be determined  using the previous equation with a value for t that is relative to the particle's start time    Time – StartTime . We'll render each particle as a textured point sprite  using GL_POINTS . It is easy to apply a  texture to a point sprite because OpenGL will automatically generate texture coordinates and  make them available to the fragment shader via the built-in variable gl_PointCoord. We'll  also increase the transparency of the point sprite linearly with the age of the particle, to make  the particle appear to fade out as it animates.  Getting ready We'll create two buffers  or a single interleaved buffer  to store the input to the vertex shader.  The first buffer will store the initial velocity for each particle. We'll choose the values randomly  from a limited range of possible vectors. To create the vertical "cone" of particles in the  previous image, we'll choose randomly from a set of vectors within the cone. The following  code is one way to do this:  vec3 v 0.0f ; float velocity, theta, phi; GLfloat *data = new GLfloat[nParticles * 3]; for  unsigned int i = 0; i < nParticles; i++   {      Pick the direction of the velocity   theta = glm::mix 0.0f,  float PI   6.0f, randFloat   ;   phi = glm::mix 0.0f,  float TWOPI, randFloat   ;    v.x = sinf theta  * cosf phi ;   v.y = cosf theta ;   v.z = sinf theta  * sinf phi ;       Scale to set the magnitude of the velocity  speed    velocity = glm::mix 1.25f,1.5f,randFloat   ;   v = v * velocity;    data[3*i]   = v.x;   data[3*i+1] = v.y;   data[3*i+2] = v.z;  321   } glBindBuffer GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, initVel ; glBufferSubData GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, 0,                  nParticles * 3 * sizeof float , data ;  In the previous code the randFloat function returns a random value between zero and one.  We pick random numbers within a range of possible values by using the GLM mix function,  the  GLM mix function works the same as the corresponding GLSL function. It performs a linear  interpolation between the values of the first two arguments . Here, we choose a random float  between zero and one and use that value to interpolate between the endpoints of our range. To pick vectors from within our cone, we utilize spherical coordinates. The value of theta  determines the angle between the center of the cone and the outer edge. The value of phi  defines the possible directions around the y-axis for a given value of theta. For more on  spherical coordinates, grab your favorite math book.  Once a direction is chosen, the vector is scaled to have a magnitude between 1.25 and 1.5.  This is a range that seems to work well for the desired effect. The magnitude of the velocity  vector is the overall speed of the particle, and we can tweak this range to get a wider variety  of speeds or faster slower particles. The last three lines in the loop assign the vector to the appropriate location in the array data.  After the loop, we copy the data into the buffer referred to by initVel. Set up this buffer to  provide data for vertex attribute zero.  In the second buffer, we'll store the start time for each particle. This will provide only a single  float per vertex  particle . For this example, we'll just create each particle in succession at a  fixed rate. The following code will set up a buffer with each particle created 0.00075 seconds  after the previous one.  float * data = new GLfloat[nParticles]; float time = 0.0f, rate = 0.00075f;  for  unsigned int i = 0; i < nParticles; i++   {   data[i] = time;   time += rate; } glBindBuffer GL_ARRAY_BUFFER,startTime ; glBufferSubData GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, 0, nParticles * sizeof float , data ; This code simply creates an array of floats that starts at zero and gets incremented by rate.  The array is then copied into the buffer referred to by startTime. Set this buffer to be the  input for vertex attribute one.  322   Set the following uniform variables from within the OpenGL program:   f ParticleTex: It is the particle's texture.  f Time: It is the amount of time that has elapsed since the animation began.  f Gravity: It is the vector representing one half of the acceleration in the    previous equation.   f ParticleLifetime: It defines how long a particle survives after it is created.  Make sure that the depth test is off, and enable alpha blending using the   following statements:  glDisable GL_DEPTH_TEST ; glEnable GL_BLEND ; glBlendFunc GL_SRC_ALPHA, GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA ;  You will also want to choose a reasonable size for each point sprite. For example, the following  line sets it to 10 pixels:  glPointSize 10.0f ;  How to do it... Use the following code for the vertex shader:     Initial velocity and start time layout  location = 0  in vec3 VertexInitVel;  layout  location = 1  in float StartTime;  out float Transp;     Transparency of the particle  uniform float Time;     Animation time uniform vec3 Gravity = vec3 0.0,-0.05,0.0 ;     world coords uniform float ParticleLifetime;     Max particle lifetime  uniform mat4 MVP;  void main   {      Assume the initial position is  0,0,0 .   vec3 pos = vec3 0.0 ;   Transp = 0.0;       Particle doesn't exist until the start time   if  Time > StartTime   {     float t = Time - StartTime;  323       if  t < ParticleLifetime   {       pos = VertexInitVel * t + Gravity * t * t;       Transp = 1.0 - t   ParticleLifetime;     }   }    gl_Position = MVP * vec4 pos, 1.0 ; }  Use the following code for the fragment shader:  in float Transp; uniform sampler2D ParticleTex;  layout   location = 0   out vec4 FragColor;  void main   {   FragColor = texture ParticleTex, gl_PointCoord ;   FragColor.a *= Transp; }  How it works... The vertex shader receives the particle's initial velocity  VertexInitVel  and start time   StartTime  in its two input attributes. The variable Time stores the amount of time that  has elapsed since the beginning of the animation. The output variable Transp is the overall  transparency of the particle.  In the main function of the vertex shader, we start by setting the initial position to the modeling  origin  0,0,0 , and the transparency to 0.0  fully transparent . The following if statement  determines whether the particle is alive yet. If the current time is greater than the start time for  the particle, the particle is alive, otherwise, the particle has yet to be "born". In the latter case,  the position remains at the origin and the particle is rendered fully transparent.  If the particle is alive, we determine the "age" of the particle by subtracting the start time from  the current time, and storing the result in the variable t. If t is greater than or equal to the  lifetime for a particle  ParticleLifetime , the particle has already fully evolved through its  animation and is rendered fully transparent. Otherwise, the particle is still active and the body  of the inner if statement executes, which is responsible for animating the particle. If the particle is alive, the position  pos  is determined using the kinematic equation described  previously. The transparency is determined by linearly interpolating based on the particle's age.  Transp = 1.0 – t   ParticleLifetime;  324   When the particle is born it is fully opaque, and linearly becomes transparent as it ages. The  value of Transp is 1.0 at birth and 0.0 at the end of the particle's lifetime. In the fragment shader, we color the fragment with the result of value of a texture lookup.  Since we are rendering GL_POINT primitives, the texture coordinate is determined  automatically by OpenGL and is available in the built-in variable gl_PointCoord. Before  finishing, we multiply the alpha value of the final color by the variable Transp, in order to  scale the overall transparency of the particle based on the particle's age  as determined in  the vertex shader .  There's more... This example is meant to be a fairly gentle introduction to GPU-based particle systems. There  are many things that could be done to improve the power and flexibility of this system. For  example, we could vary the size or rotation of the particles as they progress through their  lifetime to produce different effects.  We could also create a better indication of distance by varying the size of the particles with  the distance from the camera. This could be accomplished by defining the point size within  the vertex shader using the built-in variable gl_PointSize, or drawing quads or triangles  instead of points.  While point sprites  via GL_POINTS  are an obvious choice  for particles, they also have several drawbacks. First,  hardware often has fairly low limits on point size. If particles  need to be large, or change size over time, the limits might be  a severe restriction. Second, points are usually clipped when  their center moves outside of the view volume. This can cause  "popping" artefacts when the particles have a significant size.  A common solution is to draw quads or triangles instead of  points, using a technique like the one outlined in Chapter 6,  Using Geometry and Tessellation Shaders.  One of the most significant drawbacks of the technique of this recipe is that the particles  can't be recycled easily. When a particle dies, it is simply rendered as transparent. It would  be nice to be able to re-use each dead particle to create an apparently continuous stream of  particles. Additionally, it would be useful to be able to have the particles respond appropriately  to changing accelerations or modifications of the system  for example wind or movement of  the source . With the system described here, we couldn't do so because we are working with a  single equation that defines the movement of the particle for all time. What would be needed  is to incrementally update the positions based on the current forces involved  a simulation .  325   In order to accomplish the previous objective, we need some way to feed the output of the  vertex shader  the particle's updated positions  back into the input of the vertex shader during  the next frame. This would of course be simple if we weren't doing the simulation within  the shader because we could simply update the positions of the primitives directly before  rendering. However, since we are doing the work within the vertex shader we are limited in the  ways that we can write to memory.  In the following recipe, we'll see an example of how to use a new OpenGL feature called  transform feedback to accomplish exactly what was just described. We can designate certain  output variables to be sent to buffers that can be read as input in subsequent rendering passes.  See also   f The Animating a surface with vertex displacement recipe  f The Creating a particle system using transform feedback recipe  Creating a particle system using transform  feedback Transform Feedback provides a way to capture the output of the vertex  or geometry  shader  to a buffer for use in subsequent passes. Originally introduced into OpenGL with version 3.0,  this feature is particularly well suited for particle systems because among other things, it  enables us to do discrete simulations. We can update a particle's position within the vertex  shader and render that updated position in a subsequent pass  or the same pass . Then the  updated positions can be used in the same way as input to the next frame of animation.  In this example, we'll implement the same particle system from the previous recipe    Creating a particle fountain , this time making use of transform feedback. Instead of using  an equation that describes the particle's motion for all time, we'll update the particle positions  incrementally, solving the equations of motion based on the forces involved at the time each  frame is rendered.  A common technique is to make use of the Euler method, which approximates the position  and velocity at time t based on the position, velocity, and acceleration at an earlier time.  326   In the previous equation the subscripts represent the time step  or animation frame , P is  the particle position, and v is the particle velocity. The equations describe the position and  velocity at frame n + 1 as a function of the position and velocity during the previous frame   n . The variable h represents the time step size, or the amount of time that has elapsed  between frames. The term an represents the instantaneous acceleration that is computed  based on the positions of the particles. For our simulation, this will be a constant value, but  in general it might be a value that changes depending on the environment  wind, collisions,  inter-particle interactions, and so on .  The Euler method is actually numerically integrating the Newtonian  equation of motion. It is one of the simplest techniques for doing  so. However, it is a first-order technique, which means that it can  introduce a significant amount of error. More accurate techniques  include Verlet integration, and Runge-Kutta integration. Since our  particle simulation is designed to look good and physical accuracy  is not of high importance, the Euler method should suffice.  To make our simulation work, we'll use a technique sometimes called buffer "ping-ponging."  We maintain two sets of vertex buffers and swap their uses each frame. For example, we use  buffer A to provide the positions and velocities as input to the vertex shader. The vertex shader  updates the positions and velocities using the Euler method and sends the results to buffer B  using transform feedback. Then in a second pass, we render the particles using buffer B.  Update pass  no rasterization   input  Vertex Shader  output  B  Render pass  input  Vertex Shader  to fragment  shader  A  B  In the next frame of animation, we repeat the same process, swapping the two buffers.  327   In general, transform feedback allows us to define a set of shader output variables that are to  be written to a designated buffer  or set of buffers . There are several steps involved that will  be demonstrated, but the basic idea is as follows. Just before the shader program is linked,  we define the relationship between buffers and shader output variables using the function  glTransformFeedbackVaryings. During rendering, we initiate a transform feedback pass.  We bind the appropriate buffers to the transform feedback binding points.  If desired, we can  disable rasterization so that the particles are not rendered.  We enable transform feedback  using the function glBeginTransformFeedback and then draw the point primitives. The  output from the vertex shader will be stored in the appropriate buffers. Then we disable  transform feedback by calling glEndTransformFeedback.  Getting ready Create and allocate three pairs of buffers. The first pair will be for the particle positions, the  second for the particle velocities, and the third for the "start time" for each particle  the time  when the particle comes to life . For clarity, we'll refer to the first buffer in each pair as the   A buffer, and the second as the B buffer. Also, we'll need a single buffer to contain the initial  velocity for each particle.  Create two vertex arrays. The first vertex array should link the A position buffer with the   first vertex attribute  attribute index 0 , the A velocity buffer with vertex attribute one, the   A start time buffer with vertex attribute two, and the initial velocity buffer with vertex attribute  three. The second vertex array should be set up in the same way using the B buffers and the  same initial velocity buffer. In the following code, the handles to the two vertex arrays will be  accessed via the GLuint array named particleArray. Initialize the A buffers with appropriate initial values. For example, all of the positions could  be set to the origin, and the velocities and start times could be initialized in the same way as  described in the previous recipe Creating a particle fountain. The initial velocity buffer could  simply be a copy of the velocity buffer.  When using transform feedback, we define the buffers that will receive the output data   from the vertex shader by binding the buffers to the indexed binding points under the   GL_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_BUFFER target. The index corresponds to the index of the   vertex shader's output variable as defined by glTransformFeedbackVaryings. To help simplify things, we'll make use of transform feedback objects. Use the following code  to set up two transform feedback objects for each set of buffers:  GLuint feedback[2];     Transform feedback objects GLuint posBuf[2];       Position buffers  A and B  GLuint velBuf[2];       Velocity buffers  A and B  GLuint startTime[2];    Start time buffers  A and B     Create and allocate buffers A and B for posBuf, velBuf    and startTime  328      Setup the feedback objects glGenTransformFeedbacks 2, feedback ;     Transform feedback 0 glBindTransformFeedback GL_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK, feedback[0] ; glBindBufferBase GL_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_BUFFER,0,posBuf[0] ; glBindBufferBase GL_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_BUFFER,1,velBuf[0] ; glBindBufferBase GL_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_BUFFER,2,startTime[0] ;     Transform feedback 1 glBindTransformFeedback GL_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK, feedback[1] ; glBindBufferBase GL_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_BUFFER,0,posBuf[1] ; glBindBufferBase GL_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_BUFFER,1,velBuf[1] ; glBindBufferBase GL_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_BUFFER,2,startTime[1] ; Similar to vertex arrays, transform feedback objects store the buffer bindings for the   GL_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_BUFFER binding point so that they can be reset quickly at a later  time. In the previous code, we create two transform feedback objects, and store their handles  in the array named feedback. For the first object, we bind posBuf[0] to index 0, velBuf[0]  to index 1 and startTime[0] to index 2 of the binding point  buffer set A . These bindings  are connected to the shader output variables with glTransformFeedbackVaryings  or  via a layout qualifier, see the There's More following section . The last argument for each is the  buffer's handle. For the second object, we do the same thing using the buffer set B.  Once this is set up, we can define the set of buffers to receive the vertex shader's output, by  binding to one or the other transform feedback object.  The uniform variables that need to be set are the following:   f ParticleTex: It is the texture to apply to the point sprites.  f Time: It defines the simulation time.  f H: It defines the elapsed time between animation frames.  f Accel: It is used to define the acceleration.  f ParticleLifetime: It defines the length of time that a particle exists before    it is recycled.  How to do it... Use the following steps:  1.  Use the following code for your vertex shader:  subroutine void RenderPassType  ; subroutine uniform RenderPassTypeRenderPass; layout  location = 0  in vec3 VertexPosition;  329   layout  location = 1  in vec3 VertexVelocity; layout  location = 2  in float VertexStartTime; layout  location = 3  in vec3 VertexInitialVelocity; out vec3 Position;      To transform feedback out vec3 Velocity;      To transform feedback out float StartTime;    To transform feedback out float Transp;       To fragment shader uniform float Time;     Simulation time uniform float H;        Elapsed time between frames uniform vec3 Accel;     Particle acceleration uniform float ParticleLifetime;     Particle lifespan uniform mat4 MVP; subroutine  RenderPassType  void update   {   Position = VertexPosition;   Velocity = VertexVelocity;   StartTime = VertexStartTime;   if  Time >= StartTime   {     float age = Time - StartTime;     if  age >ParticleLifetime   {          The particle is past its lifetime, recycle.       Position = vec3 0.0 ;       Velocity = VertexInitialVelocity;       StartTime = Time;     } else {          The particle is alive, update.       Position += Velocity * H;       Velocity += Accel * H;     }   } } subroutine  RenderPassType  void render   {   float age = Time - VertexStartTime;   Transp = 1.0 - age   ParticleLifetime;   gl_Position = MVP * vec4 VertexPosition, 1.0 ; } void main   {      This will call either render   or update     RenderPass  ; }  330   2.  Use the following code for the fragment shader:  uniform sampler2D ParticleTex; in float Transp; layout   location = 0   out vec4 FragColor;  void main   {   FragColor = texture ParticleTex, gl_PointCoord ;   FragColor.a *= Transp; }  3.  After compiling the shader program, but before linking, use the following code to set   up the connection between vertex shader output variables and output buffers: const char * outputNames[] = { "Position", "Velocity",     "StartTime" }; glTransformFeedbackVaryings progHandle, 3, outputNames,     GL_SEPARATE_ATTRIBS ;  4.   In the OpenGL render function, send the particle positions to the vertex shader for  updating, and capture the results using transform feedback. The input to the vertex  shader will come from buffer A, and the output will be stored in buffer B. During this  pass we enable GL_RASTERIZER_DISCARD so that nothing is actually rendered to  the framebuffer:    Select the subroutine for particle updating glUniformSubroutinesuiv GL_VERTEX_SHADER, 1, &updateSub ;     Set the uniforms: H and Time …     Disable rendering glEnable GL_RASTERIZER_DISCARD ;     Bind the feedback obj. for the buffers to be drawn glBindTransformFeedback GL_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK,     feedback[drawBuf] ;     Draw points from input buffer with transform feedback glBeginTransformFeedback GL_POINTS ; glBindVertexArray particleArray[1-drawBuf] ; glDrawArrays GL_POINTS, 0, nParticles ; glEndTransformFeedback  ;  331   5.  Render the particles at their updated positions using buffer B as input to the    vertex shader:    Enable rendering glDisable GL_RASTERIZER_DISCARD ;  glUniformSubroutinesuiv GL_VERTEX_SHADER, 1, &renderSub ; glClear  GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT  ;     Initialize uniforms for transform matrices if needed …     Draw the sprites from the feedback buffer glBindVertexArray particleArray[drawBuf] ; glDrawTransformFeedback GL_POINTS, feedback[drawBuf] ;  6.  Swap the purposes of the buffers:     Swap buffers drawBuf = 1 - drawBuf;  How it works... There's quite a bit here to sort through. Let's start with the vertex shader. The vertex shader is broken up into two subroutine functions. The update function is used  during the first pass, and uses Euler's method to update the position and velocity of the  particle. The render function is used during the second pass. It computes the transparency  based on the age of the particle and sends the position and transparency along to the  fragment shader. The vertex shader has four output variables. The first three: Position, Velocity, and  StartTime are used in the first pass to write to the feedback buffers. The fourth  Transp  is  used during the second pass as input to the fragment shader.  The update function just updates the particle position and velocity using Euler's method  unless the particle is not alive yet, or has passed its lifetime. If its age is greater than the  lifetime of a particle, we recycle the particle by resetting its position to the origin, updating  the particle's start time to the current time  Time , and setting its velocity to its original initial  velocity  provided via input attribute VertexInitialVelocity . The render function computes the particle's age and uses it to determine the transparency  of the particle, assigning the result to the output variable Transp. It transforms the particle's  position into clip coordinates and places the result in the built-in output variable gl_Position.  332   The fragment shader  step 2  is only utilized during the second pass. It colors the fragment  based on the texture ParticleTex and the transparency delivered from the vertex   shader  Transp . The code segment in step 3 is placed prior to linking the shader program is responsible  for setting up the correspondence between shader output variables and feedback buffers   buffers that are bound to indices of the GL_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_BUFFER binding point .  The function glTransformFeedbackVaryings takes three arguments. The first is the  handle to the shader program object. The second is the number of output variable names that  will be provided. The third is an array of output variable names. The order of the names in this  list corresponds to the indices of the feedback buffers. In this case, Position corresponds to  index zero, Velocity to index one, and StartTime to index two. Check back to the previous  code that creates our feedback buffer objects  the glBindBufferBase calls  to verify that  this is indeed the case.  glTransformFeedbackVaryings can be used to send  data into an interleaved buffer instead  rather than separate  buffers for each variable . Take a look at the OpenGL  documentation for details.  The previous steps 4 through 6 describes how you might implement the render function within  the main OpenGL program. In this example, there two important GLuint arrays: feedback  and particleArray. They are each of size two and contain the handles to the two feedback  buffer objects, and the two vertex array objects respectively. The variable drawBuf is just an  integer used to alternate between the two sets of buffers. At any given frame, drawBuf will be  either zero or one. The code begins in step 4 by selecting the update subroutine to enable the update  functionality within the vertex shader, and then setting the uniforms Time and H. The next  call, glEnable GL_RASTERIZER_DISCARD , turns rasterization off so that nothing is  rendered during this pass. The call to glBindTransformFeedback selects the set of buffers  corresponding to the variable drawBuf, as the target for the transform feedback output. Before drawing the points  and thereby triggering our vertex shader , we call  glBeginTransformFeedback to enable transform feedback. The argument is the kind of  primitives that will be sent down the pipeline  in our case GL_POINTS . Output from the vertex   or geometry  shader will go to the buffers that are bound to the GL_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_ BUFFER binding point until glEndTransformFeedback is called. In this case, we bind the  vertex array corresponding to 1 - drawBuf  if drawBuf is 0, we use 1 and vice versa  and  draw the particles. At the end of the update pass  step 5 , we re-enable rasterization with glEnable   GL_RASTERIZER_DISCARD , and move on to the render pass.  333   The render pass is straightforward; we just select the render subroutine, and draw the particles  from the vertex array corresponding to drawBuf. However, instead of using glDrawArrays, we  use the function glDrawTransformFeedback. The latter is used here because it is designed  for use with transform feedback. A transform feedback object keeps track of the number of  vertices that were written. A call to glDrawTransformFeedback takes the feedback object  as the third parameter. It uses the number of vertices that were written to that object as the  number of vertices to draw. In essence it is equivalent to calling glDrawArrays with a value of  zero for the second parameter and the count taken from the transform feedback. Finally, at the end of the render pass  step 6 , we swap our buffers by setting drawBuf to   1 – drawBuf.  There's more... You might be wondering why it was necessary to do this in two passes. Why couldn't we just  keep the fragment shader active and do the render and update in the same pass? This is  certainly possible for this example, and would be more efficient. However, I've chosen to  demonstrate it this way because it is probably the more common way of doing this in general.  Particles are usually just one part of a larger scene, and the particle update logic is not  needed for most of the scene. Therefore, in most real-world situations it will make sense to do  the particle update in a pass prior to the rendering pass so that the particle update logic can  be decoupled from the rendering logic.  Using layout qualifiers OpenGL 4.4 introduced layout qualifiers that make it possible to specify the relationship  between the shader output variables and feedback buffers directly within the shader instead of  using glTransformFeedbackVaryings. The layout qualifiers xfb_buffer, xfb_stride,  and xfb_offset can be specified for each output variable that is to be used with   transform feedback.  Querying transform feedback results It is often useful to determine how many primitives were written during transform feedback  pass. For example, if a geometry shader was active, the number of primitives written could be  different than the number of primitives that were sent down the pipeline.  OpenGL provides a way to query for this information using query objects. To do so, start by  creating a query object:  GLuint query; glGenQueries 1, &query ;  334   Then, prior to starting the transform feedback pass, start the counting process using the  following command:  glBeginQuery GL_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_PRIMITIVES_WRITTEN, query ;  After the end of the transform feedback pass, call glEndQuery to stop counting:  glEndQuery GL_TRANSFORM_FEEDBACK_PRIMITIVES_WRITTEN ;  Then we can get the number of primitives using the following code:  GLuintprimWritten; glGetQueryObjectuiv query, GL_QUERY_RESULT, &primWritten ; printf "Primitives written: %d\n", primWritten ;  Recycling particles In this example, we recycled particles by resetting their position and initial velocity. This can  cause the particles to begin to "clump" together over time. It would produce better results to  generate a new random velocity and perhaps a random position  depending on the desired  results . Unfortunately, there is currently no support for random number generation within  shader programs. The solution might be to create your own random number generator  function, use a texture with random values, or use a noise texture  see Chapter 8, Using   Noise in Shaders .  See also   f The Creating a particle fountain recipe  Creating a particle system using instanced  particles To give more geometric detail to each particle in a particle system, we can make use  of OpenGL's support for instanced rendering. Instanced rendering is a convenient and  efficient way to draw several copies of a particular object. OpenGL provides support  for instanced rendering through the functions glDrawArraysInstanced and  glDrawElementsInstanced.  335   In this example, we'll modify the particle system introduced in the previous recipes. Rather  than using point sprites, we'll render a more complex object in the place of each particle. The  following image shows an example where each particle is rendered as a shaded torus.  Using instanced rendering is simply a matter of calling one of the instanced draw functions,  providing the number of instances to draw. However, there is some subtlety to the way that  we provide vertex attributes to the shader. If all particles were drawn with exactly the same  attributes, it would be simple to draw, but would hardly be an interesting result because all  particles would appear at the same location and in the same orientation. Since we'd like to  draw each copy in a different position, we need some way of providing the needed information   in our case, the particle's start time  to the vertex shader separately for each particle. The key to this is the function glVertexAttribDivisor. This function specifies the rate at  which vertex attributes are advanced during instanced rendering. For example, consider the  following setting.  glVertexAttribDivisor 1, 1 ;  The first argument is the vertex attribute index, and the second is the number of instances  that will pass between updates of the attribute. In other words, the previous command  specifies that all vertices of the first instance will receive the first value in the buffer  corresponding to attribute one. The second instance will receive the second value, and so on.  If the second argument was 2, then the first two instances would receive the first value, the  next two would receive the second, and so on in the same way.  The default divisor for each attribute is zero, which means that vertex attributes are processed  normally  the attribute advances once per vertex rather than some number per instance . An  attribute is called an instanced attribute if its divisor is non-zero.  336   Getting ready Start with a particle system as described in Creating a particle fountain. We'll just make a few  modifications to that basic system. Note that you can also use this with transform feedback  if desired, but to keep things simple, we'll use the more basic particle system. It should be  straightforward to adapt this example to the transform feedback based system.  When setting up the vertex array object for your particle shape, add two new instanced  attributes for the initial velocity and start time. Something similar to the following code should  do the trick:  glBindVertexArray myVArray ;     Set up the pointers for attributes 0, 1, and 2  position,      normal, and texture coord.  …     Initial velocity  attribute 3  glBindBuffer GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, initVel ; glVertexAttribPointer 3, 3, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, 0, NULL ; glEnableVertexAttribArray 3 ; glVertexAttribDivisor 3, 1 ;     Start time  attribute 4  glBindBuffer GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, startTime ; glVertexAttribPointer 4, 1, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, 0, NULL ; glEnableVertexAttribArray 4 ; glVertexAttribDivisor 4, 1 ;     Bind to the element array buffer if necessary  Note the use of glVertexAttribDivisor in the previous code. This indicates that attributes  3 and 4 are instanced attributes  the values in the arrays are to be advanced only once per  instance, rather than once per vertex . Therefore the size of the buffers must be proportional  to the number of instances rather than the number of vertices in an instance. The buffers for  attributes 0, 1 and 2 should  as usual  be sized in relation to the number of vertices.  The value of the vertex attribute divisor becomes part of the vertex  array object's state, so that just like the other elements of the  VAO's state, we can reset it at a later point by binding to the VAO.  337   How to do it... Use the following steps:  1.  The vertex shader code is nearly identical to the code shown in the previous recipe   Creating a particle fountain. The difference lies in the input and output variables. Use  something similar to the following: layout  location = 0  in vec3 VertexPosition; layout  location = 1  in vec3 VertexNormal; layout  location = 2  in vec3 VertexTexCoord; layout  location = 3  in vec3 VertexInitialVelocity; layout  location = 4  in float StartTime;  out vec3 Position; out vec3 Normal;  2.  Within the main function, update the position of the vertex by translating it using the   equation of motion: Position = VertexPosition + VertexInitialVelocity * t +             Gravity * t * t;  3.  Be sure to pass along the normal, and updated position  in camera coordinates  to   4.  5.   the fragment shader. In the fragment shader, implement your favorite shading model. In the main OpenGL program, within the render function, render the instances using  the following code: glBindVertexArray myVArray ; glDrawElementsInstanced GL_TRIANGLES, nEls,                GL_UNSIGNED_INT, 0, nParticles ;  How it works... Recall that the first three input attributes to the vertex shader are not-instanced, meaning that  they are advanced every vertex  and repeated every instance . The last two  attributes 3 and  4  are instanced attributes and only update every instance. Therefore, the effect is that each  instance is translated by the result of the equation of motion. The glDrawElementsInstanced function  step 5  will draw nParticles instances of the  object. Of course nEls is the number of vertices in each instance.  338   There's more... OpenGL provides a built-in variable to the vertex shader named gl_InstanceID. This is  simply a counter and takes on a different value for each instance that is rendered. The first  instance will have an ID of zero, the second will have an ID of one, and so on. This can be  useful as a way to index to texture data appropriate for each instance. Another possibility  is to use the instance's ID as a way to generate some random data for that instance. For  example, we could use the instance ID  or some hash  as a seed to a pseudo-random number  generation routine to get a unique random stream for each instance.  See also   f The Creating a particle fountain recipe  f The Creating a particle system using transform feedback recipe  Simulating fire with particles To create an effect that roughly simulates fire, we only need to make a few changes to our  basic particle system. Since fire is a substance that is only slightly affected by gravity, we   don't worry about a downward gravitational acceleration. In fact, we'll actually use a slight  upwards acceleration to make the particles spread out near the top of the flame. We'll also  spread out the initial positions of the particles so that the base of the flame is not just a  single point. Of course, we'll need to use a particle texture that has the red and orange colors  associated with flame.  The following image shows an example of the running particle system:  The texture that was used for the particles looks like a light "smudge" of the flame's colors. It  is not shown here because it would not be very visible in print.  339   Getting ready Start with the basic particle system presented in the recipe Creating a particle system using  transform feedback earlier in this chapter. Set the uniform variable Accel to a small upward value like  0.0, 0.1, 0.0 . Set the uniform variable ParticleLifetime to about four seconds. Create and load a texture for the particles that has fire-like colors. Bind it to the first texture  channel, and set the uniform ParticleTex to zero. Use a point size of about 50.0. This is a good size for the texture that is used in this recipe,  but you might use a different size depending on the number of particles and the texture.  How to do it... Use the following steps:  1.  When setting up the initial positions for your particles, instead of using the origin for   all particles, use a random x location. The following code could be used: GLfloat *data = new GLfloat[nParticles * 3]; for  int i = 0; i < nParticles * 3; i += 3   {   data[i] = glm::mix -2.0f, 2.0f, randFloat   ;   data[i+1] = 0.0f;   data[i+2] = 0.0f; } glBindBuffer GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, posBuf[0] ; glBufferSubData GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, 0, size, data ;  2.  When setting up the initial velocities, we'll make sure that the x and z components  are zero and the y component contains a random speed. This, combined with the  chosen acceleration  see the previous code  makes each particle move in only the y   vertical  direction:    Fill the first velocity buffer with random velocities for  unsigned int i = 0; i < nParticles; i++   {   data[3*i]   = 0.0f;   data[3*i+1] = glm::mix 0.1f,0.5f,randFloat   ;   data[3*i+2] = 0.0f; } glBindBuffer GL_ARRAY_BUFFER,velBuf[0] ; glBufferSubData GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, 0, size, data ; glBindBuffer GL_ARRAY_BUFFER,initVel ; glBufferSubData GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, 0, size, data ;  340   3.   In the vertex shader, when recycling particles, reset the y and z coordinates, but don't  change the x coordinate: if  age > ParticleLifetime   {      The particle is past its lifetime, recycle.   Position = vec3 VertexPosition.x, 0.0, 0.0 ;   Velocity = VertexInitialVelocity;   StartTime = Time; }  How it works... We randomly distribute the x-coordinate of the initial positions between -2.0 and 2.0 for all of  the particles, and set the initial velocities to have a y-coordinate between 0.1 and 0.5. Since  the acceleration has only a y-component, the particles will move only along a straight, vertical  line in the y direction. The x or z component of the position should always remain at zero. This  way, when recycling the particles, we can simply just reset the y coordinate to zero, to restart  the particle at its initial position.  There's more... Of course, if you want a flame that moves in different directions, perhaps blown in the wind,  you'd need to use a different value for the acceleration. In which case, our little trick for  resetting particles to their initial position will no longer work. However, we only need to add  another buffer to our particle system  similar to the initial velocity buffer  to maintain the  initial position and re-use it when recycling particles.  See also   f The Creating a particle system using transform feedback recipe  Simulating smoke with particles Smoke is characterized by many small particles that float away from the source, and spread  out as they move through the air. We can simulate the floatation effect with particles by using  a small upwards acceleration  or constant velocity , but simulating the diffusion of each small  smoke particle would be too expensive. Instead, we can simulate the diffusion of many small  particles by making our simulated particles change their size  grow  over time.  341   The following image shows an example of the results:  The texture for each particle is a very light "smudge" of grey or black color. To make the particles grow over time, we'll make use of the GL_PROGRAM_POINT_SIZE  functionality in OpenGL, which allows us to modify the point size within the vertex shader.  Alternatively, we could draw quads, or use the geometry shader to  generate the quads using the technique demonstrated in Chapter 6,  Using Geometry and Tessellation Shaders.  Getting ready Start with the basic particle system presented in the recipe Creating a particle system using  transform feedback. Set the uniform variable Accel to a small upward value like  0.0, 0.1, 0.0 . Set the uniform variable ParticleLifetime to about six seconds. Create and load a texture for the particles that looks like just light grey smudge. Bind it to  texture unit zero, and set the uniform ParticleTex to zero. Set the uniform variables MinParticleSize and MaxParticleSize to 10 and   200 respectively.  342   How to do it... Use the following steps:  1.  Set the initial positions to the origin. Define the initial velocities in the same way  as described in the recipe Creating a particle system using transform feedback.  However, it looks best when you use a large variance in theta.  2.  Within the vertex shader, add the following uniforms:  uniform float MinParticleSize; uniform float MaxParticleSize;  3.  Also within the vertex shader, use the following code for the render function:  subroutine  RenderPassType  void render   {   float age = Time - VertexStartTime;   Transp = 0.0;   if  Time >= VertexStartTime   {     float agePct = age ParticleLifetime;     Transp = 1.0 - agePct;     gl_PointSize =          mix MinParticleSize,MaxParticleSize,agePct ;   }   gl_Position = MVP * vec4 VertexPosition, 1.0 ; } In the main OpenGL application, before rendering your particles, make sure to enable  GL_PROGRAM_POINT_SIZE: glEnable GL_PROGRAM_POINT_SIZE ;  4.   How it works... The render subroutine function sets the built-in variable gl_PointSize to a value between  MinParticleSize and MaxParticleSize, determined by the age of the particle. This  causes the size of the particles to grow as they evolve through the system. Note that the variable gl_PointSize is ignored by OpenGL unless GL_PROGRAM_POINT_ SIZE is enabled.  See also   f The Creating a particle system using transform feedback recipe  343    10  Using Compute Shaders  In this chapter, we will cover the following recipes:   f Implementing a particle simulation with the compute shader  f Using the compute shader for cloth simulation  f Implementing an edge detection filter with the compute shader  f Creating a fractal texture using the compute shader  Introduction Compute shaders were introduced into OpenGL with Version 4.3. A compute shader is a  shader stage that can be used for arbitrary computation. It provides the ability to leverage the  GPU and its inherent parallelism for general computing tasks that might have previously been  implemented in serial on the CPU. The compute shader is most useful for tasks that are not  directly related to rendering, such as physical simulation.  Although APIs such as OpenCL and CUDA are already available  for general purpose computation on the GPU, they are completely  separate from OpenGL. Compute shaders are integrated directly  within OpenGL, and therefore are more suitable for general  computing tasks that are more closely related to graphics rendering.  The compute shader is not a traditional shader stage in the same sense as the fragment or  vertex shader. It is not executed in response to rendering commands. In fact, when a compute  shader is linked with vertex, fragment, or other shader stages, it is effectively inert when  drawing commands are executed. The only way to execute the compute shader is via the  OpenGL commands glDispatchCompute or glDispatchComputeIndirect.   Compute shaders do not have any direct user-defined inputs and no outputs at all. It gets its  work by fetching data directly from memory using image access functions such as the image  load store operations, or via shader storage buffer objects. Similarly, it provides its results by  writing to the same or other objects. The only non-user-defined inputs to a compute shader are  a set of variables that determine where the shader invocation is within its "space" of execution.  The number of invocations of the compute shader is completely user defined. It is not tied in  any way to the number of vertices or fragments being rendered. We specify the number of  invocations by defining the number of work groups, and the number of invocations within each  work group.  Compute space and work groups The number of invocations of a compute shader is governed by the user-defined compute  space. This space is divided into a number of work groups. Each work group is then broken  down into a number of invocations. We think of this in terms of the global compute space  all  shader invocations  and the local work group space  the invocations within a particular work  group . The compute space can be defined as a 1, 2 or 3 dimensional space.  Technically, it is always defined as a three-dimensional space,  but any of the three dimensions can be defined with a size of  one  1 , which effectively removes that dimension.  For example, a one-dimensional compute space with five work groups and three invocations  per work group could be represented as the following figure. The thicker lines represent the  work groups, and the thinner lines represent the invocations within each work group.  0  1  2  3  4  In this case, we have 5 * 3 = 15 shader invocations. The grey shaded invocation is in work  group 2, and within that work group, it is invocation 1  the invocations are indexed starting  at zero . We can also refer to that invocation with a global index of 7, by indexing the total  number of invocations starting at zero. The global index determines an invocation's location  within the global compute space, rather than just within the work group. It is determined by  taking the product of work group  2  and index number of invocations per work group  3 , plus  the local invocation index  1  that is 2 * 3 + 1 = 7. The global index is simply the index of each  invocation in the global compute space, starting at zero on the left and counting from there.  The following figure shows a representation of a two-dimensional compute space where   the space is divided into 20 work groups, four in the x direction and five in the y direction.  Each work group is then divided into nine invocations, three in the x direction and three in   the y direction.  346   4  3  2  1  0  0  1  2  3  Work groups  Shader invocations  The cell that is shaded in gray represents invocation  0, 1  within work group  2, 0 . The total  number of compute shader invocations in this example is then 20 * 9 = 180. The global index  of this shaded invocation is  6, 1 . As with the one-dimensional case, this index is determined  by thinking of it as a global compute space  without the work groups , and can be computed   for each dimension  by the number of invocations per work group times the work group index,  plus the local invocation index. For the x dimension, this would be 3 * 2 + 0 = 6, and for the y  dimension it is 3 * 0 + 1 = 1.  The same idea can extend in a straightforward manner to a three-dimensional compute  space. In general, we choose the dimensionality based on the data to be processed. For  example, if I'm working on the physics of a particle simulation, I would just have a list of  particles to process, so a one-dimensional compute space might make sense. On the other  hand, if I'm processing a cloth simulation, the data has a grid structure, so a two-dimensional  compute space would be appropriate.  There are limits on the total number of work groups and local  shader invocations. These can be queried  via glGetInteger*   using the parameters GL_MAX_COMPUTE_WORK_GROUP_ COUNT, GL_MAX_COMPUTE_WORK_GROUP_SIZE, and GL_ MAX_COMPUTE_WORK_GROUP_INVOCATIONS.  The order of execution of the work groups and thereby the individual shader invocations is  unspecified and the system can execute them in any order. Therefore, we shouldn't rely on  any particular ordering of the work groups. Local invocations within a particular work group  will be executed in parallel  if possible . Therefore, any communication between invocations  should be done with great care. Invocations within a work group can communicate via shared  local data, but invocations should not  in general  communicate with invocations in other work  groups without consideration of the various pitfalls involved such as deadlock and data races.  In fact, those can also be issues for local shared data within a work group as well, and care  must be taken to avoid these problems. In general, for reasons of efficiency, it is best to only  attempt communication within a work group. As with any kind of parallel programming, "there  be dragons here".  347   OpenGL provides a number of atomic operations and memory barriers that can help with the  communication between invocations. We'll see some examples in the recipes that follow.  Executing the Compute Shader When we execute the compute shader, we define the compute space. The number of work  groups are determined by the parameters to glDispatchCompute. For example, to execute  the compute shader with a two-dimensional compute space with 4 work groups in the x  dimension and 5 work groups in the y dimension  matching the preceding figure , we'd use the  following call:  glDispatchCompute  4, 5, 1  ;  The number of local invocations within each work group is not specified on the OpenGL   side. Instead, it is specified within the compute shader itself with a layout specifier. For  example, here we specify nine local invocations per work group, 3 in the x direction and 3   in the y direction.  layout  local_size_x = 3, local_size_y = 3  in;  The size in the z dimension can be left out  the default is one .  When a particular invocation of the compute shader is executing, it usually needs to  determine where it is within the global compute space. GLSL provides a number of built-in  input variables that help with this. Most of them are listed in the following table:  Variable  gl_WorkGroupSize  gl_NumWorkGroups  gl_WorkGroupID  Type  uvec3  uvec3  uvec3  gl_LocalInvocationID  uvec3  gl_GlobalInvocationID  uvec3  Meaning The number of invocations per work  group in each dimension. Same as what  is defined in the layout specifier. The total number of work groups in each  dimension. The index of the current work group for  this shader invocation. The index of the current invocation within  the current work group. The index of the current invocation within  the global compute space.  The last one in the preceding table, gl_GlobalInvocationID is computed in the following  way  each operation is component-wise :  gl_WorkGroupID * gl_WorkGroupSize + gl_LocalInvocationID  348   This helps us to locate the current invocation within the global compute space  Refer to the  preceding examples .  GLSL also defines gl_LocalInvocationIndex, which is a flattened form of   gl_LocalInvocationID. It can help when multidimensional data is provided in   a linear buffer, but is not used in any of the examples that follow.  Implementing a particle simulation with the  compute shader In this recipe, we'll implement a simple particle simulation. We'll have the compute shader  handle the physics computations and update the particle positions directly. Then, we'll just  render the particles as points. Without the compute shader, we'd need to update the positions  on the CPU by stepping through the array of particles and updating each position in a serial  fashion, or by making use of transform feedback as shown in the Creating a particle system  using transform feedback recipe in Chapter 9, Particle Systems and Animation. Doing such  animations with vertex shaders is sometimes counterintuitive and requires some additional  work  such as transform feedback setup . With the compute shader, we can do the particle  physics in parallel on the GPU, and customize our compute space to get the most "bang for  the buck" out of our GPU.  The following figure shows our particle simulation running with one million particles. Each  particle is rendered as a 1 x 1 point. The particles are partially transparent, and the particle  attractors are rendered as small 5 x 5 squares  barely visible .  These simulations can create beautiful, abstract figures, and are a lot of fun to produce.  349   For our simulation, we'll define a set of attractors  two in this case, but you can create more ,  which I'll call the black holes. They will be the only objects that affect our particles and they'll  apply a force on each particle that is inversely proportional to the distance between the  particle and the black hole. More formally, the force on each particle will be determined by the  following equation:  Where N is the number of black holes  attractors , ri is the vector between the ith attractor  and the particle  determined by the position of the attractor minus the particle position , and  Gi is the strength of the ith attractor. To implement the simulation, we compute the force on each particle and then update the  position by integrating the Newtonian equations of motion. There are a number of well studied  numerical techniques for integrating the equations of motion. For this simulation, the simple  Euler method is sufficient. With the Euler method, the position of the particle at time t + Δt is  given by the following equation:  Where P is the position of the particle, v is the velocity, and a is the acceleration. Similarly, the  updated velocity is determined by the following equation:  These equations are derived from a Taylor expansion of the position function about time t. The  result is dependent upon the size of the time step  Δt , and is more accurate when the time  step is very small.  The acceleration is directly proportional to the force on the particle, so by calculating the  force on the particle  using the preceding equation , we essentially have a value for the  acceleration. To simulate the particle's motion, we track its position and velocity, determine  the force on the particle due to the black holes, and then update the position and velocity  using the equations.  We'll use the compute shader to implement the physics here. Since we're just working with a  list of particles, we'll use a one-dimensional compute space, and work groups of about 1000  particles each. Each invocation of the compute shader will be responsible for updating the  position of a single particle.  We'll use shader storage buffer objects to track the positions and velocities, and when  rendering the particles themselves, we can just render directly from the position buffer.  350   Getting ready In the OpenGL side, we need a buffer for the position of the particles and a buffer for the  velocity. Create a buffer containing the initial positions of the particles and a buffer with  zeroes for the initial velocities. We'll use four-component positions and velocities for this  example in order to avoid issues with data layouts. For example, to create the buffer for the  positions, we might do something as follows:  vector  initPos;  …    Set initial positions  GLuint bufSize = totalParticles * 4 * sizeof GLfloat ;  GLuint posBuf; glGenBuffers 1, &posBuf ; glBindBufferBase GL_SHADER_STORAGE_BUFFER, 0, posBuf ; glBufferData GL_SHADER_STORAGE_BUFFER, bufSize, &initPos[0],                GL_DYNAMIC_DRAW ;  Use a similar process for the velocity data, but bind it to index one of the GL_SHADER_ STORAGE_BUFFER binding location.  glBindBufferBase GL_SHADER_STORAGE_BUFFER, 1, velBuf ;  Set up a vertex array object that uses the same position buffer as its data source for the  vertex position.  To render the points, set up a vertex and fragment shader pair that just produces a solid color.  Enable blending and set up a standard blending function.  How to do it... Use the following steps:  1.  We'll use the compute shader for updating the positions of the particles.  layout  local_size_x = 1000   in;  uniform float Gravity1 = 1000.0; uniform vec3 BlackHolePos1; uniform float Gravity2 = 1000.0; uniform vec3 BlackHolePos2;  uniform float ParticleInvMass = 1.0   0.1; uniform float DeltaT = 0.0005;  351   layout std430, binding=0  buffer Pos {   vec4 Position[]; }; layout std430, binding=1  buffer Vel {   vec4 Velocity[]; };  void main   {   uint idx = gl_GlobalInvocationID.x;    vec3 p = Position[idx].xyz;   vec3 v = Velocity[idx].xyz;       Force from black hole 1   vec3 d = BlackHolePos1 - p;   vec3 force =  Gravity1   length d   * normalize d ;         Force from black hole 2   d = BlackHolePos2 - p;   force +=  Gravity2   length d   * normalize d ;       Apply simple Euler integrator   vec3 a = force * ParticleInvMass;   Position[idx] = vec4          p + v * DeltaT + 0.5 * a * DeltaT * DeltaT, 1.0 ;   Velocity[idx] = vec4  v + a * DeltaT, 0.0 ; }  2.   In the render routine, invoke the compute shader to update the particle positions. glDispatchCompute totalParticles   1000, 1, 1 ;  3.  Then make sure that all data has been written out to the buffer, by invoking a   memory barrier. glMemoryBarrier  GL_SHADER_STORAGE_BARRIER_BIT  ;  4.  Finally, render the particles using data in the position buffer.  How it works... The compute shader starts by defining the number of invocations per work group using the  layout specifier.  layout  local_size_x = 1000   in;  352   This specifies 1000 invocations per work group in the x dimension. You can choose a value for  this that makes the most sense for the hardware on which you're running. Just make sure to  adjust the number of work groups appropriately. The default size for each dimension is one so  we don't need to specify the size of the y and z directions.  Then, we have a set of uniform variables that define the simulation parameters. Gravity1  and Gravity2 are the strengths of the two black holes  G in the above equation , and  BlackHolePos1 and BlackHolePos2 are their positions. ParticleInvMass is the inverse  of the mass of each particle, which is used to convert force to acceleration. Finally, DeltaT is  the time-step size, used in the Euler method for integration of the equations of motion.  The buffers for position and velocity are declared next. Note that the binding values here  match those that we used on the OpenGL side when initializing the buffers.  Within the main function, we start by determining the index of the particle for which this  invocation is responsible. Since we're working with a linear list of particles, and the number   of particles is the same as the number of shader invocations, what we want is the index within  the global range of invocations. This index is available via the built-in input variable   gl_GlobalInvocationID.x. We use the global index here because it is the index within  the entire buffer that we need, not the index within our work group, which would only  reference a portion of the entire array.  Next we retrieve the position and velocity from their buffers, and compute the force due to each  black hole, storing the sum in the variable force. Then we convert the force to acceleration  and update the particle's position and velocity using the Euler method. We write to the same  location from which we read previously. Since invocations do not share data, this is safe.  In the render routine, we invoke the compute shader  step 2 in How to do it... , defining the  number of work groups per dimension. In the compute shader, we specified a work group size  of 1000. Since we want one invocation per particle, we divide the total number of particles by  1000 to determine the number of work groups.  Finally, in step 3, before rendering the particles, we need to invoke a memory barrier to ensure  that all compute shader writes have fully executed.  See also   f Refer to Chapter 9, Particle Systems and Animation, for other particle simulations.  Most of these have been implemented using transform feedback, but could instead  be implemented using the compute shader.  353   Using the compute shader for cloth  simulation The compute shader is well suited for harnessing the GPU for physical simulation. Cloth  simulation is a prime example. In this recipe, we'll implement a simple particle-spring based  cloth simulation using the compute shader. The following is a screenshot of the simulation of  a cloth hanging by five pins.  You'll have to imagine it animating.   A common way to represent cloth is with a particle-spring lattice. The cloth is composed of  a 2D grid of point masses, each connected to its eight neighboring masses with idealized  springs. The following figure represents one of the point masses  center  connected to its  neighboring masses. The lines represent the springs. The dark lines are the horizontal vertical  springs and the dashed lines are the diagonal springs.  354   The total force on a particle is the sum of the forces produced by the eight springs to which it  is connected. The force for a single spring is given by the following equation:  Where K is the stiffness of the spring, R is the rest-length of the spring  the length where  the spring applies zero force , and r is the vector between the neighboring particle and the  particle  the neighbor's position minus the particle's position .  Similar to the previous recipe, the process is simply to compute the total force on each  particle and then integrate Newton's equations of motion using our favorite integration. Again,  we'll use the Euler method for this example. For details on the Euler method, refer to the  previous recipe, Implementing a particle simulation with the compute shader.  This particle-spring lattice is obviously a two-dimensional structure, so it makes sense to  map it to a two-dimensional compute space. We'll define rectangular work groups and use  one shader invocation per particle. Each invocation needs to read the positions of its eight  neighbors, compute the force on the particle, and update the particle's position and velocity.  Note that in this case, each invocation needs to read the positions of the neighboring  particles. Those neighboring particles will be updated by other shader invocations. Since we  can't rely on any execution order for the shader invocations, we can't read and write directly  to the same buffer. If we were to do so, we wouldn't know for sure whether we are reading the  original positions of the neighbors or their updated positions. To avoid this problem, we'll use  pairs of buffers. For each simulation step, one buffer will be designated for reading and the  other for writing, then we'll swap them for the next step, and repeat.  It might be possible to read write to the same buffer with  careful use of local shared memory; however, there is still  the issue of the particles along the edges of the work group.  Their neighbor's positions are managed by another work  group, and again, we have the same problem.  This simulation tends to be quite sensitive to numerical noise, so we need to use a very small  integration time step. A value of around 0.000005 works well. Additionally, the simulation  looks better when we apply a damping force to simulate air resistance. A good way to simulate  air resistance is to add a force that is proportional to and in the opposite direction to the  velocity, as in the following equation:  Where D is the strength of the damping force and v is the velocity of the particle.  355   Getting ready Start by setting up two buffers for the particle position and two for the particle velocity. We'll  bind them to the GL_SHADER_STORAGE_BUFFER indexed binding point at indices 0 and 1  for the position buffers and 2 and 3 for the velocity buffers. The data layout in these buffers  is important. We'll lay out the particle positions velocities in row-major order starting at the  lower left and proceeding to the upper right of the lattice.  We'll also set up a vertex array object for drawing the cloth using the particle positions as  triangle vertices. We may also need buffers for normal vectors and texture coordinates. For  brevity, I'll omit them from this discussion, but the example code for this book includes them.  How to do it... Use the following steps:  1.   In the compute shader, we start by defining the number of invocations per   work group. layout  local_size_x = 10, local_size_y = 10   in;  2.  Then, define a set of uniform variables for the simulation parameters.  3.  Next, declare the shader storage buffer pairs for the position and velocity.  uniform vec3 Gravity = vec3 0,-10,0 ; uniform float ParticleMass = 0.1; uniform float ParticleInvMass = 1.0   0.1; uniform float SpringK = 2000.0; uniform float RestLengthHoriz; uniform float RestLengthVert; uniform float RestLengthDiag; uniform float DeltaT = 0.000005; uniform float DampingConst = 0.1;  layout std430, binding=0  buffer PosIn {   vec4 PositionIn[]; }; layout std430, binding=1  buffer PosOut {   vec4 PositionOut[]; }; layout std430, binding=2  buffer VelIn {   vec4 VelocityIn[]; }; layout std430, binding=3  buffer VelOut {   vec4 VelocityOut[]; };  356   4.   In the main function, we get the position of the particle for which this invocation   is responsible. void main   {   uvec3 nParticles = gl_NumWorkGroups * gl_WorkGroupSize;   uint idx = gl_GlobalInvocationID.y * nParticles.x +               gl_GlobalInvocationID.x;    vec3 p = vec3 PositionIn[idx] ;   vec3 v = vec3 VelocityIn[idx] , r;  5.   Initialize our force with the force due to gravity.   vec3 force = Gravity * ParticleMass;  6.  Add the force due to the particle above this one.    if  gl_GlobalInvocationID.y < nParticles.y - 1   {     r = PositionIn[idx + nParticles.x].xyz - p;     force += normalize r *SpringK* length r  -                                   RestLengthVert ;   }   the force due to the particle that is diagonally above and to the left.   if  gl_GlobalInvocationID.x > 0 &&        gl_GlobalInvocationID.y < nParticles.y - 1   {     r = PositionIn[idx + nParticles.x - 1].xyz - p;     force += normalize r *SpringK* length r  -                                   RestLengthDiag ;   }  7.  Repeat the preceding steps for the particles below and to the left and right. Then add   8.  Repeat the above for the other three diagonally connected particles. Then add the   damping force.   force += -DampingConst * v;  9.  Next, we integrate the equations of motion using the Euler method.    vec3 a = force * ParticleInvMass;   PositionOut[idx] = vec4        p + v * DeltaT + 0.5 * a * DeltaT * DeltaT, 1.0 ;   VelocityOut[idx] = vec4  v + a * DeltaT, 0.0 ;  10.  Finally, we pin some of the top verts so that they do not move.    if  gl_GlobalInvocationID.y == nParticles.y - 1 &&         gl_GlobalInvocationID.x == 0          gl_GlobalInvocationID.x == nParticles.x   4         gl_GlobalInvocationID.x == nParticles.x * 2   4   357          gl_GlobalInvocationID.x == nParticles.x * 3   4         gl_GlobalInvocationID.x == nParticles.x - 1   {     PositionOut[idx] = vec4 p, 1.0 ;     VelocityOut[idx] = vec4 0,0,0,0 ;   } }  11.  Within the OpenGL render function, we invoke the compute shader such that each  work group is responsible for 100 particles. Since the time step size is so small, we  need to execute the process many times  1000 , each time swapping the input and  output buffers. for  int i = 0; i < 1000; i++   {   glDispatchCompute nParticles.x 10, nParticles.y 10, 1 ;   glMemoryBarrier  GL_SHADER_STORAGE_BARRIER_BIT  ;       Swap buffers   readBuf = 1 - readBuf;    glBindBufferBase GL_SHADER_STORAGE_BUFFER,0,                     posBufs[readBuf] ;   glBindBufferBase GL_SHADER_STORAGE_BUFFER,1,                    posBufs[1-readBuf] ;   glBindBufferBase GL_SHADER_STORAGE_BUFFER,2,                    velBufs[readBuf] ;   glBindBufferBase GL_SHADER_STORAGE_BUFFER,3,                    velBufs[1-readBuf] ; }  12. Finally, we render the cloth using the position data from the position buffer.  How it works... We use 100 invocations per work group, 10 in each dimension. The first statement in the  compute shader defines the number of invocations per work group.  layout  local_size_x = 10, local_size_y = 10   in;  The uniform variables that follow define the constants in the force equations and the rest  lengths for each of the horizontal, vertical, and diagonal springs. The time step size is  DeltaT. The position and velocity buffers are declared next. We define the position buffers at  binding indexes 0 and 1, and the velocity buffers at indexes 2 and 3.  358   In the main function  step 4 , we start by determining the number of particles in each  dimension. This is going to be the same as the number of work groups times the work group  size. Next, we determine the index of the particle for which this invocation is responsible.  Since the particles are organized in the buffers in row-major order, we compute the index by  the global invocation ID in the y direction times the number of particles in the x dimension  plus the global invocation ID in the x direction.  In step 5, we initialize our force with the gravitational force, Gravity times the mass of  a particle  ParticleMass . Note that it's not really necessary here to multiply by the  mass since all particles have the same mass. We could just pre-multiply the mass into the  gravitational constant.  In steps 6 and 7, we add the force on this particle due to each of the eight neighboring  particles connected by virtual springs. For each spring, we add the force due to that spring.  However, we first need to check to see if we are on the edge of the lattice. If we are, there  may not be a neighboring particle  see the following figure . For example, in the preceding  code, when computing the force due to the spring particle above, we verify that gl_ GlobalInvocationID.y is less than the number of particles in the y dimension minus  one. If that is true, there must be a particle above this one. Otherwise, the current particle  is on the top edge of the lattice and there is no neighboring particle above.  Essentially, gl_ GlobalInvocationID contains the particle's location in the overall lattice.  We can do a  similar test for the other three horizontal vertical directions. When computing the force for the  diagonally connected particles we need to check that we're not on a horizontal and a vertical  edge. For example, in the preceding code, we're looking for the particle that is above and to  the left, so we check that gl_GlobalInvocationID.x is greater than zero  were not on the  left edge , and that gl_GlobalInvocationID.y is less than the number of particles in the  y direction minus one  were not on the top edge .  Once we verify that the neighboring particle exists, we compute the force due to the spring  connected to that particle and add it to the total force. We organized our particles in row- major order in the buffer. Therefore, to access the position of the neighboring particle we take  the index of the current particle and add subtract the number of particles in the x direction to  move vertically, and or add subtract one to move horizontally.  359   In step 8, we apply the damping force that simulates air resistance, by adding to the total  force DampingConst times the velocity. The minus sign here assures that the force is in the  opposite direction of the velocity.  In step 9 we apply the Euler method to update the position and velocity based on the force.  We multiply the force by the inverse of the particle mass to get the acceleration, then store  the results of the Euler integration into the corresponding positions in the output buffers.  Finally, in step 10, we reset the position of the particle if it is located at one of the 5 pin  positions at the top of the cloth.  Within the OpenGL render function  step 11 , we invoke the compute shader multiple times,  switching the input output buffers after each invocation. After calling glDispatchCompute,  we issue a glMemoryBarrier call to make sure that all shader writes have completed  before swapping the buffers. Once that is complete, we go ahead and render the cloth using  the positions from the shader storage buffer.  There's more... For rendering, it is useful to have normal vectors. One option is to create another compute  shader to recalculate the normal vectors after the positions are updated. For example, we  might execute the preceding compute shader 1000 times, dispatch the other compute shader  once to update the normals, and then render the cloth.  Additionally, we may be able to achieve better performance with the use of local shared data  within the work group. In the above implementation the position of each particle is read a  maximum of eight times. Each read can be costly in terms of execution time. It is faster to  read from memory that is closer to the GPU. One way to achieve this is to read data into local  shared memory once, and then read from the shared memory for subsequent reads. In the  next recipe, we'll see an example of how this is done. It would be straightforward to update  this recipe in a similar way.  See also   f The Implementing an edge detection filter with the compute shader recipe  360   Implementing an edge detection filter with  the compute shader In the Applying an edge detection filter recipe in Chapter 5, Image Processing and Screen  Space Techniques, we saw an example of how to implement edge detection using the  fragment shader. The fragment shader is well suited for many image processing operations,  because we can trigger execution of the fragment shader for each pixel by rendering a screen- filling quad. Since image processing filters are often applied to the result of a render, we can  render to a texture, then invoke the fragment shader for each screen pixel  by rendering a  quad , and each fragment shader invocation is then responsible for processing a single pixel.  Each invocation might need to read from several locations in the  rendered  image texture,  and a texel might be read multiple times from different invocations.  This works well for many situations, but the fragment shader was not designed for image  processing. With the compute shader, we can have more fine grained control over the  distribution of shader invocations, and we can make use of local shared memory to gain a bit  more efficiency with data reads.  In this example, we'll re-implement the edge detection filter using the compute shader. We'll  make use of local  work group  shared memory to gain additional speed. Since this local  memory is closer to the GPU, memory accesses are faster than they would be when reading  directly from the shader storage buffers  or textures .  As with the previous recipe, we'll implement this using the Sobel operator, which is made up of  two 3 x 3 filter kernels shown as follows:  For details on the Sobel operator, please refer to Chapter 5, Image Processing and Screen  Space Techniques. The key point here is that in order to compute the result for a given pixel,  we need to read the values of the eight neighboring pixels. This means that the value of each  pixel needs to be fetched up to eight times  when processing the neighbors of that pixel . To  gain some additional speed, we'll copy the needed data into local shared memory so that  within a work group, we can read from the shared memory rather than fetching from the  shader storage buffer.  Work group shared memory is generally faster to access  than texture or shader storage memory.  361   In this example, we'll use one compute shader invocation per pixel, and a 2D work group size  of 25 x 25. Before computing the Sobel operator, we'll copy the corresponding pixel values into  local shared memory for the work group. For each pixel, in order to compute the filter, we need to  read the values of the eight neighboring pixels. In order to do so for the pixels on the edge of the  work group, we need to include in our local memory an extra strip of pixels outside the edges of  the work group. Therefore, for a work group size of 25 x 25, we'll need storage of size 27 x 27.  Getting ready Start by setting up for rendering to a Framebuffer Object  FBO  with a color texture attached,  we'll render the raw pre-filtered image to this texture. Create a second texture to receive the  output from the edge detection filter. Bind this latter texture to unit 0. We'll use this as the  output from the compute shader. Bind the FBO texture to image texture unit 0, and the second  texture to image texture unit 1 using glBindImageTexture.  Next, set up a vertex fragment shader pair for rendering directly to the FBO, and for rendering  a full-screen texture.  How to do it... Use the following steps:  1.   In the compute shader, as usual, we start by defining the number of shader  invocations per work group. layout  local_size_x = 25, local_size_y = 25  in;  2.  Next, we declare uniform variables for our input and output images and for the edge   detection threshold. The input image is the rendered image from the FBO, and the  output image will be the result of the edge detection filter. uniform float EdgeThreshold = 0.1; layout binding=0, rgba8  uniform image2D InputImg; layout binding=1, rgba8  uniform image2D OutputImg;  3.  Then we declare our work group's shared memory, which is an array of size 27 x 27.  shared float      localData[gl_WorkGroupSize.x+2][gl_WorkGroupSize.y+2];  4.  We also define a function for computing the luminance of a pixel called luminance.   Since the same function was used in several previous recipes, this need not be  repeated here.  5.  Next, we define a function that applies the Sobel filter to the pixel that corresponds to   this shader invocation. It reads directly from the local shared data. void applyFilter   {  362     uvec2 p = gl_LocalInvocationID.xy + uvec2 1,1 ;    float sx = localData[p.x-1][p.y-1] +              2*localData[p.x-1][p.y] +             localData[p.x-1][p.y+1] -             localData[p.x+1][p.y-1] +              2 * localData[p.x+1][p.y] +              localData[p.x+1][p.y+1] ;   float sy = localData[p.x-1][p.y+1] +               2*localData[p.x][p.y+1] +               localData[p.x+1][p.y+1] -               localData[p.x-1][p.y-1] +               2 * localData[p.x][p.y-1] +               localData[p.x+1][p.y-1] ;   float g = sx * sx + sy * sy;    if  g > EdgeThreshold       imageStore OutputImg,         ivec2 gl_GlobalInvocationID.xy , vec4 1.0  ;   else     imageStore OutputImg,         ivec2 gl_GlobalInvocationID.xy , vec4 0,0,0,1  ; }  6.   7.   In the main function, we start by copying the luminance for this pixel into the shared  memory array. void main   {   localData    [gl_LocalInvocationID.x+1][gl_LocalInvocationID.y+1] =     luminance imageLoad InputImg,               ivec2 gl_GlobalInvocationID.xy  .rgb ;  If we're on the edge of the work group, we need to copy one or more additional pixels  into the shared memory array in order to fill out the pixels around the edge. So we  need to determine whether or not we're on the edge of the work group  by examining  gl_LocalInvocationID , and then determine which pixels we're responsible for  copying. This is not complex, but is fairly involved and lengthy, due to the fact that we  also must determine whether or not that external pixel actually exists. For example, if  this work group is on the edge of the global image, then some of the edge pixels don't  exist  are outside of the image . Due to its length, I won't include that code here. For  full details, grab the code for this book from the GitHub site.  363   8.  Once we've copied the data for which this shader invocation is responsible, we need to  wait for other invocations to do the same, so here we invoke a barrier. Then we call our  applyFilter function to compute the filter and write the results to the output image.   barrier  ;       Apply the filter using local memory   applyFilter  ; }  9.   In the OpenGL render function, we start by rendering the scene to the FBO,   then dispatch the compute shader, and wait for it to finish all of its writes to the  output image. glDispatchCompute width 25, height 25, 1 ; glMemoryBarrier GL_SHADER_IMAGE_ACCESS_BARRIER_BIT ;  10.  Finally, we render the output image to the screen via a full-screen quad.  How it works... In step 1, we specify 625 shader invocations per work group, 25 in each dimension.   Depending on the system on which the code is running, this could be changed to better   match the hardware available.  The uniform image2D variables  step 2  are the input and output images. Note the binding  locations indicated in the layout qualifier. These correspond to the image units specified in  the glBindImageTexture call within the main OpenGL program. The input image should  contain the rendered scene, and corresponds to the image texture bound to the FBO. The  output image will receive the result of the filter. Also note the use of rgb8 as the format. This  must be the same as the format used when creating the image using glTexStorage2D.  The array localData is declared in step 3 with the shared qualifier. This is our work group's  local shared memory. The size is 27 x 27 in order to include an extra strip, one pixel wide  along the edges. We store the luminance of all of the pixels in the work group here, plus the  luminance for a strip of surrounding pixels of width one.  The applyFilter function  step 5  is where the Sobel operator is computed using the data  in localData. It is fairly straightforward, except for an offset that needs to be applied due to  the extra strip around the edges. The luminance of the pixel that this invocation is responsible  for is located at:  p = gl_LocalInvocationID.xy + uvec2 1,1 ;  Without the extra strip of pixels, we could just use gl_LocalInvocationID, but here we  need to add an offset of one in each dimension.  364   The next few statements just compute the Sobel operator, and determine the magnitude of  the gradient, stored in g. This is done by reading the luminance of the eight nearby pixels,  reading from the shared array localData.  At the end of the applyFilter function, we write to OutputImg the result of the filter. This  is either  1,1,1,1  or  0,0,0,1  depending on whether g is above the threshold or not. Note that  here, we use gl_GlobalInvocationID as the location in the output image. The global ID is  appropriate for determining the location within the global image, while the local ID tells us where  we are within the local work group, and is more appropriate for access to the local shared array.  In the main function  step 6 , we compute the luminance of the pixel corresponding to  this invocation  at gl_GlobalInvocationID  and store it in the local shared memory   localData  at gl_LocalInvocationID + 1. Again, the + 1 is due to the additional  space for the edge pixels.  The next step  step 7  is to copy the edge pixels. We only do so if this invocation is on the edge  of the work group. Additionally, we need to determine if the edge pixels actually exist or not.  For details on this, please refer to the code that accompanies the book.  In step 8, we call the GLSL barrier function. This synchronizes all shader invocations within  the work group to this point in the code, assuring that all writes to the local shared data  have completed. Without calling the barrier function, there's no guarantee that all shader  invocations will have finished writing to localData, and therefore the data might be  incomplete. It is interesting  and instructive  to remove this call and observe the results.  Finally, we call applyFilter to compute the Sobel operator and write to the output image.  Within the OpenGL render function, we dispatch the compute shader such that there are  enough work groups to cover the image. Since the work group size is 25 x 25, we invoke  width 25 work groups in the x dimension and height 25 in the y. The result is one shader  invocation per pixel in the input output image.  There's more... This is a straightforward example of the use of local shared memory. It is only slightly  complicated by the fact that we need to deal with the extra row column of pixels. In general,  however, local shared data can be used for any type of communication between invocations  within a work group. In this case, the data is not used for communication, but is instead used  to increase efficiency by decreasing the global number of reads from the image.  Note that there are  sometimes stringent  limits on the size of  shared memory.  We can use GL_MAX_COMPUTE_SHARED_ MEMORY_SIZE  via glGetInteger*  to query the maximum  size available on the current hardware.  The minimum required by  the OpenGL specification is 32 KB.  365   See also   f The Applying an edge detection filter recipe in Chapter 5, Image Processing and   Screen Space Techniques  Creating a fractal texture using the compute  shader We'll wrap up this chapter with an example that makes use of the compute shader to produce  an image of a fractal. We'll use the classic Mandelbrot set.  The Mandelbrot set is based on iterations of the following complex polynomial:  Where z and c are a complex numbers. Starting with the value z = 0 + 0i, we apply the  iteration repeatedly until a maximum number of iterations is reached or the value of z  exceeds a specified maximum. For a given value of c, if the iteration remains stable  z doesn't  increase above the maximum  the point is inside the Mandelbrot set and we color the position  corresponding to c black. Otherwise, we color the point based on the number of iterations it  took for the value to exceed the maximum.  In the following figure, the image of the Mandelbrot set is applied as a texture to a cube:  366   We'll use the compute shader to evaluate the Mandelbrot set. Since this is another   image-based technique, we'll use a two-dimensional compute space with one compute   shader invocation per pixel. Each invocation can work independently, and doesn't need to  share any data with other invocations.  Getting ready Create a texture to store the results of our fractal calculation. The image should be bound to  the image texture unit 0 using glBindImageTexture.  GLuint imgTex; glGenTextures 1, &imgTex ; glActiveTexture GL_TEXTURE0 ; glBindTexture GL_TEXTURE_2D, imgTex ; glTexStorage2D GL_TEXTURE_2D, 1, GL_RGBA8, 256, 256 ;   glBindImageTexture 0, imgTex, 0, GL_FALSE, 0, GL_READ_WRITE,                     GL_RGBA8 ;  How to do it... Use the following steps:  1.   In the compute shader, we start by defining the number of shader invocations per  work group. layout  local_size_x = 32, local_size_y = 32   in;  2.  Next, we declare the output image as well as some other uniform variables.  layout  binding = 0, rgba8  uniform image2D ColorImg; define MAX_ITERATIONS 100 uniform vec4 CompWindow; uniform uint Width = 256; uniform uint Height = 256;  3.  We define a function to compute the number of iterations for a given position on the   complex plane. uint mandelbrot  vec2 c   {   vec2 z = vec2 0.0,0.0 ;   uint i = 0;   while i < MAX_ITERATIONS &&  z.x*z.x + z.y*z.y  < 4.0  {     z = vec2  z.x*z.x-z.y*z.y+c.x, 2 * z.x*z.y + c.y  ;      i++;   }   return i; }  367   4.   In the main function, we start by computing the size of a pixel in the complex space. void main   {   float dx =  CompWindow.z - CompWindow.x    Width;    float dy =  CompWindow.w - CompWindow.y    Height;  5.  Then we determine the value of c for this invocation.    vec2 c = vec2         dx * gl_GlobalInvocationID.x + CompWindow.x,       dy * gl_GlobalInvocationID.y + CompWindow.y ;  6.  Next we call the mandelbrot function and determine the color based on the number   of iterations.   uint i = mandelbrot c ;    vec4 color = vec4 0.0,0.5,0.5,1 ;   if  i < MAX_ITERATIONS   {     if  i < 5             color = vec4 float i  5.0,0,0,1 ;     else if  i < 10             color = vec4  float i -5.0  5.0,1,0,1 ;     else if  i < 15             color = vec4 1,0, float i -10.0  5.0,1 ;     else color = vec4 0,0,1,0 ;   }   else     color = vec4 0,0,0,1 ;  7.  Finally, we write the color to the output image.    imageStore ColorImg,               ivec2 gl_GlobalInvocationID.xy , color ;  }  8.  Within the render function of the OpenGL program, we execute the compute shader   with one invocation per texel, and call glMemoryBarrier. glDispatchCompute 256 32, 256 32, 1 ; glMemoryBarrier  GL_SHADER_IMAGE_ACCESS_BARRIER_BIT  ;  9.  Then we render the scene, applying the texture to the appropriate objects.  How it works... In step 2, the uniform variable ColorImg is the output image. It is defined to be located at  image texture unit 0  via the binding layout option . Also note that the format is rgb8, which  must be the same as what is used in the glTexStorage2D call when creating the texture.  368   MAX_ITERATIONS is the maximum number of iterations of the complex polynomial  mentioned above. CompWindow is the region of complex space with which we are working.  The first two components CompWindow.xy are the real and imaginary parts of the lower left  corner of the window, and CompWindow.zw is the upper right corner. Width and Height  define the size of the texture image.  The mandelbrot function  step 3  takes a value for c as the parameter, and repeatedly  iterates the complex function until either a maximum number of iterations is reached, or the  absolute value of z becomes greater than 2. Note that here, we avoid computing the square  root and just compare the absolute value squared with 4. The function returns the total  number of iterations.  Within the main function  step 4 , we start by computing the size of a pixel within the   complex window  dx, dy . This is just the size of the window divided by the number of   texels in each dimension.  The compute shader invocation is responsible for the texel located at   gl_GlobalInvocationID.xy. We compute the point on the complex plane that  corresponds to this texel next. For the x position  real axis , we take the size of the texel   in that direction  dx  times gl_GlobalInvocationID.x  which gives the distance from the  left edge of the window , plus the position of the left edge of the window  CompWindow.x .   A similar calculation is done for the y position  imaginary axis .  In step 6, we call the mandelbrot function with the value for c that was just determined, and  determine a color based on the number of iterations returned.  In step 7, we apply the color to the output image at gl_GlobalInvocationID.xy using  imageStore.  In the OpenGL render function  step 8 , we dispatch the compute shader with enough  invocations so that there is one invocation per texel. The glMemoryBarrier call assures   that all writes to the output image are complete before continuing.  There's more... Prior to the advent of the compute shader, we might have chosen to do this using the  fragment shader. However, the compute shader gives us a bit more flexibility in defining  how the work is allocated on the GPU. We can also gain memory efficiency by avoiding the  overhead of a complete FBO for the purposes of a single texture.  369    Index  drawing, tessellation shader used  248-253  drawing, tessellation shader used  253-258  Symbols 2D quad  2D texture  applying  118-123  3D surface  7zip  URL  10  -exts parameter  13 A active vertex attributes  listing  34-37  active vertex locations  listing  34-37  Adobe Photoshop  URL  131  ads function  102 ADS shading model  about  65, 118 halfway vector, used  101-103 implementing  65-69  Airy disc  184 aliasing shadow edges  273 alpha maps  arrays  passing, to functions  74  artifacts  191 attribute indexes  specifying, without layout qualifiers  33 B back faces  rendering, for shadow mapping  274  Bernstein polynomials  243 black holes  350 blending functions  243 bloom effect  about  184-187 creating  184-187  bright-pass filter  184 buildOffsetTex function  282 C canonical viewing volume  266 celshading.

OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL) is a programming language used for customizing parts of the OpenGL graphics pipeline that were formerly fixed-function, and are executed directly on the GPU. It provides programmers with unprecedented flexibility for implementing effects and optimizations utilizing the power of modern GPUs. With Version 4, the language has been further refined to provide programmers with greater power and flexibility, with new stages such as tessellation and compute.
