Drools 2.0, the first official release of  Drools, was a great volunteer effort from a range of people working tirelessly over  evenings and weekends.  There is a long-running joke that much of Drools 2.0 was written while under the  influence of beer—much to the chagrin of a CTO who was told this little anecdote  just after telling us that transactions worth millions of dollars were processed with  Drools 2.0.  The success of Drools 2.0 didn't go unnoticed. I was soon given the opportunity, by  Marc Fleury, to work full time on Drools at Jboss—now a division of Red Hat. With  the backing of JBoss, I was soon able to hire several of the key Drools community  members, of Drools such as Michael Neale, Edson Tirelli, and Kris Verlaenen. Each of  them has become an evil genius in his own right, making Drools what it is today. Bob  is also employed at JBoss, but has since moved onto other Ruby-based endeavours.   I've known Paul for a number of years, throughout which he's been an active and  valued community member. I remember the conversation two years back when Paul  talked about his desire to write a Drools book. His initial goal was to write a small  e-book, but I guess his ambitions and imagination got the better of him, prompting  him to do something much more ambitious. So it's with great pleasure that I see  Paul finally achieve this, his first Drools book. We didn't make things easy for him.  Drools 5.0 was a continually changing platform during it's development cycle, on  which he was trying to base this book. The main focus of this book is the web-based  governance system, what other vendors call a BRMS. And luckily, most of the  important aspects are here in all their glorious detail.  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Previous Drools versions have challenged commercial vendors in this space, allowing  people to state what they know and not have to waste time translating this knowledge  into a machine-understandable format. Drools 5.0 is about to be released, and is a  monumental peace of engineering over Drools 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0. It brings together rules,  workflow, and event processing, along with an enterprise governance system, to form  the foundations of the what I call a Business Logic Integration Platform.  I've always stated that end business users struggle to understand the differences  between rules and processes, and more recently between rules and event processing.  They just want to model it using some software. The traditional way of using   two vendor offerings forces the business user to work with a process-oriented  or rules-oriented approach. But this gets in the way, often with great confusion  over which tool they should be using to model which bit. If you combine these  technologies in the right way and take a behavioural modelling approach, you form  something that is simpler and at the same time much more powerful. This allows the  business user to work more naturally, where the full range of approaches is available  to him or her, without the tools getting in the way. From being process-oriented to  rule-oriented or shades of grey in the middle—whatever suits the problem being  modelled at that time. We are taking this one step further and are adding event  processing with Drools Fusion. Thus, we are creating a more holistic approach to  software development. The term 'holistic' is used for emphasizing the importance   of the whole and the interdependence of its parts.  The JBoss Drools community continues to grow at a fantastic rate and we are very  lucky to get such great feedback and contributions. First-rate commercial support  continues to be available from Red Hat, which helps us to continue what we are  doing. Red Hat provides the branded version of Drools, JBoss Rules, which goes  through additional QA and testing against the rest of the JBoss products, such  as JBoss ESB and JBoss AS, and is available under long term support contracts.  Thousands of sites worldwide have used Drools as a part of their solution.  So where does Drools go from 5.0? Our initial focus will now be on services and  delivering codeless deployments. We will also focus on further enterprise-based  governance enhancements as we continue to move up the stack from a simple  embedded engine. In reality, we've only just started, and there's still much more   of the vision to put into place. So all I can say is, you ain't seen nothing yet.

He spent millons on behalf of a UK telephone company's  procurement department and implemented direct marketing for a well-known Texan  computer maker before joining the IT department of a company that builds bright  red tractors and other seriously cool machines.  Paul then embraced his techie side  he was writing games in machine code from  the age of 11  and started a consultancy that used IT to solve business problems for  companies in the financial and public sectors in Ireland, UK , Belgium, and New  Zealand. Eight years later, he now works with an Irish government agency that helps  similar software companies to grow past their initial teething pains.  More formally, Paul has a bachelor's degree in Business and French from the  University of Ulster, a master's degree in Advanced Software from UCD Dublin, a  post-grad qualification in Procurement from the Chartered Institute of Procurement  and Supply  UK , and will someday complete his ACCA financial exams.

Traditional computer  programming languages make it difficult to translate this "natural language" into  a software program. But JBoss Rules  also known as Drools  enables anybody with  basic IT skills and an understanding of the business to turn statements such as these  into running computer code.  This book will teach you to specify business rules using JBoss Drools, and then put  them into action in your business. You will be able to create rules that trigger actions  and decisions, based on data that comes from a variety of sources and departments  right across your business. Regardless of the size of your business, you can make  your processes more effective and manageable by adopting JBoss Rules.  Banks use business rules to process your mortgage  home loan  application, and to  manage the process through each step  initial indication of amount available, actual  application, approval of the total according to strict rules regarding the amount of  income, house value, previous repayment record, swapping title deeds, and so on .  Countries such as Australia apply business rules to visa applications  when you  want to go and live there —you get points for your age, whether you have a degree   or masters, your occupation, any family members in the country, and a variety of  other factors.  Supermarkets apply business rules to what stock they should have on their shelves  and where—this depends upon analyzing factors such as how much shelf space  there is, what location the supermarket is in, what people have bought the week  before, the weather forecast for next week  for example, ice cream in hot weather ,  and what discounts the manufacturers are giving.  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Preface  This book shows how you can use similar rules and processes in your business or  organization. It begins with a detailed, clear explanation of business rules and how  JBoss Rules supports them.  You will then see how to install and get to grips with the essential software required  to use JBoss Rules. Once you have mastered the basic tools, you will learn how to  build practical and effective of the business rule systems.  The book provides clear explanations of business rule jargon. You will learn how to  work with Decision Tables, Domain-Specific Languages  DSL s, the Guvnor and  JBoss Integrated Development Environment  IDE , workflow and much more. By the end of the book you will know exactly how to harness the power of JBoss  Rules in your business.  What this book covers Chapter 1: This chapter gives you a good platform to understand business rules and  JBoss rules. We look at the problems that you might have  and why you're probably  reading this book . We look at what business rule engines are, and how they evaluate  business rules that appear very simple and how they become powerful when  multiple rules are combined. Chapter 2: This chapter explains setting up Java, setting up Business Rule  Management System  BRMS  Guvnor running on the JBoss App Server, setting up  Eclipse, and installing the Drools Plug-in. It also details the installation of the Drools  examples for this book and the Maven to build them. Chapter 3: Guvnor is the user-friendly web editor that's also powerful enough to test  our rules as we write them. We take up an example to make things easier. Then we  look at the various Guvnor screens, and see that it can not only write rules  using  both guided and advanced editors , but that it can also organize rules and other  assets in packages, and also allow us to test and deploy those packages. Finally, we  write our very first business rule—the traditional 'Hello World' message announcing  to everyone that we are now business rule authors. Chapter 4: This chapter shows how to use the Guvnor rule editor to write some more  sophisticated rules. It also shows how to get information in and out of our rules, and  demonstrates how to create the fact model needed to do this. We import our new fact  model into the Guvnor and then build a guided rule around it. Finally we test our  rule as a way of making sure that it runs correctly.  [ 2 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Preface  Chapter 5: This chapter pushes the boundries of what we can do with the Guvnor rule  editor, and then brings in the JBoss IDE as an even more powerful way of writing  rules. We start by using variables in our rules example. Then we discuss rule attributes   such as salience  to stop our rules from making changes that cause them to fire again  and again. After testing this successfully, we look at text-based rules, in both the  Guvnor and the JBoss IDE, for running 'Hello World' in the new environment. Chapter 6: This chapter looks again at the structure of a rule file. At the end of this  chapter, we look at some more advanced rules that we can write and run in the IDE. Chapter 7: This chapter explains how testing is not a standalone activity, but part  of an ongoing cycle. In this chapter we see how to test our rules, not only in the  Guvnor, but also using FIT for rule testing against requirements documents. This  chapter also explains Unit Testing using JUnit. Chapter 8: This chapter explains how to use Excel Spreadsheets  cells and ranges   as our fact model to hold information, instead of the write-your-own-JavaBean  approach we took earlier. Then we use Excel spreadsheets to hold Decision tables, to  make repetitive rules easier to write. Chapter 9: This chapter aims to make our rules both easier to use, and more powerful.  We start with DSLs—Domain-Specific Languages. This chapter follows on from the  'easy to write rules' theme from the previous chapter and also discusses both ruleflow  and workflow.. It would be great to draw a workflow diagram to see control what   groups of  rules should fire and when. Rule flow gives us this sort of control. Chapter 10: This chapter shows you how to deploy your business rules into the real  world. We look at the pieces that make up an entire web application, and where rules  fit into it. We see the various options to deploy rules as part of our application, and the  team involved in doing so. Once they are deployed, we look at the code that would  load and run the rules—both home-grown and using the standard RuleAgent. Finally  we see how to combine this into a web project using the framework of your choice. Chapter 11: This chapter looks at what happens under the cover by opening up the  internals of the Drools rule engine to understand concepts such as truth maintenance,  conflict resolution, pattern matching, and the rules agenda. In this chapter, we explore  the Rete algorithm and discuss why it makes rules run faster than most comparable  business logic. Finally we see the working memory audit log and the rules debug  capabilities of the Drools IDE. Chapter 12: This chapter deals with the other advanced Drools features that have  not yet been covered. This includes Smooks to bulk load data, Complex Event  Processing, and Drools solver to provide solutions where traditional techniques  would take too long.

All of these are open source,   can be downloaded easily from the Internet, and are available under a   business-friendly license.  We need Java as this is the core computer language upon which all of the other tools  are built. We need BRMS Guvnor and JBoss App Server to provide a web-based  rules editor aimed at business users. We also need to install Maven, a build tool that  takes the various Java scripts  source  and transforms them into a package that we  can deploy on a web server. We need Eclipse and the Drools plug-in to edit the Java   files that we will use for transporting information around the system. We also need  to download Drools examples for this book which are available at   http:  code.google.com p red-piranha.  Who this is book for  If you are a business analyst—somebody involved with enterprise IT at a high level,  who understands problems and planning solutions, rather than coding in-depth  implementations—then this book is for you.  If you are a business user who needs to write rules, or a technical person who needs  to support rules, this book is for you.  If you are looking for an introduction to rule engine technology, this book will satisfy  your needs.  If you are a business user and want to write rules using Guvnor or the JBoss IDE, this  book will be suitable for you.  This book will also suit your need if you are a business user and who wants to  understand what Drools can do and how it works, but would rather leave the  implementation to a developer.  Conventions In this book, you will find a number of styles of text that distinguish between  different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles, and an  explanation of their meaning.  Code words in text are shown as follows: "We'll see that one file contains two rules:  Hello World and GoodBye."

My father  was an accountant who tracked and valued the items as they moved around the  world. My job is to replace both of them with automated systems, and apply a  complex set of business rules that determine what gets loaded first and how much   it is worth. For items such as fresh produce, the answer is complex and often changes  by the hour.  If you look at your family tree, you'll probably see a similar progression. We've   gone from lifting bags of coal to being workers who move knowledge around.   We may not have blisters on our hands, but we do get sore heads from the business   medical, legal, financial and similar  problems that we deal with.  How do we know if we're doing a good job? For our grandfather's generation, it  was easy to see people and companies who moved the most 'stuff' around. For our  generation things are different—We're moving knowledge that we can't see. We  often need to apply unclear business rules to our job. To be successful we need to   do our job quicker, faster, and better than anybody else.  JBoss Rules can help us become better and faster at managing our knowledge. To  explain how, this chapter looks at:                     Who you are and what your problem is Life or death business rules Business rules in your organization Why existing solutions don't cut it How rule engines can come to the rescue An introduction to JBoss and JBoss Rules The bigger picture and parts of the solution How to write the rules When not to use a rule engine  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Drooling over JBoss Rules  Who are you? What's your problem? If you are reading this, you probably know important information. You might be in  the medical, legal, or accountancy professions. You may be the only person in the  company who understands how to process refunds to tractor dealers in the Chicago  area. You may be the most experienced underwriter in the mortgage application  department. Or you may be the person who is most capable of talking to 'those guys  in IT'. Perhaps you've taken part in one or more Business and  IT projects, or maybe  this is your first one.  Whoever you are, you've got a problem. Maybe your team is too busy for the  workload it has, maybe you can't recruit enough people to work for you, or maybe  you can get the people, but it takes too many resources to train them. Whatever   the cause, there are not enough minds to go around, and costly or embarrassing  mistakes happen as a result.  You've probably already joked about being able to clone your key people. Wouldn't  it be great to leave your clone working at the desk while you get some time on the  beach; or even just get to go home on time? Although JBoss Rules does not allow you  to clone yourself, it does allow you to clone your mind that is, put your knowledge  into a computer. Once in the computer, this knowledge can be copied, reviewed, and  kept working even after you go home.  Your second thought after hearing the "put your knowledge into a computer" bit  is probably, "If the computer knows what I know, will I be out of a job?". Maybe.  Or more likely, you'll no longer do the routine 80% of your job that you hate—the  rubbish that fills up your day. It means that you will spend more of your time doing  the 20% that you enjoy, including talking to people, meeting customers, improving  the process, planning your next golf  sorry, "business networking"  trip, or whatever  you find interesting.  This book is aimed at non-technical users, although it contains a lot of information  for people who want to get under the covers of JBoss Rules. Don't worry even if the  entire extent of your PC skills is limited to writing a couple of formulae in Excel.  You're going to be OK.  Does this sound like where you work? Everybody complains about his or her job from time to time. You probably have a  mug saying "You don't have to be crazy to work here…but it helps". Just try out our  10-question pop quiz and see if it sounds somewhat like the place where you spend  most of you working hours:  [ 8 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Chapter 1  1.   2.   Is Bob, in the corner, the only person who knows how the system really  works? Can the business scale only if we have an expert? Is critical  knowledge lost when people like Bob leave? If you're Bob  owning the knowledge , are you sick of people asking you  stupid questions? Do you think: don't these people know that you've got   a job to do?  3.  Are your customers getting a different answer every time they call your  company  and getting more than slightly irate about it ? Are you at risk   of  receiving a slap on the wrist  or worse, a fine  from a regulator or other   standards body?  4.  Do you find yourself working around, rather than with, your computer  systems? Have you ever thought of pouring coffee into your computer  keyboard in frustration?  Trust me, it doesn't help.   5.  Are things always done by the book, or is there a lot of informal knowledge   that is just in people's heads?  6.  Did you prepare for a quality  ISO 9001  audit and then leave the process  documentation unused on a shelf? Is there anybody around who knows or  wants to change this process? Is this the right balance between being too hard  to change  and being stuck in a rut  and being too easy  resulting in chaos ?   If a change is made, will people know about it and will they take any notice?  7.  Does your business knowledge exist in some easily usable format? Is its   format easy to update? Can everybody use it from one central location  so  that copies are not 'out of sync' ? Can you track changes made and roll them  back if you get it wrong?  8.  Do the right people  and only the right people  have access  both read and  update  to this information? Does this access need to change depending on  the context of what the user is doing at the time?  9.  Do people in your organization work on projects? Do they come together  to form goal-driven teams and then go back to their original jobs when the  objectives have been achieved? Do you know how to document the outcome  of these projects as rules so that they can be reused?  10.  Are tasks carried out in isolation? How do we ensure that tasks and    team members collaborate effectively? In the old days, everything was   done in-house. Now the 'office as a factory' must also seamlessly interlink  with other suppliers plugged in as part of the process.

But if you think you've got problems, consider the   following example.  Life or death business rules The health services in Bangladesh  like many elsewhere  can't get enough doctors.  Training more doctors is not an answer. Those who do qualify tend to leave for  higher rates of pay elsewhere. So, given the desperate need for trained medical  staff in rural areas  for example, to curb child mortality rates , what are the health  workers to do?  The more qualified a doctor is, the more likely he is to take a flight. The district  hospital in Matlab, Bangladesh, boasts an operating table, lamp, oxygen cylinder,  and anesthetic machine, all carrying the EU's gift tag. They gleam, partly because  they are unused. Several surgeons and anesthetists have been trained, but none  so far have been retained. "Other than holding a gun to their head, doctors do not  stay here.", comments Shams Arifeen, a researcher in the International Centre for  Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh  ICDDR, B . Doubling their pay is not   the answer because they can earn five or ten times as much in private practice.  Besides, specialists want to educate their children in the capital Dhaka, not in  Bangladesh's backwaters.  What would you do? Imagine that you were standing in that clinic without medical training, when a  mother asks you to look at her sick child. What will you do? The solution that the  Bangladesh health workers came up with was IMCI or Integrated Management of  Childhood Illness. IMCI takes the knowledge in a doctor's head and writes it down  as a set of rules that health workers can follow. When a sick child is brought into the  remote clinic, the health worker is able to follow the simple step-by-step instructions  to make quite a sophisticated diagnosis.  [ 10 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   The following figure shows IMCI:  Chapter 1  Look at the boxes in the above diagram—it's a set of medical rules.   Source, World Health Organisation, http:  whqlibdoc.who.int  publications 2005 9241546441.pdf.  Using these rules a health care worker   can quickly come to the following conclusions:          When the child is under two years of age, then refer to doctor immediately When the child's skin does not bounce back when pinched, then the child   is dehydrated When the child is dehydrated then give rehydration salts  [ 11 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Drooling over JBoss Rules  This is a real life example of business rules. Although it is paper-based and useful to  the medical profession, it's a good example of business rules all the same.        Rules are 'when something is present, then do this'. And not just single   rules, but many of them. Together, loads of simple rules allow you to come  up with quite a sophisticated diagnosis. Ruleflow and Workflow allow you to group your rules and decide which  should fire first. If you're a health worker with a sick child, you want to do  the most important checks first. Depending on the outcome, you then apply  the next set of medical rules.  Everybody, including the doctors, is happy that his or her knowledge has been  translated into rules. The doctors are happy because they can  guiltlessly  move to  better-paying jobs. The medical workers using the system are happy because they   can help the sick children that they see every day. The children gain because the better  availability of medical knowledge is literally the difference between life and death.  If you've used a computer language before, you might find the above  example strange. 'Traditional' computer languages are more like a set  of instructions: Do step 1, do step 2, repeat 5 times, and so on. Rules are  different; they allow you to make many individual statements of what   you know to be true and then let the computer decide if these rules apply    or not  to the current situation. This is similar to the way in which the  human mind works. Look again at the example. We don't specify any order for our rules.   All of them, one of them, or none of them might apply in a given situation.   A child under two who was dehydrated potentially could be referred to   a doctor and given rehydration salts on the way in. This could be the  outcome we want, or we may wish to rewrite our rules to be   more precise—but always in the "when  something is true  then    do this " format.  For more information on this real life example, read The Economist magazine's  online article at: http:  www.economist.com research articlesBySubject  PrinterFriendly.cfm?story_id=9440765.  [ 12 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Chapter 1  Business rules in your organization You're going to be hearing a lot about 'business rules' over the next couple of pages,  so it might be helpful to clarify what they are. We use the term 'business rule' to  show that rules are non-technical. They could also be called 'medical rules', 'financial  rules', 'insurance rules', 'benefit payment rules', and so forth. It all depends on the  organization you work for, and the particular niche that it finds itself in.  A business rule is any bit of knowledge that can be expressed in the following format: When 'something' is true, Then do 'this'. Er, that's it. Nothing more complicated than that.  You do have knowledge like that in your organization, don't you? All companies  and organizations have business rules, even if they are implied  that's, unwritten   or buried  as code  in existing systems  for example the ones with black screens and  green text that you see in Hollywood movies .  Examples of these rules are:           When a football team wins a game, jump up and down and shout loudly When a staff member gets promoted, give them a pay rise of 10% When a person's salary is less than 30,000 dollars, apply a tax rate of 20% When somebody leaves the office before 4 pm, make sarcastic comment  about 'taking a half-day vacation'  This book uses the "when...then" format for business rules. In practical  terms, these are very similar to "if...then" statements you may have seen in  any computer language.  The key reason for using 'when' is to underline that business rules will 'fire'  whenever the condition is true. Traditional 'if' statements will only fire if  we happen to be at that step in the process at the time.   Business rules themselves tend to be simple. Their power comes from the fact that  there are many of them  tens, hundreds, or even thousands . Just as you have many  rules in your head  when you see a bear, run away , the trick is knowing when to  apply them  what happens when you see a bear in the zoo? . Later we'll look at  writing rules clearly and testing them to ensure that they do what you want.  [ 13 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Drooling over JBoss Rules  Business rules should be written as clearly as possible  in English, or your human  language of choice . While this makes your life easier when writing the rules, more  importantly, it allows other people to review your rules in the future. Various  estimates are that 95% of all work on a computer system is in this 'review and  update' phase long after the original team has left. So clarity is one of the biggest  advantages of using rule engines.  Exercise — rules in your organization As a simple exercise, take 10 minutes to list some of the business rules in your  organization. Don't worry if they are simple or difficult. Just write them out in the  "when…then" format.  Here's one I did earlier.  The chocolate factory The following figure shows sample business rules for a chocolate factory: sample business rules for a chocolate factory:  Since I was a child, I've always wanted to work in a chocolate factory, and here's  my chance. The figure shows the sample rules that I came up with. The first three  columns are the 'when' part of our business rule or the Left-Hand Side  LHS . The  last  fourth column  is the 'then' part, also known as the Right-Hand Side  RHS .  [ 14 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Chapter 1  For example, the first record in the table says: When the Finance department sees that we've sold more than 30,000 Chocolate  Crunchie bars, then they should Order more chocolate. You'll notice that there are a couple of departments other than Finance   Manufacturing, Product Testing, Sales, and Shipping . Although I made   these rules up, often the rules that get deployed are a combination of rules from   various teams.  When I'm reading books such as this, I wonder how I take this   concept or theory and actually use these in a 'real system'. Well, I don't  want to spoil the surprise, but the actual business rules we will be   writing and deploying are very similar to the 'clear English' examples  discussed earlier. There's a lot of clever stuff happening under the covers to keep our  business rules simple, but that's how it should be ,with the machines,  rather than people, doing the hardwork.  Build your own rule engine in Excel You are probably wondering why some of the rules in the figure are highlighted.  These are the rules that will 'fire' whenever we sell more than 30,000 Chocolate  Crunchie bars. You could imagine another set of rules highlighting whenever we  have less than 100 boxes of Mint Surprise left in stock. That's all a rule engine does. It selects the rules that are correct for the current  situation and then carries out whatever they say. If you're good at Excel, you could  probably mimic this behavior using auto filters or conditional formatting so that the  colors would change automatically.  Sometimes things can be as simple as they seem. If you're coming from a  business department, it makes sense that all the rules should be applied,  often all at once. Why shouldn't the manufacturing and finance people  carry out their actions simultaneously? Technical people  like me, for the first couple of months  might miss this  point. We're used to telling computers to do things one at a time and have  to 'unlearn' our years of experience that says that computers must do  things exactly one step at a time. We did say that this book is for everybody. Items like this just help level  the playing field.  Speaking of technical people…  [ 15 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Drooling over JBoss Rules  Why can't the tech guys write the rules for me? If you're a good business manager, you've probably been taught to delegate. Until  now, for anything technical  such as computer systems  you've probably been  delegating to those 'techie guys'. So why don't the tech guys write the business rules  for you? The answer is that the tech guys can write the rules on your behalf, but it's a bit like  booking a flight through a travel agent rather than over the Internet. Sometimes it's a  much better idea to do it yourself.        Have you ever turned up at the airport and found that the travel agent got  it wrong? Doing it yourself means that there is one less link in the chain  that can go wrong. Booking your own flight  and writing your own rules  is  quicker and easier. Have you understood what all the hieroglyphic codes on the paper ticket  meant?  I'm showing my age—most airlines phased out paper tickets years  ago . The chances are that if you give a technical person the rules to write, he  or she is probably going to do it in a computer language such as C, Java, or  VB. There is nothing wrong with that; it's just that they might as well write it  in Egyptian hieroglyphics for all that you will able to understand it—there   is no way you will be able to check if they got it right. Business rules solve   this problem.  For simple flights  for example, Dublin-London return , booking online  that is,  doing it yourself  is fine. For multi-stop round-the-world tickets, getting advice from  a travel agent is often a good idea. Likewise for rules: write most of the simple ones  yourself and then get some help with writing the complex ones.  Why existing solutions don't cut it Computers have been around for a long time and we're not the first people to use  them to solve these kinds of problems for business people. In general, these business  systems do three things:  1.  Capture information, for example, via a web interface  presentation layer . 2.  Apply business knowledge to this information  business layer . 3.  Store or forward this information  service or data layer .  It is the business layer that we are most concerned with. The presentation and service  layers, while not trivial, are known problems that lend themselves to some degree of  standardization. In contrast, the business layer will be unique to each organization,  as it reflects the processes and knowledge of the organization.  [ 16 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Chapter 1  In some ways, the business layer is the 'learned memory of the organization'.  Despite  or perhaps because of  years of implementing EIS  Executive Information  Systems , many of them suffer from the following problems:              All three layers tend to be tightly interlinked, so it is not easy to extract the  business logic and use it elsewhere. Business knowledge and rules are often hidden in code. This is difficult to  audit and can lead to discrepancies between the documentation and the  actual implementation. It is hard for the domain experts  the guys with the business knowledge    and the technical experts to collaborate as they  literally  speak   different languages. The business layer can be difficult to update, both in implementation and for  fear of undesirable side effects.  Although theory states that these functions should be separated, the fact that the  business tier is often expressed in a programming language like Java means that  other functions  for example, database access  often creep in over time. Even worse,  there is no clearly delineated place to put the business logic, which is why it can  become scattered throughout the system, making it hard to reuse.  Given that we've had these problems for many years, how can we do any better?  Rule engines to the rescue A rule engine can solve these problems—at least to some extent. Instead of having  technical, spaghetti code, it allows us to keep our business rules as simple as  possible, just like the examples we saw earlier. A rule engine allows us to 'run' these  business rules into the rest of our bigger computer system so that we can get our  values from a web page, save the results into a database, or anything else we need to  do with our information. At the same time, our business rules stay in a 'clear English'  format so that we are able to review them later. So, what is a rule engine? Very simply, it is a place in which we can evaluate our  business rules. Without it, our rules would be stuck 'on paper' and we'd have no way  of feeding them into our system.  Here are a couple of points that explain why rule engines are better than most  computer systems:     Rule engines allow you to say "what to do", not "how to do it". This means  that you can focus on what you know to be true, and allow the machine do the  heavy lifting of figuring out the consequences of all of these combined truths'.  [ 17 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Drooling over JBoss Rules  Logic and data separation: You probably already have a database to store  information. It's a good place for data, but a bad home for your business  rules. Having a rule engine gives your rules a natural home where you can  manage your  entire  business knowledge properly. Speed and scalability: The way rule engines work  based on the Rete  algorithm, if you're interested  has been mathematically proven to be faster  and more scalable than most traditional handcoded 'if…then' solutions. Powerful tools: For developers, as well as for business analysts, tools provide  easy ways to edit and manage rules. More importantly, they give immediate  feedback—no more slogging through 10 web screens to reproduce a 'bug' in  the business logic. Auditing: Rule systems provide an explanation facility allowing you to audit  how and why a particular decision was made.  Other rules  Microsoft Outlook  If you're a power user of Microsoft Outlook, then you probably have mail filters set  up that say something like:  When a mail comes in that looks like spam, then put it into the trash can When a mail comes in saying 'Jboss Rules', then put it in the folder   marked 'rules'                      [ 18 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Chapter 1  The figure shows business rules hiding in your mailbox. In this figure can you  recognize the 'when...then' format? You've already been using a rule engine without  even knowing it! But the rule engine in Outlook is limited to email sorting and we  need something more powerful to meet our business problem. Enter JBoss Rules.  Meet JBoss Rules Your boss or somebody from the IT department or a consultant has mentioned  Drools as part of the solution. After having a good laugh at the name  it's a long  story  you want to find out more. We'll look at this in two parts—Who is JBoss, and  what is the Drools JBoss Rules team.  JBoss is a division of Red Hat  NYSE:RHT . This means that Drools is backed by an  industry-leading company. The support from this company is available whenever  you need it.  Even better, a key part of JBoss and Drools is open source. To put this in quality  terms, both the JBoss and Drools teams are confident enough about their product to  let you poke inside it. It's a bit like getting a tour of the Mercedes car factory.  Open source also shows the confidence that the team has in the quality of the  product and of their support, If you don't think the support is good enough, you are  free  and able!  to get third parties to do the job to your satisfaction. Because the bulk  of how JBoss Red Hat makes their money is service related, they're pretty confident  that that option won't be needed.  You may be confused by the naming of the project. Is it Drools or JBoss  Rules? Officially it is now the latter, although it started out as 'Drools' and  the name is still in common usage. This book tends to use 'Drools' as it is  shorter to type and read. Both terms refer to the same thing—the business  rules product from Red Hat and JBoss.  Drools is an advanced rule engine  and a lot more besides, as we shall see later . It  allows you to state things that you know to be correct  for example, if the expenses  claim is above $5000, then a senior manager needs to sign it off . As somebody who  has knowledge of business rules, you'll be able to feed the rule engine with what   you know.  [ 19 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Drooling over JBoss Rules  A bit more on open source A few years ago, if you searched for the words 'open source business' on the internet,  you would have found people describing it as a little bit 'hippy', or maybe old style  communists resurfacing in another form. Those critics  including Microsoft—for  example,  http:  port25.technet.com   have now happily embraced open source  as a part of their business model.  Imagine buying a car with the bonnet welded shut so that only the car's  manufacturers could service it. Would you be happy with that?  Audi almost did  this with their smaller A2 model . Most closed source traditional software are like  that—you are at the mercy of the one supplier for bug fixes and improvements. What  happens if that supplier goes bust?  Now, I know next to nothing about car engineering, but I still find it comforting  that I could choose almost any mechanic to fix my car. Likewise, with open source  software you're unlikely to change the software yourself, but it's comforting to know  that you could hire somebody to do it for you if required.  All of JBoss Rules is available as open source under the Apache open  source license. That's Apache, the web server that powers most of the web  sites you read every day. The Apache license is particularly business-friendly, and you can take  the code and use it in pretty much any way you want, as long as you  acknowledge that your product was 'built using Drools'. You   don't have to publish your changes or additions  as another famous   open source license, the GPL, requires you to do . Nor do you have   to pay any license fee for using their product, even as part of a  commercial deployment. Of course, you'd want to confirm the exact details with your lawyer. But  the chances are that he or she will tell you the same thing and charge you  a lot more for doing so.  The next question is where do Red Hat and JBoss make their money if they're not  selling a product? The answer is through a combination of training and consulting  services, as well as selling cross-tested 'stable' versions guaranteed to work with  most standard server configurations.  All of the software we use in the book is available for free from the JBoss community  web sites. And it's also available as an enterprise product with full Red Hat support,  if that's important to your organization.

Where to get help Check around the sites listed as follows before firing off your 'please help me' email.                 The Product home page is the official home page, tailored more to a  business audience. If you're trying to sell a Drools BRMS  Business Rules  Management System  to your boss, this is the place to go. http:  www.jboss.com products rules The Community home page is a slightly more detailed resource. This  provides links to a lot of useful resources, including the Drools technical  documentation. The information on this page tends to be more 'bleeding  edge', including stuff that may not yet have made it into the official  enterprise versions. http:  www.jboss.org drools  The Wiki is a much more rough-and-ready resource. It has guides of varying  quality, dealing with specific issues  for example, deploying the rules  engine on non-JBoss web application servers . Wikis are writable as well as  readable, so if you're doing something that doesn't appear to be documented  here, think about adding it. The chances are that the solution is technical and  generic enough to be sharable. http:  wiki.jboss.org wiki JBossRules The mailing lists are where you can see previous questions asked by Drools  users and developers. This is where you can ask for help. But read the  next section on how to ask for help, or I can guarantee that your pleas for  assistance will go unanswered. http:  www.jboss.org drools lists.html The Bugs and feature requests page shows you what the Drools  development team is currently working on. Yes, when we said the project  was open, we meant it. You may get far too much information, but better  that than too little. If you feel something is missing from the current version,  checking here might show that it's on its way. And if you talk to the guys  on the mailing lists  they really appreciate end-user feedback , you might be  able to persuade them to add your feature here.  http:  jira.jboss.com jira browse JBRULES  [ 21 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Drooling over JBoss Rules  If there is a bug that you need fixing or feature that you need  implementing as soon as possible, one way of getting it done quickly  might be to offer to sponsor development. That is, pay for the JBoss Rules  team to add it on your behalf. Often this works best if the feature is already on Drools team's 'todo'  list, but may be 18 months from development due to other priorities.  Although the feature will be open sourced, it will get built faster and  better than any other alternative—these guys know the product inside  out. Once inside the product, it will continue to work in future releases  and maybe get further improvements 'for free'! It's an effective, if   non-traditional way, of getting you what you need.  How to ask for help  If you got locked out of your house, how would you ask your neighbor for help?  Would you be arrogant, and demand the he she helps you straight away  ignoring  that he might be doing something important themselves , or would you ask nicely,  explaining your problem, what you've done to try and sort it out, and then ask   him or her if they can help you? Which approach is most likely to succeed?  Asking for help in an open source project is somewhat similar. Any open source  team is busy—the core guys also have bosses and deadlines to meet. So if you've got  a problem with Drools, you can increase the chances of getting help from the JBoss  Rules guys by doing the following:  1.  To start out, assume that the problem is due to a mistake that you've made.   I'd consider myself experienced with computers, but you'd be amazed  at some of the 'duh!' errors that I still make. Check spellings. Check the  instructions. Check that you're connected to the network. Then check again.  2.  Read the manual or search the Web. Then read it again. Unless you're   pushing the boundaries of what Drools does, the chances are that somebody   has seen this problem before. Google is great for this. Put in the error  message that you're getting and you'll get back plenty suggestions of   areas to investigate.   3.  When you search the Web mailing lists, look at problems that are similar but   not exactly the same as your own. Often, the solution will be similar  if not  exactly the same .  4.  Ask a colleague for a sanity check, even if he or she may not be familiar   with the product. Two pairs of eyes are better than one. Often, while you're  walking through the sample, you'll see the basic mistake you've made.  [ 22 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Have you done all of this once, twice, thrice? Now you're ready to ask a question  from the mailing lists. If your question is clear, has enough  relevant  detail, and you  have put in lot of effort to solve the challenging problem yourself, the greater are  your chances of getting a quick reply. Before you type your email, read the classic  article How To Ask Questions The Smart Way at http:  catb.org ~esr faqs   smart-questions.html  Chapter 1  This section might make the Drools team appear unfriendly, but they're  not. They're very approachable and down-to-earth guys. You also have  a direct line to them, unlike most commercial software projects. But, like  all open source projects, they are asked a lot of lazy I-can't-be-bothered- to-read-the-manual type of questions. So spend an extra 10 minutes  to compose your email and you'll be rewarded with support worth  hundreds of dollars. If you want to know what really irks the Drools  guys, read this blog post: http:  blog.athico.com 2007 11  drools-user-mailing-list-growth.html.  After all that preparation, send your email to the user mailing list at   http:  www.jboss.org drools lists.html. Then wait. Do not re-send it.  Remember that Drools is an open source project and you may never get your  question answered, or get it answered only after a couple of days' delay. If you need  guaranteed support, consider buying a subscription from Red Hat.  Don't be surprised that the answer, if and when you get one, is along the lines of  'have you considered trying X, Y, or Z?' Don't expect a complete solution, but just  good suggestions as to areas that you can try to resolve the problem.  When you do find the solution, post the answer to the mailing lists. Keep it technical,  with nothing confidential to your organization. Drools users who will follow in your  footsteps will be eternally grateful. It will also earn you major kudos with the team,  which will benefit you when you ask another question in the future.  The bigger picture You're unlikely to go through the trouble of putting your knowledge into a rules  system and leave it at that. You've a problem that you're trying to solve. For that,  you're going to use rules as part of a bigger system.  [ 23 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Drooling over JBoss Rules  Here's the five-minute guide to almost any computer system. It takes information  from users  these days, mainly via a web page , does something with it, and then  stores it somewhere  normally in a database . You may recognize some database  brand names such as Oracle, SQL Server, or MySql. Think of the database as a very  big version of Excel. Sometimes the flow of information goes the other way—access  information in the database, and then show it on the web page. That's it! So what are  you paying all these IT consultants for?  Drools helps you with the middle 'do something with the information' bit. Here  you apply the business knowledge  the stuff that's currently in your head  to the  information that is passing through.  We recommend Drools, as one of the other options is to put your brain into a glass  jar  think of a mad scientist lab with rows of brains suspended in bubbling liquid   and somehow wire it in to the system. Drools is a much less painful option.  Members of your team  Unless you're a business user by day and techie by night, we don't expect you   to build the entire web system by yourself. In general, as a business user, you'll  supply two bits of information to the IT team. The rest should be considered  'plumbing'—stuff that should be done according to industry standards and best   practices, but that otherwise will be hidden from you  the user  and should 'just  work'  like water coming out of the tap .  The two sorts of information you'll generally need to provide are:        The user's interactions with the completed system. For example, the web  page that the user uses to log in, the first screen they see after they log in, and  what the various buttons on this screen do. Entire books have been written  on this subject and so we won't get into those details. The actual business rules. Unlike the screens, this is 'behind the scenes' stuff.  This is your knowledge applied to the data that's being captured on the  web pages. Even if you don't use Drools or any another rule engine, you'll  still need to do this step. Otherwise, how will the system know to pay for  prescriptions for Viagra,and not for aspirin?  or whatever your business rules  actually are .  [ 24 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801               Chapter 1  How do I write the rules So, you want to get right in and start wiring up the rules. You've got four choices of  editors for rule-writing:  You can use the Business Rules Management System  BRMS  from Drools,  which is called Guvnor. This is a web-based application that's aimed at  people like you. Not only is it easy to use, but it can be set up once for  the entire team to use via Internet Explorer, Firefox, or your favorite web  browser. In general, this is the editor that we recommend, unless you need  a feature that is only available in one of the other editors. The following  screenshot gives an idea of what a business rule looks like in Guvnor— there  is more information on this in Chapter 4.  You could write the rules via a simple text editor such as Notepad. This a bit  masochistic and dull, staring at black and white text with no help as to what  is expected. We mention it here only to show that there is nothing special  about the rules format; it's just a plain text file. You can write rules in Microsoft Excel or any spreadsheet that can output  Excel-like spreadsheets  for example, Sun's Open Office . You have to follow  a certain template  it's not that difficult once you see it . The Excel format  lends itself to rules that repeat themselves a lot  the sample Drools for  Decision Tables has lots of different categories of car insurance claims . Use the Drools IDE, which is based on Eclipse. IDE stands for Integrated  Development Environment, so Eclipse is a bit like 'Microsoft Office for  Techies'. The chances are that your technical team is using it anyway  to  write in a language called Java, although it can be used with other computer  languages . The Drools IDE bit adds plug-ins to Eclipse to allow rule editing  and debugging.  [ 25 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Drooling over JBoss Rules  The IDE is more powerful, but also more complex. We'll talk about its extra features  later, but most of the commonly used ones are already in the BRMS  and over time,  the remainder will be implemented . It's possible to easily switch between IDE   and BRMS.  Whichever way you choose, the rules that get fed into the rule engine are pretty  much the same. In fact, the BRMS allows you to import and manage rules written as  text Decision Tables via the IDE. So, for now, following the BRMS is a good choice.  Introducing the BRMS  Guvnor  The BRMS is a web page that you open in Internet Explorer, Firefox, or your favorite  Internet browser. You've seen web pages before, right? The BRMS allows you to  enter your knowledge as business rules via a web page.  BRMS or Guvnor? The web-based rule editor that we will talk about in  this section started out as the Business Rules Management System or  BRMS. Unfortunately, other rule engine vendors use the term BRMS to  refer to something completely different  not just the editor, but the core  rule engine as well . Hence the renaming of the Drools BRMS to Guvnor,  which also reflects that this web-based application can also be used to  manage other things such as deployment, testing, and processes.  At the start you can enter rules via the guided editor  a similar idea to the helpful  'wizards' that you might have come across in Windows . Later, as you get more used  to the rules syntax, you might want to edit the rules directly in the text editor.  There are a couple of other things that the BRMS gives you over and above basic  'rules editing', such as:               Team editing Version management of rules and related assets Asset management A deployment mechanism Security  Login  Import and export of data  [ 26 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Parts of the solution By now you should have understood the basic concept that a rule engine allows you  to capture your knowledge and integrate it into an enterprise web system. However,  a rule engine isn't just a black box. There are a couple of parts to it that are useful to  know about.  I don't know much about car mechanics, but I can check the oil and  tyre pressure. We'll keep the Drools technical bits at that level.   Chapter 1  Rules editor This is the choice of BRMS, IDE, Decision Table, or plain text file. All produce  a similar underlying rule language. The mechanism for deploying these rules   RuleAgent or some other equivalent  is similar.  Rules compiler Something needs to translate the near-English rules language into something the  rules engine can understand—this is what the compiler does. Your main awareness  of the compiler  as a BRMS user  is when it complains that it does not understand the  way that you are phrasing your rules.  Runtime As the information flows through your system, something has to be applied to the   compiled  rules. This is where the Drools runtime comes in. In general, you don't  worry about the technical aspects of this. You just care that there is something  applying the business rules that you have written in the live production system.  Fact model So we have a working system with information flowing from the Web, modified  by the rules, and then saved in the database. Obviously, when writing our rules,  we need to know the form that this information will be in.  Will we ask the user for  salary before or after tax? Will we ask the user what country he or she lives in or just  the post zip code?  The information has to be in a certain format.  Think of an Excel  spreadsheet. We need to know which column the salary information is stored in,  and if this is before or after tax.  The description of the information we need and the  format it is stored in is known as the fact model.  [ 27 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Drooling over JBoss Rules  Java Rather than writing the fact model in Excel, it's mostly written in Java. Don't worry,  at the level we're working  specifying the names of the information that we're  collecting and if it's a number, piece of text, and so on , it's not that complicated.  Remember that if you can handle Excel, you can do this. We've two approaches to  building the fact model:        For most of this guide, we'll assume that somebody else has done the analysis  and that all the information you need when writing the rules will magically  be there. Realistically, you're going to find things that are missing when you  start writing your rules. The Drools technical guide has more information on  how to build the fact model using Java. It's probably not beyond your ability to modify the fact model  just follow  the recipe even if you don't fully understand the low-level details . The main  reason you won't update it is that other parts of the system, such as the web  screens and the database, also use the fact model as it's a key part of how the  system is linked together. So, change a bit here without talking to the other  guys and you risk breaking things for them.  An important note is that the BRMS helps you edit the rules, and typically does not  form a part of the production system that the end users will see. That task is left to  the core rules engine.  Rule repository Rules are important and you're going to spend a substantial amount of time writing  them. While you can store them on your PC's hard disk, can you guarantee that  they're not going to get corrupted? If you store them on a shared network drive  with  backups  how to you manage the different versions  for example, you want to see the  business rules as of July 4th last year ? How do you allow collaborative editing and  track changes made by different people?  A rule repository solves these problems for us. Luckily, there is one built into the  BRMS Guvnor. But we've a couple of other options  for example, Subversion   should be wish to tie into the rest of the system.  Rest of the system Remember that a rule engine will not run in isolation, but be embedded in a wider  system. What the 'rest of the system' will be will depend on your project, but the  rules will pass data back and forward to it by means of the fact classes.

A couple of things you should consider before using a rule engine, are:  Chapter 1  Don't use a rule engine if your application doesn't have much complexity.  A lot of applications are just web pages that save information in a database.  Even if there are a couple of checks for business logic, is there enough to  justify the complexity of a rule engine? However, applications tend to  increase in complexity over time. So keep this in mind when you're making  your decision. Don't use a rule engine for the first time on a project that has strict deadlines  or is high-profile. Like all new technologies  to your organization , either  prototype the solution or gain the skills on a smaller project first. Don't use a rule engine when it's the wrong technology. What you may be  looking for is workflow, or doing things in a strict sequence. Or you may just  need a web page management solution such as Spring Webflow.  There are many places where you can use a rule engine. This is especially true when:  The business logic changes often There are people who understand the business problem in great detail, but  may not have the technical IT skills The problem may be too fiddly or complex for other solutions You need an agile solution—rule engines allow you to easily change the  business logic in an iterative manner  Summary This chapter has given us a good platform for understanding business rules and  JBoss Rules. We saw the problems that you might have. We looked at what business  rule engines are, and how they can evaluate business rules that appear very simple,  yet when multiple rules are combined are extremely powerful.  In the next chapter, we'll use this platform to dive into hands-on business rules. We'll  start with learning more about the Business Rules Management System  Guvnor .

But we will not get very far if we don't install the software first. So, in this  chapter we will see how to install the software.  What are we going to install? We will be installing four pieces of software. All of these are open source  that  is, free , can be downloaded easily from the Internet, and are available under a  business-friendly license.                 Java: This is the core computer language upon which all of the other tools   are built. BRMS Guvnor and JBoss App Server: This is a web-based rules editor   aimed at business users. We install JBoss App Server as the easiest place to  run this editor. Maven, a build tool that takes the various Java scripts  source  and  transforms them into a package that we can deploy on a web server. Using  Maven makes our examples easier to understand, as Maven automatically  downloads all the other software required. Eclipse and the Drools plug-in: Eclipse allows us to edit the Java files that we  will use for transporting information around the system. The Drools plug-in  gives us a more technical editor for rules, and the ability to see what is going  on inside the rules engine. Drools examples for this book— hands-on samples so that you get to know  Drools inside out.   This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Getting the Software  Who should install it? Broadly speaking, there are two types of people reading this book.        Technical people, who are already familiar with Java, but who want to  understand business rule technology Business people who have the domain knowledge, but to whom the  technology  and Java  may be new territory  Although the setup guide here is suitable for both groups, don't be afraid to ask for  help. The reason why all of the setup instructions are here in one place is that you  can ask your nice, friendly, technical support person to 'set up everything in Chapter  2', and then return to Chapter 3 knowing that everything is in place. Indeed, many  companies have their desktops locked so that regardless of your knowledge, you're  going to have to request this technical assistance.  Why are the instructions in this guide only for Windows? What about the  Mac and Linux users? As a complement to the Linux users, we'll assume that you know enough  about a computer to translate the instructions for your platform. Mac  users are in a trickier position. I am sorry that we had to concentrate on  the most popular platform. The software here will work on the Mac  it is will work on the Mac  it is  work on the Mac  it is  Java, after all , but you may need to follow up the links at the end of the  chapter to get Mac-specific instructions.  If you're technically adept, allow about one to two hours to install all of the software,  assuming you have a fast Internet connection so that you're not waiting too long  for downloads. Many of these instructions may be obvious  or you've done them  before . So feel free to plough on, but quickly check through to ensure that you've got  things set up correctly.  Installing Java Java is the computer language in which Drools and all other products used in this  book are written. So it's pretty important that we install it. Fortunately, it's an open  source product from Sun that will run on almost every computer platform.  It's important to note that there are different versions of Java, such as:     The JRE  Java Runtime Engine  is intended for end users. The JDK   Java Development Kit  contains this runtime, plus tools for the people  developing using Java  that's us! .  [ 32 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Chapter 2        Standard Edition  SE  is what we'll be using. There is also an Enterprise  Edition  EE  that takes the SE and adds a few more powerful services. While  it is likely that your business rules will be deployed in an enterprise system,  the SE is enough for the topics that we will cover in this book. Some versions of Java come bundled with the Netbeans IDE  a Java editor .  This is optional, as we use the Eclipse Java editor instead  because we can get  a Drools plug-ins for Eclipse, but not Netbeans .  When downloading Java, remember that the version we use is the JDK  developers'  edition  of Java SE. To start, go to the web site http:  java.sun.com javase  downloads index.jsp.  Download the latest version  at least 6 or 6.1  of Java, selecting the correct language  and operating system for your computer. On the next screen, select the download  method that you want to use. If you're not sure, click the link Windows Offline  Installation and save the file in a place that you'll remember. Once the download is complete, open this file. Click on Run, and then Accept the  license agreement,  but only if you don't intend to export it to North Korea, as per  the licence! . Unless you've specific reasons for doing otherwise, accept the defaults  of features and location by clicking Next. But be sure to make a note of the Install to  folder first  for example C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.6.0_06\ .  [ 33 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Getting the Software  The install should chug away for a couple of minutes. You'll also be asked to install  the runtime. Again, unless you've any specific reasons for doing otherwise, accept  the default features and locations by clicking Next. Let the install chug away for another couple of minutes. Amuse yourself by looking  at the advertisement for OpenOffice that appears.  By the way, OO is a very good,  and free, replacement for Microsoft Word, and is being used to write this book. So  if you have  ahem  a less-than-legal copy of Word, consider using OpenOffice as a  'drop in' replacement upgrade available from www.OpenOffice.org.   After another couple of minutes, you should see the 'Install complete' screen. Click   on Finish. The installer may open a web browser asking you to register. This is an optional  step. Feel free to provide your personal details to Sun if you wish. It's a reputable  company, but I prefer to keep my private details, well, private.  Congratulations, you now have the Java development tools installed!  Installing JBoss The BRMS Guvnor is a web-based business rules editor. So we need a web server  to install it on. If you don't happen to have a web server that can run Java to hand   although many companies do , then it's easy enough to install one. We're using  JBoss App server as it has the fewest steps to get the BRMS up and running.  Even though we're installing JBoss here, it is possible to run the BRMS  Guvnor on other Java-based App Web servers such as Websphere,  Weblogic, Tomcat, or Oracle Application server. See the wiki on www. jboss.org drools for more details.  Before we start the process, we need to tell JBoss where to find the version of Java  that we just installed. We do that by carrying out the following steps:  1.  First, right-click on the My Computer icon on your computer desktop.  [ 34 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   2.  Then, from the pop-up menu, select Properties, and the following screen  should appear.  A quicker way to carry out these two steps is to press the  Windows + Pause keys at the same time.

Then click on the Environment Variables button.  5.  Click on the New button in this window. In the New User Variable window,   enter the variable name JAVA_HOME and the location at which you  installed Java on the previous step. On my machine this is   C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_06, but it may be different on yours.

Click on OK  multiple times  to close the windows that have been opened   during the preceding steps.  Actual install Now you're ready to download JBoss from http:  www.jboss.org jbossas  downloads . Click on the download link on this page  take the latest stable version .  At the time of writing it's 4.2.2.GA, although 5 should be stable by the time you read  this. You'll be taken to the SourceForge download page. Select the filename ending in  .zip  and no other letters . Your download should begin. Save this file in a place that   you'll remember.  At the time of writing, there is an issue between JBoss 5 and the  in  progress  Guvnor. While this is likely to be resolved by the time you  read this, if you do encounter any problems  Error setting attribute  SecurityManagement  please try the 4.2.3 version  When the download has finished, unzip  that is, extract  the files to a folder of your  choice. By default, I use c:\software\JBoss. It might be helpful to follow this  convention on your machine so that all path names given in the book will be exactly  that same as on your PC.  If you don't already have a ZIP program  such as WinZip  installed on your machine   that is, if you double-click on the ZIP file and nothing happens, or Windows asks you  which program you want to use , then install a ZIP utility.  There are several. I tend to  use the open source 7-zip utility, which is available from http:  www.7-zip.org .   That's it! We now have the JBoss App Server installed  which was painless! . Now,   to run it, open the folder we just created  using Windows Explorer . Double-click on  the bin folder and you'll see a set of files. To start JBoss, click on run.bat.  After a couple of seconds, you'll see a new window with white text on a black  background. Look for the words Starting Jboss  Microcontainer , which indicate  that JBoss has found Java on your machine.  You may get a security question from Windows  or whichever firewall software that  you use . This is normal, so click on OK or Unblock.

This may have been renamed to  Guvnor version 5 by the time that you read this. In general, take the latest   available version.  Download this file to a place that you will remember. Once the download has  completed, extract  unzip  these files to a temporary folder—it should contain at least  one file, with the name drools-jbrms.war or guvnor.war.  Copy this .war file to the JBoss deploy directory. If you followed the same directory  name as I did when installing JBoss, this should be C:\software\jboss\jboss- 5.0.0.Beta4\server\default\deploy  that is, [wherever-you-installed-jboss]\ server\default\deploy .  Make sure that JBoss is running.  If it isn't, start it as per the previous step by clicking  on run.bat.   You should see the following line  highlighted  appear in the console telling you that  the application has been successfully deployed.

Installing Eclipse We use Eclipse to edit the Java files that transport data to and from Drools. It's also  the basis for the Drools plug-ins, including the advanced rule editor. To get started,  download Eclipse from http:  www.eclipse.org downloads .The version that  we want is the Eclipse IDE for Java EE developers, as this version pre-packages a lot  of additional tools and features.

Save the downloaded file in a place that you will remember  probably  the same place where you downloaded Java and JBoss . When the download is  complete, unzip the file to a folder of your choice.  I use c:\software\eclipse.   Opening this folder in Eclipse shows a set of files including eclipse.exe. This is   the Eclipse IDE file. Congratulations, you now have Eclipse installed!  This was   too easy.   Clicking on the eclipse.exe starts Eclipse. You should see the splash screen, and  then a request for where Eclipse should save its internal files. Normally I just accept  the default, making sure that the checkbox is selected  on the bottom left  so that I  am not asked the question again.  After that, a 'quick start screen' will appear with several useful links  feel free to click  around .

Not only have you installed Eclipse, but you have it up and running.  Installing the Drools plug-in Eclipse is not just a Java editor, but also a platform. This means that we can extend  it with any tool that we require. In this case, we're going to add the Drools plug-ins,  making it easier to edit and debug business rules.  The easiest way to install a plug-in is via the Eclipse update manager. This can find  plug-ins on the Internet and then download them, so it will need to know your  connection details. If you have a direct connection to the Internet  dial-up   or broadband  you won't need to change these.  However, in most corporate situations you will need to tweak the Eclipse settings.  The good news is that the Internet connection details you need will probably   be exactly the same as the connection details in Internet Explorer  and other   web browsers .

Look for the text 'Eclipse  Workbench update site'—the update site link will be shown next to this. You'll  probably want the most recent version  unless you specifically downloaded an older  version of Eclipse . Right-click on the Update site link and go Copy shortcut—the text will be similar to  http:  downloads.jboss.com drools updatesite3.3 . We'll need this address  in a minute.  Back in Eclipse, open the update site wizard from the main Eclipse toolbar  via menu  option Help  Software Updates  Find  Install . On the screen that appears, select  Search for new features to install, and then click on Next. Now we're shown a list   of already-installed features.

Chapter 2  Click on OK to return to the previous Update Sites dialog box  the New Update Site  should now have been added to the list, with a tick mark against it  and then click on  Finish. Eclipse should then contact the update site to see which  new  plug-ins are  available. A new screen will appear showing the plug-ins that Eclipse has found. Make  sure that the checkbox next to the Drools IDE is selected, and then click on Next. On the next screen, accept the terms in the license agreement  by selecting the  checkbox , and then click on Next. Unless you've any particular reason for doing otherwise, accept the default install  directory and click on Finish. Eclipse should now take several minutes to download  the Drools IDE software. After all of the features have been downloaded, you'll get  a message displaying the jars that have not been digitally signed. This is OK  most  Eclipse plug-ins don't have signatures . Click on Install All to proceed with   the installation.

Click on Yes to complete the installation. You'll know that the install of  the Drools tools went smoothly if you can see the Drools icon toolbar as part of your  Eclipse screen when Eclipse re-opens.  Congratulations, you now have the Drools IDE running on your PC!  Installing Maven Maven is a Java Build system from Apache  the same people who built the popular  web server . It takes Java source files and converts them into a format that we  actually deploy and use. We use Maven for two things: to build our samples  makes  the samples much easier to download and use , and later to build some of our   own Java code. More Maven documentation is available from the Maven site at   http:  maven.apache.org .  To get Maven, download it from http:  maven.apache.org download.html.  Select the ZIP file  all versions are the same, but compacted for download in different  ways . It's normally best to take the latest stable version. You'll then be asked to  select a mirror. Pick the one nearest to you; it should normally be OK.  Save the file to an easily-remembered place, and then unzip the file to a folder   of your choice. Following the same convention as before, I use a folder such as   C:\software\maven\.

This can take a couple of minutes. If the download is successful, you should see  output similar to the following:  Congratulations!

Ensure that you have the developer version of Java installed, and not just    2.  Check the proxy settings for Eclipse and Maven. If your download stops or   hangs half way through, try running the command again.  3.  Check that you don't have two copies of JBoss or Eclipse running at the    the runtime.  same time.  5.   4.  Check the versions of JBoss and BRMS Guvnor that you have installed. If   BRMS Guvnor is not working, try dropping back to an older version  of both  JBoss BRMS  and repeat the steps again. If you have any problems with setting up the Eclipse project for the samples   or even if you're seeing strange Eclipse errors later , remember that Maven is  the master build, and Eclipse  in this case  is just a glorified text editor. So try  these steps;  Close Eclipse, Delete the .classpath and .eclipse files in the  root of the folder and the .settings folder, then run the Run the command  mvn eclipse:eclipse again. Then follow the instructions to setup the eclipse  project again If you get a specific error message, try searching that term in Google.  6.  7.  Double-check the instructions on the Java, JBoss, Maven, or Eclipse web site    as appropriate . If everything else fails, read How to ask for help from the previous chapter.  8.   Summary Whew! We have covered a lot. If you've just re-joined us  because somebody has  kindly set up the technical items for you , then this is what we did:  1.  Set up Java. 2.  Set up BRMS Guvnor running on the JBoss App Server.  3.  Set up Eclipse and installed the Drools plug-in. 4.   Installed the Drools examples for this book and the Maven to build them.   We'll be using all of these tools in the next couple of chapters, starting with the  BRMS Guvnor to edit our business rules.  [ 57 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Meet the Guvnor  By now, you're probably keen to see if rule engines can live up to the hype. In the  previous chapter, we set up all of the tools that we need. Now we're going to dive  right in and write our first business rule.  Although we have a couple of choices of business rule editor, we will start writing  our rules using the Guvnor editor  formerly known as the BRMS . This is a user- friendly web editor that's powerful enough to test our rules as we write them. Along  the way, we'll explain some of these concepts:         A quick tour of Guvnor Loading the samples Our first business rule—Hello world  Taking a tour with the Guvnor If you've ever been in London, most of the taxi drivers will call you Guv'nor. We'll  avoid all play with words  and cockney rhyming slang  about 'taking a tour' and  'taxis' in this chapter, and just get on and see what the Guvnor screens can do.  Getting started When we set up Guvnor in the previous chapter, we tested it by going to a web  address similar to:  http:  someServerName:8080 drools-guvnor  http:  localhost:8080 drools-guvnor  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Meet the Guvnor  Open up the address in a web browser. The following screenshot uses Internet  Explorer  even if it only shows the web page , but Guvnor will also work with  Firefox, Safari, Opera, and most other browsers. You will see a screen similar to   the following one:  The screenshot shows the Guvnor login screen. By default, any username and  password will be accepted, unless the version has been configured with extra  security  for example, to use your Windows account details-ask whoever did the  setup . Click on OK, and you'll be shown the welcome screen.  General navigation The first screen you will see is the search screen. This screen, like most screens in  Guvnor, has the following components:             The Drools logo on the upper-left of the screen. Details of who you are logged in as on the upper-right  this will be blank if  you logged in using a blank username . This area also gives you the option to  log out. The Guvnor Navigation sidebar  Navigate Guvnor  allows you to access all of  the Guvnor functionality. In the search screen Rules  Find portion is shown. On the main, rightmost part of the screen is the functionality that we happen  to have open  in this case the search screen . This part of the screen will  change depending on what we are doing.  Navigating in Guvnor is fairly intuitive. Just click on the links  that's anything with a  '+' sign next to it  on the lefthand side of the screen within the navigation toolbar to  make them expand. Click on the displayed items to open them in the righthand side  of the screen. Note that after you open a few screens in this way, you'll have a row of  tabs across the top of the screen  similar to Excel . These allow you to switch easily  between the most commonly used Guvnor screens. The following figure shows the  tab bar in Guvnor:  [ 60 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Chapter 3  The search screen If you opened any other tab, you can return to the default search screen by clicking  on the Find tab of the Guvnor tab bar. You will see something similar to the  following screenshot:  The search screen  Find  works just like Google, allowing you to search for rules and  other assets that you use within your rules. But what's the Include archived items in  list option for? Remember we said that the Guvnor gave you version management?  Nothing is ever deleted, just shuffled into an archive in case you need it again in the  future—a bit like the 'Undo' feature in word, only much more powerful. Selecting  the Include archived items in list checkbox allows you to search for older or deleted  versions of rules and other assets.  What's this about assets? I thought this was a book about rules. Rules can't work in isolation. They need a support team. Assets provide  this support—things such as a data model  to get information to and from  rules , packages  to organize the rules into folders , and more. Remember  that all rules are assets, but not all assets are rules.  [ 61 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Meet the Guvnor  Administration If you did a search on the previous screen, the chances are that no results were  returned. By default, there is nothing to search for  unless samples or other rules  are hanging around on your machine from a previous version . This is good when  we write our rules  as we have a clean sheet , but not so good for our quick tour. To  make this clearer, let's load some sample rules.  Loading the samples The Guvnor samples, which provide the business rules for an extremely shady car  insurance company, are available from the Book Samples web site   http:  code.google.com p red-piranha .  Download the droolsbook_chapter3_sample.zip file and extract it to a temporary  folder. Find the repository_export.xml file. We'll need this in a minute. Within Guvnor, click on the Admin tab, then click on Import   Export.  You may  need to expand the Admin tab by clicking on the '+' sign next to it.  You will see the  Backup Manager tab, as per the following screenshot:  Click on the Browse button and select the repository_export.xml file that we  found earlier. Then click on Import  the button with the up arrow next to it . After clicking on OK to confirm that you want to import the file  remember, this will  wipe out anything that you have done up to this date , the system will churn away for  a few minutes. Then it will display a message indicating that the import is successful.  [ 62 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Chapter 3  Now go back to the search screen  click on the Find tab, or on the left sidebar click  on the Rules tab, and then select Rules  Find  and look for items with the word  'insurance'. You will now get plenty of search results.  Go ahead, and play around with Guvnor. You can always clear  everything by redeploying Guvnor. To do this, first stop JBoss  you  may need to press Ctrl+C . Then, in the folder that you installed JBoss  into  for example, C:\software\JBoss , there will be a folder called  repository—this is where Guvnor stores all of the rules. If you delete  the folder and restart JBoss, you have a new, clean, version of Drools  Guvnor. Be careful though, as this will wipe everything  Rules and other  assests  that you've created in this version of Guvnor!  What did we just do? In short, you saved yourself a lot of typing.  By now, you will be getting the feeling that the Guvnor is more than just a web page.  It is an industry-standard repository for your rules. A repository is useless without  being able to import and export information. We just imported the standard Drools  insurance sample into the Guvnor. It makes the web pages that we're going to view a  lot clearer when we see some real life examples.  The Drools repository is based on Apache Jackrabbit. This has its own  storage, but can be configured to use an industry-standard database such as  Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, or MySQL. No matter how good the database  is, it's still reassuring if we can import to it and export from it. For this,  Guvnor uses and XML-based format. If you're curious, open repository_ export.xml in your favorite text editor and have a look at it.  More on the admin page The administration page can do more than just import rules. This page gives   you functionality not directly related to rules editing, but vital for managing the   system—for example archiving items, managing rule categories, and so on.  [ 63 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Meet the Guvnor  To see what else the Admin tab can do, open it  if you haven't already done so  by  clicking on Administration  Admin  Categories. On the lefthand side you'll see  the following options:  Let's run through these:  1.  Categories: Every rule lives in a folder  or package  similar to what you  might find on your computer's hard disk. But we can also 'tag' the rule or  asset with a category name  such as 'sales' or 'accounts' . This screen gives the  ability to change these categories and tags.  2.  Archived Items: Archiving is like deleting  except that nothing really gets  lost . If we archive a rule or asset, it normally 'disappears' from that screen.  Otherwise the screens would get cluttered with older rules. This option lets  us find archived items if we need them again.  3.  Statuses: Rules and assets don't get written in one sitting. Often they pass  through various states such as 'draft', '2nd draft', 'review' and 'production'.  The various states will differ depending on the process your organization  follows. Luckily, this screen allows us to set various asset states  the default  ones being draft and production .

Import Export: We've already seen how to import rules into a system.   Export is the process in reverse  extracting rules from our system so that we  can import them on another computer and or back into our own system  at a later date . Note that the file exported is a compressed ZIP file. The  repository_export.xml file needed for importing it later is stored inside it. 5.  Error log: What happens when something goes wrong? The error log gives  you more details  over and above the usual error message that you will see  on the screen .  What's the difference between a category and a status? Although both category and a status? Although both  and a status? Although both status? Although both ? Although both  are used to describe a rule, they do different things. A status may change  over the lifetime of a rule  for example, moving from draft to production ,  while a rule will normally stay in the same category  for example, sales   during its lifetime. In addition, a rule can have only one status, but can  have many categories assigned to it.  Categories are important—every rule and every asset must have a least one of them.  So let's take a minute to look at the following Edit categories screen. The screen  shows the insurance categories that we imported in the previous step. If you want,  you can add, rename, or delete category names here. We can even nest categories  inside categories. But don't get carried away, as often the complexity isn't needed!

We  already saw the search find rules screen as soon as we opened Guvnor. To see the  other rules pages, click on the Rules tab, then expand both the States and Categories  submenus  by clicking on the '+' sign . Double-clicking on the Production state will  allow you to see the insurance rules, as shown in the following screenshot. If you're clicking through States and Categories, you'll see that many of the rules  assets are repeated. That's OK—a rule will have a state and one or more categories.  Think of it as many different ways of finding the same thing.  There are a lot of entries here  on the righthand side , but they all belong to a few  simple types. Process You are probably familiar with workflow diagrams. JBoss Rules allows you to draw  workflow diagrams in the Eclipse IDE  but not yet in Guvnor . This allows you to  have more control over the order in which groups of rules fire. The insuranceProcess  item in the above screenshot is an example of a process. The model We mentioned earlier that rules are deployed as a part of a larger system. So we need  a way of getting information into and out of the rule engine. The model lets us do this.  [ 66 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   To explain this in more detail, think of how you might email sales information  around our imaginary chocolate company from the previous chapter. You'd  probably send the information in a spreadsheet similar to one that follows, showing  customer sales for the month of February. The insuranceModel item in the above screenshot is an example of this.  Chapter 3  In the above screenshot, we have four columns showing Customer Name, Sales,  Date of Sale, and an indication of whether we've sold items other than chocolate  to the customer. Imagine the spreadsheet for March—the customer details might  change, but the structure of the spreadsheet  including the columns  remains the  same. The structure of the spreadsheet  but not the contents  is the model. For JBoss  Rules, it's written in Java.  Clicking on a model item  in the case of the rules in our Guvnor example, the  insuranceModel item  is a shortcut to the screen to upload or download the model  files that we created in Java. Guided rules The aim of the Guvnor is to allow the easy editing of business rules. The guided  rules screen  available by double-clicking on the Quick approval - safe driver, any  policy type rule in the previous screen  allows you to do this. This is a guided editor  that makes intelligent suggestions to help you write your rules. With this editor  you won't be typing any text, but using dropdowns and clicking on icons to create  business rules.  [ 67 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Meet the Guvnor  The following screenshot is the guided rule editor for the Quick approval rule:  The key features of the lefthand side of this screen are:                      Buttons at the top left to Save changes, Copy, and Archive the rule The When and Then sections of the business rules on the upper-left and   middle left Three green '+' icons next to the When, Then, and Options sections to add  more constraints or consequences Multiple '-' icons  next to the textboxes  allowing you to delete existing  constraints or consequences Options that describe the rule; for example, is it part of a process flow, is it  enabled, and the date that it is effective from Buttons  near the bottom , used to view the source  View source  and  validate the rule  Validate  A space  at the bottom of the screen  to allow  optional  information about  the rule to be specified  [ 68 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Chapter 3  On the righthand side of the screen, you will find the following features:         Options on the upper-right,used to change the Status and Categories Notes on the package to which the rule belongs Version history and other metadata about the rule, such as who created it  and when  Everything that you do on this screen actually creates the technical rule behind the  scenes  and hides the complexity from you . The View Source button allows you to  see  but not edit  the rule that is created for you. If you want the additional power of  editing technical rules, you can always use the technical rules screen. Technical rules Most of the assets in the insurance sample are actually technical rules  for example,  the Quick approval rule. If you open the Driver Glass Coverage rule  by double- clicking on it in the list of rules  you'll see a similar screen, but with text instead of  the guided editor.  Note that this text-based rule follows the same "when…then" format.  when                      When                Then      $driver : Driver   driverID : id   $supple : SupplementalInfo   driverId == driverID,      glassCoverage  == true    then       $driver.updateInsuranceFactor  1.05  ;               System.out.println "Driver wants glass coverage: " +               $driver.getInsuranceFactor   ;   Or, in plain English:  There is a Driver And that Driver has requested glass coverage  Update the driver's insurance factor Print a message saying that the driver wants coverage  The technical rules follow a predictable pattern, so it gets easier to understand and  even to write. We've to leave something for the next few chapters!

This menu allows you to create new  technical and business rules  like the one's we've just seen . It also allows you to  create DSL-based rules  a way of writing near-English business rules , Decision  Tables  an Excel-like format for business rules , and test scenarios  to make sure that  your rules work the way you intend them to .  Packages Packages are like folders. They are a way of organising rules and assets. The  difference between packages and directories comes at deployment time, when  everything in one package gets deployed at the same time. Opening the package    org  acme  insurance  base  shows you all of the assets available in the package. Most of these concepts  business rules, technical rules, DSL, models, rule flows, and  test scenarios  are familiar, but there are two new items: Functions and Enumerations.  We might want to call Functions, which are useful for calculations and the like, from  the rules. Enumerations are lists of values that we can use in our rules.  [ 70 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Chapter 3  The Create New button  just below the Packages tab  allows you to create new ones  of each of these items. If you select the main package  base , you will be able to see a summary of the  package details.  Java recommends a standard notation for packages names  that's where  the name org.acme.insurance.base comes from . Although you  don't have to follow this convention, there is no harm in doing so   especially when we start talking about the Java-based rule model later .  The package name looks a little bit like an Internet web address  although  it doesn't actually link to anything . The format is: companyurl.projecturl.subproject. anyotherdivisionsrequired. Most of the packages that you create will only need three or four levels.  However, there can be as many subdivisions as you need. You will see  more of these subdivisions when we talk about Java code  Fact models .  [ 71 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Meet the Guvnor  Some of the features on the package details screen  from top to bottom  are:                   The buttons Copy, Rename, and Archive at the top of the screen, used to to  copy, rename, and archive  delete but save a copy  respectively. Next, just below the Configuration heading are the statements that import  the fact model into the package. These are normally generated automatically  when we add the  Java  fact model. An optional Description of the package. A Save and validate configuration button, used to to save  and validate    the configuration. A Build package button, used to to build the package and put it into a  deployable condition  or let you know of any problems . A Show package source button, used to show the package source  for  example, the technical rules language that has been written by Guvnor  on your behalf . This shows the entire package  including imports and  functions , and not just single rules.  The button used to build the package is important, as building the package is the  step before deployment  that is, using our rules in a real-life production system .  [ 72 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Chapter 3  Deployment To open the deployment screen, click on the Deployment bar in the lefthand  navigation section  available on all screens . This screen plays a very important  role. It gets your rules and assets from the Guvnor editor and puts them into the  production systems.  When you edit your rules, they don't get deployed  to the live or real world system   immediately. Can you imagine being in the middle of writing the second of three  new rules and having the incomplete rule set deployed? The Deployment tab allows  you to control when your rules are released to the end users. It also allows you to  view previous deployments. Clicking on the Deployment tab displays the following screenshot. The list of  available snapshots comes from the packages built by the Build package button  under the Package tab.  In addition to the Delete and Copy buttons, there is a web link  URL . You can use  this in two ways. You can click on it here to download the package  if you wish to  copy and deploy it manually to the target system . Or you can right-click on the link  and copy the URL. Drools provides a component  called the RuleAgent  that we  can deploy into our production system. The RuleAgent can check for updates to the  package  via the URL  and deploy them to production automatically. The architects of your target system will probably have a specific deployment plan   generally it's not a good idea to deploy rules directly to production . Guvnor gives  you a couple of options, but this default one will help you to get your system up and  running quickly.  QA—Quality Analysis Here's a problem: You write rules and you check them to make sure they do what  you intend them to do. They work OK. Then you change a rule. So you have to test  them again. Still OK this time. What if it's the 60th time you've made a tiny change?  Are you tempted to skip the testing yet? Or maybe you'll test, but not as well as you  should. What if you've 600 rules? Do you test all of them?  [ 73 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Meet the Guvnor Automating testing in Guvnor The solution: You automate the testing. This is what the Guvnor Quality Analysis  page allows you to do.  This page is pretty simple. You know the inputs to your rules  for example, the  insurance application form for your typical first-time 21-year old driver  and the  outputs from the rules  the insurance premium that they should pay . The inputs  and outputs should be the same every time, which makes them ripe for automation.  The testing framework alerts you if the test results differ from what you expect. That  way, you spend less time testing and more time playing golf  or whatever it is that  you do . And you end up with better quality tests.  We'll create a simple test scenario when we'll write our 'Hello World' sample in the  next section. But as you can see from the following screenshot, this screen allows you  to run all of the tests.  Many people  me included  recommend Test-Driven Development or  TDD that is, you write your test before you write your business rule   write test, write rule, verify test, write test, and so on . The reason for  testing first is that, as a human, you may be tempted to "forget" to write  your test if the business rule appears to work OK. Over time, these single tests build up to give you a 'safety net' that  dramatically reduces the cost of things going wrong. It's much easier and  cheaper to fix something that you've just written  when your tests fail   rather than three months later when you go live and your airline is giving  away free transatlantic flights by accident on it's web site.  The test scenario screen allows us to run all of the tests in our package all of the tests in our package  the tests in our package  simultaneously, which is a useful sanity check for our rules, before deploying them.  [ 74 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Chapter 3  The analysis page The power of business rules comes from writing many simple rules that cover most  business scenarios. For example, insurance rates for drivers under 20 years of age,  insurance for the people above 40 years, insurance for the people above 60 years.   But what if we leave a gap  in this example, insurance for drivers in the age range   of 20-40 years ?  The analysis page carries attempts to catch these gaps. It's not perfect  especially for  more complicated scenarios , but for the items that it catches, you'll be glad that you  used it.  Hello World example It's traditional to show the simplest possible example—a rule that just says 'Hello  World' when it is fired during a test scenario. Writing the rule The easiest way to do this is to create a new technical rule. In Guvnor, select the Rules  tab, click on the Create new dropdown, and then select New DRL  technical rule . A  new screen will appear. We enter a name  HelloWorldRule , a category  that can be created using the Admin  tab we saw earlier , and use the defaultPackage and  optionally  enter a description  of the rule.  [ 75 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Meet the Guvnor  Clicking on OK will take us to the  technical  rule editor, similar to the one we saw  on our tour of the Guvnor  although at this point the rule is blank . In the main part  of the screen  the blank part  enter the following text:  eval true   rule "Hello World" when    then   end  System.out.println "Hello world" ;  The important thing about this rule is the when… eval true   statement. This means that the rule will always try to fire and carry out  the then part— that is, print the 'Hello World' message. Normally, our business rules would be much more choosy about 'when  they fire'  and have a lot more conditions in the 'when' part . But for our  simple sample, this suits us fine.  Next, save the changes by clicking on the Save changes button. You should be asked  for an optional 'check in' comment after clicking this button. Congratulations, you've  written your first business rule! Firing the rule Now we've a problem. Unlike most computer languages  for example, Java or C ,  we can't 'run' a set of business rules—after all they have no single start point!  So how do we test our shiny new 'Hello World' rule? The answer is that we contrive  a scenario that we know should cause our rule to fire. In Guvnor, this is relatively  easy to do using the QA screen that we saw above. We'll use the QA screen to create  a new test scenario where we can exercise our business rule.  This point about not being able to run rules is important and may be a  major change from what you are used to. Remember that with rules, you  say 'do this when this is true' and leave the rule engine to carry out that  instruction when it finds itself in that scenario.  [ 76 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Let's create a new test scenario in Guvnor. A little bit strangely, this is done via  the Packages tab. Select Packages  Create new  New test scenario, and a screen  similar to the one shown in the following screenshot will be displayed:  Chapter 3  Similar to what you did for creating a new business rule, enter a Name, Package,  Initial description and then press OK. The scenario-editing screen will then   be displayed. This screen has three green '+' signs that we use to set up our scenario. From top to  bottom these are:           GIVEN — allows us to set our inputs  that is, create a scenario in which we  know a business rule will fire  EXPECT — allows us to inspect the output after the rule has fired, to make  sure that it has worked correctly globals — allows us to pass in environmental variables that the rule may need  [ 77 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Meet the Guvnor  Fortunately for us, as our rule is set to fire every time, we don't need to set these   up. All we have to do is click the Run scenario button. When we do this, two things   will happen:  1.  We will see a message appear on the web page—1 rules fired in 0ms. Pressing   the Show rules fired next to this message shows that the 'Hello World' rule  was activated.  2.  We will see a 'Hello World' message in the web server  JBoss  log, similar to   the following:  What just happened? In the first part we created a rule that essentially said:  Anytime the rules are run  rule "Hello World" when    then   end  Print a message to the console  "Hello world" ;  The next step  firing the rules  was to contrive a situation where the preconditions in  the when part were met so that the rule would fire. For such a simple rule, this was  easy. In fact, we had nothing to add in this case. Finally, when we ran this scenario, the rule was activated, and the Hello world  message was successfully printed to the console.  Summary In this chapter we did three things. We loaded the Drools insurance sample into  the Guvnor editing tool to give us some very good examples. Then we looked at  the various Guvnor screens and saw that Guvnor can not only write rules  using  both guided and advanced editors , but can also organize them and other assets  into packages. The Guvnor screens also allow us to test and deploy these rules.  Finally, we wrote our very first business rule—the traditional 'Hello World' message,  announcing to everyone that we are now business rule authors.  We will use all of these skills in the next chapter. In that chapter, we will start on more  sophisticated business rules, using both Guvnor and more advanced editing options.  [ 78 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Guided Rules with   the Guvnor  In the last chapter we took a tour with the Guvnor and used it to write our first  business rule, and printed out a traditional 'Hello World' message. Although this  rule is a major step forward for us, we're not really using the full power of the Drools  rule engine. In this chapter, we're going to stay with the Guvnor rule editor, and use  it to write some more sophisticated rules. In particular, we're going to:             Show how to put information into and out of our rules Build a fact model to hold this information Import our newly built model into Guvnor Create guided rules using this fact model Run and test our new fact-based rules  Passing information in and out The main reason for the simplicity of our Hello World example was that it neither  took in any information, nor passed any information out—the rule always fired, and  said the same thing. In real life, we need to pass information between our rules and  the rest of the system. You may remember that in our tour of the Guvnor, we came  across models that solved this problem of 'How do we get information into and out  of the rules?'.  If you're familiar with Java, models are just normal JavaBeans deployed  into Guvnor JBoss rules in a JAR  ZIP-like  file; nothing more, nothing  less. In fact, a lot of the time you can use the JavaBeans that already exist  in your system.  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Guided Rules with the Guvnor  Here's a quick reminder of the spreadsheet that we used as an example in the   last chapter:  If we want to duplicate this in our model JavaBean, we would need places to hold  four key bits of sales-related information.           Customer Name: String  that is, a bit of text  Sales: Number Date of Sale: Date Chocolate Only Customer: Boolean  that is, a Y N type field   We also need a description for this group of information that is useful when we have  many spreadsheets models in our system  similar to the way this spreadsheet tab is  called Sales   Note that one JavaBean  model  is equal to one line in the spreadsheet.  Because we can have multiple copies of JavaBeans in memory, we are able  to represent the many lines of information that we have in a spreadsheet. Later, we'll loop and add 10, 100, or 1000 lines  that is, JavaBeans  of  information into Drools  for as many lines as we need . As we loop,  adding them one at a time, the various rules will fire as a match is made.  Building the fact model We will now build this model in Java using the Eclipse editor we installed in Chapter  2. Don't worry if this is your first bit of Java; we're going to do it step-by-step.

From the menu bar at the top the screen, select File New Project. Then   choose Java Project from the dialog box that appears. You can either select  this by starting to type "Java Project" into the wizard, or by finding it by  expanding the various menus. In the Create a new Java Project dialog that appears, give the project a name in  the upper box. For our example, we'll call it SalesModel  one word, no spaces . 4.  Accept the other defaults  unless you have any other reason to change them .   3.   Our screen will now look something like this:  [ 81 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Guided Rules with the Guvnor  When you've finished entering the details, click on Finish. You will be redirected to  the main screen, with a new project  SalesModel  created. If you can't see the project,  try opening either the Package or the Navigator tab. When you can see the project name, right-click on it. From the menu, choose   New  Package. The New Java Package dialog will be displayed, as shown below.  Enter the details as per the screenshot to create a new package called org.sample,  and then click on Finish.   If you are doing this via the navigator  or you can take a peek via Windows  Explorer , you'll see that this creates a new folder org, and within it a subfolder  called sample. Now that we've created a set of folders to organize our JavaBeans,  let's create the JavaBean itself by creating a class.  Did you play with Lego blocks as a kid—multicolored plastic blocks that  you could pull apart and stick together again and again? JavaBeans are  like those Lego blocks—instead of building toy houses, we can build  entire computer systems with them. Often, while playing Lego, you'd run out of blocks  often red roof tiles   just when you were about to finish. Luckily, in Java, we can create as  many blocks as we want. The class that we're about to put together is our  mould to let us do this.

For the moment, there isn't much there—it's akin to two nested folders  a  sample folder within one called org  and a new  but almost empty  file   spreadsheet  called Sales.  package org.sample; public class Sales { }  By itself, this is not of much use. We need to tell Java about the information that we  want our class  and hence the beans that it creates  to hold. This is similar to adding  new columns to a spreadsheet.  Edit the Java class until it looks something like the code that follows  and take a  quick look of the notes information box further down the page if you want to save a  bit of typing . If you do it correctly, you should have no red marks on the editor  the  red marks look a little like the spell checking in Microsoft Word .  package org.sample;  import java.util.Date;  public class Sales {  private String name; private long sales; private Date dateOfSale; private boolean chocolateOnlyCustomer;  public String getName   { return name; }  public void setName String name  { this.name = name; }  public long getSales   { return sales; }  public void setSales long sales  { this.sales = sales; }  public Date getDateOfSale   { return dateOfSale; }  public void setDateOfSale Date dateOfSale  { this.dateOfSale = dateOfSale;  [ 84 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   }                      Chapter 4  public boolean isChocolateOnlyCustomer   { return chocolateOnlyCustomer; }  public void setChocolateOnlyCustomer boolean choclateOnlyCustomer  { this.chocolateOnlyCustomer = chocolateOnlyCustomer; } }  Believe it or not, this piece of Java code is almost the same as the Excel Spreadsheet  we saw at the beginning of the chapter. If you want the exact details, let's go through  what it means line by line.  The braces  { and }  are a bit like tabs. We use them to organize our code. package—This data holder will live in the subdirectory sample within the  directory org. import—List of any other data formats that we need  for example, dates .  Text and number data formats are automatically imported. Public class Sales—This is the mould that we'll use to create a JavaBean.  It's equivalent to a spreadsheet with a Sales tab. Private String name—create a text  string  field and give it a column  heading of 'name'. The private bit means 'keep it hidden for the moment'. The next three lines do the same thing, but for sales  as a number long ,  dateOfSale  as a date  and chocolateOnlyCustomer  a Boolean or   Y N field . The rest of the lines  for example, getName and setName  are how we control  access to our private hidden fields. If you look closely, they follow a similar  naming pattern.  The get and set lines   in the previous code  are known as accessor  methods. They control access to hidden or private fields. They're more  complicated than may seem necessary for our simple example, as Java has  a lot more power than we're using at the moment. Luckily, Eclipse can auto-generate these for us.  Right-click on the word  Sales in the editor, then select Source  Generate Getters and Setters  from the context menu. You should be prompted for the Accessor  methods that you wish to create.   Once you have the text edited like the sample above, check again that there are no  spelling mistakes. A quick way to do this is to check the Problems tab in Eclipse   which is normally at the bottom of the screen .  [ 85 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Guided Rules with the Guvnor  If you do have any problems, you may be able to use the Eclipse quick-fix  feature  highlight the problem, then press Ctrl+1 . If that doesn't work,  check again and ensure that the spelling is exactly the same as shown  earlier. If that doesn't work, follow the steps in the How to ask for help  section near the beginning of this book.  Now that we've created our model in Java, we need to export it so that we can use in   the Guvnor.

All being well, you should get an 'export successful' message when you click  on the Finish button, and you will be able to use Windows Explorer to find  the JAR file that you just created.  What is a JAR file? JAR stands for Java Archive and is just another name  for a ZIP compressed file  you may be familiar with the WinZip utility .  Although our model is pretty small  only one file , compressing the files  and putting them in one place  the JAR  saves a huge amount of time  when deploying larger systems.  Congratulations! You have not only built your first Java file  possibly , but also  successfully exported it elsewhere for use. But now that we've built this, how do we  use it in the Guvnor?  Importing the fact model into Guvnor Switching back to the Guvnor, we're now going to create a package to hold our  brand new model that we created in the previous steps.  If you want, you can clear out the samples of Hello World from the last  chapter. Remember that you can't actually delete the items, but you can  archive them. Either way, none of the older samples will get in the way of  what we're doing in this chapter.  1.  From the lefthand side menu, select the Packages tab. 2.  Go to Package  Create New Package  org.sample   Create Package. 3.  From just below the Packages tab, highlight Create New and then select the   New model  jar  of fact classes.

Fill out the dialog box that is displayed, as follows. The Name  SalesModel    and Package  org.sample  should be the same as the ones we created in  Eclipse. Click on the OK button.  5.  Back in the main Guvnor screen, check that everything is in place.  In addition to the upload button  that we're going to use in a minute , this screen  also has a Download button  to retrieve JAR files that you may have uploaded  earlier . It also has the usual Save, Copy, Archive, and Delete options. To upload our fact model JAR into Guvnor , follow the steps shown below:  1.    Click on the Browse button, and then navigate to and select the JAR file that  we exported earlier. Click on OK.  2.  After returning to the screen above, click on the upload button  actually, the   3.   'up' arrow icon to the right of upload . If everything goes well, you will get the message File was uploaded  successfully. Click on OK to return to the SalesModel Package tab.

Save the updated package  by clicking on the Save Changes button . As with   other saves check-ins you'll be asked for an optional checkin comment.  5.  We can check whether Guvnor has successfully picked up the new package   information by expanding the org.package that was created.  Chapter 4  You can see from this example that in the Configuration section, under Imported  types, our class  org.sample.Sales  is listed. This means that Guvnor has not only  uploaded our class file, but will also allow us to write rules that use this class. Now  that Guvnor knows the format of the information that we want to pass in and out,  we can start writing rules using Guvnor.  Guided rules using the fact model Back at the chocolate factory, we've decided to implement a customer loyalty  scheme. When any customer has sales of greater than 100 dollars, we want to give  them a flat rate discount of 10 dollars. To put it in a slightly more 'rules-like' format,  our new business rule will look something like this:  when        we have a sale greater than 100 then       Give a discount  by adding a 'negative' sale   [ 89 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Guided Rules with the Guvnor  Yes, as a business rule it's slightly clunky, but it keeps things simple. In real life we'd  just update our sales object with the new balance after the discount  and keep a note  of what discount was given .  Of course, we're going to write this rule using the Guvnor. Or rather, you're going  to try to write the rule in Guvnor based on the last chapter's tour of the guided  editor. I'll show you the full step-by-step answer soon, but the end result will look  something similar to the following:  Some key notes and buttons to use in the Guvnor are:  1.  You're going to create a new rule using the guided editor in Guvnor. 2.  Click the '+' next to WHEN and THEN to add new conditions consequences    such as greater than 100 and Insert Sales -10 .  3.  The 'green arrow' icon allows you to refine these further. 4.  Guvnor will pick up the sales model that we imported earlier and offer it as   choice to you on a menu. If you make a mistake, the '-' icon allows you to delete a line.  5.   The step-by-step answer Before we write a rule we must make sure that we have a category assigned to it.  We can use any existing category or we can create a new one  under the Admin tab,  expand Categories  New Category . For this step-by-step example, we've created  a new SalesCategory. But categories are just descriptive tags, so it will work with  pretty much any name.  [ 90 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Chapter 4  After you've chosen a category, follow these steps:  1.  Create a new business rule by selecting menu option rules  create new    New business rule  guided editor .  2.  Enter the following values in the screen that is displayed. We will give the   new rule a name  SalesDiscount—although anything descriptive is OK . We  will assign a category  the SalesCategory that we created earlier . Then we  will pick the package  org.sample  from the drop-down list. After entering a  description  optional  we need to click on OK.  3.  We'll then be taken to the guided business rule editor that we saw earlier on   our quick tour. In the main section, click on the '+' sign next to the WHEN  label, to add a condition  that is, to restrict the circumstances under which  our rule will fire .

The Add a condition to the rule dialog will be displayed. We're going to  choose a fact type of Sales.  Actually, this will be the only fact type in the  drop-down list.  This means that our rule will fire only when a sales fact is  present. To put it another way, our rule only applies to the rules spreadsheet.  5.  After choosing this, we'll automatically be taken back to the guided    rule-editing screen.  6.  Back on the main screen, we'll see that Sales has been added as a condition.   Currently, this rule will fire for all sales, so we want to restrict it to only those  sales of more than 100 dollars.  7.  Because we want to elaborate on the WHEN condition, we need to click   on the green 'arrow' icon immediately next to the Sales condition. We'll be  shown the Modify constraints for Sales dialog box, shown as follows:  [ 92 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   8.  The first dropdown field contains a list of all of the fields  columns  available   for the Sales object. We'll choose sales  that is, the dollar value or amount    from the drop-down list.  9.  Back in the guided editor, another line will have been added. The default   value is please choose. Change this to greater than or equal to, as shown in  the following diagram.  Chapter 4  10.  Now we need a value to compare this field to  as part of the filter . Click on    the pencil icon to set this. In the Field value dialog box that is displayed, click  on Literal value. Literal values are numbers we can enter directly.  11.  Back in the guided editor, a new text box will have appeared. Enter 100     the value we want to use in our rule  in this text box.  That's it—the WHEN part of the rule is done and should look like the objective  picture that we saw at the very start of this sample . Now would be a good time to  save the rule  and enter a comment if you see fit .  [ 93 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Guided Rules with the Guvnor  The THEN part is somewhat easier, in that there are fewer steps to create it.   1.  Click on the green plus sign next to the Then section. The Add a new action   dialog box will be displayed:  2.  We choose to insert a new fact  in the first dropdown . Sales will be the only   option in this menu. Inserting a new fact is like adding a new row to the  Excel Spreadsheet  that is another line of information into the memory .  Logically insert a new fact does the same thing as inserting a new fact,  but automatically removes the row fact object as soon as the condition  stops being true. For this example, this wouldn't change anything as the  Sales won't stop being more than 100, but it would make a difference to  more dynamic rules  for example, if another rule reduced the price, and  we wanted to withdraw the discount in this circumstance .  3.  Back in the guided editor, the text Insert Sales will now be displayed. Click  on the green arrow next to this to begin setting to values for our new sales  object  this is similar to saying: once we insert a new line into the Excel  Spreadsheet, here are the values that I want to use in the newly created cells .  [ 94 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Chapter 4  4.  First we're going to add a name field. This will appear in the main guided  editor. Click on the pencil next to the name field to add a value. Enter the  value Discount  so that the purpose of the new line new fact is clear .  5.  Now that we've created our first field, we can repeat the process for the   second one—Sales. Add a field  click the green icon next to Insert sales  and  choose sales. Back in the guided editor, click on the pencil next to the new  line, and enter a value of -10.  6.  By now, the screen will look like the screenshot back at the start of this   section. Now is a good time to save your rule. Validate the rule by clicking on  the Validate button. All being well, you will see a dialog box similar to the  following example. To close the dialog box, click on the 'x' in the upper-right  corner of the dialog box.  Remember that validation is only a check to catch the most obvious  errors. It's still possible to get warning messages when we run and test  our rule in the next section.  To confirm that the guided editor has written the rule for us, click on the View  source button. The meaning  give a discount for sales of 100  is pretty much as we'd  expect. We've converted the rule into plain English.

In the next chapter, we'll show you how to  create your rule directly in the text  technical rule  editor. For the moment we've a  more pressing problem—how do we try this rule out?  Running this scenario The solution is similar to the one we used for running the Hello World example in  the previous chapter. The rule we want to exercise is a little bit more complicated, so  the scenario that we need to construct is also a little more complicated. To start, expand the Package tab and then create a new test scenario. Give it a name   for example TestSales , and select the same package for our rule  org.sample . You  will be presented  again  with the blank scenario test screen. The scenario that we're  going to create is similar to the following screenshot:  [ 96 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Chapter 4  The steps for building this screen are similar to those we used before. We use the '+'  sign to insert a new GIVEN EXPECT, the small green arrow to refine the scenario,  and the '–' sign to remove.  1.  Click on the plus sign next to GIVEN and choose to insert a new sales fact    under any name . Click on Add.  2.  Click on the Add a field button that appears. In the dialog box, select the    name field.  3.  Click on the green arrow next to sales to add another field  column in our  new row . In this case, use Sales and give it a value of 200  that is, greater  than 100! .  4.  Click on the green '+' next to EXPECT. In the New Expectation dialog box   that is displayed, click on show list and then choose the Sales Discount rule.  5.  Change the default  that we expect this rule to fire at least once  to    Expect Rules, to fire this many times, and then enter '1' in the new text box   that appears.  6.  Save this test scenario using the button at the top of the screen.  All being well, if you now click the Run Scenario button, you will get a green   bar at the top of the screen saying Results 100%, along with  some additional text:   Rule [SalesDiscount] was activated 1 times, which indicates that our rule is running   as expected.  What just happened? The test scenario that we created was equivalent to passing in a spreadsheet with one  row  that is, one Sales Java object with sales of 200 and a name of Acme Corp . We'd  expect our sales discount rule to fire under these circumstances and we tell our test  scenario to look out for this. When we run the scenario, our rule behaves as expected  and fires, giving Acme Corp a discount of –10 Sales for their order.  Summary In this chapter we have covered five main areas. We saw how to get information  in and out of our rules, and created the fact model in Java needed to do this. We  imported our new fact model into the Guvnor and then built a guided rule around it.  Finally, we tested our rule to make sure that it ran correctly.  Using our fact model in a guided rule is a good foundation for the next chapter. In  the next chapter, we start writing more powerful text-based rules, starting by using  the Guvnor editor, and then moving on to the desktop-based JBoss IDE.  [ 97 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   From Guvnor to JBoss IDE  In the previous chapter, we wrote our first real rule using the guided editor in  Guvnor. Although the guided editor is very useful, the rule that we wrote could do  with a few enhancements. We also had a glimpse of the behind-the-scenes text rules,  but they were for read-only purposes. As a part of our enhancements, it would be  good to use the additional power of these text rules. We'll look at using variables in  our rules by using rule attributes to provide extra information about our rules, and  editing text-based rules using Guvnor and the JBoss IDE.  A more powerful rule Our business rule from the last chapter was a bit silly. In real life there is no such  thing as 'negative sales'. It would confuse not only our customers, but also our own  company.  How would the Oompa Loompas in the shipping department put 10  boxes of chocolate into an empty truck?  Instead, we're more likely to modify the  price of our sales and update this price with the discount, to give the actual price to  be paid.  Applying this concept to our business rule, we'd end up with something like this:  when        We have a sale greater than 100 Dollars then      Discount the sales cost by 10%  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   From Guvnor to JBoss IDE   The following screenshot shows the same rule, expressed in the Guvnor's   guided editor:  The screenshot above shows a business rule that applies a discount to the sales price.  We're not going to get very far without understanding variables  such  as mySales and salesValue . You may be familiar with Variables from   other programming languages. Variables are placeholders for things that we want to refer later. They  are a bit like cells in Excel, but instead of names such as 'a1' or 'b15', we  give them easy-to-remember names. Here, any value put in mySales or  salesValue will be saved until we need it again.  Taking into consideration the knowledge that we have about variables, this rule is  more subtle than our plain-English version. What it actually says is:        When you find a line of sales  in Java or on our spreadsheet  greater than 100,  make a note of that line  and store it in a box called mySales . Make a note of the actual sales figure in that line  and store it in a box called  salesValue . Then modify our line of sales  mySales  so that the new sales figure is now  the previous figure minus 10.  Have a go That's the easy bit. Now you're going to build it, in order to try it out! Try it yourself  before skipping on to the step-by-step guide below.  [ 100 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Chapter 5  Updating the rule—step by step Our new or updated rule uses the same Java fact model as the previous chapter,   so it's going to be a lot easier to build. In fact, the step process is very similar, as it  uses '+' signs to add When  conditions  and Then  consequences . We'll concentrate  on the changes.  The When part  1.  Create a new rule and add a condition using a sales fact, exactly as before. 2.  When adding the first constraint, enter a variable name  mySales , as shown   in the following dialog box.  3.  This brings you back to the main guided editor, which will now show a rule   similar to the following:  4.  As before, select equal or greater in the drop-down box  please choose, in  the previous diagram , and use the 'pencil' icon to enter the value  100  that  we are filtering on.  5.  On the second line of the newly updated rule, click on the green arrow above   sales. An option to bind the actual sales total to a variable is shown. In this  dialog box, assign it to salesValue.  [ 101 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   From Guvnor to JBoss IDE   Remember that our mySales variable is akin to one line in a spreadsheet.  The salesValue is the sales column from within that line.  6.   In the guided editor, the Add a new action dialog box now has additional  options. Click on the green '+' sign, which is next to Then, to make these  options appear.  7.   In this dialog box we choose to modify the mySales fact.  The other options on this screen include retract  deleting the fact   from memory  and inserting, or logically inserting a new fact,   which work in the same way as before.  Back in the guided editor, we can click on the 'pencil' icon and enter the formula   =salesValues-10  to make our rule look like the one in the screenshot back at the  start of this chapter.  Looking behind the curtain—a text-based rule Before we jump in and run our new rule, let's catch our breath and take a look at the  source. Remember that when we were working through and building the above rule,  we were actually building up a text-based rule behind the scenes. Clicking on the  'view source' button might make our rule a little bit clearer.  rule "SalesDiscount"             end  dialect "mvel" when   then      mySales : Sales  salesValue : sales >= "100"    mySales.setSales  salesValue-10  ; update  mySales  ;  [ 102 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Chapter 5  We can guess most of what this means, but running through it allows us to see what  is going on.               Name the rule  SalesDiscount  Use the Mvel style for writing our rule  slightly clearer than the Java dialect  When We can find a row Sales of greater than 100, keep a handle to it called   mySales, and put the actual sales value into salesValue Then Reduce the sales by 10 Notify  update  all of the other rules that the sales has changed, so that they  may fire  or not  End of rule  A small problem... Now that we know what's going on, we go back to our test scenario that we created  using Guvnor in the previous chapter—the one called TestSales. We would expect  that when we click on the Run Scenario button  making no changes , we would get  the same results 100% message. But that doesn't happen. What happens is that the scenario fails with the message Rule [SalesDiscount]  activated 11 times. Expected 1 times. What happened? How can our rule have fired  11 times if we only have one test scenario?  What actually happened when we ran the test scenario is this:  1.  We put our sales object into the working memory  that is, passed it to JBoss   Rules , with a total sales of 200. 2.  Our discount sales rule kicks in. 3.  The sales value is now updated by this rule to 190 dollars. 4.  Drools detects that our sales object has been modified, and sees if any rule   can be applied.  than 100 .  5.  The same discount sales rule is found  as the sales value is still greater    6.  The sales value is discounted by a further 10 dollars. 7.  Repeat the last two steps until the sales value finally drops below 100 dollars. 8.  No more rules fire and JBoss Rules exits.  [ 103 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   From Guvnor to JBoss IDE   So the rule is doing exactly what we asked it to do—applying a discount to orders  with a sales value greater than 100 dollars. There are many instances in which we  want this recursive behavior. In fact, it's one of the advantages of using a rule engine:  It matches the business rule to the situation that it finds itself in, and then it fires.  What exactly is this working memory? Working memory is like a  scratchpad. All of the information that we pass to Drools is stored here.  When rules fire, the information in the working memory gets updated.  And when Drools is finished, a copy of the working memory is passed to  the rest of the program. The important thing to remember is that Drools only knows about and  fires its rules according the information that we explicitly place in the  working memory.  Rule attributes However, what we want the rule to do is fire once and then stop. To be more precise,  we do not want to have a rule that fires recursively in a tight loop. How do we  express this intention in a rule?  Luckily, Drools has a feature called rule attributes. This allows us to state more  information about our rule. The rule engine can use this extra information to modify  its behavior. In our example, we want to switch on the no-loop attribute—meaning that the rule  will fire again only if some other rule has modified the working memory in the  meantime. To express this in our rule using the guided editor in Guvnor, follow  these steps:  1.  At the bottom of our rule click on the '+' sign next to the options. 2.  Choose no-loop from the drop-down menu.  [ 104 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   3.  Save and run the rule  via the test scenario . It now behaves as we expect.   The test passes it correctly saying that the rule has fired only once.  Chapter 5  The no-loop attribute will stop the rule from being called; or rather it  will stop a rule from changing a fact in working memory, which could  otherwise cause the same rule to fire again. What no-loop will not prevent is the looping of two  or more  rules;  for example, Rule A causing Rule B to fire, which then causes Rule A to  fire, and so on. Well-written business rules with appropriate restrictions   in the When part  will avoid this situation. For example, we can add a  'discount amount' column in our fact model. Our rule will check that this  column was empty before firing and update the column when it fires.  That way, we would avoid any chance of looping.  Congratulations, you've not only written a much more sensible business rule, but  you’ve also touched upon your first bit of rule engine theory!  More on the guided editor When we were writing our rule using the guided editor, we came across a lot of  options that we didn't use. Some of these are obvious, but it's worth running through  what they are.  Possible comparisons When we added a fact comparison, we chose the option of testing to see if our sales  value was greater than 100. This comparison can also be a less than, equal to, not  equal to, equal to or greater than, or equal to or less than test. For text fields  String ,  Guvnor will also give you the option of using matches and sounds like.  Condition types When previously we added our first condition  using the '+' icon next to the WHEN  statement , we chose the Sales fact from the Add a condition to a rule dialog that  appeared. Not specifying a condition type means that the rule will fire every time a  fact is in memory.  [ 105 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   From Guvnor to JBoss IDE   We have a few other options in the second drop-down box  Condition type  in   this dialog:           This is no: This option is a simple negative value. The rule will fire only if  the fact does not exist at all in the working memory. There exists: The rule will fire once, no matter how many times the fact exists  in working memory. Any of: The rule will fire, no matter how many times the facts exist in  working memory. It differs from There exists because it can be applied to  multiple types of facts at the same time.  Once we add one of these condition types, we have the option in the main guided  editor to specify  as before  the Fact  for example, Sales  that the condition applies to.  Add more options On each part of the rule you'll see the Add more options icon  it looks like this This allows you to add additional conditions to the same line, based on the same value.  You'll see the full list in the dropdown once you click on this icon, but it allows us to  write more sophisticated conditions, such as:   .        If salesValue is greater than 100 and less than 200, then give discount level 1 If salesValue is less than 100 or greater than 100, then give discount level 2  [ 106 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Chapter 5  Note the following differences between using the ' the large green '+' icon that we've been using until now:  '  add more options  icon and   1.  The '+' icon only allows us to add And conditions  that is, all parts of the  rule have be true before the rule fires . The Add more options allows And  conditions as well as Or conditions. Or conditions are used when only one of  the conditions needs to be true for the rule to fire.  2.  The '+' icon allows comparisons based on multiple facts  for example, Sales  and Existing customers . The Add more options only allows comparisons  based on the same fact  for example, only Sales .  Multiple field constraints When we clicked on the 'green arrow' icon next to Sales, we modified the constraints  for the Sales object via the dialog box that appeared. At the time, we chose to add  restrictions on a field  salesValue , but we have a few other options in this dialog. We can add a multiple field constraint, which will allow us to combine one or more  conditions. This can be done as All of  and  or Any of  or . If you choose this option  in the editor, you can see that these can be nested to build up sophisticated  but easy  to get lost in  rules.  We also have the option to add a formula according to our condition. We won't go  into the details of this here, as we will come across a similar formula in our text rules,  before this chapter ends.  The following screenshot shows our rule once it has been updated with a multiple  field constraint. In this case, our rule will fire only when the sales value is greater  than or equal to 100 and the name either sounds like acme or matches acme corp.

Take a look at the same rule using the '+'  icon to add the additional conditions in the following screenshot. When do you think  this rule will fire?  The answer is: never. What this rule is saying is that it should fire only when our  Sales are greater than or equal to 100 and the customer name sounds like acme and  the customer name matches acme corp. The last two conditions are contradictory— our name must match acme corp, but if it does it won't sound like acme. So, just by changing the icon that we clicked on, we've changed our rule from 'or' to  'and', thus giving a very different behaviour. Beware of subtleties such as these when  building your rules, and test your rules using scenarios, to ensure that they behave  as you expect.  The Then part There are also a few options that in the Then part of the guided editor we skipped  over. These are context-sensitive, so they may or may not appear, depending on  what you have in the When part of the rule.  [ 108 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Chapter 5  The options are:                             Set the values of a field on: If we set a variable in the When part, we can  update that value here. Modify a fact: This is the same as setting the values, except that we notify  the rule engine that the values have changed  which may cause another set of  rules to fire, as in the last example . Retract a fact: Remove an item from working memory  which is akin to  deleting a line from our spreadsheet . This may cause other rules to fire. Insert a new fact: This will create a new line on our spreadsheet  and may  cause other rules to fire . This is the option that we used in the last chapter, in  our first sales discount rule. Logically insert a new fact: This is the same as Insert a new fact, but the fact  is removed again, as soon as this rule stops being true. Call a method on: This allows you to call a Java method  advanced . In this  way, you can pretty much use the full power of Java to send messages, link  to other systems, and so on, from your rules.  All of the options have dropdowns, which will provide appropriate selections from   our fact model and will update the main editor, allowing you to build your rule step   by step.  More rule options and attributes In our last version of the sales discount rule, we added a rule option called no-loop,  to ensure that the rule did not recursively cause itself to fire. You may have noticed  that there were several other options in that dropdown, and you may be wondering  what they are used for.  date effective and date expires allow us to switch our rules on or off,  depending on the current date. dialect: Rule can be written in different dialects—currently Java and MVEL,  with more to come. Both of the currently-supported dialects follow the same  'when...then' format, although MVEL is slightly easier to read  unless, or  sometimes even if, you are familiar with Java . dialect should not be confused  with DSL  Domain Specific Language , which is a templating mechanism that  allows near-English language rules. We'll look at DSL shortly. duration forces the rule to remain true for the specified duration before it  fires. This can be useful for a commodity-trading application, where the price   of chocolate beans, for example  must remain high for a specified period of  time before we'd fire a rule to sell it.

Remember that this in one of  the big differences from traditional programming languages.  However, we  can give hints to the rule engine as to which rule we consider should be fired  first. All other things being equal, the higher the salience for a rule, the more  likely it is that this rule will be fired first. agenda-group, auto-focus, and activation-group are all used by Ruleflow,  which we will cover in more detail in a later chapter. For the impatient,  Ruleflow is a means by which you can group rules so that they are only  available to be fired at specific stages in a business process. no-loop, as we already know, stops rule recursion. lock-on-active is a stronger version of no-loop, for use with Ruleflow.  Text editing We looked behind the scenes earlier, and viewed the text rule that Guvnor  automatically builds up for us. That view was read-only, but it is possible to write  text rules directly using the Guvnor editor—that's how we wrote our first 'Hello  World' rule. Even better, it is possible to start writing our rule using the guided  editor, and then switch to the text editor for the trickier parts. To do this, carry out  the steps shown below:  1.  View the source of the rule that we created in the guided editor. For this   example, open the sales discount rule and then select View Source.  2.  Copy the text of the rule from rule to end, inclusive. 3.   In the side bar of Guvnor, create a new technical rule  Rules  Create New   New DRL . You'll be presented with a New DRL dialog box that looks  familiar. Enter the values as shown in the screenshot below these steps, and  then click on OK.  4.  We will be shown the technical rule editor. This is similar to the guided   rule editor except that in place of all the dropdowns, you have space for  editing text. Into the text editor, paste the text of the rule that you copied in step 2 earlier.  We can then save the rule and run it as before.  5.   [ 110 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Chapter 5  That's it. You've written  and run  your first text-based rule. But what is this DRL  thing? A DRL file  often with the extension .drl  is the file where Drools stores its  rules, in much the same way that a file with the extension .doc is a Word file, and a  file with the extension .xls is an Excel file. Inside, it's a DRL file just a text file, which  we can open in Notepad, or one of the other text editors, such as the JBoss IDE.  Introduction to the JBoss IDE The text editor in Guvnor is useful, but for the moment, it is not as powerful as  some of the other editors that are available. For example, it doesn't have syntax  highlighting  coloring that makes the business rules easier to read  or the inline  highlighting of errors. Compare the plain grey text in Guvnor with the following  screenshot of the JBossIDE, where the rules are much easier to read.  So what is the JBoss IDE? There are a few ways to answer this question:           An IDE is an Integrated Development Environment. This is a fancy way of  saying 'you can edit all of your files in one place'. The JBoss IDE is based on the Eclipse open source platform. If you look at   the applications on your desktop, you'll see that a lot of them have   common functionality  open file, save file, and so on. . Eclipse provides this  functionality not only for Java, but also for editors for other languages.   There are even Eclipse-based financial applications. The whole aim of Eclipse is a platform for extensions, so basically the JBoss  IDE = Eclipse + extensions. The extensions provided are not only for rules  editing, but also for things such as workflow, storing information in databases   Hibernate , faster web development, and distributed applications  Seam .  [ 111 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   From Guvnor to JBoss IDE   Think of the IDE as a text editor that can edit multiple files at a  time. Yes, it can do a lot more powerful things, such as allowing  us to test and run our text-based rules, but we'll get to that later.  Now, does a text editor seem quite as daunting?  We came across the JBoss IDE in Chapter 3, when we used it to edit our Java-based  fact model. In this chapter we're going to concentrate on the rules-editing extensions.  Previously, we only looked at the IDE in passing  as we were using it to create just  enough Java to get by . This time it is worth taking a more detailed look around, as  we'll be using the IDE quite a bit in the next few chapters. The parts of interest in the  above screenshot are:        Main menu bar: This is at the top of screen, and contains commands such  as File, Edit, Search, Window, and Help. A lot of these commands  such as  File, Save, and Edit  will be familiar to you. Menu icons: There is a set of icons just below the menu bar. Just like Word or  Excel, these are shortcuts to the functionality provided by the main menu bar.  [ 112 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Chapter 5                    Main editor: In the centre of the screen is the main editing space. In the  screenshot above, this is showing a rule  Sample.drl  being edited. If we  have more than one file open at a time, multiple tabs will appear  in the same  line as Sample.drl  which allow us to switch between the open files. There is  an 'X' on each tab, which allows you to close it.  You will be prompted if you  want to keep any unsaved work.  The lefthand panel, by default, shows the project explorer  that is, a way  to view all of the files of the project . Like most things in Eclipse, this panel  is configurable. For example, selecting Window  Show View  Other   General  Navigator will cause a Windows Explorer type view to appear  in the lefthand panel. The project explorer will remain open, and tabs are  available to allow you to switch between these two views of the same project. The righthand panel, by default, shows an outline of the currently open   file—in this case, the rule we are editing. This is also configurable. For  example, dragging the Outline tab and dropping it onto the lefthand panel  will cause it to be displayed there. Right-clicking will cause a context-sensitive menu to pop up, just like in other  Windows applications. For example, right-clicking on the Outline tab and  selecting Fast view will minimise the view to an icon in the bottom left of the  screen, to save screen space. Don't worry; you can click on this icon to see its  contents again  or right-click on it to restore it to the way it was previously . The Status Bar at the bottom of the screen is where the fast view icons  migrate to. It also shows messages from Eclipse, such as if Eclipse is working  on a background task  for example, validating a rule . The bottom set of tabs are also configurable  that is, we can drag and drop,  or fast-view just like the left- and righthand panels . The two tabs shown in  the screenshot that we're most interested in are Console, where anything  we print out from our rules is displayed, and Problems, which shows any  problem  for example, incorrect spelling  that we may have.  [ 113 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   From Guvnor to JBoss IDE   Now that you're interested in using the JBoss IDE to edit your rules, lets get started.  This is similar to creating a new Java project  which we did in Chapter 3 , that is: 1.  Choose File  New  Project from the main toolbar, but this time choose   New Drools Project as the next step.  2.  Give the project a name  for example, ChocolateFactory , but click on Next    and not Finish . The dialog that is displayed is shown in the screenshot   that follows.  3.  Take the existing samples.  Actually, the only samples we need right now   are the first two, but selecting them now will save you having to recreate the  project later.   Next, click on Finish. Your JBoss IDE will look similar to the one we walked through.  Hello World in the JBoss IDE editor When we started with the Guvnor IDE editor, our first rule was 'Hello World'. It  would be a pity to break a fine tradition, so let's write our first rule in the JBoss IDE  in the same way. Even better, the steps that we just followed  to set up samples as  part of a new Drools project  means that all the hard work of typing is done for us.  All we need to do is poke around and understand what is going on.  [ 114 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Chapter 5  Looking at the project explorer  on the lefthand side  and expanding the folders   using the small arrow icons  shows that quite a few folders and files have been  added to our project. These follow a standard format, so once you understand them  for this project, you'll be at home in bigger, more complex projects.                 src main java: this folder contains the text files holding the Java code   *.java . We saw these in Chapter 3 when we were building our Fact Model  to transport information into and out of the Rules Engine. Of course, Java is a  lot more powerful than that. DroolsTest, a Java-based test, is highlighted in  this folder.  We will run it shortly. src main rules: This folder contains the text files containing the source for   the rules. JRE System Library: This is a shortcut to the Java toolkit. Without the Java  toolkit, the Java code wouldn't mean anything to the computer.  Drools Library: This is a shortcut to the Drools toolkit. If the Drools toolkit is  missing, the computer will not know how to convert the rules into code that  it can understand. bin: Before we can run our rules, we must convert them from text that  we understand to a format the computer understands. This step is called  compilation, and the computer-format output is stored in the bin folder. In  Guvnor this step is performed behind the scenes, but we are still notified of  any errors in compilation  for example, spelling mistakes .

Let's run  it first. Right-click on the DroolsTest.java file and, from the pop-up menu that  appears, select Run As  Java Application. After a second or two, the following  message will appear in the Console.  Remember the Console? It will be in the bottom  set of tabs on your screen.   What just happened?  In summary: we loaded some rules and passed them some information; the rules  fired; and words were printed to the Console. The business explanation A longer explanation will gloss over what is happening in the Java file  DroolsTest ,  except to say that it loads the rule file  Sample.Drl , passes in a fact object  Message   with a status of 'Hello' and message text of 'Hello World', and then fires the rules.  So what happens when the rules fire? That's the bit we're interested in. So, open  Sample.Drl and let's have a look. We'll see that one file contains two rules:   Hello World and GoodBye. The first two lines of the file are a package statement   saying what folder it lives in  and an import statement.  What's this import statement? Our Java code passes to the rules the  Message fact object, which contains important information.   Drools needs to know more about what sort of fact it is.   The import statement  standard in Java  tells Drools about the folder   and file where it can find more information. Previously, Guvnor  automatically generated the import statement for us.  [ 116 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Chapter 5  package com.sample        import com.sample.DroolsTest.Message;  rule "Hello World"    when       m : Message  status == Message.HELLO, message : message      then       System.out.println  message  ;        m.setMessage  "Goodbye cruel world"  ;       m.setStatus  Message.GOODBYE  ;       update  m  ; end  rule "GoodBye"    no-loop true    when       m : Message  status == Message.GOODBYE, message : message      then       System.out.println  message  ;        m.setMessage  message  ;          end  The intention of the business rules is fairly clear. Let's work through them line by line:  rule "Hello World"    when       We find a message fact, and its status is 'Hello' , put the fact         in a box called 'm' and put our message text in a box called                        'message'     then       Print the contents of the 'message' box         Set our message text to 'Goodbye Cruel World'       Set our message status to 'GoodBye'       Notify the Rule engine that our message fact has changed end  rule "GoodBye" no-loop true    when       We find a message fact, and its status is 'Goodbye', put it in         a box called 'm' and put our message text in a box called        then       Print the contents of the 'message' box    end    'message'         [ 117 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   From Guvnor to JBoss IDE   So, this is what happens when the rules are called:  1.  When Drools gets called, it starts with a message fact that has a status Hello.   It also looks for rules that match this fact.  2.  The first rule  Hello World  matches. It prints the message, updates its status   to GoodBye, changes the message, and notifies Drools of the change in the  fact status.  3.  On hearing that facts have changed, Drools searches for rules that match    this newly-updated fact and finds the Goodbye rule that applies to the   new situation.  4.  The contents of the message  GoodBye Cruel World  are printed. 5.  There are no more matching rules to fire, so Drools finishes and returns the   updated fact objects to the program that called it.  Easy when you know how, eh? The technical explanation Normally, as a business rule writer, you don't care about the system that calls your  rules. You let somebody else worry about all that stuff. But if you're the 'somebody  else'  for example, if you're a Java programmer wanting to know how the magic is  done and how to deploy rules as part of a web application , read on. If you're not a  'techie', there's nothing going on 'behind the scenes' that Guvnor doesn't do for us  automatically; so it may still be worth a peek.  Not surprisingly, the bit that you're interested in as a  Java  programmer is in the  Java   file DroolsTest. Open it in Eclipse.  Pressing Ctrl+Shift+R, and then typing DroolsTest  is a quick way of opening it.  The key lines to watch out for are as follows:           The public static final void main String[] args  method is a Java  convention. When we run DroolsTest, the starting point is in this method. The first line, try, and the catch line towards the end mean 'stop if you  encounter a problem and do something'. In this case, the 'something' is to  print out the details of the problem. The readRule   method contains the lines of code that we use to find  and  load  our Sample.drl file, and convert it into a RuleBase  that is, a set of  rules that are ready to fire . It may look complicated, but the steps that we  take here are pretty much the same as if we had loaded the rules from a file  or directly from Guvnor. We'll go into these steps in more detail later, when  we cover other rule deployment options.  [ 118 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Chapter 5              The following two lines call the readRule   method and use it to get a  working memory—a stateless or goldfish-type memory that remembers the  results of our rules firing, and then forgets it as soon as we want it to forget: RuleBase ruleBase = readRule  ; WorkingMemory workingMemory = ruleBase.newStatefulSession  ;  At the end of our file is the fact object message  public static class  Message . It's the same idea as our sales object from the previous chapter   a placeholder for carrying information into and out of the rules , except that  this time it shares the file with the rest of the code, instead of having a .java  file all to itself. Using this message template, the following lines create an actual object  a  bit like making a cookie using a cookie-cutter template , and then add the  information that we want to pass: Message message = new Message  ; message.setMessage   "Hello World"  ; message.setStatus  Message.HELLO  ;  Finally, the following lines pass our message to the rules and tell Drools to  start firing the rules as is appropriate  that is, the bit that we discussed in the  previous section :  workingMemory.insert  message  ; workingMemory.fireAllRules  ;                 Try it yourself Although the business and technical explanations of our rules may appear daunting,  the fact is that the same lines appear again and again—familiarity may not breed  contempt, but hopefully, confidence! In fact, to prove the point, you're going to use the  IDE to change the above rules. Change the rules so that instead of printing Goodbye  Cruel World, it prints Goodbye  whatever your name is . For the really advanced  readers  those who have a taste for playing around with the .java files , do the same  for the Hello message: change it to Hello  insert name here .  Why should we use the JBoss IDE instead of Guvnor? It's your choice, but many  people find that the text editor is more powerful. And if you're interested in the way  we call rules  that is, you going to be the poor soul writing the Enterprise Java code  as well , then this chapter has shown you that we need to load and call our rules; and  you're probably already familiar with the Eclipse environment anyway.  So the IDE isn't that big and scary; it's just another way of wiring the same rules. Go  ahead and play with it. If the worst happens, you can delete and start again.  [ 119 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   From Guvnor to JBoss IDE   Summary This chapter pushed the boundaries of what we can do with the Guvnor rules editor,  and then brought in the JBoss IDE as an even more powerful tool for writing rules.  We started by using variables in our existing sales discount rules, to get around the  problem of having negative sales. Then we came across rule attributes  for example,  salience  to stop our rules from making changes that cause them to fire again and  again. After testing this successfully, we looked at text-based rules—both in Guvnor  and the JBoss IDE—that run the Hello World example in the new environment.  Now that we've written more complicated rules, in the next chapter we'll look at  ways to make sure that our rules don't break—both now, and in the future.  [ 120 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   More rules in the JBoss IDE  In the previous chapter we moved away from the Guvnor editor and started using  JBoss IDE to edit our rules. Our Hello World example was a useful start, but we  know that rules can do much more. For example, consider the poor Ooompa  Loompas that are shipping the chocolate bars out of the factory door. Wouldn't it be  nice if we drew up a shipping schedule for them? Before we do that we'll look again  at the structure of a rule file. Towards the end of this chapter, we'll look at some  more advanced rules that we can write and run in the IDE.  Rule syntax  We bumped into our first rule  .drl  file in the previous chapter. We will see a  lot more of it here, so it's worth going over it again. Our rule file can contain the  following elements:  1.  package: Package-name is the name of the folder in which a rule file lives.   This is useful for organising our rules  especially when you build up  hundreds of them . import: This pulls in any Java class files  including fact models  that we use  in our rules.  2.   3.  global: This defines the global variables that we use. Remember variables    boxes that hold values ? Earlier, they were emptied as soon as our rule had  fired and only changes to the facts lived on. Compared to 'normal' variables,  global variables live longer, and allow us to pass information into and out of  our rules.  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   More rules in the JBoss IDE  Passing information into and out of our rules via a global variable  is almost the same as passing a fact into the rules. The difference is  that the rule engine does not match  or fire  against global variables. variables..   This makes the rule engine more suitable for passing in items that  change slowly, such as the current date, counter, and so on, and  giving rules access to external resources  such as log files .  4.   function: Sometimes you may need to perform the same calculation in many  rules. Defining a function allows you to perform the same calculation again  and again. Note that it's often easier to call a normal Java function to carry  out the same task.  5.  rule: This is the 'when…then' structure that we've spent most of this book is the 'when…then' structure that we've spent most of this book   talking about.  6.  comments: These are pieces of text ignored by the rule engine, which explain   what is going on with us. They can be on a single line  anything after '  '  until the end of the line  or split over multiple lines  everything between the   * and *  Comments split over many lines .  In the Hello World example, our rule  the 'when...then'  was fairly simple. We matched  Message.STATUS  when , updated that status and printed a message  then . Let's look  at the other options available to us. We'll start with the When part of the rule.  Patterns for the When part Remember our rule from Chapter 4 that calculated the discount on the chocolate sales?  Using the fact model from that example  sales.java , the following are all valid  'when' conditions. The following code extract shows most of the simple conditions that  we can use in our rules. Note that it would be impossible for this rule to fire, given that  all of the contradictory conditions cannot be met at the same time. Drools would also  complain that we use same variable name  $mySales  twice in one rule.  Drools recommends the convention $variableName; dollar sign, first letter  small, and capital letter for each of the following words in the variable  name. But it's only a convention. Note that variable names are also case  sensitive, that is, $variableName is not the same as $VARIABLENAME.  [ 122 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Note the use of the "  " single-line comments to explain what each line does.  Chapter 6  rule "show various conditions" when   Simple match on all sales, no assignment of variable Sales      matches all sales lines, one by one, assigns to local var MySales $mySales : Sales       additional filter on customer name. Corrpesponds to getName   on  sales JavaBean $mySales : Sales  name=="acme corp"    'or' - both lines do the same thing $mySales : Sales  name=="acme corp" or name=="beta corp"  $mySales : Sales  name=="acme corp" name=="beta corp"    and - three lines do the same thing $mySales : Sales  name=="acme corp" and sales>100  $mySales : Sales  name=="acme corp" , sales>100  $mySales : Sales  name=="acme corp" && sales>100    Number comparison $mySales : Sales  sales==100    equals 100 $mySales : Sales  sales<100    less than 100 $mySales : Sales  sales>100    greater than 100 $mySales : Sales  sales!=100    not equal to 100 $mySales : Sales  sales>=100    greater than or equals 100 $mySales : Sales  sales<=100    less than or equals 100   Use of bracket reorder the evaluation of the condition   The 'and' condition is performed first, then the 'or' condition $mySales : Sales  name=="acme corp", sales>100 && sales<200    then   end    do something  In the above example, we could also test for customers with empty names by using a  condition similar to:  $mySales : Sales  name== null   null is another of those words with a special meaning; think of it as void or  completely empty. Note that this is different from name== "", which means it does  have a name, but that name is blank. "" is like a blank sheet of paper, whereas null  means no piece of paper at all. Still confused? Then you can test for both as follows:  $mySales: Sales  name== null or name==""   [ 123 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   More rules in the JBoss IDE  Sometimes when you're running rules, do you get an error related  to null called nullPointerException? OK, make that you will  frequently get a nullPointerException. This error means that we are trying to do something like sales. getName  , except that sales are null. Drools and Java do not know  how to handle this. So it stops, tells you what went wrong, and waits for  your next move.  Patterns for the Then part In the Then part of the rule we can use just about any Java code, plus the Drools  constructs given as follows. The following consequences are all valid, as long as we  have a variable called $mySales defined in the When part  like we defined in the  previous example :           lid Java code, such as the System.out.println "HelloWorld"  from   Any valid Java code, such as the the previous examples. The insert statement tells Drools that we have created a new fact that it  should be aware of. This can be done using a variable  for example, insert   $mySales   or creating a new fact on the spot  for example, insert  new  Sales   . The update statement is similar to insert, but is used where the fact existed  statement is similar to insert, but is used where the fact existed  before the rule started  for example, update $mySales  .  In the next example, we'll use a variant of update  , called modify  . This is a  useful shortcut when we need to change several items in a fact at once  for example,  Sales number, date, and name .  Shipping chocolate bars Armed with the latest business rule information, we can now go about helping our  Ooompa Loompas. They work hard at loading all of the chocolate bars that we are  making onto trucks, to ship to the customers who are busy sending us orders. In fact,  we are getting so many orders that we are limiting each customer to one box of 210  chocolate bars a week.  Now, if you've ever worked in a packing or a shipping department, you know that  your hands are always busy. You just want to be told what and when to pack, and  you don't have to calculate your next step. So, using Drools, we're going to write a  list of what to ship and when to ship to each customer.

We don't work on holidays, so we ship our chocolate bars the next   working day.  How do we write this in a way a computer can understand? write this in a way a computer can understand?  this in a way a computer can understand?  The problem  and remind me why I need  business rules  If we were writing this in a normal computer language, we'd have something like   the following:  Start Loop Have we shipped all the chocolate bars yet? Yes – go to end of loop Is today a holiday No – Ship 210 bars and update totals Is tomorrow a holiday? No – Ship 210 bars and update totals . . . .  Have we shipped all the chocolate bars yet? Yes – go to end of loop End Loop  This code will  almost  work, but we've got the following problems:              Even though it's written in plain English, can you identify the six business  rules that are embedded in it? Take a peek down to our business rule  solution to find them all. Most code is not written in English, but in Java or C. Would you be able to  find the business rules hidden in a technical language like Java? This example will break if we have more than two holidays in a row, but it's  not immediately obvious from the text. What if we want to change our business rules  for example, to have time off on  the weekends ? If we do this on a separate line  to keep our sample clear  and kends ? If we do this on a separate line  to keep our sample clear  and  have two days off per weekend, the code becomes 40%  four lines  longer.

Adding 10 business rules would take about 500 lines to  write  and the size increases exponentially . For the mathematically inclined, that is  10 lines times our 40% extra complexity per rule times our 10 extra business rules or  10*1.4^10. A fault in any of these lines could break the entire function.  By contrast, our Drools business rules are independent. Adding another means that  we add only 10 extra lines each time  not including whitespaces or comments . See  the business rules example below and count the lines yourself! That's 10 lines extra  for the first rule and 10 lines extra for the 16th rule, as each rule does not make the  previous rules more complex to write.  Rules may give a slightly longer solution at the beginning, but increase in efficiency  as the project grows for all but the most trivial solutions.  Getting and building the sample You could type in the entire example that we will describe in the next couple of  pages. Or you could download the Chapter 6 example from http:  code.google. com p red-piranha , unzip it into a directory of your choice, and then review it at  your leisure. We recommend downloading, as it's a much more pleasant option.  Once you've downloaded and unzipped the Chapter 6 example, you're ready to  open the JBoss IDE. The sample includes the necessary Eclipse settings. Create a  new Eclipse project  as we've done for the previous samples  and in the wizard that  appears, open the folder where you have unzipped the Chapter 6 example. Eclipse  should automatically pick up the project settings.  When you've created the Eclipse project, you will notice that the supporting libraries   such as the Drools core  are missing. This is deliberate, as it reduces the size of the  example file that you have to download. Fortunately, the sample also contains a  Maven project file  pom.xml . We set up Maven in Chapter 2, so you can build the  project  and download the required libraries  as follows:  1.  Open a command window  DOS prompt . Open a command window  DOS prompt . d window  DOS prompt . 2.  Go to the folder containing the project, for example,    cd \some-project-folder.  3.  Type mvn eclipse:eclipse. This will generate the Eclipse project. Then, This will generate the Eclipse project. Then,   download all of the dependencies.  At this point  once you see the build successful message  when you refresh the  project  right-click on the project name in Eclipse and select Refresh , all of the  required libraries will be available.

After the first download, Maven keeps a local After the first download, Maven keeps a local  the first download, Maven keeps a local  copy, and as long as the version number is up to date, it will use that file  for future examples. You'll notice the speed difference in future chapters.  For information, if you wanted to go one step further and build the project from the  command line you can also run the command mvn clean package. This will give  you a deployable JAR file. For the rest of this chapter, we'll concentrate on running  the examples through Eclipse.  Rules Let's take a quick look at our rule file, shipping-rules.drl. The first part of the rule  file contains the usual package and import information. At the bottom of the extract,  we can see the declarations for two global variables.  package net.firstpartners.chap6;  import java.util.Date;  import org.apache.commons.logging.Log;  import net.firstpartners.chap6.domain.CustomerOrder; import net.firstpartners.chap6.domain.ChocolateShipment; import net.firstpartners.chap6.domain.OoompaLoompaDate;  global OoompaLoompaDate nextAvailableShipmentDate; global Log log;  In this case we import the following: handles to Date; where to get information on  the Apache log  a smarter way of printing to the console ; three facts that we use to  organize our data; and two global variables.  The three other facts that we import to organize our data are OoompaLoompaDate,  CustomerOrder, and ChocolateShipment. A customer order is the total amount of  chocolate that the customer wants, and will contain many chocolateShipments as  we send them one box a week to meet their order.  Our global variables  the nextAvailableShipmentDate and the handle to the  external log  are placeholders for items that we pass in when we call our rules.  [ 127 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   More rules in the JBoss IDE  Our first rule confirms the holidays when the Ooompa Loompas will not work.  Whenever we find a date, we print out a message to the console. If we don't want to  see this message, we could safely remove this rule.  rule "confirm holidays"   $holiday : OoompaLoompaDate                  when        then                  end            Logging message         log.info "Remember - Ooompa Loompas don't work on:"+$holiday ;  This rule actually matches against all OoompaLoompaDates in  working memory. This works in this particular example, as the only  OoompaLoompa dates directly in working memory will be holidays. In real  life, our rule would need to be a bit more particular, that is, it should check  whether the date is a holiday using something similar to the following: When $holiday : OoompaLoompaDate holiday==true    The next rule is one of the key ones in the example. When we find a customer order  for which we haven't shipped all of the chocolate, then we add a new chocolate  shipment to the order.  rule "Chocolate Shipment"        when         $CustomerOrder : CustomerOrder currentBalance>0                then                      Add a new shipment into the CustomerOrder         ChocolateShipment ChocolateShipment = new           ChocolateShipment 210 ;                 addShipment ChocolateShipment          }  modify $CustomerOrder {            notify the working memory of the new shipment         insert  ChocolateShipment  ;            Logging message         log.info "Fired Customer Shipment rule - customer is still                               chocolate bars" ;       waiting for "+$CustomerOrder.getCurrentBalance  +"                                  end  [ 128 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Chapter 6  The next rule looks for any shipments  like the ones created in the previous rule  that  have no shipment date set yet. When it matches, it sets the shipment date to the next  available date  as retrieved from the nextAvailableShipmentDate global variable ,  and then rolls forward the next available shipment date by a week.  rule "Add Next Available Shipment Date"      when         $ChocolateShipment : ChocolateShipment shipmentDate ==null                                    then          modify $ChocolateShipment {           setShipmentDate nextAvailableShipmentDate.getCopy            }                     nextAvailableShipmentDate.rollForward 7 ;            Logging message         log.info "Add Next Available Shipment Date:"+$ChocolateShipment         .getShipmentDate   ; end  Our holidays are passed in as facts, so rules can match against them. Whenever a  shipment date lands on a holiday, our next rule will fire and move the shipment  forward one day. If that date also happens to be a holiday, this rule will automatically  fire again. We don't need to write any specific code to handle the 'holidays in a row'  situation. We just state what we know to be true, and let the rule engine manage   the complexity.  rule "modify due to holidays"   when      $holiday : OoompaLoompaDate                $ChocolateShipment : ChocolateShipment shipmentDate==$holiday                then            end          modify $ChocolateShipment {         getShipmentDate  .rollForward 1          }                            Logging message         log.info "Reschedule Shipment Date to:"+$ChocolateShipment.            getShipmentDate  +" due to holiday on:"+$holiday ;  [ 129 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   More rules in the JBoss IDE  When we are shipping our boxes of chocolate, it is likely that the last box won't be  full. For example, an order for 500 fudge chocolate bars will be made up of two boxes  of 210, and one smaller box of 80. Our next rule covers this situation by ensuring that  the last box we ship does not leave us with items still to ship of less than 0. It  does this by matching any customer order with a negative items still to ship and  adjusting the numbers accordingly.  rule "Don't ship more than the customer order"        when         $CustomerOrder : CustomerOrder currentBalance<0          $ChocolateShipment : ChocolateShipment itemsStillToShip<0      then         long $newShipment = $ChocolateShipment.getShipmentAmount  +$                                    ChocolateShipment.getItemsStillToShip  ;                                           modify $ChocolateShipment {         setShipmentAmount $newShipment ,         setItemsStillToShip 0          }                    modify $CustomerOrder {         setCurrentBalance 0          }           Logging message         log.info "Removed CustomerOrder Overshipping - new shipment:"+                  $newShipment ; end  ChocolateShipment.java Our rules depend on three Java-based facts that we saw earlier when we imported  them into our business rules. The first of these is the ChocolateShipment—a note  to the Ooompa Loompas in the shipping department to put a box onto a truck. You  can inspect the code if you want, but given that it is a simple JavaBean  that is, a  placeholder for carrying information into and out of our rules  we can see a better  overview using the outline view in Eclipse   the JBoss IDE.  Reading from the bottom up, we can see that our bean allows us to get  and set   the following values: the number of items still to ship; the amount in this shipment;  and the date that we are shipping on. The toString method is a Java convention that  makes it easier to print the information that we hold in this Java class to the log. The  two ChocolateShipment methods give us information on how we can create   new shipments.  All of these are referenced in the rules. In fact, if the spelling used in the rules doesn't  match the one we have here, we get an error.   [ 130 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Chapter 6  CustomerOrder.java We also saw the CustomerOrder JavaBean imported into our ChocolateShipment  JavaBean. In this sample, we can have one overall customer order containing many  customer shipments to fulfill the order. The outline of the CustomerOrder.java file   image below  reflects this. The toString  logging  method, and the get or set methods for shipments,  InitialBalance, and currentBalance follow the normal JavaBean style  remember  that JavaBeans are still just a means of passing information around . The two  CustomerOrder methods give us different options for how we create this bean.   For information, CustomerOrder   means that we can create the bean with no  parameters, which is perhaps the easiest way of all.   [ 131 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   More rules in the JBoss IDE  Note the subtle difference in three similar methods that we use to deal with shipments:           The addShipment method allows us to add another customer shipment to   the existing list.  The getShipments method returns the current list of customerShipments.  The setShipments method allows us to pass in an entirely new list of  customerShipments.  There is also an iterator method to make it easier for us to loop over the list   of shipments.  More information on the full power of Java collections  a more powerful  form of the lists we're dealing with here  is available on the Java web site,  http:  java.sun.com. We are able to write rules using this power. For example, the following condition would match customerOrders  with a first shipment to a customer of less than 100. CustomerOrder  shipments[0].shipmentAmount <100  Note the use of [0] to refer to the first shipment in the CustomerOrder.  For those interested in how this works, the shipmentAmount matches to  the getShipmentAmount   method on our CustomerShipment class.  OompaLoompaDate Dealing with dates in Java can sometimes be nasty. For example, Java counts the  days in the month from 1  as you'd expect , but months in the year start from 0   January . For this reason we have wrapped the Java Date in OoompaLoopaDate to  hide some of the ugliness and make dates behave as you'd expect.  There's a second, even better, reason for the having OoompaLoompaDate.java in  this sample. Remember that we talked about functions in our rule  .drl  file and  said you'd be better off using normal Java code? The rollForward   method is an  example of this, as it allows us to move to a date 'x' days in the future. In our rules,  we don't care how this is done, just that it works!  Although business logic works great in rules, calculating dates isn't business logic.  Calculating dates in Java makes it easier to unit test. There is more on unit tests in the  next chapter. If you can't wait until then, it's a method of quality assurance—when  we ask to move 10 days on, we know that it will do exactly that.  [ 132 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   The outline of the OompaLoompaDate.java file can be seen in the following screenshot:  Chapter 6  The other new methods to note are hashCode   and equals  . These are standard  JavaBean conventions that allow us to match one date against another more easily.  The RuleRunner file We saw some code in the HelloWorld example in the previous chapters that loaded  our rule  .drl file  and called the rule engine. For convenience, we have put it into  one file called RuleRunner.java.  The main starting point in this file is the second runRules   method. The steps to  follow for this method are:  1.  Load the rule file s  from disk. We pass in the names of the files when calling Load the rule file s  from disk. We pass in the names of the files when calling  the rule file s  from disk. We pass in the names of the files when calling  the methods.  2.  Create a RuleBase and a session  our scratchpad  using these rules. 3.  Pass any global variables  name, value  into our rule session. 4.  Pass any facts.  facts.  This code is fairly generic and could easily be reused in your own rule projects. We  will look at the content of the RuleRunner file in more detail in Chapter 11. For the  moment, we'll concentrate on the actual business rules.

We will run the MultipleRulesExample.java file soon. It's the starting point for the  example. Reading through the file, the main points are:             The package and import statements tell Java what directory this file lives in  and the files from other directories that we need NEXT_AVAILABLE_SHIPMENT_DATE is a constant value that matches the global  variable of the same name in our rules file RULES_FILES is a constant value of the name where we find our rules file The main method, like our previous sample, is where we start when we click  the Run button  public static void main String[] args  throws Exception  The step-by-step procedure for running the MultipleRulesExample.java class is  given as follows:  1.  We create our customer order.          Initial order       CustomerOrder candyBarOrder = new CustomerOrder 2000 ;  2.  We create a placeholder for the starting date for a first shipment. We add it  under the NEXT_AVAILABLE_SHIPMENT_DATE, so that we can pass it into the  rules as a global variable.         HashMap  startDate = new                                              HashMap   ;        startDate.put NEXT_AVAILABLE_SHIPMENT_DATE, new                                      OoompaLoompaDate 2009,02,03  ;  3.

You're unlikely to use all of these, although  it is good to know that they are there for some of the weird and wonderful rules that  you'll be asked to write  or review . More information on the rules syntax can be  found in the Drools documentation, if you're into that kind of thing.  Lefthand side not We came across not at the start of the chapter, where we used it within an expression  to select lines where Sales were not equal  !=  to 100. We can also use it at the top  level of a rule. For example, if we add not to our last shipping rule we completely  change its meaning. In this case, it fires only if we do not have any customer orders  left to fulfil.

Contains and memberOf If we wanted to check whether a customer order had shipments, we could use the  contains keyword. contains allows us to examine a list or collection  in this case,  our shipments  and act accordingly. The following rule will fire when a particular  shipment  if we previously assigned a value to $mySpecialShipment  is actually a  part of a customer order.  rule       when         CustomerOrder shipments contains $mySpecialShipment                then  The not contains keyword would have the opposite effect.  memberOf is a similar test, but in the reverse order. We have a handle to a fact,  and we want to check if it is contained within a wider collection  for example,  $shipmentsToAcmeCorp .  rule       when         Shipment shipment memberOf $shipmentsToAcmeCorp                then  Similarly, not memberOf is the reverse of this.

Previously, we  compared text1 == text2 using the standard equals operator. Soundslike uses the  well-documented Soundex algorithm  http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Soundex   to gauge if two pieces of text sound similar when spoken—for example, to match all  Sales where the customer name sounds like acme.  Sales  name soundslike "acme"   matches is even more powerful, but requires an understanding of the industry  standard regexp  regular expressions . For example, the following condition will  match all customer names that begin with a:  Sales  name matches "a*"   We can also use not matches and not soundsLike, if required. in in allows Drools to check if a single value is a part of a collection. For example, if we  want our rule to fire only for our three favourite customers  Acme Corp, Breakfast  Roll Inc and Chocolate Creams Co , we could add the following condition:  Sales  name in  "Acme Corp","Breakfast Roll Inc","Chocolate Creams  Co"    exists Another way of saying exists is 'at least one'. So the following rule will fire when  we have pushed at least one customer shipment out the door:  rule       when         exists  ChocolateShipment        then         log.info "Hurray! We made a shipment!" ; end  [ 140 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   forall Normally, when we write a rule, it will match against any of the facts in memory and  fire against the matched facts. But what if we want our rule to fire only if all of the  facts match our condition? Something like 'fire only if all our customer shipments  have dates' could be written as follows:  Chapter 6  rule       when         forall  Shipment  shipmentDate !=null         then  forall   can also take multiple conditions, all of which have to be true for all facts  matched, before the rule fires. collect accumulate collect allows us to check how many facts in memory match a given rule, and then  test the results. For example, if we had more than one customer order, we'd have no  easy way of counting the total number of shipments that we made on a particular  date.  We can get shipments for single customer using getShipments  , but this  approach won't scale.   The following rule will display the total number of shipments  for all customers  on  1st January, 2009:  rule       when         $numberofShipmentsOnDay : collect                                       then         log.info "Boxes shipped today:"+$numberofShipmentsOnDay ; end  ChocolateShipment      new OoomplaLoompaDate 1,1,2009   accumulate is a more powerful form of collect. It can do everything that collect  can do, along with additional things such as firing custom code as it works it's way  through the collection.  The Drools documentation has more details on how to use  this power.   [ 141 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   More rules in the JBoss IDE eval Sometimes, after looking at all of those expressions, you still can't find one that fits.  eval allows any expression or formula that returns a Boolean value  that is, a true  or false answer  to be used in evaluating a rule. For example, if we want to get the  names of customers that are longer than 10 letters, we could use the following:  rule       when        $s : Sales           eval  $s.getName  .length >10      then  eval is also useful when calling functions. For example, if we had a   function, 'name too long', which returned a Boolean, we could call it using   eval nameTooLongFunction   .  eval is very convenient as it allows us to include pretty much any  condition in a rule. However, it's considerably slower. With other  conditions, Drools can cache  remember  the results because it can  figure out when these results need to change. With eval, Drools  doesn't have this visibility. Therefore, all eval expressions need to  be rechecked every time the rule is true. If you have to use eval, it's best to add it as the last condition in  a rule—meaning, it will be called less often. If any of the previous  conditions return 'false', then Drools shortcuts, because there is no  need to check any of the remaining conditions.  from For the examples we've given so far, we've expressed  or pushed  our information   the Java facts  into our rules. The from keyword allows the rule engine rules to  pull information as required, for example, from a database using the Hibernate  framework. Assuming that we have correctly set up Hibernate to talk to the database   a topic so vast that a whole book about it can be written , our rule can use the  following syntax:  rule       when         Order   from $myHibernateObjectPassedAsGlobal.subquery     then …  [ 142 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Chapter 6  Righthand side—Then Just like the When part of the rule, there are also more powerful options available  on the righthand side  Then clause  of the rule. At the start of the chapter we came  across simple uses of update   and insert  , but the following keywords are also  valid in our rules:              $someHandle = insert something : This form of insert works the same as  insert  something , that is, putting 'something' into the working memory.  The difference is that we keep a hold of it  in the variable $someHandle  so  that we can do things with it later on. retract $someHandle : This removes a fact from the working memory.  For example, we may decide to insert a fact representing a discount, only to  retract it later if the customer cancels an order. insertLogical new someFact   : At the start, insertLogical   works  the same as insert—it puts an object into memory. The only difference is  that as soon as the rule stops being true, the fact  someFact  is automatically  retracted from the working memory. update object,$somehandle : This is similar to update  object , although we  can specify to the object the handle that we wish to update. If the handle is not  passed  that is, the update we did previously , Drools can use a 'best guess'.  The advanced 'When...Then' options are available both in the text editor  like the  previous examples  and the guided editor.  Guided editor in the JBoss IDE Until now we've focussed on using the advanced text editor in the JBoss IDE. But it's  also possible to use a guided editor, similar to the one we used in Guvnor. To use  this editor, you can take the following steps:  Open any Drools-enabled project in the JBoss IDE, and right-click on the 1.  Open any Drools-enabled project in the JBoss IDE, and right-click on the  any Drools-enabled project in the JBoss IDE, and right-click on the  folder where you want to create the file.  2.

Summary This chapter extended the limits of what can be done with business rules. We went  through almost every keyword available to us in writing rules and used them to  generate a sample to help the Ooompa Loompas pack chocolate bars onto trucks.  Now that we understand how the rules work, in the next chapter we will look at  testing to ensure that our rules keep on working the way we intend them to.  [ 144 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Testing your Rules   We went through many samples in the first six chapters of the book, and didn't  have to pay out 'real' money if we made a mistake. We could happily play with the  examples, make mistakes, and learn from them. This changes when we start writing  'real' business rules. How much money would a company lose if a rule that you  wrote gave double the intended discount to a customer? Or, what if your airline  ticket pricing rule started giving away first class transatlantic flights for one cent?  Of course, mistakes happen. This chapter makes sure that these costly mistakes don't  happen to you. If you're going through the trouble of writing business rules, you will  want to make sure that they do what you intend them to, and keep on doing what you  intend, even when you or other people make changes, both now and in the future.  The chapter shows how to test your rules. It begins the testing by using Guvnor.  It then shows how to test rules against requirement documents using the FIT   Framework for Integrated Testing , and then shows how to unit test rules by using  Junit. But first of all, we will see how testing is not a standalone activity, but part of  an ongoing cycle.  Testing when building rules In this book we play with the examples, and then throw them away when we've  learned everything that we can from them. Real life isn't like that. It's a slightly  morbid thought, but there's every chance that some of the business rules that  you write will last longer than you do. Remember the millennium bug caused by  programmers in the 1960's, assuming that nobody would be using their work in   40 years' time, and then being surprised when the year 2000 actually came along?  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Testing your Rules  Rather than 'play and throw away', we're more likely to create production business  rules in the following cycle:  1.  Write your rules  or modify an existing one  based on a specification, or  your rules  or modify an existing one  based on a specification, or   feedback from end users. rom end users.  2.  Test your rules to make sure that your new rules do what you want them to   do, and ensure that you haven't inadvertently broken any existing rules.  3.  Deploy your rules to somewhere other than your local machine, where end   users  perhaps via a web page or an enterprise system  can interact with them. ps via a web page or an enterprise system  can interact with them.  You can repeat steps 1, 2, and 3 as often as required. That means, repeat as many  times as it takes you to get the first version into production. Or, deploy now and  modify it anytime later –in 1, 2, or 10 years time.  We covered step 1  writing  in the first six chapters of this book. We will cover step 3   deployment  in Chapter 11. Testing is what we'll cover in this chapter.  Making testing interesting Normal testing, where you inspect everything manually, is booooooooring! You  might check everything the first time, but after the hundredth deployment you'll  be tempted to skip your tests—and you'll probably get away with it without any  problems. You'll then be tempted to skip your tests on the 101st deployment—still no  problems. So, not testing becomes a bad habit either because you're bored, or because  your boss fails to see the value of the tests.  The problem, then comes one Friday afternoon, or just when you're about to go on  vacation, or some other worst possible time. The whole world will see any mistakes  in the rules that are in production. Therefore, fixing them is a lot more time and  money consuming than if you catch the error at the very start on your   own PC. What's the solution? Automate the testing. All of your manual checks are very  repetitive—exactly the sort of thing that computers are good at. The sort of checks  for our chocolate shipment example would be 'every time we have an order of 2000  candy bars, we should have 10 shipments of 210 bars and one shipment of 110 bars'.  Testing using Guvnor Back in Chapters 3 and 4, we used the testing facilities in Guvnor to run our first  rules. We had no other way of running rules that would eventually be deployed into  the enterprise systems. This is another advantage of testing—we can instantly see  whether our tests are correct, without having to wait for our rules to be deployed  into the target system.  [ 146 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Chapter 7  At a high level, Guvnor has two main screens that deal with testing:        An individual test screen: Here you can edit your test by specifying the  values that you want to input, and the values that you expect once your rules  have fired A package or multiple tests screen  below : This allows you to run  later package or multiple tests screen  below : This allows you to run  later  on  all of the tests in your package, to catch any rules that you may have  inadvertently broken  Another way of saying this is: You write your tests for selfish reasons because you  need them to ensure that your rules do what you want them to do. By keeping your  tests for later, they automatically become a free safety net that catches bugs as soon as  you make a change.  Testing using FIT Guvnor testing is great. But, often, a lot of what you are testing for is already  specified in the requirements documents for the system. With a bit of thought in  specifying various scenarios in your requirements documents, FIT allows you to  automatically compare these requirements against your rules. These requirements  documents can be written in Microsoft Word, or similar format, and they will  highlight if the outputs aren't what is specified. Like Drools, FIT is an open source  project, so there is no charge for either using it, or for customising it to fit your needs.  Before you get too excited about this, your requirements documents do have some  compromises. The tests must specify the values to be input to the rules, and the  expected result—similar to the examples, or scenarios, that many specifications  already contain. These scenarios have to follow a FIT-specific format. Specification  documents should follow a standard format anyway—the FIT scenario piece is often  less than 10% of it, and it is still highly human-readable! Even better, the document  can be written in anything that generates HTML, which includes Microsoft Word,  Excel, OpenOffice, Google documents, and most of the myriad of editors that are  available today.  [ 147 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Testing your Rules  Like the Guvnor testing, we can use FIT to test whether our individual requirements  are being met when writing our rules. It is possible to run FIT automatically over  multiple requirement documents to ensure that nothing has 'accidentally' broken as  we update other rules.  Getting FIT When you downloaded the samples for Chapter 6, you probably noticed three  strange packages and folders that we didn't talk about at the time.           fit-testcase: This folder resides just within the main project folder, and  contains the FIT requirements documents that we're going to test against. chap7: This is a folder under src main java net firstpartners, and  contains the startpoint  FitRulesExample.java  that we'll use to kick- start our FIT Tests. FIT: This folder is next to the chap7 folder. It contains some of the 'magic  plumbing' that makes FIT work. Most business users won't care how this  works  you probably won't need to change what you find here , but we   will take a look at it in more detail in case we want to customize exactly   how FIT works.  If you built the previous example using Maven, then all of the required FIT software  will have been downloaded for you.  Isn't Maven great?  So, we're ready to go.  The FIT requirements document Open the word document fit-testcase.doc using Word, or OpenOffice.  Remember that it's in the fit-testcase folder. fit-testcase.doc is a normal is a normal  document, without any hidden code. The testing magic lies in the way the document  is laid out. More specifically, it's in the tables that you see in the document. All of the  other text is optional. Let's go through it. Logo and the first paragraph At the very top of the document is the Drools logo and a reference to where you  can download FIT for rules code. It's also worth reading the text here, as it's another  explanation of what the FIT project does and how it works.  [ 148 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   None of this text matters, or rather FIT ignores it as it contains no tables.   We can safely replace this  or any other text in this document that isn't in the table    with your company logo, or whatever you normally put at the top of your   requirement documents.  Chapter 7  FIT is a GPL  General Public License  open source software. This  means you can modify it  as long as you publish your changes . In this  sample we've modified it to accept global variables passed into the  rules.  We will use this feature in step 3.  The changes are published in the FIT plumbing directory, which is a  part of the sample. Feel free to use it in your own projects.  First step—setup The setup table prepares the ground for our test, and explains the objects that we  want to use in our test. These objects are familiar as they are the Java facts that we've  used in our rules.  There's a bit of text  worth reading as it also explains what the table does , but FIT  ignores it. The bit that it reads is given in the following table:  net.firstpartners.fit.fixture.Setup net.firstpartners.chap6.domain. CustomerOrder net.firstpartners.chap6.domain. OoompaLoompaDate  AcmeOrder  nextAvailableShipmentDate  If you're wondering what this does, try the following explanation in the same   table format:  Use the piece of plumbing called 'Setup' Create CustomerOrder and call it Create OoompaLoompaDate and call it  AcmeOrder nextAvailableShipmentDate  There is nothing here that we haven't seen before. Note that we will be passing  nextShipmentDate as a global so that it matches the global of a same name in our  rules file  the match includes the exact spelling, and the same lower-and uppercase .  [ 149 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Testing your Rules Second step—values in The second part also has the usual text explanation  ignored by FIT  and table  the  important bit , which explains how to set the values.  net.firstpartners.fit.fixture.Populate AcmeOrder AcmeOrder  Set initial balance Set current balance  2000 2000  It's a little bit clearer than the first table, but we'll explain it again anyway.  Use the piece of plumbing called Populate AcmeOrder  Take the … we created earlier, and set it  to have an initial balance of … Take the … we created earlier, and set it  to have a current balance of …  2000  2000  AcmeOrder  Third step—click on the Go button Our next part starts the rules. Or rather, the table tells FIT to invoke the rules. The rest  of the text  which is useful to explain what is going on to us humans  gets ignored.  net.firstpartners.fit.fixture.Engine Ruleset  src main java net firstpartners chap6  shipping-rules.drl AcmeOrder nextAvailableShipmentDate  Assert Global Execute  The following table is the same again, in English:   Use the piece of plumbing called 'Engine' Ruleset Assert Global  Use the rules in shipping-rules.drl Pass our AcmeOrder to the rule engine  as a fact  Pass our nextAvailableShipmentDate to the rule  engine  as a global  Click on the Go button  Execute   Fourth step—check the results After running our rules, we check to see if the results are as we expected.  [ 150 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Chapter 7  net.firstpartners.fit.fixture.Results AcmeOrder AcmeOrder  Get current balance Get initial balance  0 2000  The following table explains whether the results are as we expected:  Use the piece of plumbing called 'Results' AcmeOrder  Check the … we created earlier,  and make sure we now have a  current balance of … Check the … we created earlier,  and make sure we have an initial  balance of …  0  2000  AcmeOrder  Clear  an optional step  This optional step clears any of the previous steps. This means that, if we want, we  can repeat steps 1 to 4 again in the same requirements document.  net.firstpartners.fit.fixture Clear  Print a summary  an optional step  Another optional step is to print a summary of how our tests went. This is in  addition to the information that will append to each of the previous steps.  fit.Summary  Footer Finally, there is some more narrative in the footer. FIT ignores this, so you can  remove or replace this if you want.  There is an important part in this footer. It's a note that the sample   that we're now using  is based on FIT, and also on a sample by  Michael Neale from the Drools team—http:  fit-for-rules. sourceforge.net . This sample is based on GPL licenced code.   My understanding  remember that I'm not a lawyer  is that you can  use it internally within your organization; but if it is used outside,  then you will need to publish any changes  if you made any  to the  core FIT testing code.  [ 151 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Testing your Rules Running FIT on our sample So far, all we've seen is a Word document. Let's make the magic happen by running  FIT against this document. In this example we're running FIT through the JBoss  IDE, but it would be easy for anyone with a moderate knowledge of Java  ask your  friendly technical person  to make this work by double-clicking on a Windows icon.  The steps for running FIT on our sample are given as follows:  1.  FIT doesn't run against the Word document, but against the HTML version   of the Word document. Save your Word document as HTML.  In Word,  choose File  Save As  Web Page.  Name the file as fit-testcase.htm.  Our project already has this 'Save As HTML' step done, but don't forget  to do it again if you make any changes to the FIT document, later.  2.  Run the FIT test. In this case select FitRulesExample in the JBoss IDE    package explorer or navigator , and right-click on it. Select Run As  Java  Application from the context menu that is dispalyed.  3.  You should see a bunch of stuff in the console, beginning with net   4.   firstpartners.chap7.FitRulesExample main and ending with Clearing  domain objects. In between, you'll see the results of our rules firing, such as 28 right, 0 wrong,  23 ignored, 0 exceptions. Remember that we automate our testing in order to  automate our inspection of the results. So don't bother reading the console,  other than to check that FIT has run successfully.  5.  To see the results, open fit-test-result.htm. The filenames that   we use  fit-testcase.htm and fit-test-result.htm  are set in the  FitRulesExample.java file, and can be changed to whatever you want.  What just happened? Fit-test-result.htm is a copy of the original FIT test case, but it has been   updated with the results of our tests. If everything goes well, all of our tables should  be highlighted. As an example, the fourth table where we check the results is shown   as follows:  net.firstpartners.fit.fixture.Results AcmeOrder AcmeOrder  Get current balance Get initial balance  0 2000  The other main change has been our  optional  summary table. FIT has updated the  output with a summary of the set of tests that it has just run. Most importantly,   it's highlighted.  [ 152 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Chapter 7  fit.Summary counts input file input update output file run date run elapsed time  28 right, 0 wrong, 23 ignored, 0 exceptions C:\projects-drools\chap6-sample\fit-testcases\fit-testcase.htm Thu Sep 04 22:31:39 BST 2008 C:\projects-drools\chap6-sample\fit-testcases\fit-test-result.htm Thu Sep 04 22:43:44 BST 2008 0:01.58  There is a small bug in the version of FIT used here  we didn't have 28 tests . But a  test that fails will always be picked up, which leads us to the question, "What does a  failed test look like?"  What can go wrong? Let's imagine that our requirements document was slightly different—it said that our  rules have run, and so we should still have a balance left on our order of 150 bars   still to ship. In other words, table 4 of our requirements document should look  something like this:  net.firstpartners.fit.fixture.Results AcmeOrder AcmeOrder  Get current balance Get initial balance  150 2000  When we save the document using Save as  HTML and run our FIT tests again   using the steps above , we'll notice two differences. The first indication that a test  has failed is in the console of the JBoss IDE, where we'll see the message: 25 right, 3  wrong, 23 ignored, 0 exceptions. The second change is in the FIT document, where  the results table  table 4  is highlighted in dark gray. Helpfully, it shows you the  actual and expected values. The following figure shows you a failing FIT test:  Net.firstpartners.fit.fixture.Results Get current balance AcmeOrder  AcmeOrder  Get initial balance  150 expected  0 actual 2000  Normally, we would revise our rules and run our FIT tests again until our  requirements were met  hightlighted .  That was a failing rule. But what if something more serious happens that causes our  rules to 'blow up', or throw an exception? We made a note while talking about the  rules that it was important that the rule matches the name of our global variable.   [ 153 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Testing your Rules  What happens if it doesn't? Let's change the name of the variable in tables 1 and 3.  The following table shows the setup using some made-up name:  net.firstpartners.fit.fixture.Setup net.firstpartners.chap6.domain.CustomerOrder net.firstpartners.chap6.domain.OoompaLoompaDate  AcmeOrder someMadeupName  The following table shows how to execute the rule using some made-up name:  net.firstpartners.fit.fixture.Engine Ruleset Assert Global Execute  src main java net firstpartners chap6 shipping-rules.drl AcmeOrder someMadeupName  When we save the document using Save as  HTML and we run FIT again, we see  an indication of problems in the console  22 right, 3 wrong, 23 ignored, 2 exceptions   with full details of the error in the updated FIT results document. It is shown as  follows with some details removed, and others highlighted for clarity:  org.drools.spi.ConsequenceException: java.lang. NullPointerException ….    Caused by: java.lang.NullPointerException at net.firstpartners.chap6.Rule_Add_Next_Available_Shipment_Date_ 0.consequence Rule_Add_Next_Available_Shipment_Date_0.java:10       ... 19 more  When you first see this, there is too much detail  about 19 lines of technical-looking  text, in this example , but the important bits are:        The first line that tells us we have a he first line that tells us we have a nullpointer exception. As explained  in the previous chapter, this is where a rule expects to have something  available; but what it expects isn't there. The Caused by line indicates that the problem is in Rule_Add_Next_ Available_Shipment, and more particularly in the consequence    the 'when' part .  Looking at the When part of Rule_Add_Next_Available_Shipment, we see that it we see that it  contains the code nextAvailableShipmentDate.rollForward 7 . This assumes This assumes  that our nextAvailableShipmentDate has something passed in to it. But it doesn't,  as we've just changed the FIT rules to use a different name. Hence, it is empty, and  causes the NullPointerException that we see.

Chapter 7  Even though we change the first  and not the third  table in our FIT  document, we will still get an exception, but of a different kind:  IllegalArgumentException-No domain object for key  'nextAvailableShipmentDate' exists. As before, the key to resolving the error is to not get scared by the large  amount of detail provided, but to look for clues. In this case something is  wrong relating to nextAvailableShipmentDate. 80% of the problems  are caused by something being misspelt, or the wrong variable name  being used  which is the problem in this case .  The FIT plumbing If you're interested only in testing against requirements, then you should presume  that FIT for rules 'just works' and skip ahead to the next section  on unit testing . If  you're somewhat technical, you're probably wondering how FIT works under the  covers. If so, read on.  In general, the classes that were mentioned in the FIT template  for example, mentioned in the FIT template  for example,  net.firstpartners.fit.fixture.Setup  are the plumbing that allows the FIT  framework to understand our rules code. These files can be found in the   src main java net firstpartners fit folder.  FIT or FIT for rules? FIT is a general-purpose requirements-testing  framework that can be adapted to test almost anything. Normally,   'adapted' means a bit of work to match FIT to your code. Fortunately,   as most rules follow a standard pattern, Micheal Neale  of the Drools  team  has already written the adapter for you as the 'FIT for Rules' project.   The most likely scenario is that 99% of what you need is already covered by this   modified  FIT for Rules framework, but you may come across something that you  would like to add, or do differently. For example, the modified framework can pass  global variables to the rules, whereas the original source cannot.  The full source is available for both, so these are just pointers to get you started:  1.  When we start FitRulesExample, Java finds our main   method and jumps  in. This method sets up parameters  such as input and output files  and calls  the FileRunner file  run method .  [ 155 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Testing your Rules  2.  FileRunner is a part of the FIT framework—the source code is available. But  as a summary, it loads the input document that we specified and scans it for  tables that may contain instructions to carry out a test.  3.  You'll notice that the first line of all of the tables in our FIT document start with  an instruction—Setup, Populate, Engine, Results, Clear, and Summary. When  the FIT framework finds one of these, it tries to find the file, and loads it.  4.  All of these instruction files follow a similar format. They 'extend' another  file called AbstractRulesTesting, which is like a template. So when we  are reading a file  for example, Setup.java , we must remember that it also  contains all of the code from AbstractRulesTesting.  Because many files  use this common template, it saves us a lot of typing.   5.  At this point, FIT has scanned the document, found the table, and loaded   the instruction file  for example, Setup.java . It loops through each cell in  the table and calls the doCell   method in the Setup.java  or other   instruction  file.  6.  The doCell   method checks to see what sort of cell it is. It may carry out   different actions depending on whether it's the first row, the first column, or  any other cell.  In this way, FIT loops through the document and sets up the facts to be tested, calls  the rule engine, checks the results, and then prints a summary.  Remember that we would normally write the instruction file to understand our code.  It just happens that we have a set of adaptors  in FIT for Rules  that understands  most of the rules-related code. If we need to modify an adaptor, we can add pretty  much any Java-based code that's required.  The actual mechanics of calling the rules from FIT are the same as our previous  examples. What is different in FIT for Rules is that we express our tests in Word, and   via our adaptors  FIT understands what values to pass to the rules.  Now that we understand requirements testing, let's look at testing at the next level  down—unit testing.  What is unit testing? A good enterprise computer system should be built as if it was made of Lego bricks.  Your rules are only a piece of the puzzle. You'll need to go back to the Lego box to  get pieces that talk to the database, make web pages, talk to other systems that you  may have in your company  or organisation , and so on. Just as Lego bricks can be  taken apart and put together in many different ways, the components in a well- designed system should be reusable in many different systems.  [ 156 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Chapter 7  Before you use any of these components  or 'bricks'  in your system, you will want  to be sure that they work. For Lego bricks this is easy—you can just make sure that  none of the studs are broken. For components this is a bit harder—often, you can  neither see them, nor do you have any idea whether their inputs and outputs are  correct. Unit testing makes sure that all of the component pieces of your application  work, before you even assemble them.  You can unit test manually, but just like FIT requirements testing, you're going to  'forget' to do it sooner or later. Fortunately, there is a tool to automate your unit tests  known as Junit  for Java; there are also versions for many other languages, such  as .Net . Like Drools and FIT, Junit is open source. Therefore, we can use it on our  project without much difficulty. Junit is integrated into the JBoss IDE and is also  pretty much an industry standard, so it's easy to find more information on it. A good  starting point is the project's home page at www.Junit.org.  The following points can help you to decide when to use unit testing, and when to  use the other forms of testing that we talked about:           If you're most comfortable using Guvnor, then use the test scenarios within  Guvnor. As you'll see shortly, they're very close to unit tests. If the majority of your work involves detailing and signing off against the  requirement documents, then you should consider using FIT for Rules. If you're most comfortable using Java, or some other programming language,  then you're probably using  J unit tests already—and we can apply these unit  tests to rule testing.  In reality, your testing is likely to be a mix of two or three of these options.  Why unit test? An important point to note is that you've already carried out unit testing in the rules  that we wrote earlier. OK, it was manual unit testing, but we still checked that our  block of rules produced the outcome that we expected. All we're talking about here  is automating the process.  Unit testing also has the advantage of documenting the code because it gives a  working example of how to call the rules. It also makes your rules and code more  reusable. You've just proved  in your unit test  that you can call your code on a  standalone basis, which is an important first step for somebody else to be able to use  it again in the future.  You do want your rules to be reused, don't you?  [ 157 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Testing your Rules Unit testing the Chocolate Shipments sample As luck would have it, our Chocolate Shipments example also contains a unit test.  This is called DroolsUnitTest.java, and it can be found in the test java net  firstpartners chap7 folder.  DroolsUnitTest.java lives in a similar, but parallel, set of folders. It  begins with test instead of main. Having these parallel sets of folders is  a convention used to separate our test code from our production code.  We want to run our tests before we deploy them to production, but not  actually deploy those tests. By having the folders set up in this way, we  fool Java into thinking that these tests live in the same package as the  actual rules, yet they are still separate. This is done so that the tests don't  accidentally get deployed  which is a good thing, as we don't want our  tests to corrupt our production data .  Running the Junit test is similar to running the samples. In the JBoss IDE Navigator  or package explorer, we select DroolsUnitTest.java, right-click on it, and then select  Run as  Junit test from the shortcut menu. All being well, you should see some messages appear on the console. We're going   to ignore the console messages; after all, we're meant to be automating our testing,   not manually reading the console. The really interesting bit should appear in the   IDE— the Junit test result, similar to the screenshot shown below. If everything is  OK, we should see the green bar displayed—success!  We've run only one unit test, so the output is fairly simple. From top to bottom  we have: the time it took to run the test; the number of errors and failures  both  zero—we'll explain the difference shortly, but having none of them is a good  thing , the green bar  success! , and a summary of the unit tests that we've just run   DroolsUnitTest . If you were running this test prior to deploying to production, all you need to know  is that the green bar means that everything is working as intended. It's a lot easier  than inspecting the code line by line.  [ 158 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Chapter 7  However, as this is the first time that we're using a unit test, we're going  to step through the tests line by line. A lot of our Junit test is similar to  MultipleRulesExample.java that we ran in the previous chapter. For example, the  unit test uses the same RuleRunner file to load and call the rules. In addition, the  Junit test also has some automated checks  asserts  that give us the green bar when  they pass, which we saw in the previous screenshot.  What just happened? Probably the easiest way to understand what just happened is to walk through the  contents of the DroolsUnitTest.java file.  Our unit code starts with the usual package information. Even though it is in a  separate folder, Java is fooled into using the same package.  package net.firstpartners.chap7;  In our imports section  list of other files that we need , we have a mix of our  domain objects  the facts such as CustomerOrder  that we used earlier for holding  information. We also have the logging tools. What is new is the imports of Assert   part of our automatic checking tool  and importing the junit test  the template for  our unit test .  import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals; import static org.junit.Assert.assertNotNull; import static org.junit.Assert.assertTrue;  import java.util.HashMap;  import net.firstpartners.chap6.domain.CustomerOrder; import net.firstpartners.chap6.domain.OoompaLoompaDate; import net.firstpartners.drools.RuleRunner;  import org.apache.commons.logging.Log; import org.apache.commons.logging.LogFactory; import org.junit.Test;  The start of the main part of the file may be renamed to DroolsUnitTest, but what it  does is the same. The rules are still read from exactly the same file as before.  public class DroolsUnitTest {     private static Log log = LogFactory.getLog DroolsUnitTest.class ;     private static final String NEXT_AVAILABLE_SHIPMENT_DATE =  "nextAvailableShipmentDate";     private static final String[] RULES_FILES = new String[] { "src  main java net firstpartners chap6 shipping-rules.drl" };  [ 159 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Testing your Rules  Earlier, our starting point was called main so that Java knew where we wanted it  to start when we pressed the green Go button. This time, our start method is called  testShippingRules and it's marked with a @Test flag so that we know it's an entry  point. We can have multiple tests, each marked with @Test. The Junit framework  will test each one in turn.  The rest of this code snippet, which involves setting up and calling the business rules  via RuleRunner, is exactly the same as our previous 'calling the rule engine' samples.     @Test    public void testShippingRules   throws Exception {           Initial order       CustomerOrder candyBarOrder = new CustomerOrder 2000 ;    Object>  ;        HashMap  startDate = new HashMap<String,               startDate.put NEXT_AVAILABLE_SHIPMENT_DATE, new        OoompaLoompaDate 2009, 02, 03  ;          Holidays       OoompaLoompaDate holiday2 = new OoompaLoompaDate 2009, 2, 10 ;       OoompaLoompaDate holiday1 = new OoompaLoompaDate 2009, 3, 17 ;                 Call the rule engine       Object[] facts = new Object[3];       facts[0] = candyBarOrder;       facts[1] = holiday1;       facts[2] = holiday2;           A lot of the running rules uses the same code. The RuleRunner          code          in this project           keeps this code in one place. It needs to know          - the name s  of the files containing our rules          - the fact object s  containing the information to be passed                  out of our rules          - a list of global values     in and        new RuleRunner  .runRules RULES_FILES, facts, startDate ;  In our previous example, once we called the rules, we printed the results out to the  screen for manual inspection. This time things are different. We want to make this  checking automatic. Hence, we have added following new lines in the final snippet,  using assertXXX to check if the values that we get back from the rules are   as expected:  [ 160 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Chapter 7           Check that the results are as we expected       assertEquals          "No more bars should be left to ship", 0, candyBarOrder            .getCurrentBalance   ;        assertEquals              "Our initial order balance should not be changed",                2100, candyBarOrder.getInitialBalance   ;        assertNotNull              "Our list of shipments should contain a value",             candyBarOrder.getShipments   ;        assertTrue              "We should have some Cusomter Shipments",              candyBarOrder.getShipments  .size   > 5 ;    }  }               In general, our assert checks follow the format: Assert  "message if the value is  not as we expect" , valueWeExpected, valueWeGotWhenWeRanTheTest   The first line  ne  assertEquals  compares the number of candy bars that  should still be left to ship after our rules have fired  should be 0  The second line  assertEquals  ensures that the initial order is not changed  by the rules, and remains at 2100 The next line  assertNotNull  ensures that the list of shipments that we  made is not empty The final line  assertTrue  checks that we have more than five shipments  made to a customer  Is it best to have multiple tests or multiple asserts within a single test? It is possible to  have multiple tests, such as someTest   methods  each marked with @Test , and or  multiple tests using assertXXX within a method. A combination of both is probably  the best. Multiple asserts in one method are great when your test is difficult to set up,  but the test will stop at the first assert that turns out to be false. This means you can  solve the first error, but your test will then stop at the next assert that fails. Having  these asserts in separate test methods shows you instantly how many problem s  you  have—at the price of having some duplicated setup code.  [ 161 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Testing your Rules  There is a school of thought that advocates test-first design. Write your unit  tests before you write any proper rules—this acts as your specification. Of course, all of your tests will fail at the start. However, bit by bit, you  must write the rules to make them work. That way, you know when  you've done what you started out to do—no more and no less. And it  means that you can never 'forget' to write your tests. It may appear strange, but it works for many people. So, it's certainly  worth giving a try.  What if it goes wrong? We were lucky that our tests worked the very first time. Unfortunately, this is almost  impossible to achieve. For example, assume that we mistakenly wrote a rule that  changed the initial balance.   assertEquals                    "Our initial order balance should not be changed",                2100, candyBarOrder.getInitialBalance   ;  In this case, when we come to check, our test will fail. We will get a red bar in our  unit tests, detailing what has gone wrong  similar to the screenshot below . The  message in our assert  Our initial order balance should not be changed  and other  details  such as line numbers  are provided to help us trace what is going wrong.  You'll also notice that the Failures count is now 1.  Failures and errors So what's the difference between failures and errors? Failures are things  such as the  above assert  that we explicitly check for. Errors are the unexpected things that go  wrong. Remember our NullPointerException from the previous section in FIT?  That is, the problem that we face when something is empty that shouldn't be. That  exception is shown as an error in Junit with a red bar  again , along with the details  of the problem to help you fix it.  [ 162 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Chapter 7  It's simple—green is good and red is bad. But remember, it's always better to catch  mistakes early.  Testing an entire package Typically, you write a unit test at the same time as writing a set of rules to confirm  that the functionality is 'done'.  After you're 'done', you  or one of your team  should run all of the tests in the project  to make sure that your new work hasn't broken any of the rules or code that already  existed. There are a couple of ways to automatically do this overnight  as part of a  build control tool such as Cruise Control  as part of your build scripts  Maven, the  tool installed to build the samples in this book does this for you , or you can run all  of the tests from the JBoss IDE  akin to the 'run all scenarios in package' that we saw  in Guvnor .  It's pretty easy to run all of your unit tests in one go. All you have to do is this:  he toolbar  at the very top of the JBoss IDE  select Run.  1.  From the toolbar  at the very top of the JBoss IDE  select 2.   In the dialog box that is dispalyed, select Junit  near the lower-left of the  screen  and then click on New launch configuration  the icon on the   upper-left of the screen, as shown in the screenshot . enshot .

On the righthand side, fill in the following values:     4.  Click on Apply  to save it, so that you don't have to go through all of the   steps the next time , and then click on Run.  As before, the JBoss IDE will chug away for a couple of moments, and then the  popup Junit screen will be displayed. As before, if any of the multiple tests fail, you'll  see a red bar, along with details of all of the items that went wrong. When all of your  tests pass, you can be sure that your rules are of top quality. quality..  Summary Hopefully, you're now confident about testing. In this chapter we've seen how to test  our rules using Guvnor, as well as using FIT for rule testing against requirements  documents, and unit testing using Junit. Now that we can write and test advanced  enterprise rules, let's see another rule format—rules in Excel  decision table  format.  [ 164 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Data and Rules in Excel  At the start of the book we said 'If you can understand Microsoft Excel, then you  should be OK'. To prove this, we're going to devote this entire chapter to Excel.  Almost everybody understands Excel spreadsheets, or their equivalent in OpenOffice  and Google Docs. All of these are simple, grid-based editors that allow us to store,  edit, and share information. Spreadsheets may not be perfect, but they're popular  and well-understood. First, we're going to use them to hold the data that we supply  to the business rules. Then we're going to use spreadsheets to hold the actual rules in  a decision table format.  Reading data from Excel One of the basic problems that we face is getting information into and out of our  business rules. Until now we've been using JavaBeans. These are great, especially  if you're familiar with Java already. JavaBeans are also good if your information  is already available from a technical source of data, such as a database, that Java  can easily read. But JavaBeans can be time-consuming to create—more so if your  information is already contained in an Excel spreadsheet.  Instead of having to create our Java Beans manually, wouldn't it be great if we could  hand this spreadsheet to the Drools rule engine and say 'here you go—fire the rules  against this information'. It would be even better if our rules could say something  like 'If the value at cell A1 is greater than 100, then update the spreadsheet to say:  value too high'. As a result of our rules firing, the spreadsheet could be updated   with that message.  Fortunately, there is already an open source project called Apache POI that   allows Java-based programs  such as the Drools rule engine  to read and write   data from Excel spreadsheets. We'll use a simplified version, based on POI  from the  Red-Piranha project , in our chapter so that we can read and write from Excel. That  covers the 'store the data in Excel' requirement.  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Data and Rules in Excel  What's the difference between updating values using normal Excel  formulae and updating the values using Drools, as we explain in   this chapter? For most spreadsheets, the power of Excel  and it is very powerful  is  enough. But, pretty quickly, those formulae become very complex and those formulae become very complex and  formulae become very complex and  difficult to understand, test, and maintain—the same problem of 'traditional  coding' that we talked about in the previous chapters. Rules solve this  problem by expressing your business rules in a clear and clean way.  If you're interested in loading high volumes of data from different formats    including Excel , fast-forward to the Smooks section in Chapter 12. The advantage  of the Red-Piranha approach is that it allows us to change the formatting or colours  in the spreadsheet. Smooks is better for large volumes of data, but doesn't give you  the pretty colors!  Business rules for this sample The business rules that we'll walk through in this chapter are based on the following:             The chocolate factory needs to buy cocoa beans to make candy bars Because the price of cocoa beans rises and falls almost daily  an entire  building in Chicago is dedicated to this market , the chocolate factory decides  to make a bit of side money by trading in chocolate We trust certain traders more than others, so we will buy from them at a  higher price—that is, we have specific prices for each broker We also have different selling prices for different traders, as either they have  a bulk-buying agreement, or we factor in the cost of delivery  Of course, this is very simple compared to what really goes on in the market, but it's  enough to show how to store both data and rules in Excel.  Getting and running the sample Our sample that shows how to read and write Excel data  as our fact model  can be  downloaded  like the last example  from Google Code at http:  code.google. com p red-piranha. The file you need is droolsbook-chap8-sample_01.zip. .  Like the previous example, unzip it to a location of your choice. The downloaded file  should contain the Eclipse project, but  as before  you may need to execute the Maven  command mvn clean package to download the required libraries to your computer.

It is called chocolate-data. xls, and is found in the src main resources folder. When you open it, it looks  something like the following screenshot—a fairly ordinary spreadsheet with   one value at the top  Current Stock , and below that many rows, one per broker     A Broker, B Broker, and so on  with five columns. These lines are the various buy  and sell offers that chocolate brokers will make to us. The five columns are contain  Broker Code, Buy or Sell, Quantity, Price, and Status of the trade.  The screenshot below demonstrates named ranges. Referring to cells such as 'A1' or named ranges. Referring to cells such as 'A1' or  Referring to cells such as 'A1' or  'B12' is great, until you have to modify the spreadsheet when you need to update allall  your rules.  Rather than referring to cells 'A12-E12', we can use a name such as 'G Broker Values'  to refer to a range  group  of cells. If we add or remove lines from the spreadsheet,  the named range will continue to point to the same set of information.

You should see the Define Name dialog box listing all of the ranges in the current  spreadsheet. In effect, there is one named range for each broker  that is, one for each  line in the Excel spreadsheet , and a named range for the current stock value.  Rules Our rules for the first sample are pretty simple and are still in the standard format  that we're used to. It just prints out the values and marks cells as modified.  Remember, this first sample is all about reading data from Excel.  package net.firstpartners.chap8;  import net.firstpartners.drools.log.ILogger  import net.firstpartners.exceldata.Cell; import net.firstpartners.exceldata.Range;  global ILogger log;  rule "log then modify cell values"      when       $cell : Cell modified==false       then           end         $cell.setModified true ;            Logging message        log.info "initial cell value:"+$cell ;  [ 168 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Chapter 8  Running the sample Our main class is ExcelDataRulesExample.java  which is in the directory src  main java net firstpartners chap8 . Select this Java file in Eclipse and run it  in the usual way  right-click on the file, and then choose Run as Java application .  You'll see some output in the console, but the real change is in the Excel spreadsheet,  which has been copied and then modified.  This output spreadsheet is called chocolate-output.xls, and can be found in the  main project folder. When you open it you'll see that according to our simple rule, all  cells having a range name have been marked as modified. In this case, the cells are  highlighted to make it clear what is going on.  Copying the Excel spreadsheet and then modifying it means that even  if a rule deleted all the values by accident, you still have the original  spreadsheet to go back to and try again!  What's going on? If you're not interested in the technical nuts and bolts, then skip ahead to the next  section. Just remember that we can read and write information in Excel, and pass this  information to our rules. Still with us? Then you're in for a treat, because we're going  to explain what's just happened in the previous example. Along the way, you'll pick  up information that will help you write rules that use Excel as a fact model to hold  information for our business rules.  Under the covers Our sample starts in the ExcelDataExample.java file. As before, the flow starts  in the main method. It's fairly clear in this file where our input  chocolate-data. xls , output  chocolate-output.xls , and rules  log-then-modify-rules.drl   are. What is different from the previous sample is that we have a piece of code   Rangeconvertor  that loads the Excel spreadsheet and transforms it into a set of  simple JavaBeans  Cells and Ranges . These JavaBeans are the fact model  containing  the data  that we pass to our rules as normal.

The answer is that you can use them, but the Cells and  Ranges based on Red-Piranha that we will use here are simpler. They also  allow us to add methods  such as getRangeContainsValue  that make  it easier to write rules.  We've already seen that the simple rule for this example matches against all cells, logs  their contents, and marks them as modified. Our RangeConvertor also translates our   updated  Cells and Ranges back into a proper Excel spreadsheet. For clarity, any cell  that we modify is highlighted—hence all our ranges are highlighted.  More on Cells and Ranges When we write more sophisticated rules, we'll be matching against Cells and Ranges.  These JavaBeans hold the information that we passed in via the Excel spreadsheet.  Because our rules will be matching against these Cells and Ranges, it's worth looking   at them in more detail.  Our Range JavaBean, like its equivalent in Excel, is used to hold a group of cells. The  items marked on the above screenshot are the ones that we will discuss in more detail.  1.  Like Excel, our Range has a name that we can access with the   getRangeName and setRangeName methods.  2.  A range is based on the Map interface. That is, our cells are stored within the  range as a cell name, and then the actual cell itself. Our cell names follow the  range name  for example, the first cell in the some_name range would be  some_name_0 , but we have convenience methods that handle this for us.  [ 170 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Chapter 8  3.  Our own methods for working with cells are: getCell  the actual cell itself ,  getCellValue  a shortcut to the value held within the list , getCellValueList   a list of all the values within the range , and getRangeContainsValue   which searches the range and returns true if the value is found .  4.  We have other methods to help us print  for example, toString and   toShortString , methods to help us compare ranges  hashcode and equals ,  and other Map methods  size,remove, isEmpty, and so on .  and so on .  One Range can contain one or more cells, depending on the Excel spreadsheet that is  passed in.  1.  A cell is aware of the Range that holds it  getHoldingRange,   setHoldingRange .  2.  When a cell is updated by any setMethod, the modified flag is tripped. We  can read this with the isModified method. This is what is used later on to  mark the modified cells  in Excel  are highlighted.  3.  We can read or set a value with the getValue oror setValue methods. We also   have convenience methods such as getBooleanValue, getIntValue, and and  getValueAsText to get the values converted to yes no, numbers, and text  respectively.  4.  Like the range, we implement toString, equals, and and hashcode to make Cells   easier to print  to the console  and easier to handle from our rules.  [ 171 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Data and Rules in Excel  The actual code that converts between the Excel code and our JavaBean code  and  back again  is contained in the RangeConvertor.java and CellConvetor.java files.  We don't need to go into the details. But we should know that we loop through all of  the named ranges in the Excel sheet, and copy the values to and from our JavaBeans  as required. There are a couple of quirks in this conversion process, such as:  1.   If we leave the chocolate-output.xls open in Excel, and run our sample  again, we'll get the following error  to resolve it, simply close the file in Excel : Exception in thread "main" java.io.FileNotFoundException:  chocolate-output.xls  The process cannot access the file because  it is being used by another process   2.  Because of the way that Eclipse builds projects, if you change the input   clean out any old versions by selecting Project  Clean  spreadsheet  chocolate-data.xls , you must save the Excel file  as normal   and then clean out any old versions by selecting Project  Clean from the  Eclipse toolbar. If you don't do this before running the sample, any changes . If you don't do this before running the sample, any changes  that you make will appear to be ignored. If a cell is blank in Excel, then it doesn't exist.  It's a way to make the Excel  file size smaller.  If a cell doesn't exist, then we can't update it with a value,  even if the Rules have changed it—that's why have n a in some cells rather  than keeping them empty. This is a quirk in the Excel conversion code that a  future version of Red-Piranha should correct.  3.   Red Piranha is a knowledge management tool available as an open source  project on Google Code, at http:  code.google.com p   red-piranha. For the purposes of this chapter, Red-Piranha makes it easier to  manipulate data in Excel using Drools. Drools hides the complexity  of Apache POI  the code that does the actual Excel manipulation ,  which means that your rules could update other table-based sources of  information such as Google Docs, or web pages containing HTML tables.  You may have noticed that when we invoked the rule engine  via the   DtRuleRunner file , we passed in both Ranges and Cells  that is, we called the   ranges.getAllRangesAndCells method . Surely, this is duplication. Because Ranges  contain Cells, why not pass only the Ranges so that the rule engine can automatically  read all the Cells that are contained within them? The answer is: We can access a cell  within a range using the notation SomeRange.getCell 1 .getValue  . But as the But as the  rule engine cannot detect changes in these second-level JavaBeans, updates to Cells  made in this way will not cause other rules to fire when they should. way will not cause other rules to fire when they should. ill not cause other rules to fire when they should.  [ 172 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   This restriction applies not only to Ranges and Cells, but also to any 'nested'  JavaBeans that you may write on your own. Later, we'll see ways of notifying Drools  about the changes to the cells. But for the moment, it's best to pass both Ranges and  Cells to the rule engine. Java is smart enough to realise that they are duplicates, so  we only end up with a single copy of the cell being stored in memory.  Chapter 8  Note that both Cells and Ranges implement property change listeners  to help the rule engine detect changes in values. However, because your  JavaBeans may not have these, we also notify the rule engine explicitly of  any changes  via update and modify calls . In this example, contents of Cells may change, but Ranges do not. That is,  the value of a cell may be updated, but the shape or the name of a range is  unlikely to change.  As an aside, you may have noticed that even though we have both Range and Cell  values available  in working memory  to match against,  to keep the sample simple ,  the current rules only match against values contained in Cells.  Sophisticated, but repetitive rules Reading and updating an Excel file is a good trick, but our simple rule doesn't do  much yet. How can we add more sophisticated rules? More importantly, if you've  extended the rules from previous chapters, how do we write repetitive rules without  a lot of copying and pasting? And how do we write rules in an Excel format, and not  just the data, which is what we've done so far in this chapter?  Let's remind ourselves of the chocolate trading rules and write them in a more  'business rule' type format:                 When you get a BUY offer for A_Broker, compare the price of the offer  against the price that you are willing to pay. If the price is reasonable, make a  note to execute a buy order. Put in place similar buy rules for each and every broker. When you have a note saying BUY, execute the order.  execute the order. When you get a SELL offer for A_Broker, compare the price of the offer  against the price that you are willing to accept. If the price is reasonable,  make a note to execute a sell order. Put in place similar buy rules for each and every broker. When you have a note saying SELL, execute the order. execute the order.  [ 173 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Data and Rules in Excel  Although, there are only four types of rules  evaluate buy, execute buy, evaluate  sell, and execute sell  there are potentially hundreds of duplicate rules. These rules  may be simple compared to those in previous chapters, but they have a higher risk  of error due to their large number. It would be better if we could set them out in a  simple table format like the rules table shown in the following screenshot:  The two images in the screenshot below are actually the same table, except  split to fit into the page. Both are screenshots from the TradingRules. xls file that you downloaded as a part of the Chapter 8 sample.  The first part of the table shows the usual 'if' conditions. In the column which is  highlighted, we check the broker name, ensure that this is a buy offer, make sure that  no other rule has processed this offer, and then ensure that the price is greater than  what we're prepared to pay for.  Underneath, we have the actual lines of data we use as part of these 'if' conditions.  We only show four, but there are 13 as a part of the sample table, and there could be  many more. These lines combine with our rules, so we can read the first line as:  Check that our broker name is A_Broker. Check that it is a buy offer, and that  nobody else has taken up  modified  this offer. And if the buy offer price is  less than 300 then …  If we didn't have the table format, we'd have had to write out in full each of the rules  from 4 to 13, or however many we have. So the decision table format is ideal for the  rules that are repetitive. The structure stays the same, but the values that we are  checking against change from rule to rule.  That's the 'when' part of the table. What about the other part  the 'then' part ?   In real life, the screenshot below  showing the 'then' part  follows to the right of the  previous table.  [ 174 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Chapter 8  Our 'then' part follows a similar format, breaking the rules into the structure  the  highlighted part  and the associated values that change for each rule. The 'then' part  matching against our 'when' part  A_Broker  the first line   is:         Update the status to_Buy This Log a message about what we plan to do Notify the rule engine that both Cells and Ranges have been updated  to see Cells and Ranges have been updated  to see  have been updated  to see  if any other rules should be fired   Some Excel magic The decision tables that you saw earlier are taken directly from our sample Trading- Rules.xls, but it looks like there is something missing. How does our technical rule  engine understand the near-English language we have in the excel decision tables?  The answer is that we've used a bit of Excel magic to hide this technical complexity  from the business users. In Excel 2003 and Open Office, the feature we use is called  Group and Outline and is found under the Data item on the toolbar. Office 2007 has  this feature under the Group item on the ribbon.  Clicking the '+' sign at the far left of the screen shows the hidden technical mapping.  With the lines unhidden, we can begin to see what is really going on.  Grouping and hiding columns is not the only visual trick that we can  use to make data entry easier. We can use formatting and colors in cells,  borders, and comments—all of which are used on this sample. We can  also use more advanced features such as merged cells and dropdowns  for selecting values from a predefined list. In general, Drools just ignores these and reads the basic Excel table in  black and white.  [ 175 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Data and Rules in Excel  Decision tables behind the scenes A lot of the lines that we've just displayed contain the rule syntax that we've used  in the previous chapter. We'll take a run through the information at the top of our  decision table file and the first two decision tables. Remember that we're writing  these rules to match against the chocolate-data.xls fact model  containing the  data , which we loaded at the start of this example.  Keep in mind that decision tables are just a mechanism to help generate  our rules. Behind the scenes, the rules themselves get translated into the  rules syntax that we're familiar with.  Header information In Chapters 5 and 6, we saw a list of items that go at the top of our rules files. These  items can go into the header table, which always starts with a RuleSet declaration, as  we can see in the screenshot below. RuleSet lets Drools know where the header table begins, and everything else is  ignored  for example the Chocolate Trading Rules title is not read . RuleSet also lets  Drools know which package these rules live in, although we do import additional  JavaBeans for this example  the ones that represent our Ranges and Cells . Our Notes  line is ignored as it means nothing to Drools. We could also have used items such as  'global' and 'function' in this part.  [ 176 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   RuleTable—Evaluate the buy trades Drools ignores everything else in the Excel file, until it comes to a section marked  as RuleTable, where it expects to find rules laid out in the specific decision table  format. The text following RuleTable is used to autogenerate the rule names, so be  careful with the name that you use.  Chapter 8  The first part of the decision table is the CONDITION cells, which makes up  the 'when' part of the rule. In this case, we have one variable definition and four  conditions to be matched before the rule fires. Note the use of parameter variables Note the use of parameter variables  in the unhidden part of the rules. $param1 or $1 means take the first value from  the cells below and use it as part of the comparison in the rule. The following table  explains the different conditions shown in the above screenshot:                CONDITION $r:Range: Only match against Ranges in working memory. CONDITION eval $r.getRangeName  .equals "$1"  : Matches the name of  this range against the parameter from the cell below  for example A_Broker,  B_Broker, and so on . CONDITION eval $r.getCell 1 .getBooleanValue  ==$1 : Matches the  first cell of this range against the parameter  this value is true for all lines .  Remember that the first cell of data is the Buy   Sell flag. CONDITION eval $r.getCell 4 .isModified   == $1 : Checks that the fourth   that is, last  cell in our Range—'modified' flag—is equal to the parameter   that is, this parameter is false for all lines . Remember that the last cell  of data that we pass in  from the data spreadsheet, which was the first  spreadsheet mentioned in this chapter  is Status, which starts out as N A. CONDITION eval $r.getCell 3 .getIntValue   < $1 : Checks that the third  cell in our data range  the price that we offered for the chocolate beans  is less  than our parameter  which varies from broker to broker .  Decision tables can use more than one parameter. For example, $2 means  take the second value within the data cells in the same column of the  spreadsheet. For example, if a data cell had values of 10, 20 then $1 would  have a value of 10, and $2 would have a value of 20.  Note that the two  values are separated by a comma.   [ 177 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Data and Rules in Excel  As a reminder, eval   can take any calculation, as long as it returns a true or false  answer. It's great for text and calculations. The downside is that it's not as efficient,  but that's OK for a small ruleset like the one in this example. The second part of this decision table  ACTION  gives the 'then' part of the rules,  which includes the following:              ACTION $r.getCell 4 .setValue "$1" ;: Sets the value on the fourth cell in the  data range  the status  to our param, which is always Buy This ACTION log.info "$1" ;: Logs the message from the following table ACTION update $r.getCell 4  ;: Pings the rule engine to let it know that   cell 4 in our data has been updated ACTION update  $r ;: Pings the rule engine to let it know that the entire  Range has been updated  The above screenshot will generate three rules. Each rule will use the same structure,  but will have the values embedded in it. To demonstrate this, the following is the  rule that will be generated for the first line, for A_Broker:  rule "Identify the Buy Trades that we are interested in_12"                         end  when         then          $r:Range eval $r.getRangeName  .equals "A_Broker"    eval $r.getCell 1 .getBooleanValue  ==true  eval $r.getCell 4 .isModified   == false  eval $r.getCell 3 .getIntValue   < 300   $r.getCell 4 .setValue "Buy This" ; log.info "Plan to Buy from Y Broker" ; update $r.getCell 4  ; update $r ;  There will be similar rules generated for each and every line in each of our decision  tables. This sample generates 13 in total, one for each line of this table.  [ 178 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Chapter 8  RuleTable—Execute the buy trades We can have multiple RuleTables on one Excel spreadsheet. Each starts with the  keyword RuleTable, and then follows the same decision table format. For example,  take a look at the next decision table, which takes trades marked Buy This and  actually executes the trade.  That is, the first table says we are interested in buying,  but this second rule table is where money changes hands.   The format  once we unhide or ungroup the technical parts  is the same as before,  even if we've only one line of rules rather than the 13 we had previously. It also has  two conditions and three actions.  The conditions are:  CONDITION: $r:Range , eval $r.getRangeContainsValue "$1"  : Only  matches lines of data that have been flagged with param 1  Buy This . CONDITION: $output:Range , eval $output.getRangeName    .equals "$1"  : Fires this rule only if we have a place to put our output    that is, a cell or range in our data sheet called Current Stock .  The actions are:  ACTION: $output.getCell 1 .setValue $1 ;: Increases the value of our  current stock  the cell we previously identified as $output  by the amount  of stock we have just bought. You can demonstrate the formula passed as  params by using the calculation listed in the  white  param cell as $output. getCell 1 .getIntValue  +$r.getCell 2 .getIntValue  . ACTION: $r.getCell 4 .setValue "$1" ;: Updates the status of this trade on  the Excel spreadsheet to the param that we pass  that is, Trade Executed . ACTION: log.info "$1" ;: Logs what we just did to the console.

These  deal with identifying the sales offers that we wish to take up and the execution of  those sales. The format of these two tables is very similar to the two rule tables above   Evaluate Buy, and Execute Buy . Of course, there is a minor difference—we are  selling chocolate beans rather than buying.  Mixing rules and decision tables While reading the previous rules Excel file, you may have wondered where the log  object that we used in the previous rules actually comes from. In other chapters we  had to declare a global variable  that our rules had a connection to the outside world,  including the screen or console to actually print or log messages onto  and pass it in  our logging object. In our DecisionTable.xls file we don't have this, but why?  The answer is that as we run this example, we load a second traditional rules file   log-rules.drl . This file is optional, as we could have used a global variable in  the  header section of our Excel rules file, but it's a good way of showing a mixture of  rules and decision tables. After all, Drools translates them behind the scenes to be in  the same format.  A good rule of thumb is to put the business rules stay in Excel and keep the more  expressive, but more technical, 'plumbing' in the .drl  standard rule  format.  Looking at the log-rule.drl file, you'll see that it contains the imported file global  ILogger log and two rules, which are:  1.  A rule that matches against unchanged cells and logs  but does not modify     2.  A rule that matches against changed cells and logs  but does not modify     the contents.  the contents.  Remember that both our Cell and Range JavaBeans have a modified toString    method to make logging easier. The logging object    The logging object  Ilogger  also comes from the  Red-Piranha project. It prints everything to the console, but also saves it  if we ask it  to  as a part of our Excel output file.

Before we run it  by selecting menu option Run  Run As  Java Application from  the Eclipse toolbar , we note that there are a couple of obvious similarities and  differences in this example file:        As before, our input file is called chocolate-data.xls and our output goes  to chocolate-output.xls Unlike before, we load two rules files: the Excel decision table that we've  just looked through  TradingRules.xls , and a standard rules file  log- rules.drl  that shows that we can mix and match decision tables with the  'traditional' rule format that we're used to  Like most of the examples in the book, your PC will pause for a couple of seconds,  print out lots of messages to the console, then show the line,   ExcelDataRulesExample - Finished when done. Opening the output file  chocolate-output.xls , we see that only some of the cells  have been updated  highlighted  in line with the more sophisticated business rules in  this example.  [ 181 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Data and Rules in Excel  The following cells are updated:  1.  The Current Stock is updated, as both our "execute buy" and "execute sell"   rules modify the total.  2.  Status fields for individual offers that we have taken up are highlighted, with that we have taken up are highlighted, with  highlighted, with   a Trade Executed  Buy Sell  message.  3.  Status fields for individual offers that we have not taken up remain white, that we have not taken up remain white, remain white,   with the value unchanged.  4.  All other cells remain white, as they have not been modified by our rules.  Logging information is printed to the Eclipse console. More usefully, there is a  second tab in the output spreadsheet  Chocolate-Output.xls , with logging only  from the rules. An extract of this is shown as follows  highlights in bold :  Before we go through what is happening when these rules fire, we'll go back to  basics. We will look through the main log file  in the Eclipse console  to explain what  just happened, from start to finish.  What just happened? The first thing that we see in our console log when we run ExcelDataRules.java   is that our sample finds the source Excel file  containing the buy and sell data  and  converts it to Cell and Range JavaBeans  which we looked at in detail earlier —just  like the very first example in this chapter.  ExcelDataRulesExample - found file:chocolate-data.xls  It then logs all Cells and Ranges, and so on, for each broker and range listed in our  Data Excel spreadsheet.  ============ Excel Cell Contents In ========= ExcelDataRulesExample  - Range:A_Broker A_Broker_2: cellName:A_Broker_2 value:110.0 comment:null modified: false A_Broker_3: cellName:A_Broker_3 value:300.0 comment:null modified:  [ 182 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   false A_Broker_0: cellName:A_Broker_0 value:A Broker comment:null modified: false A_Broker_1: cellName:A_Broker_1 value:true comment:null modified:false A_Broker_4: cellName:A_Broker_4 value:n a comment:null modified:false …  The sample then loads the 'traditional' style rule file, before loading the decision table.  Chapter 8  DtRuleRunner  - Loading file: log-rules.drl … found file:TradingRules.xls  After it loads the decision table, it compiles it into the standard rule format. Our  sample converts our Excel-based decision table to rules and logs the output—like  the extract we see below. We saw one of the 26 evaluate buy-sell rules earlier in this  chapter. This is the 'execute sell rule', once it has been translated.  This will probably  be at the end of the set of the rules that is output to the log.      when      $r:Range eval $r.getRangeContainsValue "Sell This"    $output:Range eval $output.getRangeName  .equals  From row number: 68 rule "Execute the Sell Trades_68"               "Current_Stock"               .getIntValue  -$r.getCell 2 .getIntValue   ;     end  $r.getCell 4 .setValue "Trade Executed Sell " ; log.info "Executed Trade" ;  $output.getCell 1 .setValue $output.getCell 1   then         If we have an error  that is, because of incorrect decision table format , it normally  gets flagged here. Often, it can help to look at the rule format that is printed out, to  help you identify the error.  The next step in our example is to insert global variables, of which we have only one  in this example—a handle to the object that we use for logging.  Inserting handle to logger  via global   And then we call our rules.  DtRuleRunner - === Calling Rule Engine ===  At this point, in our rules, our Excel output matches the console output. As before,  we have no control over the order in which our rules fire. For example, the first set of  rules to fire concern the last broker in the list  Z_Broker .  [ 183 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Data and Rules in Excel  You may have noticed from the console output that rules are not executed  in the order in which they appear on the decision table. Rather, just like  the other rules that we have seen, they are executed in the order that the  rule engine deems best.  Remember that your rules will fire if something is true. So if you find  yourself writing rules that are sequence-dependant, think again.  The cells are updated with the help of the following steps:  1.  The initial rule  from the drl file  logs the initial cell values.   ExcelLogger - initial cell value:cellName:Z_Broker_4 value:n a  comment:null modified:false ExcelLogger - initial cell value:cellName:Z_Broker_3 value:500.0  comment:null modified:false ExcelLogger - initial cell value:cellName:Z_Broker_2 value:300.0  comment:null modified:false ExcelLogger - initial cell value:cellName:Z_Broker_1 value:false  comment:null modified:false ExcelLogger - initial cell value:cellName:Z_Broker_0 value:Z  Broker comment:null modified:false  2.  The evaluate Sell rule fires  from the decision table .    ExcelLogger - Plan to Sell to Z Broker  3.  The execute Sell rule fires  from the decision table .    ExcelLogger - Executed Trade  4.  The modified cell logger fires  from the drl file .  ExcelLogger - modified cell value:cellName:Z_Broker_4 value:Trade  Executed Sell  comment:null modified:true  5.  This pattern repeats itself for each of the brokers until we have evaluated all   of the buy sell rules.

So go on, have a go yourself! Modify the above example   as follows:           Change the sample so that it uses different quantities and prices, and see   the effect. Add a check to our sell rules to ensure that we cannot sell more chocolate  than we have in our current stock. Hint: Our execute_sell rule already  obtains a handle to the current stock. We can use this as part of an additional  condition to the evaluate_sell rule. Take a data spreadsheet from your business and use it instead of the data  sheet  chocolate-data.xls  used in this sample. Hint: When writing the  rules, try to make small changes to one rule at a time.  When 'having a go', remember to execute a 'clean project' command in Eclipse    if you are making modifications to Excel , and make sure that you don't keep your   chocolate-output.xls file open  or you'll get the Java FileNotFoundException  error that we highlighted earlier .  Summary This chapter, behind all of the details, was pretty simple. We used Excel spreadsheets   Cells and Ranges  as our fact model, instead of the write-your-own-JavaBean  approach that we took earlier. Then we used Excel spreadsheets to hold decision   tables in order to make repetitive rules easier to write.  In reality, we can use this new capability in three ways:         Use Excel as our data model, with a standard rule  .drl  file Use Excel to hold our rules, and JavaBeans to hold our data Use Excel to hold both rules and data   There are several ways of handling rules and data. Use the one that makes it easy  for you to handle your project. In the next chapter, we'll again try to make things  simpler by using DSLs and Ruleflow.

This chapter will show some ways of making both of these things easy   to understand.  In the previous chapter, we saw how to use Excel decision tables to make it easier  to write rules. This chapter takes off from the 'easy to write rules' theme. Although  writing rules in Excel is good, wouldn't it be much better to write them in a language  that is closer to English, or whatever human language you prefer? Domain Specific  Language  DSL  gives you this option. The other point of confusion is the order in which rules are fired. Wouldn't it be great  to draw a workflow diagram to see and control which  groups of  rules should fire,  and when? Ruleflow gives us this control.  We'll come to Ruleflow shortly, but first we'll look at how to use DSLs.  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Domain Specific Language  DSL  and RuleFlow  What is a Domain Specific Language   DSL ? Every profession has its own language, or what is called a jargon. Although, on the  surface a jargon may appear to be related to English, it's often incomprehensible to  outsiders. If you've watched ER, Grey's Anatomy, House, or any of the other medical  dramas on TV, you know what I mean. You will understand this better with the help  of the following example:  Doctor to nurse:  Give me sterilised scalpel number 4, spreaders—the patient's cardioangiogram  is showing traces of acute defibrillation.  In plain English, this means:    Give me a knife now, this guy's having a heart attack.  One of the reasons why each profession, or domain, has its own specific language   or DSL  is that it conveys information much more precisely and concisely. A more  cynical view would be that domain terminology allows professionals to baffle   clients and charge more. But obviously, nobody in the IT industry would ever   take advantage of that fact!  The fact is that business and other professionals speak one language. Our rules, even  though they are 'plainer English', are written  so far  in another language. If we want  to capture the business knowledge from the professionals, we need to speak the  language of the business users. This is where DSLs provided by Drools come in.  Imagine that we could write our rules in a form similar to the extract that follows.  This extract is pretty easy to understand without any technical knowledge. This  would be a good thing, because more people would be able to review and maintain  the rules.  when  There is a Patient         rule "Check Patient for Heart Attack"                          then        Call for Assistance   end  Start CPR     - appears not to be breathing - has no pulse - is white or blue in the face  [ 188 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Chapter 9  You've been reading this book long enough now to know that the next line after  'imagine … '  is usually  'but of course you can!'. And expanders are a key part of  how we do it.  Expanders Something needs to convert the near-English rules  like the previous sample  into  the more formal or standard rule  DRL  format that we're used to seeing. That's the  Drools expander. The concept is simple:  1.  We start with the near-English business rules. They are saved in a text file   with a .dslr extension, to make it clearer to us what the file contains.  2.  The rulefile contains a statement similar to expander chocolate-trading. dsl. So Drools knows how to translate the near-English file into our standard  rule file format.  3.  Using the DSL file, Drools finds the English text and replaces it with a more   technical rule language.  4.  Once this find-and-replace process is complete, we will have a file     in memory, not on disk  containing our standard rule language. It is   similar to the DRL rules that we saw in earlier chapters. 5.  Drools can then execute the rules in this DRL as before.  The actual process is even more powerful than find and replace, given that we can  use regular expressions  also known as regex  and wildcards. For example, h\?t  would match  then replace  all three-letter words beginning with "h" and ending  with "t"-for example, "hat", "het", "hit", "hot", "hut", as well as the more nonsensical  words with endings such as "hbt", "hct", and so on.  How does Drools know which expander or DSL file to use? Our    near-English  rules file tells Drools which file is required, using a  statement such as expander my-dsl-file-name near the top of   the rules  .dslr  file.   The process of taking a more readable file, converting it to a rules file, and then  applying those rules as appropriate, may seem familiar. It's the same sort of process  used in the Excel-based decision tables from the previous chapter. Like decision  tables, DSLs can automatically convert a human-friendly format into something   more Drools-like, and then fire the generated business rules as appropriate.

The format looks something like the following plain-text file, so that  you can view it with almost any editor. The file will have a .dsl extension.   Match against the when part of our medical rules  [when]There is a Patient  = $patient : Patient   [when]-has no pulse = pulse==false [when]-appears not to be breathing = breathing== false  [when]-is {color1} or {color2} in the face =  face == {color1} or face  == {color2}    Our possible medical actions in the 'when' part  [then]Call for Assistance= $hospital.callForAssitence  ; [then]Start CPR=$patient.startCPR  ;  The format allows a pretty simple find-and-replace process, using the   following parts:  1.  Comments  lines beginning with   are ignored, although they are useful for   explaining what is going on. Similarly, whitespace and blank lines are also  ignored, but laying out the file cleanly using whitespace makes it a lot   more readable.  2.  The basic format of the file is [when] or [then]  something to find =   something to replace . The [when] or [then] part means that we will only  match against the left  when  or right  then  part of the rule, as appropriate.  [ 190 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Chapter 9  4.   3.  For example, [when] There is a Patient = $patient: Patient   means,  find the text There is a patient in the when part of our rule, and replace  it with the more Drools-like language $patent : Patient    that is, match  against all patients in working memory . If the next line starts with a '-'  for example, -has no pulse = pulse==false ,  then Drools is smart enough to add a filter to our rule in case of a  match in the original file. This means that we end up with $patient :  Patient pulse==false , which will match against all patients with no  pulse. This allows us to mix and match the conditions on our rules without  having to specify every possible combination in our DRL translation file. 5.  The [when] find {value} = replace {value} allows you to specify a  value in your original rule, which will get passed to the final translation.   For example,  -is {color1} or {color2} in the face means we can reuse  this DRL translation for other colors  specified in the 'English' .dslr   rules file  later.  6.  The find-and-replace mechanism works in a similar way for translating    the [then] part of the rules from 'near-English' to the more technical   Drools language.  Other DSL editing options The DSL is just a text file, so we can edit it in Notepad. There is another option for  editing a DSL file in the IDE—the guided editor. If you open a DSL file in the JBoss  IDE, you'll see something similar to the following screenshot:  [ 191 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Domain Specific Language  DSL  and RuleFlow              There are three main sections to the editor: a place for the DRL Description  at the top, a table showing existing entries in the DSL, and a space at the  bottom to add new entries. The latter space also has buttons to Edit, Remove,  Add, oror Copy entries, as well as an option to Sort the existing ones. existing ones. Language Expression is what we will Find in the original rules file. Rule  Language Mapping is something we will Replace it with to generate our  Drools technical file. This find-and-replace mechanism is similar to the one  we looked at in the text editor. We also have Scope  [condition] or [consequence] , which is just another  name for [when] or [then], which we looked at previously. What is new is the Object field. This object takes the full name of a JavaBean,  including the package  for example net.firstpartners.Patient . This  allows autocompletion  that is, pop-up suggestions  when we are writing the  rules that use this DSL in Guvnor or the IDE.  that use this DSL in Guvnor or the IDE.  The IDE editor saves the DRL file in the text format that we looked at earlier. So, we  can switch back and forward between the two editors as required.  Writing DSLs Imagine that you had to write your own language, from the very beginning. Where  would you start? You could try using an existing dictionary as your inspiration, but  you're likely to map too many words that you don't really need. Or, you could make  it up as you go along, but users would get frustrated with the many delays while   you add yet another word to your language. Remember that the ideal is to have a  more-or-less stable language that users can easily understand so that it is easier for  them to write their rules. So, what are you going to do?  The answer is iteration. You  as a 'knowledge engineer' who understand rules and  DSLs  write the first 10, 20, or 100 rules, adding the elements that you need to the  DSL, as you go. Over time, you'll find that your DSL becomes more and more stable,  needing fewer additions to cope with each additional rule. At this point, you can  hand over the DSL to your business users  with much mentoring and training  and  the users can start writing their own rules based on the  near-stable  DSL.  Of course, picking a representative sample of rules will make writing the initial DSL  much more effective. Staying around to pick up the occasional mapping that your  rule writers need to add, will make them a lot happier. It also helps to have tests  written against your rules  as described in Chapter 7  so that you know instantly if   any of the changes that you are making breaks anything.  Let's look at this process, using a sample that we saw in the last chapter.  [ 192 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Chapter 9  As there is a lot of crossover and code reuse, the samples for this chapter  can be downloaded from the Chapter 8 sample at http:  code. google.com p red-piranha.  Meet the sample  Do you remember the rule in the DRL file that we had in the previous chapter—the  one that logged the contents of Excel cells? At the start of log-rules.dsl, it looked  something like the following:  package net.firstpartners.chap8;  import net.firstpartners.drools.log.ILogger  import net.firstpartners.excel.Cell; import net.firstpartners.excel.Range;  global ILogger log; rule "print cell initial values"        when        then  $cell : Cell modified==false             Logging message       end  log.info "initial cell value:"+$cell ;    Our first step is to change the file name to log-rules.dslr, and create a blank DSL  file called cell-logging.dsl. We link the two by adding an expander statement to  the DSLR file  expander cell-logging.dsl .  Once we add the expander statement, we've got a problem: Drools expects to match  everything between when and end against what it finds in the DSL. The problem is  that the DSL is  for the moment  just a blank file. The lines are marked with '>' so  that they are taken as they are. Our .dslr file will now look as follows:  package net.firstpartners.chap8;  import net.firstpartners.drools.log.ILogger  import net.firstpartners.excel.Cell; import net.firstpartners.excel.Range;  expander cell-logging.dsl  global ILogger log;  rule "print cell initial values"      when  [ 193 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Domain Specific Language  DSL  and RuleFlow  >     $cell : Cell modified==false       then            Logging message >      end  log.info "initial cell value:"+$cell ;    For this iteration, we know that we need to put in the entries for the two lines  marked with '>'. Starting with the 'then' part, we add the following lines to our DSL:  Cell Selection Rules [when]There is a Cell = $cell: Cell   [when]-unmodified = modified==false [when]-modified = modified==true  To cover the second-to-last line  log.info  we add some more lines to our DSL file:   Logging rules [then]Log the cell contents = log.info "Cell value:"+$cell ;  Now that we have a DSL ready  at least for this iteration , we can update our rule  file with more English-language rules. Because we've also changed the package  declaration inline with this chapter's name, the sample now looks like this:  package net.firstpartners.chap9;  import net.firstpartners.drools.log.ILogger  import net.firstpartners.excel.Cell; import net.firstpartners.excel.Range;  global ILogger log;   We must reference the dsl that we are using expander cell-logging.dsl  rule "print cell initial values"   when  There is a Cell                     then         Log the cell contents End  - unmodified  In real life, once we were happy that this was working, we would carry out some  more iterations. We would do this by covering other methods available on the Cell  Object, and perhaps the Range Object as well.

On the other hand, Guvnor is a web  editor intended for business users editing rules. What could be more perfect than  combining the two?  From what we already know, it's pretty simple to start writing DSL-based rules in  the Guvnor Web editor.  1.  Open up the Guvnor web editor, as you did in Chapter 3. 2.  Create a new package  net.firstpartners.chap9  to hold our information,   like we did in Chapter 4.

Ruleflow also makes our rules more understandable.  We'll take a look at that, now.  Ruleflow  One of the key features of a rule engine is that we have no control exactly when  our rules will fire. Our rules simply become available to fire  because the 'when' become available to fire  because the 'when'  conditions have been filled , and the rule engine decides the best order in which to to  execute them. We may drop hints about the rules that have higher priority  using  Salience , but the sort of 'fine-grained' controls that we have in other languages are   for good reason  not there. This is a good thing as it makes the individual rules  simpler, reusable, and easier to understand. However, there are business situations  where we may need to group our rules and control when they fire.  For example, for a mortgage application  which we'll call Homeloan  you may have  several hundred business rules. These might be naturally grouped by the state of the  loan application: rules that fire in the initial enquiry  for example, to provide a quick  quote , rules that fire when the application is received  for example, to make sure  that all of the paperwork is in order , rules that fire when the loan is drawn down   for example, to ensure that the money is sent out correctly , rules that fire every  month  for example, to calculate interest and accept a loan repayment , and rules  that fire if the loan goes into arrears or if there is a change in the interest rate.  [ 197 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Domain Specific Language  DSL  and RuleFlow  It would be possible to write our rules to check the status of the application,   for example:         Mortgage application is in 'Monthly Loan Repayment State' And  some other conditions unique to this business rule  ……  When  Then    Carry out monthly interest calculations  This goes on for each and every one of our several hundred rules. The problem with  this is that if our business flow changes  for example, if our bank decides that there  is an exciting new opportunity in the subprime lending market , then we have to  change each and every one of the business rules to reflect this. Next, we test all of   the rules to make sure that none of them inadvertently fire at the wrong time.         The alternative is to map our business flow graphically, like the following diagram.  At a glance, we can now see what the sequence of rule firing is: We start at Initial Enquiry and allow those rules to fire. If the Initial Enquiry is followed up, then we loan the money. After passing through a join point, we make a decision based on the question:  Are there any loan repayments outstanding? If yes, we give our rules that  calculate the loan interest the chance to fire. There is a  non  rule action to collect repayment before rejoining the   previous point. This time, if we don't have any repayments outstanding, we allow the  Complete Loan rules to fire, before ending the Ruleflow.        Collect Repayment  Repayments Outstanding?  Calculate Interest  Start  Initial Enquiry  Loan Money  Join  Complete Loan  End  [ 198 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Chapter 9  Understanding the Ruleflow in a diagram is far easier than deciphering the  information buried in individual rules.  Ruleflow is not workflow Notice that in the previous section we didn't say 'and at stage X the rules fire'. What  chance to fire'. It's still up to the rule  we said was 'at stage X we give the rules a chance to fire'. It's still up to the rule engine to decide which rules are the most appropriate to fire. Your rules are still  fire. Your rules are still  rules, except that effectively another condition has been added to the 'when'   part—checking that the Ruleflow is pointing to the group that our rule is in.  It's worth repeating this statement again. Ruleflow is not workflow. It might look  similar  for example, the JBoss jBPM workflow product has similar diagrams , but it  is subtly different. Let's look at the differences between the two:        Workflow says exactly what will happen at each stage in the process. As soon  as the workflow reaches a step, we will fire the actions associated with it. will fire the actions associated with it.  fire the actions associated with it. Ruleflow says what might happen selects the rules that actually fire.   happen at each stage in the process. The rule engine   It is possible to set individual rules to fire at each step in the flow  just like traditional  workflow . But if you find yourself wanting to do this, then you're really not using a  rule engine in the best way. It is better to mark a group of rules  and not a single rule   to fire, and then let Drools do its rule-engine stuff.  If you do need traditional workflow, you've got plenty of choices. From  JBoss alone you have jBPM  java Business Process Management  and  Drools  with enhanced workflow features in Drools 5, which we will  introduce in Chapter 12 . Both JBoss workflow products integrate well with the rule engine. For  example, when we have a decision node  to choose what the next step is   we can use the rule engine to make this decision.  Whatever you do, don't be tempted to write your own workflow—there's  no need to do so with hundreds of open source and commercial workflow  engines to choose from.  That Homeloan example again  To create a sample like the Homeloan, right-click on a project in the JBoss IDE and  select the New  other  Ruleflow menu option. You'll be shown a blank drawing  page  where you can draw your Ruleflow  with the following icons available on the  lefthand side of the screen. To compose your Ruleflow, select the icons that you want  to use, and then use Connection Creation to tie them together.  [ 199 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Domain Specific Language  DSL  and RuleFlow  The available steps in our Ruleflow are:  Start: Every flow should have only one start. Naturally enough, this is where  our Ruleflow begins.                    RuleFlowGroup: Our RuleFlowGroup has a name. When our Ruleflow  reaches this point in the flow, rules belonging to this Ruleflow group  and  only those rules belonging to this group  will be given the chance to fire.  RuleSet: If you look at the Property tab at the bottom of the screen, you  see additional information about each icon. In this case we can see that the  display name of the icon is RuleSet, and that  and that RuleFlowGroup  which we  will use shortly to tie our Ruleflow to our rules  is Evaluate Loan. Remember that all icons, and not just the RuleSet, have properties that you  can view and change.  Action: In our Homeloan flow we have a step that was more suited to the  traditional programming task  Collect Repayment . This could be printing  a letter, or sending an XML message to another bank, requesting payment.  Although this can be done via our rules  as it's calling the standard Java  code , it's better to be able to state it as a clear step in our flow.  Split: Only the simplest flows run in a straight line from start to finish.  Splits and joins allow the flow to branch and reconnect. As we saw in the  Homeloan sample diagram, splits and joins allow us to create loops in the  Ruleflow. Splits can allow the flow to go down one path or another, or even  down both paths. The decision about the path is rule-based.

We can  specify to wait for all branches to come back the Join, or just wait for one of  them one.  Milestone: This is a wait state—waiting until specified conditions become  true. The expressions used to specify the wait state are the same as those   on the lefthand side of a rule. The flow will be held until this condition   is fulfilled.  SubFlow: This executes the flow in another Ruleflow file. The name of that  other Ruleflow file is specified via the Properties tab.  End: Every flow should have only one end point. Naturally enough, this is  where our Ruleflow terminates.  It's not just the icons that have properties. If you select the entire Ruleflow  by  clicking on a blank area of the diagram , we can set properties for it as well.

There are also fields to set a version number and  to give the Ruleflow a more human-readable name  in this case, homeloan . After drawing your diagram and making connections between the Ruleflow steps   select two workflow steps, right click, then choose create connection from the context  menu that appears . It's always useful to validate the diagram  so that you catch any  errors now, rather than when you try to execute the flow for the first time . To validate  the diagram, right-click anywhere in the whitespace of the Ruleflow diagram and  select Validate from the context menu. Drools will notify you of any errors that it finds  in the Ruleflow.  Just because your Ruleflow validates correctly doesn't necessarily  mean that it will run without any errors. There are many things  that can still go wrong at runtime. Validation is still a good way of  reducing the chances of having errors.  Linking rules to Ruleflow So far, we drawn a few Ruleflow diagrams and stepped through the different   actions that we can add to the Ruleflow. But how does Drools know which rules   are available to fire at each step in the Ruleflow?  The answer is simple. We tag our rules with the name of the Ruleflow group that  they belong to.  Remember that we set the Ruleflow group name as a part of the  Ruleflow diagram.  By doing this, we end up with a rule looking something like this:    rule 'YourRule'      ruleflow-group 'evaluate loan'      when       ...      then       ...     end    This way, when our flow gets to the evaluate loan Ruleflow group, we know that  we have at least one rule that is available for firing. Whether the rule fires or not will  depend on the conditions attached to the when part of the rule.  There are other Ruleflow-related attributes that we can add to our rules. These are   as follows:       agenda-group is just another term for Ruleflow group. auto-focus true allows the rule to capture the focus if no Ruleflow-group   is selected.  [ 202 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Chapter 9     activation-group "some-name" is an activation group from which only one  rule in can fire. You can think of it as a more sophisticated form of no-loop  true, which acts on groups instead of single rules.  There is a final part to tying rules and Ruleflow together, but first we need a quick  lesson in stateful applications.  A quick introduction to stateful applications Most of the rules examples that we've seen are stateless. This means they run, fire  the rules, print the values, and then terminate. When we run the example again, they  'forget' that they have been run before and produce exactly the same output.  Most real-life applications are stateful. How angry would you be if you'd logged into  your web based online banking, only to find the application had forgotten about the  money that you'd lodged in your account the last time you logged on?  In a normal application, such as an online banking web site, we need to remember  what users did last  Are they logged in? What account are they looking at? Are  they in the middle of making a payment? and so on . If we do not remember this  data, users would get annoyed about having to repeat themselves at every step. It  would also lead to some pretty complicated screens, to allow users to enter all of the  information at once. Instead, we allow users to enter information in several steps,  and remember where they are each time.  In an application designed to be used by computers, we don't have to worry about  this. We can force the computer to give us all of the information required in one go,  for example username, password, bank account to take money from, bank account  to give money to, the date on which to execute the transaction, and so on. This is  actually easy for a computer, because we make one call to our banking service and  we are told whether our transaction has succeeded or failed. It's also easier for us to  build our service.  Each service  transferring money, booking flights, or executing share trade  does  only one thing.  Because each service 'forgets' everything after each call, we don't need to worry  about trying to remember what we were doing before.  Because we have no memory, stateless applications  and services  are very scalable.  We can make several copies of the same service and put them in a pool. Any client  can talk to any service—no waiting for a particular server to become available.  [ 203 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Domain Specific Language  DSL  and RuleFlow  In summary, stateless applications are simpler and scale better. Stateful applications,  although harder to design and build, are more user-friendly. There are scores   of books dedicated to explaining which design to choose and how to build them.   But for the time being, there is one important reason why we've introduced   stateful applications.  Stateful rules and Ruleflow In all of our previous examples, we've fired our rules in a stateless manner. That  is, we pass all of the information that we need to our rules, allow the rules to fire,  and then get the final result back. There is no 'state', and nothing to remember, as  everything is fired in one go.  You may recall the following line from previous examples:  runStatelessRules RULES_FILES,DSL_FILE, facts, globals, logger ;  Notice that no value is returned by this piece of code, nor do we need it. We fire  our rules in one go, and our facts  for example, cells in the Excel spreadsheet  are  automatically updated.  Stateless rule sessions are fine for our simple examples, where everything is  completed in a few seconds. But what about our mortgage application Ruleflow,  where the process can last for days, weeks, or even months? We will have to call our  rules in a stateful way to remember the way we left things the last time we invoked  the rule engine.  Stateful and stateless rules are almost the same. The only difference is the  manner in which we call the rule engine.  The code extract  from RuleFlowExample.java in the net firstpartners chap9  package or folder  shows us how. It also shows that while we gain the power of  having stateful rules, it takes a bit more work on our part to call the rule engine.  StatefulSession session = new RuleRunner                .getStatefulSession RULES_FILES,          null,           RULEFLOW_FILE,          ranges.getAllRangesAndCells  ,         globals,      excelLogger ;     session.startProcess RULEFLOW_ID ;  session.fireAllRules  ;  [ 204 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Chapter 9  This code does a few things, such as:                It uses our RuleRunner to load the rule file. Like before, it passes in our facts  the Cell JavaBeans , globals, and a handle  to the logger. It also passes a handle to the Ruleflow file  so that Drools  knows what process we wish to use . Unlike before, rules are not fired at this point. Instead, we get a session  back—that is, a handle to the rule engine, with everything loaded and ready   to go. Our second line of code starts the Ruleflow process by calling the   session.startprocess method. This simply puts the token at the start   of the Ruleflow because no rules are fired as yet. The RULEFLOW_ID that   we pass in is the one that we set in the properties screen of our Ruleflow    for example, mortgage Ruleflow . The final line of our code  session.fireAllRules  starts our rules. The  difference between the rules firing in this and the previous samples is that  the Ruleflow is guiding which groups of rules become available to fire, and  when. As before, when all of the possible rules have fired, our fact objects   the Cell JavaBeans  are updated, and control returns to our program.  The rest of the code example  for example, the code that converts the values from  Excel to JavaBeans and back again, the logging, and so on  remains the same as the  code we've used in other examples.  There are a lot of other things that we can do with the Drools session, and  not just Ruleflow. For example, as we step through the web pages for a  Homeloan application, we can have Drools working in the background  to ensure that all rules remain true, by updating the facts. We'll cover this  truth-maintenance capability in more detail in the next chapter.

We started with a DSL, or domain specific language. By using DSLs, business rule  editors can write near-English rules in a language suited to their profession. Drools  then does the hard work of finding and replacing these rules, using an expander, so  that we end up with a more technical rule that we can execute in the normal way.  Ruleflow also makes our rules easier to understand. It allows us to extract the flow  that might otherwise be hidden in our rules. We saw how to create the Ruleflow  diagram, and how to run it as part of a stateful rules session.  In our next chapter, we'll see how to take these new rules capabilities and deploy  them as a part of a real-world application.  [ 206 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Deploying Rules in Real Life  All of the previous chapters have shown you how to do many useful things  with business rules—including how to write them in the Guvnor, the IDE, excel  spreadsheet, and the near-English DSL formats. All of this is useless unless you  can make the results of your hard labour available to end users who will interact  with your business rules in some way. To make this possible, you need to get your  business rules off the computer where you wrote them and onto a production server.  It's like a teenager leaving his or her home for the first time and making his or her  way in the wider world.  What we need to do is deploy our business rules.  One size fits all architecture If you were building a house, you'd employ an architect to design it for you before  anybody started working on the site. That way, the bricklayers, plumbers, joiners,  and electricians would know what the finished product will look like and can plan  their work accordingly. Most computer systems cost far more than your average  house  that is, when you include the cost the wages of the people involved in the IT  project . So it makes sense to take a little time to prepare the architecture for these  systems as well.  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Deploying Rules in Real Life  Fortunately, most computer systems these days are web based; that is, they use web  pages to gather input from users and to display the result. It doesn't matter if these  web pages can be seen only within your company or organisation, or by the world   at large—both use the same underlying technology. There are entire bookshelves    or the online equivalent  devoted to the best web architecture, but pretty much all   of the designs contain a similar core, as shown in the following diagram:     User  Browser  Presentation Layer   Struts Model-View-Controller  Pattern    >   >  Browser   >  Data  Data Cache  Java Beans  Value Object  Business Layer  Business Agent  Business Agent  Business Agent  Sub Business  Agent  Value Object   DTO  Value Object   DTO  Server  DAO Facade  Service Layer   Data Access Object - DAO  Pattern   Database DAO  XML DAO  Other DAO  Value Object   DTO  Database  XML & Web Services  Other  Back End              Most web systems take information from the user  at the top of the diagram , mation from the user  at the top of the diagram ,  do something with it  the white area in the middle of the diagram , and store  it in a database  at the bottom of the diagram . The grey areas at the top  Browser  and bottom  Back End Database and  other systems  are outside our immediate control. We have to 'talk' to them.  But, typically, we're stuck with whatever web browser or database someone  else has chosen. The part that we can control is in the middle, labelled Server. A server  is simply a computer dedicated to running our software and making it  available over the Web. Our system on the server is built in three layers: the Presentation Layer, the  Business Layer, and the Service Layer.  [ 208 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Chapter 10  These three layers are like a sandwich. Standard technologies make up the e a sandwich. Standard technologies make up the  Presentation Layer  which shows web pages to the user  and the Service  Layer  which talks to databases and other 'backend' systems . The more  interesting sandwich filling  unique to our system  is the Business Layer  right in the middle of the diagram. As you'd expect from the name 'business rules', the Business Layer is where  the business rules normally reside .  There you have the one-size-fits-all architecture. Now, what are you paying all those ecture. Now, what are you paying all those  overpriced consultants for?  What needs to be deployed? The architecture diagram contains a lot more than examples based on simple rules,  which is what we've been looking at until now. There are a lot of pieces that make up  a full Enterprise web system. Many of these should already have been installed as a  'one-off' by the friendly system administrators in your IT department. Others are up  to you to provide.  Let's look at the parts of the solution that you'll need:  Server: An application needs a machine to run on. This could be a box tucked  away under somebody's desk  not ideal , a real server plugged into a rack  somewhere  better , or a 'virtual' server hosted by an IT company or a secure  third-party hosting company  better again . Operating system  OS : Our server is useless without the basic instructions  that make it work. This would most likely be Windows  a version similar to  what is on your desktop PC , Linux, or some other variant of UNIX. For the  purpose of Java-based rules, our application can deploy on any of these. Java application server: We talked about deploying this on a desktop PC back  in Chapter 2, when installing JBoss. This gives our application a 'home' to run  on and provides common services such as security, database access, and a  web server. Application: This consists of the non-rules Java code, web pages, and other  configuration. This is pretty much everything except the business rules, as  depicted on our 'one size fits all' architecture diagram. The application is  often deployed as a .war  web archive  file, a type of ZIP file. In some cases the configuration files may be deployed separately, to allow  easier changes later.  That is, you only have to update a single file, rather  than the entire application.                        [ 209 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Deploying Rules in Real Life              Support libraries  such as web frameworks or drivers to allow us to talk to  databases  are often deployed as part of the WAR  Web Archive  file, but  can be deployed separately. The choice will often depend on the instructions  provided with the library. Rules: The business rules that form the core of the system. To a large extent,  the other components are deployed purely to support the rules.  In general, the server, OS, Java, and the application will be supplied by your IT  department  with input from you . The web application may be provided by you,  or by the development team that you are working with. The development team will  also specify the support libraries required  and where on the Internet they can be  obtained . Rules will be developed by you.  Rules as code or data? Should business rules be embedded as a part of the application code that doesn't  change very often? Or are rules more like your application data  for example,  pricing lists , which you expect to change on an almost daily basis? Depending on  your answers, you will deploy your rules very differently. The answer, somewhat  confusingly, is that rules are 'both'.  Rules are as powerful as the normal code and should be treated in the same  way.  For example, before deployment, any changes should be thoroughly  tested.  Rules are as easy to change as data because: first, they live outside the  'normal' application; and second, rule engines are expressly designed to application; and second, rule engines are expressly designed to  allow easy changes to the business rules.  Organisations will typically have two sorts of deployment processes, which are   as follows:  1.  A heavier, more rigorous, process for the deployment of code as, traditionally,  getting it wrong has been at best embarrassing, and at worst very, very costly.  2.  A lighter process for deploying data changes—after all, the application is   changing data itself all the time—such as saving user profiles in a database.  Remember that it is also possible to store rules in a database, even though most of  the examples in this book store the rules in a standard text file. For example, hidden  within the Guvnor is an Apache Jackrabbit repository. This repository can use an  industry standard database  such as Oracle, Sybase, MySql, or Microsoft SQL Server   as its storage area.  [ 210 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Chapter 10  Perhaps the best way of summing this up is that rules give you a lot of power, and  many deployment choices; so be careful how you use them. Whatever view you  take, any changes to your rules in the 'big bad world' of production, or a live system,  should be part of a standard, well-documented process.  Deployment process We know how to write our business rules. We also know about the other pieces of  the application puzzle  or at least we know who to ask them for . And we've decided  whether we want to treat our rules as code or as data. Now, how do we get them  from our computer  where we have written them  to the production server  where  the entire company, or world, can interact with them ?  What we need is a deployment process.  If you don't have a deployment process, the worst case scenario is that you have to  edit the rules on the production server. In doing so, you not only risk breaking an  application that users are using, but you also risk not having a backup copy.   A slightly less bad scenario is that you edit the rules on your own PC, and then put  them live. If you have no process to manage this transfer, you risk making a mistake.  And your mistake may not be recognized until several days later. How do you  return to the last known good version of your rules?  What we need is a deployment process. So what does a proper deployment process  look like? Although there are many variations, at their core they contain the features  shown in the following diagram:  Firewall  Development  Test  Production  The first surprising thing that you encounter is that three separate computers are  used in the deployment process. One  maybe your local PC  is where you write your  rules. Another is the production server, which is a server accessible to the end users.  But the rules aren't deployed directly from development to production. They get  there via a test box—a server that is as similar to the production server as possible. It  allows verification of the code that we are about to deploy, without disrupting users.  [ 211 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Deploying Rules in Real Life  We need a separate test server to verify our application  and rules . The main reason  for this is that other people will need to test your rules before they go live. No matter  how careful you are, you might miss something. Having a third-party test for your  rules provides an additional level of confidence.  The second group of people involved in the deployment process are the system  administrators. It is unlikely that you will move the code between the various  servers—it will more likely be the sys admins who do the job for you. Their role is to  ensure the stability of these servers, and not just to put your application live. Expect  plenty of questions from the sys admins about differences between versions, the  underlying software requirements, step-by-step instructions on how to install the  software, and which repository to find the code to deploy in.  What's a repository? One of the questions the system administrators will ask you is "Are you storing your  source code in a repository?" Now, what's a repository? And why do they care—after  all you're deploying the finished, compiled product, not the source code?  The problem with storing your files on a local file system is that if you delete a file  accidentally, it's very difficult to recover. Yes, you have the recycle bin, but what  happens if that is full? What happens if you delete a portion of a file, save it, then  only realize your mistake five minutes later?  A repository solves this versioning problem. It allows you to save a complete history  of all of the changes that you have made and roll back to whichever version you  choose  should this prove necessary . By allowing the merging of files, an entire team  can co-operate on developing an application. There are many repositories available  from many suppliers, including Microsoft, and Subversion.  You'll remember that Guvnor has a built-in repository, and take advantage of this  later in the chapter. This repository stores only rules and items directly related to  rules. For version control of the other items in our application, we would still need a  full repository.  Deploying rules Just to complicate things further, there are many options for how we can deploy the  rules. They are as follows:  1.  We can deploy the rules as plain-text source files—similar to the approach   used in the examples in this book. Although this is perhaps the simplest  approach, we will need the Drools compiler as a support library. This means  that there can be problems, which we will find only after we deploy.  [ 212 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Chapter 10  2.  One alternative is to compile the rules and the dependent objects into  a binary package. It is this package that is deployed on the server. This  approach needs an extra step during our compile or build process, but it will  find problems sooner.  3.  A third approach is to pull the rules from the Guvnor repository. Although   this is convenient, this approach doesn't always have the 'somebody else  checks your rules before deployment' step. It is easy  perhaps far too easy  to  push changes to your rules to the production.  There are further variations on the above three themes. They are listed as follows:             We can mix and match any, or all, of these three solutions atch any, or all, of these three solutions We can add or remove individual packages  or the entire rule base consisting  of multiple packages  before, or during, our running of the rules When deploying source files, we can pre-check for syntax errors, but still  allow rules to be compiled on the production server We can deploy our rules as code  as an integral part of the application  or as  data  that is, build our application to check often for rule-changes   Remember that Drools is pretty powerful. It can cope with rules swapping in and  out, even when the rules are running as a part of long-term stateful rule session. We  can also serialize  akin to freeze-drying  all of the Drools objects. This means we can  de-serialize them later—a bit like adding water again to bring the rules and other  Drools objects back to life. Serialisation means that 'live' rules can be sent over the  network, and stored in a database for later use, and so on.  Push or pull? In a normal deployment style, we 'push' the items to be deployed from the  development PC or repository to the test server, and finally to the production server.  The following diagram shows push deployment:  Rule  Repository  Production  Server  The copy, or deployment,  as shown by the arrow  is often a manual copy of the rules  files. This is great because the copy will often be managed by system administrators,  and they will ask you tough questions  such as 'Are you really sure?'  before they  deploy. This push style fits very well with treating rules as traditional code.  [ 213 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Deploying Rules in Real Life  On the other hand, aren't rules meant to be dynamic? What if we want to make a  small change to a business rule, which is after all designed to change frequently? Do  we have to wait for a system adminstrator to be available? Will all of the questions  they ask just get in the way?  Rule  Repository  Production  Server  The pull style is meant to be more dynamic than this. In it, the production  application using the rules will check every 'x' minutes, or hours, or days to see  if there is a new set of rules in our rule repository. If so, it 'pulls' the new rules  into the application. This process is similar to Windows Update, and can happen  automatically, behind the scenes. A Drools component called 'RuleAgent' is provided  to help build these kinds of systems.  The pull style works best if you are treating your rules as data that changes often.  It also works best if the kind of changes you are making to your rules preclude  costly mistakes—the sysadmin's 'Are you sure?' question comes from hard-earned  experience. Remember that there is no 'best' deployment mechanism, but only the  one that works best for your project.  Loading our rules Whether we push or pull our rules to the live system, or deploy the rules a plain  text of a pre-compiled or processed binary, we've got the same problem: How does  our application actually load the rules we give it? In our previous examples, we've  glossed over this process while we concentrated on what the rule engine was doing.  Now it's time to take a detailed look at how we call the rule engine from Java.  Looking inside RuleRunner.java  Almost all of our samples have used some variation on the RuleRunner.java file to  do the hard work of calling our rules. The good news is that the process is the same,  which means that you can reuse it in your own projects. The code in RuleRunner will  cover the following scenarios in which we have to:         Load rules in a stateless manner Load rules in a stateful manner Load decision tables  [ 214 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Chapter 10       Load rules with DSL Load rules with Ruleflow th Ruleflow  Helper methods Firstly, we'll look at the code that all of these scenarios will use. The following  code identifies our package, imports the other files that we will need, defines some  constants  the XLS file extension, which is unlikely to change any time during the life  of the program , and also defines the RuleRunner   method—it makes RuleRunner  a JavaBean. Although this is not vital in the book samples, it does make the code  more reusable.  If you're happy being just a business rule author, you're unlikely to  need the mechanics of rule loading to the detail we're going to discuss  here. On the other hand, if you're a rule and Java developer—read on.  We're going to talk about lots of useful stuff.  package net.firstpartners.drools; import java.io.FileNotFoundException; import java.io.IOException; import java.io.InputStream; import java.io.InputStreamReader; import java.io.StringReader; import java.util.Collection; import java.util.HashMap; import org.apache.commons.logging.Log; import org.apache.commons.logging.LogFactory;  import org.drools.RuleBase; import org.drools.RuleBaseFactory; import org.drools.StatefulSession; import org.drools.StatelessSession; import org.drools.rule.Package; import org.drools.compiler.DroolsParserException; import org.drools.compiler.PackageBuilder; import org.drools.decisiontable.InputType; import org.drools.decisiontable.SpreadsheetCompiler;  import net.firstpartners.drools.log.ILogger;  public class RuleRunner {      private static final String XLS_FILE_EXTENSION = ".xls"; private Log log = LogFactory.getLog getClass   ;         public RuleRunner   {     }  [ 215 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Deploying Rules in Real Life  The imports fall into the following four broad categories:              Standard Java objects, such as exceptions  errors  when a file is not  found or cannot be opened  IOException , and utilities for reading files   InputStream, InputStreamReader, StringReader . It also includes Java  standard collections and a Hashmap  a collection of name-value pairs . Objects from Apache, which provide many useful open source utilities. In  this case, we import the logging utilities. These help us print messages about  what is going on in our samples. Next, we import the Drools objects. We've seen them before—a RuleBase  or  compiled set of rules  and a RuleBaseFactory to help us load the rules from  a package. We have stateful and stateless sessions  working copies of the  rules , as well as compiler for both standard and decision table based rules. Finally, we import other Java files from the project—in this case, a utility that  we use to help write log entries for our rules.  The next section contains helper methods that are used by the stateful and stateless  rule loaders.You’ll see that these are marked private, that is, only other methods  within the same file—the public runStatelessRules and getStatefulSession  methods that you will recognize from the samples in previous chapters. The main  helper method used is loadRules, which finds the multiple rule files we pass into it,  as well as any DSL or ruleflow files that we specify.  If we don't have a DSL or Ruleflow file, then we can pass in null,   which is a special Java word meaning 'empty' or 'nothing'.  private RuleBase loadRules String[] rules,                            String dslFileName,                            String ruleFlowFileName                   throws Exception{     RuleBase localRuleBase = RuleBaseFactory.newRuleBase  ;    PackageBuilder builder = new PackageBuilder  ;                                                    for   int i = 0; i < rules.length; i++   {        String ruleFile = rules[i];       log.info  "Loading file: " + ruleFile  ;           Check the type of rule file, then load it       if ruleFile.endsWith XLS_FILE_EXTENSION  {           loadExcelRules ruleFile,builder ;          } else {  [ 216 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801     loadRuleFile  ruleFile,dslFileName,ruleFlowFileName,    builder ;  Chapter 10                  }                         }                              Package pkg = builder.getPackage  ;     localRuleBase.addPackage  pkg  ;      return localRuleBase; }  Within the method, there are three main rules-related features that are highlighted in  the code above. They are:  1.  The line beginning with for  ...  loops though all of the names of the rule   files that we pass in.  2.  The line beginning with if   … XLS_FILE_EXTENSION  checks to see if our  rule file is an Excel decision table. Depending on the answer, it calls a helper  method to load a normal, or an Excel, rules file.  3.  All of the rules files loaded by the helper method are added to a package    builder. getPackage , and then combined into a single rulebase   localRuleBase. addPackage .  The loadRuleFile method  which loads DRL rules  is called by the loadRules  method. However, it only takes the name of a single drl rulefile as a parameter  as  well as the dsl and ruleflow files .  private void loadRuleFile String ruleFile,                           String dslFileName,                           String ruleFlowFileName,                           PackageBuilder addRulesToThisPackage                 throws DroolsParserException,              IOException{              This method is more flexible in finding resources on disk    InputStream ruleSource = RuleRunner.class.getClassLoader                                     .getResourceAsStream ruleFile ;       We must be able to find all rule files    if null==ruleSource {                               "Cannot find rule file:"+ruleFile ;  throw new FileNotFoundException            log.info "found rule file:"+ruleFile ;     } else {     }            [ 217 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Deploying Rules in Real Life                                                                                                                                Check if the user has passed in a DSL    if dslFileName!=null {            Load the rules, expanding them using the DSL Specified         InputStream dslSource = RuleRunner.class.getClassLoader                                     .getResourceAsStream dslFileName ;  throw new FileNotFoundException            We must be able to find all rule files         if null==dslSource {                                           "Cannot find dsl file:"+dslFileName ;         } else {                 }                               Load the rules, using DSL                                 new InputStreamReader ruleSource , new InputStreamReader dslSource  ;       log.info "found dsl file:"+ dslFileName ;  addRulesToThisPackage.addPackageFromDrl           } else {                     Load the rules, no DSL         addRulesToThisPackage.addPackageFromDrl                   new InputStreamReader ruleSource  ;    }       if we've specified a ruleflow, add this to the package    if ruleFlowFileName!=null {                      Load the rules , expanding them using the DSL Specified         InputStream ruleFlowSource =RuleRunner.class.getClassLoader                                 .getResourceAsStream ruleFlowFileName ;            We must be able to find all rule files          if null==ruleFlowSource {                                          "Cannot find dsl file:"+ruleFlowFileName ;          } else {                        }  log.info "found dsl file:"+ ruleFlowFileName ;  throw new FileNotFoundException              addRulesToThisPackage.addRuleFlow                      new InputStreamReader ruleFlowSource  ;      }             }  [ 218 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Chapter 10  Notable steps highlighted in this method are:  1.  The Java method for locating and loading the RuleRunner.class.  getClassLoader  .getResourceAsStream ruleFile  file. Rather than  being hardwired to a specific location, this file allows Java to search in the  locality for files of the specific name. This is especially useful if this code is  running as a part of a web application.  2.  We try to load the rule file using this technique, and then throw an exception    error message  if the file cannot be found.  3.  We check to see if a DSL has been passed in  dslFileName!=null . If yes, we   call the Drools method addPackageFromDrl ruleSource, dslSource . If  there no DSL file specifed, we call the more simple addPackageFromDrl rul eSource  method.  4.  We check to see if a ruleflow file has been specified  ruleFlowFileName   !=null . If yes, we load and add it to the package by using the Drools  method addRuleFlow  ruleFlowSource .   The Excel equivalent of this method is loadExcelRules. This method takes the name  of the Excel decision table that we wish to load, and the name of the package that we  want to add it to.  This example doesn't accept a Ruleflow file to keep things simple. It is  possible to use Ruleflow with Excel decision tables in a similar way as  normal DRL rule files are used.  private void loadExcelRules String excelRuleFile,                             PackageBuilder addRulesToThisPackage                  throws DroolsParserException, IOException{        This method is more flexible in finding resources on disk     InputStream xlRuleSource = RuleRunner.class.getClassLoader  .                                    getResourceAsStream excelRuleFile ;      if null==xlRuleSource {                  throw new FileNotFoundException                  "Cannot find file:"+excelRuleFile ;     } else {            log.info "found file:"+excelRuleFile ;     }        first we compile the decision table into a whole lot of rules.              SpreadsheetCompiler compiler = new SpreadsheetCompiler  ; String drl = compiler.compile xlRuleSource, InputType.XLS ;           Show the DRL that is generated  [ 219 ]                     This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Deploying Rules in Real Life                log.debug drl ;      same as previous - we add the drl to our package                addRulesToThisPackage.addPackageFromDrl                                          new StringReader drl  ;     }        }             This method also finds the named Excel file by using the getResourceAsStream   excelRuleFile  technique. However, there are two new lines  highlighted . They  are explained as follows:  1.  We create a SpreadsheetCompiler helper object  kindly provided by the   Drools project .  2.  We call the compile method on this helper object to transform the Excel-  based decision table into the DRL format, which we are familiar with. Just to  prove that our rules are now in the DRL format, we even print them to the  screen by using the log.debug statement.  Once done, we add the rules to the package provided, which is similar to what we  did for the DRL source rules.  Public methods All of these methods are going on 'under the covers', because the examples from  previous chapters don't use them directly. In fact, unless you want to modify the  behavior  for example, to add Ruleflow to rules based on decision tables , you  might never need this amount of detail. What you will do in your project, like in our  examples, is call one of the following methods:  runStatelessRules getStatefulSession  As with the samples in the previous chapters, stateless rules are simpler as they fire  once, and then give you a result immediately. Stateful rules, though more complex, are  good for long-lived rules where we will update records and get results multiple times.  Stateless The runStatelessRules method takes the following parameters:  An array of text names—these are the rule files that the sample will search  for, and then load. The dslFileName as text  string , or null if it is empty.  [ 220 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801            The facts that we wish to pass to the rule engine—a collection of JavaBeans. A collection of global objects, such as name value pairs, and so on. The ruleFlowFileName as text  string , or null if it is empty. A handle to the logger helper object. This allows the rules to print out what   is happening.  Chapter 10  Remember that the difference between facts and globals is that facts  are designed to be updated as a result of business rules firing  and will  cause other rules to fire in turn . Globals, on the other hand, are more for  'reference' data that may or may not change.  To see an example of how this method is called, look at the ExcelDataRulesExample  again.  It's part of the samples in Chapter 8.  The complete details of the  runStatelessRules method:   **  * Run the rules  * @param rules - array of rule files that we need to load  * @param dslFileName - optional dsl file name  can be null   * @param facts - Javabeans to pass to the rule engine  * @param globals - global variables to pass to the rule engine  * @param logger - handle to a logging object  * @throws Exception  *   public void runStatelessRules String[] rules, String dslFileName,                              Collection  facts,                              HashMap  globals,                               String ruleFlowFileName,                              ILogger logger                   throws Exception {                  RuleBase masterRulebase=                 loadRules rules,dslFileName, ruleFlowFileName ;       Create a new stateless session    StatelessSession workingMemory =                                masterRulebase.newStatelessSession  ;     for  String o: globals.keySet   {           log.info  "Inserting global name:"+o+" value:"+globals.get o  ;            workingMemory.setGlobal o, globals.get o  ;     }                  Add the logger  [ 221 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Deploying Rules in Real Life      log.info "Inserting handle to logger  via global " ;     workingMemory.setGlobal "log", logger ;                        log.info "==== Calling Rule Engine ====" ;                Fire using the facts     workingMemory.execute facts ;      log.info "==== Rules Complete =====" ; }          The key features of this method  highlighted above  are:  1.  Load the rule, or DSL, or ruleflow file, by using the   DSL, or ruleflow file, by using the loadRules      helper method.  2.  From the loaded RuleBase, create StatelessSession. This is a one-time   scratchpad based on the rules, which is unique to this session. Into this StatelessSession, add the globals in a loop  starting at the for …  line . The logger helper object is also added as a global.  3.   4.  Fire the rules, passing in the facts using the Drools method workingMemory.  execute  facts .   When the rules fire, the facts  JavaBeans  are updated. So when this method finishes,  the rest of our Java code has access  via these JavaBeans  to the 'answers' that the rule  engine comes up with.  Stateful The stateful method takes almost the same set of parameters as does the stateless stateful method takes almost the same set of parameters as does the stateless  method takes almost the same set of parameters as does the stateless  one. But there are two points of difference: we don't pass in the facts to it, and the  stateful method returns a value  whereas the stateless method returns nothing .  The returned value is StatefulSession. By returning this, we have a handle to the  memory. This handle gives us the state of the rules, and allows us to come back to  update that state with new facts later, if needed.   **  * Run the rules  * @param rules - array of rule files that we need to load  * @param dslFileName - optional DSL file name  can be null   * @param ruleFlowFileName - optional  can be null   * @param facts - JavaBeans to pass to the rule engine  * @param globals - global variables to pass to the rule engine  * @param logger - handle to a logging object  * @throws Exception  *      [ 222 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Chapter 10                 public StatefulSession getStatefulSession String[] rules,String          dslFileName, String            ruleFlowFileName,                                           HashMap globals,                                           ILoggerlogger                  throws Exception {                                                      rules,dslFileName,ruleFlowFileName ;  RuleBase masterRulebase=loadRules                 Create a new stateful session StatefulSession workingMemory = masterRulebase.newStatefulSession  ;  for  String o : globals.keySet   {      log.info "Inserting global name: "+o+" value:"+globals.get o   ;                          workingMemory.setGlobal o, globals.get o  ; }         Add the logger log.info "Inserting handle to logger  via global " ; workingMemory.setGlobal "log", logger ;  return workingMemory; }          Two differences are highlighted in this method. Firstly, we use  newStatefulSession   to get a working memory  scratchpad . This stateful session  can be called more than once.  Secondly, the method is actually shorter than its stateless equivalent. The reason is  that we set up the rules, but don't fire them. So if we're using this method  as in the  RuleflowExample.java file from Chapter 9 , you'll see that you have to do the hard  work in the Java code that calls this method.   This 'hard work' is familiar, and explains why we don't have to pass in the facts. We  have to insert ourselves in the calling method. An example of the calling code is   as follows:  Collection  allRangeValues = ranges.getAllRangesAndCells  ;  for  Object fact: allRangeValues {    statefulSession.insert fact ;        Finally, we also need to remember to call the rules:  statefulSession.fireAllRules  ;  [ 223 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Deploying Rules in Real Life  Alternative method—RuleAgent Drools provides an alternative method for loading the rules, based on the RuleAgent   found in the org.drools.agent package . The RuleAgent helper can make your  code simpler, as long as you follow the RuleAgent way of deployment. However,  you don't get as much flexibility as you do with the code samples above. Typically,  this means that pre-compiled  binary  packages of rules fit quite well with the way  the Guvnor web editor works.  The way the RuleAgent works is through code plus a properties file. Your code calls  the RuleAgent helper, similar to the following  remember that you will have import  org.drools.agent.RuleAgent at the top of the file :  RuleAgent ra = RuleAgent.newRuleAgent " RuleAgent.properties" ;      RuleBase rb = ra.getRuleBase  ;      now get a stateful or stateless sessions from RuleBase as before  The RuleAgent.properties text file referred to in the above code snippet looks  similar to the following:  poll=60 NewInstance=false name=SomeNameUsedInLogging dir= my dir file = alternativeToDir  url=http:  myfirstUrl http:  anotherURLIfNeeded localCacheDir=file:  c:  temp  Most of the options in the properties file are straightforward, as follows:               Poll = 60: This causes the RuleAgent to check for updates every 60 seconds. NewInstance: If this is true, and there is an update to the rules, then only  new sessions that are created will pick up the new rules. The previous  sessions will remain unchanged. name: This is the name that is used in logging. dir, file, or url: The location where the binary package of rules can be  located. url can be used to point directly to Guvnor. localCacheDir: The RuleAgent will keep a local copy in case the remote  URL is temporarily unavailable. rarily unavailable.

However, you could be using one of the hundreds of  Java web frameworks. Each of those web frameworks would be worthy of a book in  itself. Instead, we'll provide a set of notes about what to expect. These notes are not  meant to be exhaustive, but to give you an idea of the steps involved in deploying  Drools as a part of the web framework of your choice.  Each of these frameworks has three major points of integration with JBoss Rules.  These are as follows:          How do we package the project  with Rules and the Drools Libraries  so that ow do we package the project  with Rules and the Drools Libraries  so that  it gets deployed to the web server? In which folder do we save the rules files in the web project? Where in the web framework do we call the rules code  seen previously in  this chapter ? his chapter ?  For our walkthrough, we'll use the Appfuse framework  which uses Spring under  the covers . The quick run-through also assumes that you have the MySql database  installed from http:  dev.mysql.com downloads —the community edition will  do fine. The next few pages assume some knowledge of Java web development due  to the complexity of the subject.  Why Appfuse? Underneath, it uses the popular Spring MVC framework.  But it gives you a choice of web frameworks. It also generates most of  the applications automatically, for immediate results—a bit like Ruby on  Rails. More information on the Appfuse project is available at   www.appfuse.org.  Maven for packaging Previous chapters have used Maven as a build tool, mainly for setting up Eclipse  projects. It can do a lot more, including pulling down Appfuse from the Web,  creating the package structure for the project, and deploying the code to the web  server. This can be seen with the help of the following steps:  1.  Open a command window. Use Maven to download Appfuse, and create a   standard project.     mvn archetype:create -DarchetypeGroupId=org.appfuse.archetypes- DarchetypeArtifactId=appfuse-basic-spring -DremoteRepositories =http:  static.appfuse.org releases -DarchetypeVersion=2.0.2 - DgroupId=net.firstpartners.chap10 -DartifactId=chap10-sample  [ 225 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Deploying Rules in Real Life  2.  Change the director to the folder created in the previous step using the    3.  Use Maven again, this time to generate a project skeleton, with the    cd chap10-sample command.  command mvn war:inplace.  project in Eclipse.  4.  Create an Eclipse project by using mvn eclipse:eclipse, and then open the   In the project structure, you'll see the place where we can save our rules files and  other resources, under the resources folder, as shown in the screenshot below.  By default, Maven expects this standard structure. The following figure shows the  RuleFile location:  5.  Maven can also run a test web server - mvn jetty:runwar. When the   message [INFO] Started Jetty Server [INFO] Starting scanner at interval  of 3 seconds. appears in the console, open a web browser at http:   localhost:8080 login.jsp. You will see the following web screen, or  sample app, generated by Appfuse. If you want to log in and play around,  enter admin as both the Username and the Password.  [ 226 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Chapter 10  6.  Stop Maven  by pressing Ctrl+C in the command window , when you're   finished playing with it.   7.  Now that we have a web application up and running, it's time to start   adding Drools. In Eclipse, we'll modify the pom.xml file so that the web  project knows where to find the Drools libraries. Rather than supplying the  full details here, just copy and paste the   section from the  pom.xml file in the sample from Chapter 8.  8.  Next, we need to add the code that calls JBoss Rules  that is, the code we   saw previously in this chapter and in the samples . Typically, this is in  the Java file  controller of the model-view-controller pattern  where the  values submitted by the user on the Web have already been converted into  JavaBeans. By happy coincidence, these JavaBeans are very suitable for  passing into the rule engine.  9.  More details on how to add a controller for Appfuse-Spring-MVC can be  found at http:  www.appfuse.org display APF Using+Spring+MVC.  The file that we will modify according to these instructions is  PersonFormController. In summary, this file  PersonFormController   extends another file  BaseFormController , and adds one method  that we  will use to call the rules :      public ModelAndView onSubmit HttpServletRequest request,               HttpServletResponse response, Object command,               BindException errors      throws Exception {         log.debug "About to call Rules..." ;          as previous examples          return new ModelAndView success ;     }     Place the code to call rules here, exactly      10.  Within the updated PersonFormController, add the code that calls the rule  engine—a copy-and-paste job from the examples in Chapter 9 should work.  The trickiest part for this code is the rules  DRL  file. However, as long as   the rules file is included in the Web Archive  WAR  file that   contains the application, the code in our previous sample,   getClassLoader  .getResourceAsStream ruleFile , should find it.  11.  Generate the web application ZIP file by using Mvn War, and deploy it to your   favorite web application using the instructions that come with it.  Remember—this isn't meant to be a complete web application development  tutorial. Rather, it's meant for people familiar with Java web development  to be able to add rules to their applications. If you're not familiar with web  development, it may give you some idea of the required steps.  [ 227 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Deploying Rules in Real Life  So, let's answer the three big previous questions, here:           How to package the project? The answer is: Use Maven standard  functionality  or an equivalent from another Java build framework  with the  Drools libraries specified as a part of the build script  for example pom.xml . In which folder do we save the rules files? The answer is: In the resources  folder of the Java project. Where do we call the rules code? The answer is: We call it from the Java code,  typically the controller class. If you followed the instructions that come with  Appfuse, whenever you click the Submit button on the web browser, the  framework will eventually cause the above rule code to be executed.  Look again at the 'one size architecture fits all' diagram at the start of this chapter.  As promised, the code we have just seen fits right in the middle of the picture, in the  Business Layer of the system.  Summary This chapter has shown you how to deploy your business rules in the real world. We  looked at the pieces that made up an entire web application, and where our rules fit  into it. We saw the various options for deploying rules as a part of our application,  and also the team that's involved in the process. Once deployed, we looked at the  code that will load and run the rules—both home-grown, and those created using the  standard RuleAgent. Finally, we saw how to combine this into a web project using  the framework of your choice.

We've  described what goes in and what comes out, but not what happens 'under the  covers'. In this chapter, we open the box and explain how a rule engine works. We  demonstrate how it is a faster and easier-to-maintain solution than traditional coding  methods. We'll also introduce debugging and other ways of seeing what is going on  inside the rule engine in real time, as it happens.  In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:           Rule engine concepts Logging Rete Debugging rules  Rule engine concepts To understand what we're seeing when we look inside the rule engine, we first  need to understand a couple of rule engine concepts, including a repetition  in more  depth  of something we first covered back in Chapter 1.  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Looking under the Cover  Facts or objects Facts are pretty straightforward. They're the container that we use to transport  information into  and out of  the rule engine. You'll remember that because facts are  standard JavaBeans  we compared them to Lego blocks , a lot of the code already in  your organisation can be used for this purpose. Or, you can write your own—such as  the CustomerOrder and ChocolateShipment. An 'object' is just another term for a fact  it's where the term Object Orientated  Programming or OOP comes from . Earlier, we saw how we can insert, update, and  retract  remove  facts or objects from the rule engine, and how the rules would react  as a result. Or rather, we inserted, updated, and retracted the facts from the Working Memory,  and saw the Agenda and Activations change as a result. All three of these are parts  of the Drools Rule Engine, and are a critical part of what happens 'under the covers'.  Working memory To keep things simple, all of the examples that we've given until now have been  about a 'single user'. That way, we could treat the rule engine and working memory  as almost the same. In real life, the sorts of Enterprise Applications that use rules   will have many people calling rules at the same time. If all of these people shared   the same memory, then things could get pretty confusing.  Imagine if the rules  returned somebody else's bank balance!  The solution is to give everybody their   own workspace, or working memory.  If you're used to working with web servers, you will notice a similar  problem and a similar solution—each user who is interacting with  the server has his or her own unique session, which is isolated from  any other user's session.  We touched upon working memory when we used stateful sessions as a part of the  ruleflow, but working memory is also behind the stateless session. Both stateless and  stateful sessions are types of working memory. In both cases, working memory acts  as a scratchpad, unique to each user, which contains all of the knowledge  facts  that  Drools has been told about the case. When we insert, update, or retract a fact, it's the  working memory that changes. Likewise, when a rule inserts, updates, or retract a  fact, it's the working memory that changes.  Let's repeat it because it's important: Rules change facts in the working memory.  Because of the way that Java works, even though our facts are a part of working  memory, the code that passed in the values still has a 'handle' to them. Thus, it  automatically knows about the changed values.

It is about the business rules  for the chocolate factory. It's far simpler than the Excel-based decision tables that we  used later in the book. In the following table, the first three columns represent the  'when' part of the rule, and the final, fourth column shows the actions to be taken:  Chapter 11  Highlighted are the rules that become available to fire whenever we sell more than  30,000 Chocolate Crunchie bars. This pattern matching  identifying the relevant rules  for any given situation  is a core part of Drools, and something that rule engines do  very well.  In real life we would insert facts to the rule engine  or rather, to working memory ,  telling the rule engine that all those candy bars have been sold. As soon as we did so,  the rule engine would identify the relevant rules via pattern matching. These rules  would become 'active' or ready to fire. So, Activations are rules that are ready to fire, and  Agenda is the list of all of these activations.  Conflict resolution Note that we didn't say Activations 'are rules that fire' but 'rules that are ready to  fire'. Just because there are facts in the working memory that match a rule  that is, a  rule could fire  doesn't mean that the rule will fire. The first question, which might  not be obvious from the chocolate factory sample, is which rule amongst the six  highlighted ones will fire first?  [ 231 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Looking under the Cover  Because  at a simple level  only one rule fires at a time, Drools needs to decide which  of these rules should fire first. To make this decision, let's introduce an idea called  conflict resolution.   Strictly speaking, more than one rule can fire at a time, especially if  you have multiple working memories. Within the working memory,   the Rete algorithm optimises the matching and firing process. matching and firing process.  and firing process.  As soon as the 'when' part of the rule it satisfied, it is added to the Agenda as an  Activation. This creates a list of rules that are available to fire. If there is only one   rule Activation on the agenda, there is no need for conflict resolution—it is fired  straight away. If there are two or more rules, conflict resolution is used to put an  order to the list.  By default, conflict resolution decides the order of priority in the following manner: 1.  Salience: Back in Chapter 5, we came across salience as a rule attribute that  Chapter 5, we came across salience as a rule attribute that   we could add via Guvnor  or the other rule editors . Under this conflict  resolution method, a rule with a higher salience value will be closer to the  top of the agenda, and thus more likely to fire. Remember that salience only  changes the order of rules whose 'if' part matches the current facts. If this  doesn't happen, you can increase the salience if you wish.  2.  Recency: If salience doesn't resolve the rule agenda order, then Drools    looks at Recency, or how many times a rule has fired previously. The more  the rule has fired, the higher it will be on the agenda.  3.  Complexity: A rule with more conditions in the 'when' part will be more  specific, that is, it will be fussier when it fires. On the other hand, when it  does fire, it is likely to be more relevant to the current situation. Therefore,  the more complex rules tend to move toward the top of the agenda.  4.  LoadOrder: If none of the first three strategies work, then the fallback    situation is to use the LoadOrder of the rules—that is, rules that got loaded   first get fired first. Because we can load rules from many different files, we   can implicitly state which blocks of rules are more important than others.  If you need to refresh your memory, look at emory, look at RuleRunner.Java, from the  from the  previous chapter.  Although this is the default conflict resolution strategy, it is possible to change the  methodology employed. There can be good reasons for doing this, but in general, a  well-written set of rules shouldn't need this level of fine-tuning.  [ 232 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Chapter 11  A more dynamic Agenda The order in which rules Activations appear on the Agenda is critical. This is  because only the first rule on the Agenda is guaranteed to fire, even though all of  the other rules on the Agenda match the current set of facts in the working memory.  The other rules may fire in turn, but only if an earlier rule hasn't changed the facts in  the working memory. This means that rules can be dropped from the Agenda before  they get a chance to fire, because there are no longer valid.  Let me explain how housework and chores get done in my home. My wife  gives me a list of tasks to complete—wash the dishes, brush the floor, and  put out the bins. By the time I finish washing the dishes, my wife has lost  patience and has already brushed the floor—so that's no longer on my 'to- do' list. On the other hand, she has now asked me to tidy up the yard and  wash the car, so that gets added to the list. Think of the 'to-do' list as the Drools Agenda and you'll get an idea of the  dynamic addition or removal of 'rules to fire' from the list.  Truth maintenance We change the working memory by inserting and removing facts. Changes in  working memory cause rules to match, get added to the agenda, and fire. Because  rules can also insert, remove, or update the facts in the working memory, a rule  firing can cascade and cause other rules to be added to the agenda and subsequently  fire. These rules, in turn, can cause further rules to become active and fire. What is going on here is the process of truth maintenance. Given a set of facts,  the rule engine applies the appropriate business rules and modifies the facts as  necessary. If the newly-changed facts mean that other business rules come into play,  then they are applied. Eventually, all necessary rules are fired, and the facts stored in  the working memory represent the truth, or at least the truth as understood by our  business rules.   Any change in facts  for example, if a user submits more information about his or her  insurance application  causes new rules to come into play, in an attempt to maintain  the truth.  [ 233 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Looking under the Cover  Truth maintenance is a bit like playing pool  or snooker  because of the   following reasons:  1.  You take a shot, hitting the white cue ball  that is, introduce a new fact to e a shot, hitting the white cue ball  that is, introduce a new fact to    the system .   2.  The rules of physics are applied and the ball rolls across the green baize, and   bounces off the cushions.  It may hit another ball  that is, cause another rule to fire . The rules of physics  are applied again, and now two balls are moving.   3.   4.  These may hit other balls  more facts getting introduced, more rules getting  fired, and more balls getting moved—although slightly more slowly , until  eventually the whole system  all the balls on the table  is still again.  5.  The truth  according to the laws of physics  has been maintained! Or at least,   until another player takes a shot.  player takes a shot.  This 'rules changing facts causing other rules to fire' process can lead to rules getting  caught in a loop. Rule 1 changes a fact, which causes rule 2 to fire, rule 2 changes a  fact, which causes rule 1 to fire, and so on. There are a couple of features in Drools  that help to avoid this. Marking a rule with an attribute of 'no-loop' means the rule  cannot cause itself to fire. In Ruleflow, Agenda groups control the amount of rules  available to fire. Writing the conditions  the 'when' part of the rule  as precisely as  possible also helps to avoid this scenario.  If you're a programmer, truth maintenance is a fundamental difference rogrammer, truth maintenance is a fundamental difference  to any language you may have used before. With those languages, you   the programmer  have to ensure that your code gives the correct results.  With Drools, the rule engine ensures that the result is always consistent  with the business rules that you have given it. e given it.   Back to the future  with chocolate  shipping  We've just looked at a couple of make-believe rules from the chocolate factory.  Wouldn't it be great to see some real rules and use it to see the internals of the rule  engine that we've just talked about? Fortunately, our Chapter 11 example allows  us to do just that  this example is available for download from the same site as the  previous samples, http:  code.google.com p red-piranha  .  [ 234 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Chapter 11  This sample is the same as the chocolate factory that we saw back in Chapter 6, but  with some extra code that makes it easier to see the internal happenings in the rule  engine. The following are the basic rules found in the shipping-rules.drl file:                A rule to confirm  print out  the OoompaLoompa holidays is passed, as a  fact, to the rule engine A rule matches against unfilled customer orders, and starts sending out  shipments of 210 units at a time A rule adds an estimated date to these new shipments of chocolate A rule adjusts this shipment date if it falls on a day that the OoompaLoompas  take as a holiday A rule ensures that we don't overshoot on the last shipment, adjusting it so  that only the remaining balance is sent t only the remaining balance is sent  Running the Chapter 11 example is similar to before. Open EventRulesExample. java, right-click anywhere in the file, and select context menu that appears.    right-click anywhere in the file, and select Run As  Java Application from the   The sample comes with an Eclipse project, so you should be able to  open it with File  New Project, and then select the folder to which you  unzipped the sample.

Open a  command window  Dos Prompt  at the folder containing the project  the  one containing pom.xml . After executing the command mvn eclipse: clean eclipse:eclipse, refresh or reopen the project in Eclipse, and  everything should be set up correctly.   After running the sample, you should get output similar to the following in the  Console window as before, ending the schedule that we have calculated.

The output above, showing the shipment amounts, is a good example of this. Mostly,  this is our own logging statement. Although we can add logging statements that get  output when the rules fire, until now we've treated the decisions by the rule engine  about which rule to fire as taking place in a 'black box'. Wouldn't it be great to look  inside and see which rules are getting fired, and why?  The main difference between the example in this chapter and the one in Chapter 6  is that the code in RuleRunner.Java has been modified to display what is going on  internally in the rule engine. The main lines that have been added to this file are:     create a new Working Memory Logger, that logs to file. WorkingMemoryFileLogger wmLogger = new                              WorkingMemoryFileLogger workingMemory ;     Set the log file that we will be using wmLogger.setFileName "event-log" ;            ….              Fire using the facts workingMemory.execute facts ;    stop logging wmLogger.writeToDisk  ;  It's not a big change. The snippet above has only four lines of code, of which   workingMemory.execute , we're familiar with one already. What happens is:             We create a new WorkingMemoryFileLogger, passing in a handle to the  working memory that we want to log We set the name of the log file in which the information will be written  in  this case event-log  We fire the rules as normal, using workingMemory.execute When the rules have fired, we write the log to disk using   wmLogger.writeToDisk  In real life the log file can become very large, so be careful to disable the logging of  production systems. At the simplest level, this means commenting out the above  code  by placing '  ' in front of it .   [ 236 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Looking at the working memory log Assuming that you ran the sample in the previous section, you'll already have the  event-log.log file generated. This file should sit at the root of the project  just  under the chap11-sample folder in Eclipse, next to the pom.xml file .   Chapter 11  Eclipse doesn't display changes to files by default, so you may need to  refresh the project to see the changes. To refresh your project in Eclipse,  select the project name, then press the F5 key or choose File  Refresh  from the main menu.  If we open this file, we'll see something similar to the following text:                     Chocolate Shipment [1]         Chocolate Shipment         $CustomerOrder=Initial Chocolate Order:2000  itemsStillToShip:2000 shipments:none-listed 1          4                     1         Initial Chocolate Order:2000  itemsStillToShip:2000 shipments:none-listed         1                     confirm holidays [2]         confirm holidays         $holiday=17 03 2009 2          4               [ 237 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Looking under the Cover  Drools Audit Log Viewer Not very readable, is it? To understand what the working memory log is showing,  we need to use the Drools Audit Log View.  To open this view in Eclipse, select Window  Show View  Other   Drools  Folder  Audit View from the toolbar. You should see an empty version of the above  window. The window is empty as we haven't told the viewer where our working  memory log file is. See those icons at the top right of the Audit View window? Click on the file icon  it's  the highlighted one on the left, looking like a piece of paper  and choose the audit log  that we opened earlier.  Now the window looks a bit more like the Audit View in the diagram above. But  what does it actually mean? Working through the list, you'll see that the first item  in the log is where the initial chocolate order is inserted into memory. The icon is a  green square.  Because the rules start firing as soon as the facts are inserted,  before the second fact  is inserted  an Activation is immediately created for the Chocolate Shipment rule.  The icon is a right-facing arrow.  [ 238 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   The third line in the log is the second object being inserted  one of the  OompaLoompa dates passed in as a holiday , causing another activation to be  created for the rule confirm holidays.  A couple of lines later, we see the first rule—the one that confirms holidays—actually  being executed. The icon is a blue diamond.  Chapter 11  In total, there are three activation executions in this part of the log. Note that the  executions are not in the order in which they were created, but in the order that  Drools deems fit when it resolves the conflicts. As the third rule is the chocolate  shipment rule,  we immediately see an object update in the log. The icon for an  object update is a yellow square.  The line immediately following this in the log is a new rule Activation created  as a  result of this object being created . The line immediately after that is interesting—it  is another object insertion  we've seen those before . Because the object  a shipment   has been created or inserted by a rule  the chocolate shipment rule , with an rule , with an  existing object being changed, the following line has a new Activation created   shipment rule .   Even in this simple example, there are a couple of hundred lines, so we'll skip  them and move on. Before we do this, it's a good time to mention the show cause  functionality in the Audit View. To activate it, right-click on the log and select Show  Cause from the context menu.   For this example, we clicked on the Object updated  4  and the action that caused it  is highlighted. As it happens, what caused the update was the action in the previous  screenshot  that is, the object that had just been inserted by the rule .  [ 239 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Looking under the Cover  The previous section talked about conflict resolution when there are more than  two rules on the Agenda available to fire. Near the very end of the audit log is an  example of this happening.  The conflict happens where the two right arrows  that is, rules that are on the  Agenda  fire one after the other. The rules are Add Next Available Shipment Date  and Don't ship more than the customer order. Obviously, this conflict is resolved as one of these rules is activated and fired in the  next line: the Don't ship more than the customer order rule. This section also shows  an Activation cancellation—the second line from the bottom of the screenshot. The  icon for a cancellation is a left-facing arrow.  There is another icon, not shown in the above samples, when an object or fact is  removed from the working memory. The icon for fact removal is a red square.  Other icons not shown in this diagram, but which might appear in your audit log, are:       Drools logo icon: Rule or rule package added or removed Process icon: Ruleflow started or ended, or Ruleflow group activated   or deactivated  Rete algorithm The Rete algorithm is at the heart of the events that we just saw in the audit log. The  one-line explanation of Rete is:  Rete makes rules run incredibly fast by sorting the rules in such a way that when  facts change, the rule engine knows instantly which rules need to fire.  [ 240 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Chapter 11  The Rete algorithm is a bit like the algorithm used by Google for searching the entire  Web. You don't need to know how it works to use it, but it's nice to have a vague  idea. If you want to know more than the overview here, there are hundreds of pages  on the Web, including Dr Charles Forgy 1974 to 1979 original papers, where he first  outlined Rete—just do a Google search for Charles Forgy Rete Algorithm.  If I was to write a rule engine, and didn't know about Rete, I would do it incredibly  badly. I would probably write a series of loops checking each part of my business  rules every single time a fact might have changed, including every time a rule fires.  For example, the shipping rules have 5 rules, with 3 facts, each holding about 4 values.  In my loop  which I would have to run every time something changed  that would be  60 values  5x3x4 = 60  that I need to check after every single change. That's 60 values  checked hundreds or thousands of times, over the life of a simple application.  That's not going to scale very well—a medium-sized sample would have 100 rules,  with 20 facts in total, holding about 4 values each. This becomes 8000 items to be  checked, and checked repeatedly. Even if we check 2000 items a second, it comes to a  4-second delay each and every time something changes, which can be very frequent  in an enterprise application.  Don't laugh at this description. If you've written any code, you've  probably made the same mistake yourself  I have . Think of the hundreds of 'if…then' statements that you have scattered  throughout your code, and imagine them gathered together in one  place, often getting called more than once. Sounds a bit more like the  example above? That  along with other optimisations  is why rule  engines are often more efficient than the equivalent 'traditional' code.  It's just as well that I don't write rule engines. Let's try again.  Mostly, the checking of facts is slow because there are duplications in the checks. For  example, if both rules use a common shipment date, the same fact will get checked  twice for changes. What if we spent a bit of time grouping the rules so that one check  will do everything for both rules?  [ 241 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Looking under the Cover  Rete in action One example of this grouping is shown in the following screenshot, from the Drools  IDE. It shows the shipping rules from our example, but displayed as a Rete Tree. To  view this yourself, open the Shipping-rules.drl file as normal. Using the tabs at  the bottom of Rete View, click on Rete Tree.  While this looks complicated, the concepts are simple. Drools  the white node at the  top  has analyzed the 'when' part of the five shipping rules, and picked out the facts   the three red nodes on the second line , and the fields on those facts  the four blue  nodes, most of the third line . These are then connected via the green and yellow nodes  on the third and fourth line,  used to cache the previous values to further reduce the  amount of checks that we need  to the black nodes  the rules that can fire  at the very  bottom of the diagram.  Remember that when we were running our previous examples, there  was a noticeable pause before the rules fired. This was the time taken to  construct the Rete network from the rules. It's a trade off—a slight pause  at the start, compensated for by by a greatly-increased performance later.  [ 242 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   To analyze which rule needs to fire, all that Drools has to do is to start at the top  node and, depending on what has changed, walk down the tree until it gets to the  black node  representing the 'when' part of the rule  to fire. That's the hard bit done.  Firing the rule once it's been decided is more or less standard Java.  Chapter 11  To find out more information on each node, click on it in the Rete Tree  View. If you have the property view open in Eclipse  from the toolbar,  select Window  Show view  Properties , you'll see the name of the  fact field rule displayed.  To give an example of this 'walking the Rete tree', imagine that a shipment date  changes on one of the shipments. The path that Drools will follow is shown below.  From these five nodes, one is standard Drools  the one at the top , and the next two  are 'real' checks on the fact and field respectively. The fourth node is an internal  connector. The final node is the actual rule that will fire.  In this example, when the shipment date changes, instead of the of the 60+ checks  previously required, now only two checks need to be done  in the second and   third nodes .   Two checks are obviously faster than 60  or 8000 in the larger sample , especially if  they are repeated 100 times. The actual Rete algorithm is much more sophisticated   and faster  than we describe. Drools has further optimizations that make the process  faster still—it's easy to optimise business rules when they are written in standard  'when…then' format.  [ 243 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Looking under the Cover  Debugging rules  Now that we understand how a rule engine works, let's take a peek at its internals, in  real time.  This book has shown you how to print logging statements to the console to see what  is going on in your rules. It has also shown you how to use the working memory  logger to show you what is happening within the rule engine. But these methods are  'after the fact'—the rules have completed and we are trying to reconstruct what has  happened, long after the program has finished. What if we want to see rules firing  and values changing as they happen?  What we need is debugging. Debugging is like pausing a movie on a DVD player.  Normally, we would run our program  movie  from end-to-end using the play  run   button. If we don't like the movie  program  we can halt it by clicking on the stop  button  or pressing Ctrl+C . If we need to take a break we can pause it, and maybe  change a few of the movie options such as to view it in widescreen, or to switch the  director's commentary on or off, and so on.  If you've already debugged Java programs, you'll recognise the above description. The  tools we're about to describe are very familiar. But how we do start to debug the rules?  Normally, we can only debug rules when running them through the Eclipse IDE. To  start debugging, we need to do the following two things:  1.  We need to tell the Drools IDE that we want to run the rules in a debug  tell the Drools IDE that we want to run the rules in a debug   mode, and not just run straight through  which is how we've run our  examples up to this point .  2.  We need to tell Drools where to 'pause'. Although it is possible to debug right  from the start of the program, telling Drools to run until it hits a 'breakpoint' the program, telling Drools to run until it hits a 'breakpoint' breakpoint''  saves us from trawling through hundreds, or thousands, of lines of code to  get to the bit that we're interested in.   When the debugger hits the breakpoint in our code, it will pause the program and  allow us to see a snapshot of the frozen program. When we're ready, we can continue  the program, or step through it one line at a time.  Debugging rules in the Eclipse IDE If you have the rules project for Chapter 11 already open in Eclipse, then we're  almost ready to start debugging. We'll first set the breakpoints—where we want the  debugger to pause:  [ 244 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Chapter 11  1.  Make sure that the project has Drools Nature enabled. To do this, right-click   on the project name, and then select Convert to Drools Project from the  context menu. This command will only switch on Drools. So if you're not sure,  it does no harm to do this again.  2.  Open the rules file  ShippingRules.drl  as normal and go to where we   want the debugger to pause.   3.  Select the line where we want to place the breakpoint.  In our sample, scroll   4.   down to the second-to-last line of the Chocolate shipment rule.  In the lefthand margin of the editor, right-click and select the command   Toggle breakpoint from the context menu.  The screen should now look like the following screenshot  with the new breakpoint  circled in red .  Using this technique, we can also set breakpoints in Java code—for  example, at more or less any line after the main[] method in  EventRulesExample.java. This is the method of debugging that  programmers reading this book will be familiar with.  If you try clicking elsewhere in the rules file, you'll notice that you can only add  breakpoints in the consequence  then  portion of the rules. This is because of the way that  the Rete algorithm works—effectively, the 'when' parts of the rules are shared at  run-time. Even if we could set a breakpoint in the 'when' part, the Drools IDE would  have no way of knowing which of the shared rules we wished to examine.

This is almost, but not quite, the same as running the  application normally.  1.  Open the start point of the application  EventRulesExample.java .  2.  Start debugging by right-clicking and selecting    Debug as  Drools Application from the context menu.  The program will now start running  much more slowly!  in debug mode. It is  important to debug the program as a Drools Application  and not a standard debug  application , otherwise the breakpoints that you set in the rules will not be noticed  and the program will continue  slowly!  right until the very end.  A typical program will run five to ten times slower while debugging  because of the additional checks  such as 'Do I need to stop now?'   that need constantly to be made.   Rules debug perspective When you started debugging, you may have been asked the question Debug  perspective is normally associated with this action—do you wish to switch to it  now? Click on Yes, and Eclipse will look like the example shown in the following  screenshot. You can always switch later, manually, by selecting the Eclipse Toolbar  and going to Window  Open Perspective  Other  Debug.  Both actions leave a button on the toolbar  top right of the picture  to make switching  perspectives easier the next time.

Perspectives are just bundles of views that are  displayed whenever we carry out a specific activity. Previously,  although we didn't  know it  we were using the editing perspective. Now that we're debugging, it's  useful to see our project from a different angle. The normal perspective is great for  editing or writing files. The debug perspective  that we're looking at now  is great for  debugging projects.  [ 247 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Looking under the Cover  At first, the debug perspective looks very different from the one that we are used to.  However, if we look at the screen from the bottom up, we'll see that two-thirds of the  bottom screen looks familiar. It contains the following:           The Console  the bottom panel : Like before, this shows text that has been  output from the program The Editor  the middle left panel : This is for editing the Shipping-Rules.drl  file, with the current line  where the program is paused  highlighted The Outline  the middle right panel : This shows an outline of the rules  within the current file  The top two panels are new to this view. On the top left is the debug view  as shown  in the screenshot below . For the moment, ignore the video type controls at the top of  the panel, and look at the main panel instead. This main panel shows the stack trace.  When we start a program, our main method calls another method, which in turn  calls another method until the breakpoint that we set is reached  and the program  pauses . It's a bit like those Russian dolls—one method call fits inside another, and  that call that fits inside another, and so on.  We read the stack trace from the bottom up. In this case it is an EventRulesExample,  called the RuleRunner, which called various Drools files  Retoo, Default Agenda, and  so on , which in turn called our rules  Rule_Chocolate_Shipment_0.consequence .  At the top of the debug panel is a DVD-like control panel, which allows you to stop,  start, and step through the program one line at a time  a bit like the 'forward by one  frame' feature on most DVD players. The main icons or buttons are as follows:  [ 248 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Chapter 11             Resume  the green arrow  — continue until next breakpoint is reached, or the  code ends Pause  greyed out : Pause the code that is running before it hits the   next breakpoint Terminate  the red button : Stop the debug session. Arrows: Allow you to step through the code one line at a time de one line at a time  The other new panel is the Variables view, which is on the top right of the debug  perspective  as shown in the screenshot above . This shows the variables  value  placeholders  in our rules. More precisely, it shows only the variables that the  current rule  highlighted in the editing window  has access to.   The variable view gives us a window into the program in real time. If we step  through the rules line by line, we can see the values being updated step by step.  The format of the screen is a 'treeview', that is, there are three top-level variables   as used by this rule —$CustomerOrder, a handle to the logger, and an individual  chocolate shipment that is the process of being created by the current rule. The panel  at the very bottom shows more detail on the currently-highlighted value    the chocolate shipment .  [ 249 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Looking under the Cover  The three JavaBeans highlighted in the above variable view are as follows:  1.  Customer Order: The same fact that was inserted by the Java code and   updated by the rules. Remember that it contains the current and the initial  balance, and a list  array  of all of the shipments as the rules create them. In  the current snapshot there are two shipments that are already populated in  the list  elements [0] and [1] . Each of these elements is a ChocolateShipment  JavaBean  containing the shipment amount . Because this snapshot is taken  before the set shipment date has had a chance to fire, the shipment date is  null or empty. log: This is a global variable, as passed in when we called the rule. It is  displayed in this view. Even through it is a global variable, it is passed in to  the rule.  2.   3.  ChocolateShipment: This is the same JavaBean that we are in the process of  creating in this rule.  That is, it is the same chocolate shipment that has been  added to the list at position number [1].  Given that it's 'work in progress',  the shipmentDate is null  empty .  Behind the variable view is a tab Breakpoint. This shows all of the sets  in the rules and Java code. It is far easier to find them here than having  to search through multiple files.  Other Drools views while debugging There are other views available to help you while debugging. All of these can be  added to the current view using the following option from the toolbar: Window   Show View  Other  Drools:           Working memory: A live snapshot of the working memory, similar to the  variables view above Agenda View: A list of the rules that are available to fire  and the order  in  real time, as you step through the rules Rules: A list of the rules that have been loaded  [ 250 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Chapter 11  When to log, when to test, and when to debug Debugging, testing, and logging are all useful tools to help you understand what  is going on with your rules. But when it is best to use each of these tools can be  explained as follows:           Logging is used the most. This is especially true when using a toolkit such . This is especially true when using a toolkit such  as Log4j or Apache Commons, where it can be turned on and off via a  configuration file with little or no perceptible impact on performance.  Writing a test is proactive, and will catch errors before the users do. It also  has the advantage that once it is written it goes on working, and keeps  checking for a recurrence of the problem, and alerts you if required. Debug is the most powerful feature. However, once you've solved the  problem, most of the effort is lost; and if a similar problem happens in the lost; and if a similar problem happens in the  future, you're likely to have to start again from the beginning.  Summary This chapter opened up the internals of the Drools rule engine so that we can  understand concepts such as truth maintenance, conflict resolution, pattern  matching, and the rules Agenda. We explored the Rete algorithm, and why it makes  rules run faster than most comparable business logic. Finally, we saw the working  memory audit log and the rules debug capabilities of the Drools IDE. The next  chapter uses this power and knowledge to take advantage of some of the more  advanced features.

We wrote  rules using the Guvnor web editor and the more sophisticated JBoss IDE, before  testing those rules using a variety of tools. We used Excel to hold both rules and  data, and wrote our own DSL and rule flows. Not only that, we also looked under  the covers to see some rule engine internals and understand how we would go about  deploying rules in real life.  This chapter is a bit different from the earlier chapters. It is a level up from the  introductory chapters as it presents additional information about the topics already  covered in those chapters. A lot of information comes from the latest version of  Drools. Although these features are stable and can be used in production systems,  they may undergo substantial enhancements by the time you read this.  We will cover the new features of Guvnor. They include a new more powerful  API for calling the rule engine from Java, the ability to load data, create Java  Beans dynamically, Complex Event Processing  CEP , and Drools Solver. We also  explain some more under-the-cover features such as backward forward chaining,  controlling conflict resolution, and Rule Engine Standards  JSR-94 .  Let's start with Drools Fusion—Complex Events Processing.  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Advanced Drools Features  Pigeons, Drools, and Complex   Event Processing Pigeons  the birds that flock around city squares and parks  aren't known for  being clever. So it may strike as strange that they appear in a book about business  intelligence. However, during the Cold War, the Soviets  allegedly  trained pigeons  to inspect ball-bearings on the production line. The pigeons would sit in comfortable  little boxes while the shiny silver ball-bearings steamed past on a conveyor belt.  If the pigeon spotted any that were defective, they would peck a button and the  broken bearing would be gone. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, all of the pigeons  have been gainfully re-employed at Google  http:  www.google.com technology  pigeonrank.html .   Thankfully, the pigeons didn't go to work at a bank in the city.  Have you ever seen  anything with feathers drive a Ferrari?  Although the pigeons would be very good  at responding to simple market events  if market is up then sell, and if market down  then buy , more complex analysis escapes them. For example, consider a situation  where the market is down for 30 minutes. The shares in Acme corp are down by  more than 10% than the average. But if you see three buy orders for that share in the  last 60 seconds, then you may think that the market is about to turn, and hence buy  shares in Acme corp.   Never mind the pigeons. Even most humans would find that difficult—think about  trying to read the stock ticker prices  the ones you see rolling across the screen at  MSNBC  for all stocks, while trying to hold the buy and sell information for the last  30 minutes in your head. And do that not only for one, but for a hundred different  types of shares in the market. You have to do this while keeping an eye on your  own trading position so that you're not exposed to one sector of the market  for  example, keeping enough cash, and not too many property or technology shares . No  wonder most traders make their millions and burn out before they're 30—that sort of  Complex Event Processing  CEP  will wear you out.  Most IT applications are like pigeons; they can only handle simple events. Press the  button. Do something. The way to make millions is to design applications that can  handle these complex events, and apply sophisticated business rules to the  evolving   situation. You have to do it quickly enough  milliseconds  to seize the opportunity  before somebody else does, and keep on doing it as long as the market is open.  CEP is what Drools Fusion provides.  [ 254 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Chapter 12  Implementing Complex Event Processing  using Fusion There are a lot of 'under the cover' changes to the latest version of Drools. These  allow it to handle the volume of events that happen  often all at once  during CEP.  However, from the end user point of view using CEP is strangely familiar to:  1.  Writing facts  Java Objects . 2.  Writing rules—same as before. 3.  Notifying Drools of events  in the same way as we asserted facts  previously—facts and events are interchangeable in many ways .  The third step is similar to asserting the facts, which we've done before. The  difference is that events will be in greater number  especially in a stock market  trading system  than the facts. And there will  potentially  be no limit to the amount  of events that can happen, while we will tend to have a good idea of the number of  facts that we will encounter. Fortunately, the upgrades to Drools during the latest  version are specifically intended to handle large volumes of multiple events.  Although we can manually assert the events into working memory, one optimization  for complex event handling is to set the working memory to listen to a stream, and  automatically pipe the event from one to the other. Even with this shortcut, our  solution using CEP will involve the following three files:  1.  The Java file describing the event object being used: It is a simple JavaBean,   which is the same as the facts in the previous examples  that is, the facts  could be used as events if desired .  2.  The Rule file: It imports rules and other assets  as before , declares the events   used in the rules, and connects them to any event streams that the rules   listen to.  3.  The Java code in the application: It loads the rules, either inserts the events or   links it to the stream specified, fires the rules and then does something with  the results.  [ 255 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Advanced Drools Features  We'll work through this based on a sample from the Drools code, StreamsTest. java. This is a unit test, but shows how CEP works in practice. We'll start with the  JavaBean file.  public class StockTick {  private int tradeNumber; private String stockName; private int price; private long currentTimeMillis;  public StockTick int tradeNumber, String stockName, int price, long  currentTimeMillis  {                        } public int getTradeNumber   {    this.tradeNumber=tradeNumber; this.stockName = stockName; this.price = price; this.currentTimeMillis = currentTimeMillis;  return tradeNumber; }  public String getStockName   {    return stockName;}  public int getPrice   {    return price;}  public long getCurrentTimeMillis   {    return currentTimeMillis;  }                               }  Note that this class is immutable—once it's created it cannot be changed. In real   life, events once occurred can't be altered, so the reasoning behind this feature   is understandable.  This 'immutability' is implanted in two parts in the code above: The first part is  that values that can only be set when the JavaBean is created  the line starting with  public StockTick int tradeNumber, String stockName, int price, long  currentTimeMillis  . The second is that there is no 'set' method on the JavaBean,  but there are methods beginning with 'get' to read the values. There is no chance to  change an event that has already happened.  [ 256 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   The second file is the rules file, an example of which is given as follows:  Chapter 12  package org.drools;  import org.drools.StockTick;  global java.util.List results;  declare StockTick     @role  event   end  rule "Test entry point" when     $st : StockTick  company == "ACME", price > 10   from entry-point  StockStream then     results.add  $st  ; end  This rules file has the usual package, import, and global statement. The three lines  beginning with declare StockTick are new. They take the StockTick JavaBean we  declared in the previous file, and let the rule engine know that we want to treat it as  an event.  The rule matches all the events from the external stream where that event concerns  the ACME stock, and where the price is greater than 10. When fired, the then part  adds it to a results list—declared as a global variable at the top of the rules file.  The second new part in the rule file is in the when part of the rule beginning with  from entry-point StockStream. We have met the from keyword before. It allows  us to reach outside the rules' working memory  for example, to values in a database  using the Hibernate framework  and allow those values to trigger rules. In this case,  the source of those values is an event stream called StockStream. The code that calls  the rule engine will supply this stream.  An extract of the application code with the complete file is available at   http:  anonsvn.labs.jboss.com labs jbossrules  trunk drools-compiler  src test java org drools integrationtests StreamsTest.java. Most of  what has been removed is package and import statements  most of the Drools classes  referred to can be found in the org.drools package, or subpackages under it, from  the Drools core library . The code is in the form of a unit test, that is, it has assert  statements to check the results of the rules; these statements have also been removed  in the interest of clarity.  [ 257 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Advanced Drools Features  The first method loads the rules base using the new Drools API  we will talk more  about this API shortly . It searches the classpath for a given file name, loads it as a  rule file, and then returns Drools Knowledgebase based on that rule file.  private KnowledgeBase loadKnowledgeBase final String fileName    throws IOException, DroolsParserException                                                           {    KnowledgeBuilder kbuilder =                             KnowledgeBuilderFactory.newKnowledgeBuilder  ;  kbuilder.add   ResourceFactory. newClassPathResource fileName,getClass   ,ResourceType.DRL ;  KnowledgeBase kbase = KnowledgeBaseFactory.newKnowledgeBase  ;       kbase.addKnowledgePackages  kbuilder.getKnowledgePackages    ;  return kbase; }  The second important method in the file is the one that uses these rules to 'do  something'. It's called testEventAssertion  . You may remember from Chapter  7 that unit tests such as this will have every method starting with 'test', and will  be called by the framework. In real life, this method would most likely be called  something similar to 'call rules', but the contents of the method will be similar.   public void testEventAssertion   throws Exception {    read in the source using the method explained previously    and the rules file  drl  we featured earlier KnowledgeBase kbase = loadKnowledgeBase  "test_EntryPoint.drl"  ;  KnowledgeSessionConfiguration conf = new SessionConfiguration  ;           SessionConfiguration  conf          .setClockType  ClockType.PSEUDO_CLOCK  ;  StatefulKnowledgeSession session = kbase.newStatefulSession  conf  ;  final List results = new ArrayList  ;  session.setGlobal  "results", results  ;     StockTick tick1 = new StockTick   1, "DROO", 50, System.currentTimeMillis    ;               StockTick tick2 = new StockTick                       2, "ACME", 10, System.currentTimeMillis    ;  StockTick tick3 = new StockTick                    3, "ACME", 10, System.currentTimeMillis    ;  StockTick tick4 = new StockTick                     4, "DROO", 50, System.currentTimeMillis    ;  [ 258 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   …… WorkingMemoryEntryPoint entry =             session.getWorkingMemoryEntryPoint  "StockStream"  ;  Chapter 12  entry.insert  tick1  ;             ……    session.fireAllRules  ; }  In this artificial sample we create the four events ourselves, and then  stop them. In real life, there would be another application constantly  passing us events over a longer period. These events can be passed by  another Java thread, a web service, or passed over a network connection.   Several important things are going on in this method:  1.  The rules  that we saw earlier  are loaded into a Drools knowledgebase   object using the helper method which we have just reviewed.  2.  We create configuration settings. Since this is a test, here we want to use  a clock that we have more control over, rather than one that is tied to an  internal system clock. This is important in situations  such as testing, where  you have multiple rule servers, or you need to 'replay' events later  where  you cannot guarantee that the time will be exactly as you expect. A pseudo  clock gives us control over this situation.  3.  Using this configuration, a StatefulKnowledgeSession is created—similar   in concept to the stateful session that we met earlier. A global variable   results  is passed to this session.  4.  Next, four events  of type StockTick  are created. Each time we create a   StockTick, we must pass the stock tick number, the stock name, the price,  and the current system time.  5.  We get a handle to the StockStream from the recently created   StatefulKnowledgeSession, using the   getWorkingMemoryEntryPoint   method.  6.  Using the handle to the StockStream, we pass in the StockTick events.   Passing in the StockTick events is exactly the same as passing in facts to the  working memory. The advantage of using the stream method is its speed, as  only rules that listen to events will inspect the newly inserted objects.  7.  When we've inserted all of the objects, we allow the rules to fire by calling   session.fireAllRules again. Once the rules have finished firing, the  objects  such as the global variable results that we passed in earlier  are  updated and become available for use in the rest of the Java code.  [ 259 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Advanced Drools Features  If this unit test runs correctly, only one event will match the rule and cause one line  to be added to the results list.  If you look at the test on the web site, you'll see that the actual line for  inserting events contains a reference to an item called a facthandle.  It is a simple handle to the object after we pass it to the rule engine. It's  useful for testing  and other advanced situations , but does not change  the meaning of the line from the one described on the previous page.  This simple example only hints at the power of complex event processing. For  example, instead of fireAllRules used in the example, we could have called  fireUntilHalt. This is more suitable for situations  such as events  where we  neither know the number of objects or events that may come our way, nor the  timescale in which they will be made available to us. FireUntilHalt is more  suitable for these situations. Typically, there would be two threads to your program   that is, the computer is doing two things at one time . One thread is similar to  the code in the example above, and calls fireUntilHalt. The other is listening  for events and adding them to the working memory. At a time of our choice  for  example, we choose to stop trading on the stock market  we call halt   and the  rules will no longer fire, even if the events continue to happen.  More powerful events The events syntax in the previous sample is fairly simple. Primitive events are those  events in which there is no restriction of duration, no need for two events to occur in  or out of sequence, or to occur within a particular time window. To add these kind  of complex restrictions to the when part of the rule, you can use coincides, before,  after, meets, overlaps, during, starts, and finishes as special Drools keywords.  They can help in filtering your rules. The following is an example:  when     $st : StockTick  company == "ACME", starts > '01 01 2009'         from entry-point StockStream  There is also the option for sliding time windows. For example, to match all events in  the last 60 seconds, the syntax has to do the following:  StockTick    over window:time  60    This will match all of the StockTick events that happened in the last 60 seconds.  A detailed list of the syntax is available in test_CEP_TimeRelationalOperators. drl file at http:  anonsvn.labs.jboss.com labs jbossrules trunk drools- compiler src test resources org drools integrationtests test_CEP_ TimeRelationalOperators.drl.

Although  writing this JavaBean is relatively straightforward, it still involves writing code in  Java. As we saw, this is nothing to be scared of, but it is something you hardly want  to do while writing your rules.  The latest version of Drools can help you with this problem. It allows you to declare  beans within your rule files, and use those beans exactly as we did in other samples.  Declaring an inline bean is fairly straightforward.  global …  declare SomeJavaBeanName     javaBeanId : long     name : String     quantity : Integer     price : double end  rule …  declare SomeJavaBeanName     @role  event       javaBeanId : long …  In this extract we declare the SomeJavaBeanName bean with fields of javaBeanId   number, long , name  string or text , quantity  number, integer , price  number,  double . The field types  String, double, and so on  are the same types used in the  real JavaBeans.  Inline beans are ideal for event handling, especially where the event is coming from  an external source. In this case, we change the above bean definition to include @ role  event   as follows:  Loading data when your beans don't   exist—Smooks Declaring the bean inline is great for editing, but how does the rest of the system  know the structure of the bean? If no JavaBean exists in a .java file, then Enterprise  Java has no way of knowing what information it can pass in or out, the names of  these fields, and the type  for example, text or numbers  of these fields.

This means that we know the format the data will  be provided in, so that we can concentrate on the data rather than the format. In  real life, we need to deal with other formats such as XML  a stricter form of HTML  that makes up web pages, useful for data transportation , CSV  Comma Separated  Values —the most basic Excel format, and other proprietary formats. That's where  the Smooks framework comes in.  If Smooks can handle data from Excel, then why use the method  suggested back in Chapter 8? The answer is that Smooks is better at  handling data. But given that it uses CSV instead of Excel files directly,   it's not so good at keeping the format of the Excel file.  Smooks is an open source Java framework that exists independently of Drools.  Smooks is a Java Framework Engine for processing XML and non-XML data  CSV, Java Framework Engine for processing XML and non-XML data  CSV,  EDI, Java, JSON, and so on . You'll need to add the Smooks library to your project in  order to use the functionality it provides.  To put it simply, Smooks loads the Excel  CSV , XML, or any other file and generates  the events declared as inline beans in the rule file. It maps everything from the  source file to the inline bean using the configuration that you provide in smooks- config.xml. Once the data is loaded as an inline bean, it is asserted into the working  memory. Then the rules that we have written have a chance to fire. The Java code  to do this is standard Drools, with one line telling Drools to use Smooks to load the  incoming data.       Load the rules into a rulebase and get a session as before PackageBuilder packageBuild = new PackageBuilder  ;  packageBuild.addPackageFromDrl  new InputStreamReader  getClass  . getResourceAsStream  "myRuleFile.drl"     ;  RuleBase ruleBase = RuleBaseFactory.newRuleBase  ;  ruleBase.addPackage  packageBuild.getPackage    ;  StatefulSession session = ruleBase.newStatefulSession  ;     Load Smooks using the Config file  Smooks smooks = new Smooks  "smooks-config.xml"  ;                     Tell Drools-Smooks the point in our file that we want to start  loading data. DroolsSmooksConfiguration conf = new DroolsSmooksConfiguration  "  someJavaBeanName ", null  ;    Prepare a  Stateless  Session using the Smooks and Drools conf DroolsSmooksStatelessSession smooksSession = new  DroolsSmooksStatelessSession  session, smooks, conf  ;   Get a handle to the data file javax.xml.transform.Source xmlSource = new StreamSource  getClass  .

Thus, they get a handle to the result.  Mostly what we want to do is map the incoming XML  or other format  directly to  the inline bean that we created in the rule file. In the following XML extract most of  the names correspond directly to the names in our inline bean:         123       Onions       72       1.2     The smooks-config.xml configuration file to do this mapping can be quite  sophisticated.

From pigeons to biscuits—Drools Solver  for your local supermarket Stock market trading might appear to be a little exotic. How about another trading  problem that is causing the manager of your local supermarket to scratch his or   her head?  Supermarkets, no matter how big they are, have a limited amount of shelf space.  Obviously, supermarkets want to make as much money as possible. So, they want  to stock the most profitable products on their shelves. However, even if chocolate  bars are the most profitable line, a supermarket full of nothing but chocolate bars  isn't going to make many sales. Even the most ardent chocolate fans are going to  need things such as milk, bread, and cheese. So what mix of products will make the  supermarket the most money?  Supermarkets have detailed information on the amount of sales in each of their  stores—those barcode scanners do more than just give you your bill. They track each  and every item sold in the shop. The barcode information also includes the most  basic list of must-have items of the customers. The supermarket knows how much  shelf space it has in any particular store and also the profit margin on each product.  But this information doesn't tell the store manager how much money the store could  potentially make if they had a different mix of goods on the shelves.  [ 263 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Advanced Drools Features  Part of the problem in answering the question about the best mix of products is that  there are many potential factors involved—there are 100,000 products in a typical  supermarket, and there are about 1,000 different ways of displaying them  top shelf,  end shelf, back of store, next to the milk  in different combinations.  Does beer really  sell well if it is placed next to the baby nappies as the urban legend has it?   In classic mathematical or computing terms, this is similar to the 'travelling  salesman' problem, where it is technically possible to calculate the answer. Even with  computers more powerful than they are today, it would take you about 100 years to  get an answer; and another 100 years to calculate it all over again if another type of  beer is released in the market.  Once you tell this to the supermarket manager, you realize that  s he would be  happy even if you found a slightly better way of placing the products than the  current situation. It may not be the best solution, but it's good enough to get him his  bonus. And good enough solutions are something that Drools Solver can help with.   How Drools Solver works At a very simplistic level, the way Drools Solver works is as follows:  1.  One correct solution is supplied at the start—the current mix of products on   the supermarket shelves.  2.  Alternative solutions are generated either randomly or via an algorithm that   is most likely to provide usable results. Impossible solutions  for example, milk not being stored in refrigerators  are  discarded. These hard constraints are expressed as rules.  3.   4.  The remaining solutions are scored using business rules. The scoring  or soft   constraints  is also expressed as rules.  5.  The best available solution is used when we loop back to step 1.  This process repeats until either a certain time period has elapsed, or until Drools  Solver cannot find a better solution.  The Solver could have been written without using business rules, but the addition of  Drools makes it so much better.        Clear rules: What combinations are allowed, and how we score alternatives is  clearly stated. Scalable rules: The Drools Rete Algorithm means that adding additional rules  will only add milliseconds to the time required, and will not double the time  needed  as per traditional solutions . This is especially important when the  calculations are run repeatedly  as happens within the Solver .  [ 264 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Chapter 12     Optimized calculations: Drools detects the change from a previous to new  scenario, and can carry out only those calculations required. That is, it does  not need to recalculate everything from scratch.  Implementing a Solver A full Solver solution is provided as part of the Drools examples on the download  site  on which the solution below is based . Implementing the five steps given above  is relatively straightforward.  Steps 1 and 5 are provided by implementing the Solution interface. This, like most  of the files mentioned in this section, can be found in the org.drools.solver.core  package  or its subfolders .  We did warn that this chapter was more advanced than the  previous ones! Although we'll explain concepts to a non-technical  level, you'll probably need to have some Java experience  or know  somebody who does  to actually implement the examples.   Think of an interface as a template guiding you to fill in the gaps and complete the  solution—in general, this 'complete template' is contained in a second Java file. In  this case, getFacts   returns the JavaBeans representing the goods on the shelves  of the supermarket as we begin our analysis. The cloneSolution   method allows  step 5 to copy any better solution  that is, save a good copy while it tries to improve  it even further .  public interface Solution {      Collection  getFacts  ;      Solution cloneSolution  ; }  Running the solver is easy. We create a configuration, load the configuration file, and  then start the Solver  which may take some time .  XmlSolverConfigurer configurer = new XmlSolverConfigurer  ; configurer.configure "SolverConfig.xml" ; Solver solver = configurer.buildSolver  ;  The configuration file ties the remaining parts of the solution  together. The Comments explain what each part means. <!—Name of the file containing the solver business rules used for  rating the alternatives-->  SolverRulesFile.drl        <!—How we compare the various solutions – Simple is one of the three   [ 265 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Advanced Drools Features     built in options, or can build or own -->    SIMPLE    <!—Finish solving after 2 minutes, or after 100 attemps, or after we  have achieved the perfect score-->         OR       2       100       0.0              NameOfMoveFactory     <!—An accepter filters out the most crazy alternatives.

The most important method is createMoveList, which is a list of the items  that we wish to swap on the supermarket shelves in search for a better solution.   It takes the implementation of the Solution interface as a parameter that we   created earlier.  public interface MoveFactory       extends LocalSearchSolverAware,               LocalSearchSolverLifecycleListener {      List  createMoveList Solution solution ; }  [ 266 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Chapter 12  The LocalSearchSolverAware and LocalSearchSolverLifecycleListener  files referenced are other interfaces. The methods  not listed here  that implement  the Solution interface help the Solver avoid 'dead ends' that appear to be good  solutions. We did not look at them in detail.   The following is an example of a rule file mentioned in the config file, which shows  'hard' constraints, such that beer and nappies should not be on the same shelf:  rule "Stock items cannot be placed on the same shelf"     when         $item1 : StockItem $shelf : shelf, name =="beer" ;         $item2 : StockItem  shelf == $shelf, name =="nappies" ;     then         insertLogical new UnweightedConstraintOccurrence                  "Incompatible objects on shelves", $item1, $item2  ; end  The match against the facts in the when part is the same as usual—remember all  of the facts provided by the solution are inserted into the working memory, and  updated as we cycle through the alternative solutions.   The then part shows how to communicate the fact that nappies and  beer should not sit side by side on the same shelf. We insert a new  UnweightedConstraintOccurrence into the working memory. There are similar  constraints  such as IntConstraintOccurrence  which allow us to communicate a  score on how good the rules think the current solution is.   InsertLogical is similar to insert, except that the object will  automatically be removed if the 'when' part is no longer true.  With all these pieces in place, Solver loads the initial solution, generates and  evaluates alternative solutions, and then repeats the process until it decides to stop.  More information on Solver Of course, the actual implementation of Drools Solver is much more sophisticated.  More information is available in the Drools documentation.  See Chapter 2 for more  details on where to obtain this.  When reading this documentation you may come  across a line that might puzzle you.  It's recommended to use drools in forward-chaining mode […] This is a huge  performance gain.   Forward and backward chaining are key  if advanced  rule engine concepts. So  perhaps now is a good time to introduce them.  [ 267 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Advanced Drools Features  Forward and backward chaining You use forward and backward chaining in real life—except that you don't know   it yet.              Forward chaining is where you have the instructions, but you don't know rward chaining is where you have the instructions, but you don't know  the end goal of where the instructions are taking you. For example, it's like  following the driving instructions on your SatNav or GPS where somebody  else has entered the end coordinates. Backward chaining is where you have an end goal in mind, and need to work  out how you get there. For example, if you need to go to the supermarket and  work out the best way to drive there, then the way you work out the route is  an example of backward chaining.  Drools is a hybrid rule engine because it allows both forward and backward chaining.  Most of the examples in this book have used forward chaining. Backward chaining  tends to either happen accidentally, or when we need to answer the question, 'Which is  the set of facts that could lead us to a particular situation?' The Miss Manners example  from Drools can be configured to show backward chaining behavior.  Forward and backward chaining is important because of its effect on performance.  Backward chaining is very powerful, but much slower.  To explain this, consider the example of the tangle of wires behind your television  set. There are probably power cables from your TV, DVD, satellite, games console,  and Wi-Fi leading to the power sockets in the wall.  If we want to confirm that the TV is plugged in  forward chaining , all we  need to do is pull the power lead at the back of the TV, and confirm that the  lead that is plugged in moves. If we want to confirm which gadgets are plugged in to where, we need to test  each and every cord. This is why backward chaining is much slower.  Forward and backward chaining is implemented using the Rete algorithm, and can  fill the entire contents of a book in itself. But if we did that, we'd miss the chance  to touch on another important 'under the covers' topic of how Drools implements  conflict resolution, and what you can do to configure it.  [ 268 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Chapter 12  Changing the conflict resolution methodology In the previous chapter we met with a problem with rule engines. If there is more  than one rule available to fire on the Agenda, how do we decide which one goes  first? This is especially important as the first rule to fire might cause the subsequent  rules to be removed from the agenda, and hence prevent them from firing.   The solution was conflict resolution—an in-built method that comes with Drools.   It uses this methodology to resolve which rule fires first. But what if we want to  change this methodology?  The code sample below shows how we do this  this happens behind the scenes  without us needing to change it . Normally, the current order of conflict revolvers is  based on salience  number , last fired, rule simplicity, and then rule order. Adding  the following code will allow you to tweak the conflict resolution strategy of your  rule engine:    ConflictResolver[] conflictResolvers =      new ConflictResolver[] { SimplicityConflictResolver.getInstance  ,       SalienceConflictResolver.getInstance  ,               LoadOrderConflictResolver.getInstance       };  RecencyConflictResolver.getInstance  ,                      CompositeConflictResolver resolver =      new CompositeConflictResolver        conflictResolvers ;                              businessRules = RuleBaseLoader.loadFromUrl      BusinessLayer.class.getResource         BUSINESS_RULE_FILE ,resolver ;  In this case we've made simple rules  that is, fewer conditions in the when part  that  are more likely to fire first. We've done that by building up an array of the conflict  revolvers that Drools offers us in the order of importance that we want. Then we add  this array  list  together in a CompositeConflictResolver. Finally, when we load  the rules, we pass in the CompositeResolver. When the rules fire, conflicts  if any   are resolved using the strategies in the order that we specify.   Like forward and backward chaining, it's important to be aware of the conflict  resolution strategy. Likewise, in everything but the most advanced situations, you  shouldn't need to change it. So if you find yourself tweaking the conflict resolution,  So if you find yourself tweaking the conflict resolution,  double-check that the problem isn't in your rules. Make sure you have a good set  of unit tests around your rules. When fixing one rule, make sure that you don't  inadvertently break others.  [ 269 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Advanced Drools Features  Standard rule engine API—JSR 94  The standard rule engine API, JSR-94  Java Specification Request , like conflict  resolution, will come up in conversation soon after you bring up the topic of rule  engines with your colleagues. JSR-94 is the Java standard API for dealing with rule  engines in almost the same way as the Java Database Connectivity  JDBC  is the Java  standard way of connecting Java to databases. So why is this piece of information  tucked away in the very last chapter?        JSR-94 only specifies how we call the rule engine, and not the syntax of pecifies how we call the rule engine, and not the syntax of  the rules themselves. There is no rules standard similar to ANSI SQL  for  databases  to specify the format. Even when calling rule engines, JSR-94 gives you only a subset of the power g rule engines, JSR-94 gives you only a subset of the power  of Drools  or most other rule engines .  Although there is no standard rule format, it is possible for Drools  to mimic other commercial rule engine syntax  such as Blaze  using  Domain Specific Language  DSL . At the time of writing you'll need  to write this DSL yourself, but given the open source nature of  Drools, expect much progress in this area. For example, Drools Clips  emulation is already in an advanced stage.  If you choose to use the JSR-94 syntax, you'll need to add an additional   library—drools-jsr94.jar—to your project. The code to load and fire the rules in  the standard manner is very close in concept to the examples we saw earlier, even  if the terminology used will look something similar to the extract below. This code  sample is how the sample from Chapter 6  remember those ChocolateFactory  rules?  would look using JSR-94.    Specify the exact provider of the JSR-94 driver Class.forName "org.drools.jsr94.rules.RuleServiceProviderImpl" ;    Get the rule service provider from the provider manager. RuleServiceProvider provider = RuleServiceProviderManager.getRuleServi ceProvider "http:  drools.org " ;     Get a handle to the Administration API-  RuleAdministration ruleAdministrator = provider. getRuleAdministrator  ; LocalRuleExecutionSetProvider ruleExecSet = ruleAdmin. getLocalRuleExecutionSetProvider  null  ;     Create a Reader for the drl URL drl = new URL "shipping-rules.drl" ; Reader drlReader = new InputStreamReader   drl.openStream     ;     Create the RuleExecutionSet for the drl RuleExecutionSet ruleExecutionSet = ruleExecSet.  [ 270 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Chapter 12  createRuleExecutionSet  drlReader, null  ;     Register the RuleExecutionSet with the RuleAdministrator String uri = ruleExectionSet.getName  ; ruleAdministrator.registerRuleExecutionSet uri, ruleExecutionSet,  null ;    Get a stateless execution set from this set RuleRuntime ruleRuntime = provider.getRuleRuntime  ;  StatefulRuleSession  session = ruleRuntime.createRuleSession  uri,                              null,RuleRuntime.STATELESS_SESSION_TYPE  ;    Insert the facts – assume that we created these earlier session.addObject  candyBarOrder ; session.addObject  holiday1 ; session.addObject  holiday2 ;    Fire the rules session.executeRules  ;  In some ways the code is more complicated  as we need to specify at the start that we  are using the Drools Rule Engine . Like before, once the rules have fired, the updated  Java objects will be available for use by the Java program. The Drools documentation  gives further information on JSR-94. If you feel you need to use this, there is an  alternative API to call the rule engine.  Other rule engines So, if somebody has gone through a lot of trouble to write the JSR-94 specification for  portability  even if you choose not to use it , what other rule engines are available to  use? There are literally hundreds of frameworks that claim to embody business rules.  But if we filter the list according to those that have a moderate amount of features  and traction, either commercially or in the open source community, we get the  following alternatives:  Remember that this is not an exhaustive list.                    BizTalk Blaze Advisor Jena Jess JRules OpenRules PegaRules RulesPower  [ 271 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Advanced Drools Features  Normally, you'd expect at this point a critical evaluation of the rule engines  mentioned in this list—something like 'Jess is a mature Java rule engine with good  tool support  for example, plug-ins from Eclipse . It's a commercial product, and  the rules are written in a Prolog-style syntax, which can be confusing for many Java  programmers.' All of this would be true. However, given my bias  of course, I'm  going to recommend Drools on the basis that it's the most mature, open source   Java-based rule engine , would you believe any of the analysis?  The best way to summarize is that you should do your own research, and Drools  will inevitably be on the shortlist. Some of the frameworks mentioned  for example,  Jena  offer basic rules functionality, but it's not their core purpose  for Jena, it's the  semantic web . Other frameworks claim to be rule engines, but offer only a fraction  of the functionality discussed in this book. Outside Java, remember that Drools.Net  offers a rule engine on the .Net platform  although its features are not as mature as  those in Drools Java , and Windows workflow  the workflow module that is part of  .Net platform  also has a subset of rules functionality.  New API You may have noticed that the examples in this chapter are using a slightly different  API from those in other chapters. The reason for this is that Drools has a new API.  Don't worry, all of the previous examples will continue to work as before.  Why change something that isn't broken? The changes to the API make interacting  with Drools more 'knowledge engine' based and less 'rule engine' based.   This may seem unusual for a book on rule engines. But a lot of the functionality  that is being added is broadening the capabilities of the engine into areas such as  complex event processing, solving  both of which we saw earlier in this chapter , and  workflow.  We touched upon it in Chapter 9, and we will deal with the extensive  improvements in the next section.  Chances are that if you need a rule engine, you'll  need  at least some of  these capabilities. So it makes sense to enhance Drools and  make the API more generic to accommodate this.  The main parts of the new API that you interact with are as follows—more or less  one for each replacement for the Drools objects we used earlier:             org.drools.builder.KnowledgeBuilder  org.drools.KnowledgeBase  org.drools.agent.KnowledgeAgent  org.drools.runtime.StatefulKnowledgeSession  org.drools.runtime.StatelessKnowledgeSession   [ 272 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   The notes accompanying the new release have good examples. The main addition panying the new release have good examples. The main addition  in the samples below is that in the new API we need to explicitly state that we're  loading a rule file  ResourceType.DRL . This is because KnowledgeBuilder can also  load other resources, such as workflow files. The following sample shows how we  would load the chocolate factory from Chapter 6, but using the new Drools API:  Chapter 12  URL drl = new URL "shipping-rules.drl" ;  KnowledgeBuilder kbuilder = KnowledgeBuilderFactory. newKnowledgeBuilder  ;  kbuilder.add  ResourceFactory.newUrlResource  url  ,              ResourceType.DRL  ;    check for errors if   kbuilder.hasErrors     {    System.err.println  builder.getErrors  .toString    ;  }           KnowledgeBase kbase = KnowledgeBaseFactory.newKnowledgeBase  ;  kbase.addKnowledgePackages  builder.getKnowledgePackages    ;  StatefulKnowledgeSession ksession = knowledgeBase. newStatefulKnowledgeSession  ;          Insert the facts – assume that we created these earlier ksession.addObject  candyBarOrder ; ksession.addObject  holiday1 ; ksession.addObject  holiday2 ;       ksession.fireAllRules  ;  More information on these new objects can be found in the Javadoc at   https:  hudson.jboss.org hudson job drools lastSuccessfulBuild  artifact trunk target javadocs stable drools-api index.html.  Drools flow—a full workflow engine Back in Chapter 9 we mentioned that Ruleflow is not a workflow. This holds true,  and Ruleflow can still be used to control when the different sets of rules may fire.  However, Drools 5 now has a first-class workflow engine integrated into it, plus all  of the supporting tools that you'd expect. To remind ourselves of the differences, and  what workflow is:        Ruleflow says what might happen at each stage in the process. The actual  rules that fire are selected by the rule engine. Workflow says exactly what will happen at each stage in the process. As soon  as the workflow reaches a step, we will fire the actions associated with it.  [ 273 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Advanced Drools Features  Typically, workflows model the business process. The following sample is from  the JBoss jBPM  Business Process Management  documentation  the other JBoss  workflow that Drools integrates well with . It describes the business steps needed to  process an e-commerce order.  What both Drools Flow and JBoss jBPM provide are Eclipse-based tools to 'draw' the  workflow—the image above is an example on one using the Eclipse tools. Using the  tool, you then state what Java code you wish to fire at each point in the workflow.  It  is easy to write because the Java code doesn't have to worry about what is happening  around it, only that it will be told to run in the correct circumstances.  Drools and  jBPM also provide a runtime that executes the workflow as the various steps are met.  Drools hooks into the decision-making node for both Drools flow and jBPM, allowing  you to make  rules-based  decisions on what path you want the process to proceed.   New features in Guvnor Guvnor gains a lot of enhancements in the latest Drools release. These include:       Fine-grained security: You can restrict what groups of users can and cannot do. grained security: You can restrict what groups of users can and cannot do. Web-based decision tables: They have a similar grid-like format to that  which the Excel decision tables have  as seen in Chapter 8 , but are accessible  through the Guvnor web interface.

There are also substantial under-the-cover improvements to the core rule engine, the  net effect of which is to increase stability and performance.  Does this still sound like where you work? Back in Chapter 1, you may have taken the 10-question pop quiz with the heading  'Does this sound like where you work?' The aim was to show you the problems that  Drools can solve. Lets take a look at the solutions.  1.   2.   Is Bob in the corner the only person who knows how the system really  works? Can the business scale only if we have an expert? Is critical  knowledge lost when people like Bob leave? Solution: Getting the knowledge out of Bob's head and into a business   rule-based system is a scalable, durable, solution. If you're Bob  owning the knowledge , are you sick of people asking you  stupid questions? Do you think: don't these people know that you've got a  job to do? Solution: Write your knowledge as business rules. That way, at the very least  it's documented; and even better, it can be run in the rule engine.  3.  Are your customers getting a different answer every time they call your  company  and getting more than slightly irate about it ? Are you at the   risk of receiving a slap on the wrist  or worse  from a regulator or other  standards body? Solution: Having the company's knowledge in one place  the business rules ,  and referring to that each time means that clients will get consistent answers.  4.  Do you find yourself working around, rather than with, your computer  systems? Have you ever thought of pouring coffee into your computer  keyboard in frustration? Solution: Drools won't stop you from pouring coffee into your computer. But  since rules-based systems are more flexible, you should be less tempted to try  pouring coffee into your computer in the first place.

Are things always done with books, or is there a lot of informal knowledge   that is just in people's heads? Solution: There will always be an element of informal knowledge in every  business. But since rules are much easier to update than code, the balance  will be shifted towards documented business rules  a good thing .  7.   6.  Did you prepare for a quality  ISO 9001  audit and then leave the process  documentation unused on a shelf? Is there anybody around who knows or  wants to change this process? Solution: If you move your knowledge to rules and workflow, the next   time you have a quality audit you just print the rules and send the auditors   their way. Is your business knowledge in some format that gives payback?  For  example, Electronic instead of that dusty paper copy, and not locked away in  unreadable machine-code.  Is this format easy to update? Can everybody use  it from one central location  so that copies do not get 'out of sync' ? Can you  track changes and roll back if you get it wrong?  Solution: Drools gives a repository to securely store your knowledge and  track changes. Even better, it can 'execute' that knowledge  as rules  directly  from the repository.  8.  Do the right people  and only the right people  have access  both reading and  updating  to this information? Does this access need to change depending on  the context of what the user is doing at the time?  Solution: The rules repository that comes with Drools Guvnor allows you to  do just this.  9.  Do people in your organization work on projects? Do they come together   to form goal-driven teams, and then go back when the objectives have been  achieved? Do you know how to document the outcome of these projects as  rules so that they can be reused both over time and over the organization? Solution: The project team  among other things  can generate new or updated  business rules. Captured by Drools, these can be shared with the rest of   the organization.  10.	 No task is done in isolation. How do we ensure that tasks and team members   collaborate effectively?  Solution: Rules encourage sharing so that everybody can understand what   is going on. Even better, the Guvnor web editor allows many people to   contribute at the same time, without needing to install special software. OK, so our pop quiz was slightly biased  this is a Drools book, after all . But the  fundamental problems that Drools solves, and the change that JBoss Drools can  make to where you work, should still be clear. [ 276 ]  This material is copyright and is licensed for the sole use by Richard Ostheimer on 15th June 2009 2205 hilda ave., , missoula, , 59801   Chapter 12  Summary We've come a long way since the start of this book. Chapter 1 introduced the  problem of capturing business logic in a way that is readable and updateable by   non-technical users. It introduced Drools and rule engines as a solution to the  problem. Chapter 2 showed where to obtain Drools and other open source software,  and how to install it on your computer. Chapter 3 introduced the Guvnor web editor,  available to help non-technical users write business rules.  In Chapter 4 we began to write our first business rules using the Guvnor editor,  and wrote our first JavaBean to support these rules using Eclipse the JBoss IDE.  In Chapter 5 we wrote more advanced rules using Guvnor, rather than the JBoss  IDE, to write the business rules due to the increased power that it offers. Chapter 6  continued this thread to give a comprehensive guide to the rules syntax.  Testing the rules written in the previous chapters is the focus of Chapter 7, while  Chapter 8 showed how to use Excel to hold both the business rules and the data for  those rules. Chapter 9 showed other ways of expressing your rules using Domain  Specific Language and Ruleflow.   How to deploy all of the business rules created to date was the focus for Chapter 10.  In Chapter 11 we took a view inside the rule engine to help us write better business  rules. Finally, in this chapter, we looked at advanced rules concepts, many of which  have become available in the latest Drools release.   I hope this book inspires you to use Drools business rules in your project. Good luck  and remember to check for updates to Drools at www.jboss.org drools and code  samples at http:  code.google.com p red-piranha .

This book takes a practical approach, with step-by-step instructions. It doesn't hesitate to talk about the technologies, but takes time to explain them (to an Excel power-user level). There is a good use of graphics and code where necessary. If you are a business analyst – somebody involved with enterprise IT but at a high level, understanding problems and planning solutions, rather than coding in-depth implementations – then this book is for you. If you are a business user who needs to write rules, or a technical person who needs to support rules, this book is for you. If you are looking for an introduction to rule engine technology, this book will satisfy your needs. If you are a business user and want to write rules using Guvnor/JBoss IDE, this book will be suitable for you. This book will also suit your need if you are a business user and want to understand what Drools can do and how it works, but would rather leave the implementation to a developer.
