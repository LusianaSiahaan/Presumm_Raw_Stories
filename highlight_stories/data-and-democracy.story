Watching  news  coverage  of  the  2016  presidential  race,  it’s  easy  to imagine  that  this  year’s  election  is  unlike  any  other  that’s  come before.  Behind  the  scenes,  though,  this  year’s  campaigns  are  con‐ tinuing  a  trend  that  has  been  underway  for  more  than  a  decade. Modern  campaigns  in  the  US  have  become  more  reliant  on  data with  each  election  cycle,  using  analytics  to  drive  everything  from overall  strategy  and  messaging  to  individual  voter  contacts  and advertising.  This  evolution  was  well  documented  in  the  2008  and 2012 presidential campaigns, and in 2016, the technology has spread to  “downballot”  campaigns  for  state  and  local  offices  that  never before had access to such sophisticated tools. At the same time, a data-driven mindset is also shaping how cam‐ paigns  are  covered  in  the  media.  To  bring  sanity  to  the  deluge  of often-conflicting  poll  numbers,  survey  aggregators  use  forecast models to combine results and produce a clearer estimate of where each contest stands. And by digging deeper into filings that record how money flows through each campaign, investigative journalists can  better  understand  what’s  going  on  both  within  the  campaign and across the electorate.  vii   This compilation brings together leading experts on the role of data in electoral politics, to share insights learned across nearly a century of combined experience. These contributors span a range of techni‐ cal areas and bring together perspectives from Democrats, Republi‐ cans,  and  members  of  the  media.  What  the  contributors  have  in common, though, is that they are all highly skilled practitioners who have an intimate understanding of the technical challenges in their fields. Bringing these voices together to explain political data for a tech-savvy  audience,  our  goal  is  to  leave  readers  with  a  more detailed  and  comprehensive  understanding  of  the  topic  than  has ever before been gathered in one publication. A Primer on Modern Election Campaigns Before we begin, it’ll help to lay out a common framework in which elections take place, to anchor the discussions that follow. For all the drama and complexity surrounding election contests, every part of a campaign’s work is ultimately designed to impact the same thing: the final vote totals. Working backwards from there, this gives a cam‐ paign two avenues for swaying the outcome: first, influencing who shows up to vote, and second, affecting how they vote when they get there. All of the other numbers in a campaign—fundraising totals, ad  airings,  poll  results,  etc.—ultimately  matter  mainly  because  of their connection to who votes and how. In  terms  of  overall  strategy,  then,  campaigns’  options  are  pretty straightforward:  they  want  to  convince  eligible  voters  to  support their candidates, then they want to make sure those supporters show up  to  vote.  Almost  everything  else  on  a  campaign  is  built  around these  goals.  From  firm  supporters  who  are  certain  to  vote,  cam‐ paigns solicit donations and recruit volunteers to help with persua‐ sion and get-out-the-vote efforts aimed at other voters. Campaigns then use both volunteers and paid staff to reach out to other voters directly,  and  develop  messaging  strategies  and  advertising  cam‐ paigns  to  reinforce  these  efforts.  And  as  Election  Day  approaches, they rely on polling and forecast models to allocate resources and adapt their tactics to fit the latest political environment. The starting point for all data on a modern campaign is a voter file. This is a list of all registered voters in a given state or district, com‐ piled by the local and state election authorities. A typical voter file contains voters’ contact information, basic demographic characteris‐  viii     Prologue: The Role of Data in Campaigns   tics, historical voter turnout records, and  in most states  partisan affiliation. From there, campaigns supplement voter files with their own  data  on  things  like  contact  history  and  donations,  as  well  as external data from other campaigns, public records, and commercial data vendors. To reach these voters, campaigns develop messaging strategies based on polling and other research. These messages are sometimes tested and  refined  through  experimental  testing,  and  then  the  final  mes‐ sages  are  turned  into  specific  ads  and  talking  points.  Those campaign-produced ads  often referred to as “paid media”  are cus‐ tomized for TV, radio, print, mail, and online usage, and reinforced through talking points used in interviews and other news coverage  “earned media”  that the campaign gets for free. As  the  election  season  heats  up,  media  sources  also  do  their  own research into campaigns’ activities and performance. The most savvy of these journalists use many of the same techniques campaigns use, compiling  large  datasets  and  building  advanced  models  to  better understand  the  state  of  each  election.  Over  time,  these  media  not only  provide  new  information  to  their  audiences,  but  also  help shape  perceptions  of  the  campaigns  and  candidates  by  translating complex  patterns  into  findings  that  are  easier  for  the  public  to digest. What to Expect Over the coming pages, you’ll hear firsthand accounts of what this work looks like in 2016, examples of the many challenges practition‐ ers  still  face,  and  predictions  about  how  political  data  science  will continue to evolve in the coming years. Taken together, these pieces illustrate just how essential data has become to today’s elections. To be  sure,  this  trend  echoes  that  seen  in  many  other  fields,  but  the rapid pace and high stakes of politics have inspired a degree of inno‐ vation that few other industries can match. No matter how much you’re interested in politics for its own sake, these contributors’ stories will likely offer insights that are relevant to your own areas of expertise. As editor, I hope that you all get as much  satisfaction  out  of  reading  these  great  pieces  as  I  did  from assembling them. Enjoy!  Prologue: The Role of Data in Campaigns      ix    CHAPTER 1 Essentials of Modeling and Microtargeting  Dan Castleman  Dan  Castleman  is  cofounder  and  Director  of  Analytics  at  Clarity Campaign Labs, a modeling and targeting consulting firm for progres‐ sive candidates, political coalitions, corporations, international cam‐ paigns, and charitable groups. His expertise covers strategic program targeting,  data  analysis,  modeling,  and  polling.  One  of  the  leading modelers in Democratic politics, Castleman has built voter targeting models for the Democratic National Committee, Democratic Congres‐ sional  Campaign  Committee,  and  Democratic  Governors’  Associa‐ tion, as well as dozens of individual campaigns and advocacy groups.  In  the  Democratic  Party  today,  modeling  and  microtargeting  have become ubiquitous. They are no longer peculiar curiosities confined to only a few forward-thinking campaigns, but de facto parts of any modern campaign with sufficient resources. While this leap forward can  at  least  partly  be  attributed  to  coverage  of  their  use  by  the Obama campaign in 2012, individual-level models have been used by  Democratic  campaigns  since  as  early  as  2004.  Indeed,  in  many ways modeling and microtargeting are simply an extension of tactics employed to target voters at the aggregate level for decades. Over the past ten years, I have built countless models and advised dozens of political  campaigns  in  how  to  use  them.  In  that  time,  I  have  seen firsthand their rise in use, what they can  and can’t  do, and what methods for building them work the best.  1   Although the two terms are often used interchangeably, “modeling” and “microtargeting” have some important distinctions. Modeling is the practice of using algorithms and observed data to build statisti‐ cal  or  machine  learning  models,  in  order  to  predict  unobserved actions  or  preferences.  Modeling  for  political  campaigns  is  most often done at the individual level using voter files, which combine official voter registration lists with other data sources, such as con‐ sumer  records,  campaign  contact  histories,  and  other  proprietary information collected by the campaign and party. Microtargeting,  meanwhile,  refers  to  the  process  of  making  cam‐ paign  targeting  decisions  at  the  individual  level—for  instance, selecting which voters to mail campaign literature to—and is gener‐ ally  informed  by  these  voter  models.  While  these  practices  are clearly intertwined, they are not inseparable. Modeling can still be done on other types of data  e.g., collections of exit polls or precinct- level vote totals , and microtargeting can be done in the absence of models  e.g., making selections based on characteristics included in voter files or consumer data . What Models Can and Cannot Do The practice of using models and microtargeting has made a pro‐ found and important impact on how campaigns are run. But despite what is often said and written about them, they do not offer unpop‐ ular politicians any magic ability to win over electorates that dislike them. And while they can provide an accurate snapshot of the elec‐ torate’s overall preferences, they are not an efficient way to generate the horse-race numbers that the media and public are most interes‐ ted in. What they can do—and what we ultimately seek most from them—is to improve the efficiency of how campaigns run their pro‐ grams. While  efficiency  sounds  like  a  rather  mundane  goal,  for  political campaigns it is of the utmost importance. Campaigns have to gain the  support  of  a  majority  of  often-large  electorates,  but  are  con‐ strained in terms of money, volunteers, and the ever-looming elec‐ tion date. To help use these limited resources as wisely as possible, campaigns have to be smart about how they target voters. For exam‐ ple, looking at the breakdown of survey responses across subgroups can give a campaign an idea of the types of voters who are potential supporters or areas where a candidate’s popularity is weak. The same  2      Chapter 1: Essentials of Modeling and Microtargeting   can  be  done  historically  by  examining  past  election  results  at  the precinct level. Modeling allows us to apply a more robust methodol‐ ogy  to  identify  targets  and  provides  even  greater  efficiency  gains when applied at the individual level. Selecting Voters to Target Since campaigns’ targeting needs drive their modeling needs, deci‐ sions  about  what  models  to  build  are  based  on  larger  strategic assumptions.  When  developing  their  overall  strategies,  campaigns typically  think  about  voters  in  two  main  dimensions:  support  for their candidate and likelihood of voting. For campaigns it is not just important  to  identify  whom  voters  support  and  whether  they  are persuadable, but also whether or not they will take their support to the polls. Figure 1-1 demonstrates how these two measures are con‐ nected  and  further  divides  voters  into  the  three  groups  on  which campaigns will want to focus their resources.  Figure 1-1. Basics of voter targeting in campaigns  When targeting voters who are highly likely to turn out and support their  candidate   “base  supporters” ,  campaigns  will  seek  financial contributions and recruit volunteers. Those with high support but uncertain likelihood of voting become targets for “get-out-the-vote” efforts to increase their turnout. And those with uncertain support will  be  targeted  for  persuasion.  For  the  remaining  voters—those highly likely to support the opponent—a campaign’s limited resour‐  Selecting Voters to Target      3   ces  are  best  spent  elsewhere,  as  these  voters  are  not  very  likely  to respond to the campaign’s efforts. This strategic thinking explains why turnout and support scores are the most common  and in many cases, the most useful  models for campaigns, but there are many other types of models that can also be valuable for campaigns. Table 1 lists some of the most common types  of  voter  models,  many  of  which  are  available  pre-built  and scored nationally by firms like Clarity.  Table 1-1. Common types of voter targeting scores Type of Score Party Turnout Candidate Support Issue Position  Description Likelihood of identifying with one political party or another Likelihood of voting in a given election Likelihood of supporting a specific candidate Likelihood of holding a given position on a specific issue  marriage equality, gun control, etc.  Likelihood of being a campaign activist or donor  Volunteer   Donation Propensity Demographic   Behavioral  Persuasion  Likelihood of being a college graduate, gun owner, Fox News watcher, etc. Likelihood of being responsive to campaign persuasion  How Models Are Made Most models are built using survey data—and lots of it.1 For exam‐ ple, a candidate support model will be informed by a short survey with  a  large  sample  size.  Unlike  traditional  “horse-race”  election polls   like  those  put  out  by  newspapers  and  TV  networks ,  which usually include between 400 and 1,000 responses, modeling surveys typically  use  anywhere  from  2,500  to  20,000  or  more  responses, depending  on  the  size  of  the  geography  and  the  type  of  model.  A support  model  can  be  built  on  something  as  simple  as  a  head-to- head candidate support question, and the responses used directly as the  model’s  outcome.  For  more  complex  characteristics,  such  as  a  1 Turnout models are the most notable exception: the standard approach is simply to  model turnout in comparable past elections  as recorded in official voter files  to make inferences about who is most likely to turn out in the next election. Other models, such as those for donation or volunteer propensity, can also be built on similar directly observed behaviors.  4      Chapter 1: Essentials of Modeling and Microtargeting   voter’s persuadability, models may use multiple questions in aggre‐ gate  or  estimate  treatment  effects  from  randomized  experimental tests. The end result of most models is a “score” that we can append to the voter file used by the campaign for targeting. Most scores represent estimated probabilities  of supporting a candidate or turning out to vote, for example , but others may give percentile or decile rankings, especially for outcomes that are unlikely to be well calibrated  often because they are built on low-frequency events, such as volunteering or donation . As mentioned before, models are not magic. They can help find per‐ suadable voters, but they cannot make voters persuadable or make a poor  message  more  effective.  And  while  the  models  we  build  get increasingly  accurate  every  year,  they  will  always  be  probabilistic, which means they will always have some degree of error. For exam‐ ple, appended consumer records can improve models, but they are far less informative than you might think: the data points provided are often sparse, vaguely sourced, or just plain wrong. This uncertainty affects the methods and algorithms we use. With hundreds  or  thousands  of  potential  features  to  include,  the  most important  step  in  modeling  is  often  the  feature  selection  process. Furthermore,  the  machine  learning  algorithms  that  work  the  best for our needs are ones that scale well with a large number of dispa‐ rate features and can discover nonlinear patterns. Tree-based mod‐ els  are  most  common,  particularly  as  ensembles  of  trees   such  as random forests  or when ensembled with other types of models. But every  campaign’s  needs  are  different,  and  even  more  rudimentary algorithms, such as linear and logistic regressions, are still used for certain models. Like  much  of  the  data  science  community,  the  political  modeling field  is  increasingly  turning  to  open-source  tools  such  as  R  and Python, although some practitioners use commercial packages like Stata. In addition to developing a community of data scientists with expertise with these tools, we have also invested resources in build‐ ing systems that allow us to work with large datasets efficiently and quickly, in order to create and score models in a streamlined fash‐ ion.  These  systems  combine  custom  ETL  and  analytics  tools  with terabyte-scale data warehouses of voter data, allowing us to update models frequently so that the already-short timelines of campaigns  How Models Are Made      5   are not held up by our processes. After all, our models are only use‐ ful  to  a  campaign  if  they  have  time  to  employ  them,  so  efficient turnaround is key to providing value. Looking ahead, there are still new techniques to be explored, meth‐ odologies to be improved, and challenges to overcome. For example, we  have  been  working  on  enhancing  our  methods  for  providing accurate  and  useful  models  for  not  just  presidential  and  statewide campaigns but for smaller campaigns as well  such as those for state legislature or local offices . To help these downballot campaigns in 2016, the Democratic National Committee has put together a suite of “off the shelf” models available to all their campaigns nationwide, and we at Clarity have been working on finding ways for multiple smaller campaigns to pool their resources and develop customized models  that  wouldn’t  otherwise  be  affordable  or  feasible.  In  this unusual election cycle, we are constantly striving to improve, adapt, and  understand  the  implications  of  the  ever-changing  political winds on modeling for all races up and down the ticket.  6      Chapter 1: Essentials of Modeling and Microtargeting   CHAPTER 2 Data Management for Political Campaigns  Audra Grassia  Audra Grassia leads political engagements at Civis Analytics. She has spent the majority of her career working on political campaigns across the  country,  including  statewide,  local,  and  federal  races.  Addition‐ ally, Audra was the Deputy Political Director for the Democratic Gov‐ ernors Association during the 2014 election cycle.  “Big Data in politics is just a fad!…said no one. Ever.” This is the joke a non-data, political colleague of mine recently made while  we  were  discussing  the  future  of  electoral  politics.  Her  joke was  correct  in  its  sarcastic  tone:  we  all  know  big  data  in  electoral politics is here to stay. But it wasn’t too long ago when some believed it would fade into the background as the next new, shiny thing came on the market. The  reality  is  that  data  is  now  in  the  background—and  the  fore‐ ground. It now informs every campaign decision and is talked about by pollsters, pundits, and even candidates. The level of granularity and the breadth of insight that one can produce using all of the data at  our  disposal  is  unmatched,  and  we  are  rapidly  growing  our understanding of who voters are, how to reach them, and what we say to them. Our ability to draw actionable insights from our data has been enhanced as data and analytics technology becomes more available, sophisticated, user-friendly, and decision-maker centric.  7   Just because we now have access to more information about voters than ever before, though, does not mean it is easy to use all of that data  to  inform  decisions.  In  this  article,  I  will  discuss  three  broad challenges when using data to inform decisions in a campaign envi‐ ronment, and suggest ways to think about data management infra‐ structure—from the outset—in order to minimize those challenges. The Challenge: Building a Smart, Scalable, and Compatible Data Infrastructure First, there is the people gap. Managing, using, and understanding data  takes  technical  training,  and  no  matter  how  many  people  we put through data-training programs, the dearth of well-trained, skil‐ led  data  scientists  and  analysts  working  in  politics  is  not  likely  to change rapidly. Additionally, political decision-makers are becoming increasingly sophisticated in their consumption of data and analyt‐ ics  products.  They  are  asking  more  interesting  and  involved research questions and expecting answers faster. So while demand for data and analytics services increases, the supply of skilled talent is slow to follow. Second, there are disparate sources of data, all structured in different ways, living in different systems that don’t talk to one another. This challenge  isn’t  unique  to  campaigns.  However,  the  speed  and  effi‐ ciency with which we need to unify and make use of that data is tied to a hard deadline  Election Day , which  almost  never changes. Finally,  given  the  first  and  second  challenges,  there  is  not  a  well- defined process for directing the right data to the right stakeholders. It will take a few more cycles before incorporating data and analytics into all aspects of a campaign becomes seamless and replicable. By then, there will undoubtedly be several more data sources to inte‐ grate, which is all the more reason to build a data infrastructure that is scalable and smart from the outset. Seizing Opportunity: Five Ways to Maximize Use of Data on a Campaign Thinking smartly about data management infrastructure can greatly enhance a campaign’s ability to overcome challenges and ultimately contributes to a successful campaign.  8      Chapter 2: Data Management for Political Campaigns   To provide a bit of context, a data-driven culture encourages collab‐ oration between previously siloed departments. What happens when a finance director sees that field data can help build a model that will increase their success at fundraising? They’ll want more field data, and the campaign will raise more money. What happens when com‐ munications  sees  that  their  messages  aren’t  resonating  with  digital donors? They’ll want to figure out how to adjust their message—and then they will want to test it. Good data management infrastructure is key to building a unified vision of campaign efforts in order to fully understand how resour‐ ces are being allocated, where those resources are being most effec‐ tively used, and when where resources might need adjustment. So  what  should  you  consider  when  planning  your  campaign  data infrastructure? Ideally, decision-makers will consider five factors as they are building a campaign, but the principles behind them can be revisited as a campaign  and the data  grows:  1. Let each tool  and person  do what it does best.  On  any  campaign,  there  are  a  number  of  tools  meant  to  both manage and use data, with specific software designed for fund‐ raising,  digital  outreach,  regulatory  compliance,  accounting, and  field  management.  There  is  no  single  system  that  will accomplish what you need for all users and use cases. Therefore, the  question  becomes,  what  tools  are  best  for  their  users  and can interact through syncing? Having multiple tools for collect‐ ing or managing data isn’t a problem as long as there is a way to then aggregate, analyze, and report on all of the data in order to answer key questions. Thinking about your data management tools as Legos is a help‐ ful  way  to  consider  this  problem.  Imagine  you  have  a  tub  of plastic  Legos,  and  in  that  tub  are  a  few  oddly  shaped  wooden blocks.  While  the  wooden  blocks  may  add  some  interesting dimensions to whatever you are trying to build, they ultimately won’t  click  into  place  with  the  other  Legos,  and  you’ll  be  left with a structure that needs to be cobbled together in a less than ideal way. This is the same danger you face if you don’t consider interoperability between your systems before you decide to use them.  Seizing Opportunity: Five Ways to Maximize Use of Data on a Campaign      9   2. Distribute access to your data and data tools.  Let’s  take  the  toy  analogy  one  step  further.  Now  imagine  that Legos are all individual pieces of data, and you have a big clear tub full of them. They are all different colors, shapes, and sizes. Individually, and even all jumbled up in the box, those Legos are not particularly useful or interesting. The clear tub allows you to view those Legos, but if you cannot get the Legos out to build something, then what’s the point? Data is no different. There are many  systems  that  allow  you  to  input  information.  Many  of those systems will even help you enhance the data from other sources   e.g.,  consumer  data  sources .  What  happens  next  is where things get tricky. Some systems allow you to take your data—in almost any form you decide is best—and do whatever you need to with it, pend‐ ing  any  legal contractual  limitations.  Other  systems  severely restrict access to the raw data and instead provide the informa‐ tion  in  the  form  of  hard-to-manipulate  reporting  tools. Depending  on  your  organizational  needs,  the  more  restrictive version can limit the usefulness of the data. It prevents easy uni‐ fication  with  other  data  systems  and  hampers  the  ability  for people  within  your  organization  to  find  creative  ways  to  con‐ duct analysis. It is like locking the lid of the clear tub holding the Legos and only giving the key to the system vendor. There was a time when this model made sense, when what we could do with our data was as limited by bandwidth and server size as it was by the lack of trained analytics professionals. Lead‐ ers ten years ago didn’t grow up in a culture of data and were therefore only asking questions that could be answered with the limited amount of available information. Simple reports helped them make informed decisions. But as the role of data in society grows and as we have infinitely more access to infinitely more data, using a system that is severely restricted puts organizations at a disadvantage. Instead, seek out vendors that provide APIs, webhooks,  or  backend  SQL  database  access.  Direct  access  to underlying  data  will  give  you  flexibility  as  your  organization scales.  3. Get your data together and automate.  Imagine  that  you  just  hired  your  first  data  director.  She  has already  proven  her  value  ten-fold  by  producing  interesting insights  visualized  in  a  way  that  your  entire  team  can  really  10      Chapter 2: Data Management for Political Campaigns   understand. You wish you could clone her, but we are at least a few decades away from such technological advancement. Given that reality, finding ways to automate all of the “data munging” tasks she needs to do before she gets to drawing insights is the most  efficient  way  to  exponentially  increase  a  smart  analyst’s time and value to the organization. Automation is often one of the most difficult things to achieve. As discussed in 2, you might have a number of different tools you are working with to achieve specific tasks. Understanding the compatibility of the job-specific tools with one another and your overarching analytics platform is important. To the great‐ est extent possible, you want to use tools that allow you to auto‐ mate  rote  tasks   e.g.,  syncing  data  to  and  from  given  sources, cleaning data, reporting .  4. Create clear standard operating procedures  SOPs  for each department’s  use  and  handling  of  data,  and  ensure  those SOPs work together. While  you  might  have  different  tools  you  use  to  capture  data from  different  sources  or  departments,  put  together  a  system that is consistent across the organization. A fundraiser should be using the field tool if they go out canvassing, while field staff should be using the fundraising tool if they are making donor calls. Managers should be aware of the data management tools from  other  departments  and,  for  functions  that  go  across departments  e.g., digital fundraising , deciding at the outset the business  rules  around  which  system  should  be  used  and  how the data should flow. You might, for example, have a digital platform that will allow email blasts to be sent out for recruiting volunteers and for rais‐ ing  money.  The  platform  should  make  sure  action  taken  by potential volunteers is shared with the field team and donation information is shared with the finance team appropriately. Any  SOPs  should  start  with  the  department  heads,  as  they understand the best and most practical ways their tools should be used. However, someone with organizational oversight  e.g., an  operations  director  or  data  director   who  understands  the need for departments to work together should ultimately ensure that the tools and methods used will allow for the greatest inte‐ gration of data down the road.  Seizing Opportunity: Five Ways to Maximize Use of Data on a Campaign      11   5. Listen to all levels of the campaign, not just the leadership.  Innovation is often driven from the bottom rather than the top. People in leadership might be too far removed from the day-to- day of data management and analytics to really understand the added value of doing things differently. As leaders, it’s important to empower people who are responsible for generating insights from data to find faster, cheaper, and better ways to answer the core  questions  of  a  campaign.  While  some  methods  might require investments, good ideas can come from anywhere. Facil‐ itating a creative culture that listens to and entertains innovative solutions  will  help  build  a  collaborative  environment  where everyone feels invested in the data infrastructure.  Applying These Principles on Real Campaigns Ultimately, a few critical choices and habits can make the difference between just having a lot of data and being a data-driven campaign or organization. Adopting as many of these five principles as possi‐ ble  when  building  your  data  management  infrastructure  will increase your likelihood of achieving the latter, and a data-friendly culture needs to be adopted from the ground up and championed from the top down. Fortunately, you don’t have to recreate the wheel. These same chal‐ lenges  have  been  dealt  with  by  campaign  managers  and  staff  for more than a decade, and there are tools available that can make their solutions’  implementation,  adoption,  and  collaboration  easier.  If you’re not sure where to start, seek out the advice of those who have done  this  in  the  past.  Many  of  those  who  faced  these  same  chal‐ lenges in previous election cycles are now working to help others in the  same  position,  and  their  knowledge  and  experience  can  help future campaigns make smart decisions from the outset and avoid having to learn these lessons the hard way.  12      Chapter 2: Data Management for Political Campaigns   CHAPTER 3 How Technology Is Changing the Polling Industry  Patrick Ruffini  Patrick Ruffini is a cofounder of Echelon Insights, a survey research and  analytics  technology  company.  He  has  been  applying  data  and technology to political campaigns for more than a decade. Ruffini hel‐ ped establish one of the first full-fledged digital operations in Presi‐ dential  politics  for  Bush-Cheney  ’04,  led  digital  strategy  for  the Republican National Committee, and later founded and grew Engage, one of the leading digital agencies on the right.  In  recent  elections,  high-profile  examples  of  polling  missing  the mark have people asking whether traditional polling is as reliable as it used to be. These questions reached a fever pitch after the UK’s recent  vote  to  leave  the  European  Union,  with  immediate  pre- referendum  polls  pointing  to  a  win  for  remaining  in  the  EU;  the 2015  UK  general  election,  where  nearly  every  pollster  missed  the Conservative  Party’s  comfortable  win;  and  the  stunning  2014  pri‐ mary loss of House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, who had led by as many as 30 points in pre-election polling. These questions come at a time when it is getting much harder and more expensive to reach a representative sample of adults over the telephone,  the  dominant  way  of  reaching  survey  respondents  for decades. Response rates have declined from 36% in 1997 to just 9% in  2012,  according  to  the  Pew  Research  Center.  Additionally, respondents  increasingly  only  use  cell  phones,  which  are  twice  as  13   expensive to reach, since the government mandates that these num‐ bers be dialed manually. The increased cost of calling mobile devices disproportionately affects access to young people between 18 and 29 years old and Hispanics, two groups where more than 60% of the population doesn’t even have a landline telephone, according to sta‐ tistics compiled by the Centers for Disease Control. These difficulties are leading consumers of polling to look for alter‐ natives,  from  Internet  surveys  to  digital  sentiment  analysis  to  big data  analytics.  The  polling  industry  as  we  know  it  today  will  look very different ten years from now, and we already see the transfor‐ mation underway in this year’s elections. Despite Challenges, Polling Isn’t Dead Yet… First,  the  good  news:  Despite  highly  publicized  “misses”  and  the challenges facing the industry, there is little evidence that polling has gotten  less  accurate  over  time.  This  primary  season,  polls  have largely  been  on  the  mark.  The  Republican  polls  showed  a  strong lead for Donald Trump throughout. When analysts strayed from the raw polling numbers, conjecturing that Trump would wither under a barrage of establishment attacks, they were usually wrong. On the Democratic side, polls showed a stable and consistent national Hill‐ ary Clinton lead with few surprises in state-level contests. The polling industry has also adapted, conducting more interviews via  cell  phone  or  online.  Internet  polling  in  particular  has  proven very popular as a way to counteract the rising costs of dialing cell phones. In the Republican primary, Internet polling rose 257% over 2012, counteracting a 15% drop in live telephone polling and contri‐ buting to an overall 37% increase in national polling, according to an analysis by The Huffington Post. Nearly half of all national polls in the 2016 primary race were Internet polls. …But Understanding How to Poll Is More Essential than Ever Recently, we’ve been seeing a rise in state-level media polls conduc‐ ted  using  phone  numbers  collected  from  state  voter  rolls,  a  best practice used by campaign pollsters. Calling phone numbers at ran‐ dom, or random-digit dialing, has been the traditional way of ensur‐ ing  that  polls  are  representative  of  the  general  population.  This  14      Chapter 3: How Technology Is Changing the Polling Industry   method is time-tested and is still often used in national surveys, but can  fall  short  in  low-turnout  primaries  when  knowledge  of  the respondent’s past participation matters more. Polls were most off the mark  this  year  on  the  Republican  side  in  Iowa,  where  just  6%  of Iowa  adults  voted,  when  many  pollsters  dialed  randomly  or  didn’t know who had attended caucuses in the past. Data from voter files is being used to update traditional methodolo‐ gies  for  assessing  who  is  and  isn’t  likely  to  vote.  Rather  than  only asking  voters  if  they  are  likely  to  vote,  we  can  see  whether  they actually  have  in  the  past.  Then,  rather  than  discard  data  from unlikely voters in a “likely voter” survey as pollsters traditionally do, we  simply  weight  according  to  the  share  of  sporadic  voters  tradi‐ tionally in the electorate. In our pre-primary survey in South Caro‐ lina,  we  found  that  those  with  less  than  a  50%  chance  of participating  supported  Donald  Trump  at  36%,  while  those  95% likely to turn out supported him at 26%. In no turnout cohort did Trump lose. By appropriately weighting based on a voter’s likelihood to  participate,  we  were  able  to  accurately  project  Trump’s  winning margin  within  1%,  while  also  releasing  multiple  sets  of  expected results based on high, medium, or low turnout. This approach gives consumers of polls a more accurate, scenario-based understanding of the interplay between turnout and election outcomes. The Shift to Online Interviewing: Possibilities and Pitfalls The  new  paradigm  of  online  polling  has  led  to  exciting  successes, and  inevitably,  novel  challenges.  Many  of  the  reasons  behind  the shift  to  online  polling  are  pragmatic:  they  cost  less,  typically  have larger sample sizes, and have proven they can be accurate in fore‐ casting election results. For example, the online survey technology company  SurveyMonkey  correctly  forecast  the  2014  US  midterms and  2015  UK  elections—which  other  pollsters  missed—by  ran‐ domly  sampling  users  of  its  survey  tools,  people  doing  everything from filling out customer satisfaction surveys to choosing times for their next book club meeting. Some  online  surveys  are  conducted  of  “non-probability”  panels, meaning  that  respondents  opt-in  to  take  surveys  and  that  every member of the public does not have an equal probability of being included   a  basic  tenet  of  traditional  survey  research .  Yet,  even  The Shift to Online Interviewing: Possibilities and Pitfalls      15   those  Internet  panels  performed  better  than  most  traditional  poll‐ sters in 2012. In a review compiled by Nate Silver, four of the seven most  accurate  pollsters  in  2012  conducted  interviews  online.  By contrast, only one of the bottom ten performers used online polls exclusively,  while  another  used  online  panels  as  a  supplement  to automated landline surveys. While online polling is getting better every year, it isn’t perfect. The number of people who take online surveys is rarely large enough to complete a reliable survey in Congressional or local elections. There are  also  vast  differences  in  the  composition  of  panels  on  lines  of educational  attainment  and  political  engagement.  Some  panels  are skewed heavily in the direction of more engaged citizens  who have actively volunteered to take surveys . This is true even if they’re rep‐ resentative  of  the  demographics  of  the  country.  A  recent  Pew Research Center study found that one company in particular  You‐ Gov   was  able  to  achieve  significantly  reduced  bias  and  increased accuracy by weighting to education and civic participation in addi‐ tion to traditional demographic variables. For  firms  like  Echelon  Insights,  the  reasons  to  use  online  polling extend beyond capturing younger demographics or electoral accu‐ racy. Much of the value in online surveys is in opening up new pos‐ sibilities for the types of questions we can ask, and how. Most  polling  is  not  about  elections,  and  even  the  political  polling done for election campaigns is not primarily about knowing who’s winning.  Campaigns  and  issue  organizations  poll  to  know  how  to win the argument. They poll to understand which messages will per‐ suade voters. Properly breaking down and framing the argument— and wording questions accordingly—is critical to this task. Additionally,  the  political  industry  has  a  “big  data,  small  content” problem.  Campaigns  are  ever-more  precise  in  their  targeting,  but not always as rigorous as they should be at validating message effec‐ tiveness. Voter files that have been matched to consumer databases often  come  with  hundreds  or  even  thousands  of  variables  that  we can use to build target segments. And while much effort has been expended on discovering new niche audiences, campaigns often fail to  close  the  loop  by  proving  that  a  given  message  or  ad  actually works  in  the  field.  New  techniques  made  possible  through  online surveys are closing this gap.  16      Chapter 3: How Technology Is Changing the Polling Industry   In  fact,  Internet  polling  may  be  uniquely  suited  to  understanding what  resonates  with  different  populations.  Telephone  surveys  can easily fatigue respondents forced to sit through lengthy 20-minute interviews designed to tease out every angle of an issue. The same questions  can  often  be  asked  more  efficiently  online.  Survey respondents can also rate campaign ads second-by-second online, in a mechanism similar to dial tests in focus groups, except that tech‐ nology allows us to show this message to hundreds of people rather than the dozen or so in a physical focus group. At our firm, we’ve applied this same concept to any piece of text, letting respondents highlight text they like and strike through text they don’t. Methods like  these—which  aren’t  possible  over  the  phone—help  organiza‐ tions  surgically  hone  their  message  before  committing  limited resources to TV ad production and paid media. The Future as a Hybrid We’ve heard the case for gloom and doom in the polling industry: response  rates  are  plummeting,  and  new  techniques  aren’t  reliable enough yet. But upon closer inspection, this narrative doesn’t hold water:  as  the  industry’s  methods  have  shifted,  accuracy  hasn’t  suf‐ fered.  If  anything,  these  shifts  have  been  a  necessity  to  defend against the declining accuracy of what the industry used to do: call voters at random on landline phones. Furthermore, the scope of what we can learn about public opinion and human behavior from data is growing daily, and what we think of as “polling” is only a tiny part of it. Voters exhibit behaviors we can  learn  from  even  when  not  in  a  voting  booth  or  talking  to  an interviewer. Often, the outward signs of this are digital: typing their questions into the Google search box or sharing what they think on Twitter and Facebook. Social media and search trends data is not truly representative of the general  population,  sure,  but  it  can  help  us  go  places  traditional methods can’t. Day-of-the-election Google search share caught late swings to surging candidates and was accurate to within a few per‐ centage points in early Republican primary contests. Language used in  online  conversation  can  help  us  craft  better  surveys  by  making sure our questions are reflective of how people talk about the issues. Media  analytics,  measuring  the  rate  at  which  both  traditional  and new media sources mention candidates, were the canary in the coal  The Future as a Hybrid      17   mine for Donald Trump, with a surge in media coverage and online interest  preceding  his  initial  rise  in  the  polls  and  his  improbable march to the nomination. The  polling  industry  in  the  future  will  be  informed  by  the  time- tested methods of the past, but will increasingly bring in newer dis‐ ciplines,  from  modeling  and  statistics,  to  capturing  and  making sense of mountains of real-time digital data. Technology disruption in the polling industry isn’t just coming. 2016 shows it’s well under‐ way.  18      Chapter 3: How Technology Is Changing the Polling Industry   CHAPTER 4 Data-Driven Media Optimization  Alex Lundry  Alex Lundry is the cofounder and Chief Data Scientist at Deep Root Analytics.  He  is  one  of  the  country’s  leading  experts  on  media  and voter analytics, electoral targeting, and political data mining, and has directed the data science efforts of two presidential campaigns.  It  shouldn’t  surprise  anyone  that  the  Fox  News  Channel  is  a  good place to find and advertise to Republican voters. But what may sur‐ prise  you  is  the  degree  to  which  Republican  campaigns  rely  upon Fox News for their television positioning. In the 2014 Texas Repub‐ lican  primary,  nearly  two-thirds  of  Republican  advertisements  on cable occurred on the network, and in the race for Lieutenant Gov‐ ernor a stunning 99.9% of all candidates’ cable spots ran on Fox. This rush for inventory on Fox News has two rather impactful nega‐ tive  consequences  for  Republican  campaigns.  First,  their  ads  are being  shown  in  an  environment  where  they  are  bound  to  run  up against  their  competitors.  Second,  and  probably  more  consequen‐ tial, the rates Fox can charge for a 30-second ad increase exponen‐ tially as demand rises for a limited supply of slots. Surely there are other,  less-dense  and  less-expensive  places  to  find  Republicans  on television.  In 2014, one Republican campaign that did things differently—the Abbott for Governor campaign—ran only 19% of their cable adver‐ tising  on  Fox.  Why?  They  ran  media  optimization  models  against the Republican primary audience and identified programming that  19   gave them broad reach into their target but also balanced target den‐ sity for each show against its cost efficiency. At the end of the cam‐ paign, a randomized controlled experiment revealed their targeted TV efforts to be the most impactful of all their campaign communi‐ cations. Their buying habits were responsible for a 10.4 percentage point gain in net favorability of the candidate, more than twice as high as the next most impactful form of communication.  Why Media Optimization Matters Data-driven media optimization has become increasingly common since the 2012 elections. Practically, this is a function of the contin‐ ued  dominance  of  television  advertising  in  political  campaigns. Kantar  Media  estimates  that  in  2016,  $4.4  billion  will  be  spent  on television advertising in political races. Though TV ads account for 80%  of  a  typical  campaign’s  spending,  until  the  uptake  of  media optimization  tools,  it  was  the  least  data  driven.  These  techniques couldn’t have come at a better time, as the way viewers interact with televisions has changed  and continues to change  dramatically. At the dawn of the TV era, 68% of TV households watched I Love Lucy. But the top-rated show in 2013 was NBC’s Sunday Night Foot‐ ball, only reaching 12% of households. The growth of cable is a pri‐ mary driver of this change, and indeed, cable’s share of overall TV viewership passed the 50% mark in 2001. Much of this is a function of  the  increasing  number  of  channels  available,  growing  from  an average of 19 in 1984 to more than 189 today. And there’s more orig‐ inal  content:  1999  saw  only  23  original  scripted  series  on  cable, while  this  year  there  are  180.  Moreover,  an  increasing  number  of consumers  are  cutting  their  cable  subscriptions  and  moving  to streaming providers like Netflix or Hulu. But despite the growth of these alternatives, even single Millennials, who are least attached to traditional television programming, watch more than two hours of live television on average every day.  Even  in  this  increasingly  complex  viewing  environment,  many advertisers continue to make suboptimal decisions about where to place their ads. The metaphors used by TV buyers speak volumes about their philosophy, using terms like “saturation,” “carpet bomb‐ ing,” “spray and pray,” or “burning it in.” But in their defense, much of this philosophy is rooted in necessity, as one of the major encum‐  20      Chapter 4: Data-Driven Media Optimization   brances to change in advertising has been the data powering it: the Nielsen household.  The Challenge of Measuring Viewership The television ratings used to drive billions of dollars of advertising each year are built off of the Nielsen company’s panel of individuals in each of the nation’s media markets.   Nielsen recruits a representa‐ tive sample of Americans and either equips them with devices that will  track  their  media  consumption  or  asks  them  to  keep  detailed diaries of their usage. In each media market, Nielsen has a few thou‐ sand tracked respondents. This panel, while carefully recruited and maintained, suffers from a few key problems.  First, diary measurement of TV consumption suffers from inherent issues of precision. Respondents may put off their diary entries and fail  to  accurately  recall  what  they  watched,  or  they  may  give  in  to social desirability bias  the desire to answer questions in a way that respondents think reflects well on themselves  and say they watched Downton Abbey rather than Real Housewives. Their viewing habits may also be more complex than what they can enter in the diary— say, if they are prone to channel flipping. Unfortunately, many key political markets  for example, all of Iowa  are entirely diary-based. And  perhaps  most  importantly,  the  relatively  small  samples  in  the Nielsen panels means viewing habits can only be derived for a few key  demographics  such  as  gender,  age,  and  ethnicity,  and  going deeper into subgroups can be highly unreliable.  This is especially problematic when campaigns have largely moved away from basic demographic targeting in favor of individual voter- level  predictive  models.  Campaigns  no  longer  focus  on  winning “white suburban women,” but instead focus their efforts on individ‐ ual voters who are predicted as likely to be persuadable. Nielsen is incapable  of  providing  viewing  information  for  a  group  like  this because  they  lack  both  the  voter  information  that  campaigns  have and the sample sizes to do a meaningful voter match to their panel. Fortunately, campaigns now have the ability to match their lists of voter targets with media consumption data taken directly from the devices  that  cable  and  satellite  providers  use  to  deliver  program‐ ming. These set-top boxes were originally built only to push content to a household, but many are now able to pull back viewing infor‐ mation  as  well.  In  these  instances,  any  time  a  viewer  changes  the  The Challenge of Measuring Viewership      21   channel on a TV, a new row is created in a dataset that is date- and time-stamped and has the network they arrived at.  The advantages of this data are significant, and it has all the hallmarks of a big data solution: the data has volume  it includes raw viewing data for mil‐ lions of customers , it has velocity  new data is collected every day , and it has veracity  it contains directly observed logs rather than self reports . Working with TV Data Providers of set-top box data take many steps to protect their cus‐ tomers’ privacy when sharing. Records can sometimes be matched directly  to  a  campaign’s  list  of  targeted  voters,  but  the  data  is matched via an independent third party and sent back anonymized so that no analyst can see what a specific household has watched.  Additionally, many providers will go one step further and provide only  aggregated  information—campaigns  will  know  how  many  of their  targets  were  watching  a  particular  program,  but  not  which ones.  The  data  also  has  varying  degrees  of  latency  that  must  be accounted for: some providers will deliver preliminary data within 24 hours that is then backfilled over one to two weeks, while others deliver data in batches two to three weeks afterward.  Once acquired, this data must be further manipulated to be useful. Many sources of viewing data are imbalanced in terms of the type of people that use the service or the geographic coverage of the pro‐ vider. To account for these biases, analysts have to apply weighting similar  to  what  you  might  do  with  a  survey  that  didn’t  include enough  young  people.  This  process  uses  information  about  the households in our viewing data and adjusts the dataset to match our overall target group. The  final  balanced  sample  is  used  to  derive  the  three  key  metrics used by any political media buyer:    the  target  rating,  which  estimates  the  percentage  of  the  target  audience that is watching a particular program    the target index, which tells us whether the proportion of view‐  ers that are in our target audience is above or below average    the targeted cost per point, which serves as a normalized unit cost for ad placements so that we can measure the value we are getting out of each program   22      Chapter 4: Data-Driven Media Optimization   The Federal Communications Commission  FCC  mandates that all political ad buys be placed in a publicly accessible database online, and this opens up a new avenue for campaigns to be adaptive and opportunistic:  competitive  advertising  data.  Campaigns  can  see where  and  when  both  allies  and  opponents  are  purchasing  ads. Frustratingly, the data is released as unstandardized PDFs, but com‐ bining OCR tools with human coding can get the data into an oper‐ able format. From there, matching this planning data to viewership allows  campaigns  to  identify  key  metrics  like  share  of  Voice   the percentage of all ads being run that are coming from the campaign  between campaigns by media market, network, and daypart. Campaigns also have access to retrospective data on what advertise‐ ments  actually  ended  up  airing.  The  data   compiled  by  Kantar Media  is limited to broadcast channels, but it gives a much more detailed look at when spots aired and their precise contents  issues, tone, and so forth , and it can similarly be matched to viewership data.  This  viewer-matching  process  can  also  be  applied  to  “earned media” news coverage of a candidate or campaign: companies like Critical Mention and TVEyes track closed captions and can identify each time a candidate is mentioned. Beyond these viewership and advertising data sources, a variety of other  datasets—social  media  sentiment  about  particular  shows, radio and online media consumption data, or guide data on future programming—can all help to identify promising ad opportunities. Building Optimized Media Strategies Having established key metrics for media-buying and assessed the overall media environment, campaigns have a number of options for creating an optimized flight of inventory. The nature of this optimi‐ zation depends on the goals of the particular moment. Campaigns must choose between, or try to balance, reach and frequency.  That is, for a given cost, an advertiser can choose between reaching many people a few times by targeting programs with high viewership or reaching a few people many times by purchasing more spots on pro‐ grams with fewer viewers.  Moreover, campaigns are usually trying to do this with an advertis‐ ing schedule that gives them both “horizontal balance”  good repre‐ sentation in each of the TV viewing dayparts  and “vertical balance”  a mix across all of the networks . This is usually an attempt to max‐  Building Optimized Media Strategies      23   imize a schedule’s unduplicated reach—the calculation of the num‐ ber of viewers that you are reaching at least once. And indeed, this becomes another important evaluative metric for the overall health of the ad buy. Finally, campaigns can also use this viewership data alongside other data sources that help give them a holistic view of the political media landscape.  Tracking  earned  media   free  publicity  gained  through social  media,  word  of  mouth,  news  mentions,  etc. ,  for  example, would enable a campaign to identify not only which newscasts most often mention their candidate, but also how many swing voters were likely  to  be  watching.  With  this  information,  the  campaign  could choose to run ads on the same programs to complement or respond to  that  coverage,  or  alternatively,  to  direct  ad  resources  to  other channels where the audience is less likely to hear about the candi‐ date otherwise.  The  complexity  of  media  optimization  underscores  the  need  for analysts in the political space who possess a facility with varied data‐ sets and can quickly process, clean, and merge these data with oth‐ ers. This means familiarity with cloud-based storage solutions like Amazon  Web  Services,  distributed  data  processing  platforms  like Spark,  query  languages  like  PostgreSQL,  and  programming  lan‐ guages like R. At the same time, these analysts also need to under‐ stand the intricacies of the media buying process and how it fits into a broader campaign operation. Media  optimization,  previously  the  province  of  simplistic  demo‐ graphic  targeting,  has  had  to  grow  in  its  complexity  to  match  the nuances of modern media consumption. Fortunately, the data now exists  to  perform  the  necessarily  sophisticated  analysis  to  account for this, and it has come at a critical time. A new generation of mar‐ keters has grown used to the targeting and optimization capabilities of online advertising, and applying the same optimized approach to TV  allows  campaigns  to  make  their  largest  budgetary  outlay  both more effective and more efficient.  24      Chapter 4: Data-Driven Media Optimization   CHAPTER 5 How  and Why  to Follow the Money in Politics  Derek Willis  Derek Willis is a news applications developer at ProPublica, where he maintains political data websites and APIs and does some reporting, too. He previously worked at The New York Times.  Campaign finance data is ultimately about behavior. Journalists fol‐ low the money in politics because it reveals the connections between donors and politicians and tells us something about how campaigns operate. Fundraising and spending data helps us see whether politi‐ cians actually do what they say, what each candidate’s priorities are in  running  a  campaign,  and  which  people  and  organizations  play major roles in campaigns. Even though the amounts of money can be distracting, campaign finance data is a reminder that politics is about people and their decisions. As a journalist, what interests me is how campaigns raise and spend their money, and in particular how the Internet is changing that. I try to find stories in the data, keeping in mind that the best stories involve  people  doing  things—sometimes  fascinating  or  unique, sometimes banal or criminal. Getting Campaign Finance Data First, a brief history of federal campaign finance data in the United States. Whenever you hear, “This is the most expensive election in  25   history,” know that “history” means since 1978, since that was when the Federal Election Commission  FEC  began collecting and pub‐ lishing data that campaigns, journalists, and researchers can down‐ load  and  use.  Here’s  how  it  works:  political  campaigns  and organizations  “committees”  register with the FEC, then file reports listing their contributions and expenditures on a regular schedule. The FEC takes that information, standardizes it, and releases weekly files covering a two-year election cycle on its FTP site. For years, that was the only way to get FEC data: wait until Monday morning when updated files were published, then download them, and  import  them  into  your  database  of  choice.  And  the  practice continues  today—rare  among  government  agencies,  the  FEC believes in and practices backwards compatibility for its data files. You could, if you wanted to, maintain a local copy of every disclosed contribution since 1978. But there’s a big catch: for years, that infor‐ mation  had  to  be  entered  by  hand  by  the  FEC’s  contractors.  Because of a quirk in campaign finance law, reports by senate can‐ didates still require this step.  That meant  and still means  a delay of weeks for some data, as some filings run thousands of pages long. Thankfully,  most  committees  now  file  electronic  reports,  which means we can see them almost immediately on filing deadlines. This is a very good thing for people interested in campaigns, and not just because we don’t have to wait for data. Electronic filing means we actually  get  more  data:  expenditures,  which  the  FEC  did  not  key‐ punch for years, are now available, as are street addresses for donors and  recipients,  which  the  FEC  avoided  as  a  cost-saving  measure when data entry was labor-intensive. A small group of developers at The New York Times, the Associated Press, and ProPublica, among other news organizations, have writ‐ ten software to parse the electronic filings and make them more use‐ ful for journalism. But there’s a catch here, too. The electronic filings are  considered  unofficial  by  the  FEC  until  they  are  processed  and released  via  FTP.  And  for  good  reason,  too:  they  do  contain  mis‐ takes, in terms of both substantive content and data formatting. So, as  the  adage  goes:  timeliness,  accuracy,  completeness—pick  two, most of the time.  26      Chapter 5: How  and Why  to Follow the Money in Politics   The Toolkit The hard part about working with FEC data isn’t the technical stuff. If  you  know  SQL  and  a  general-purpose  language  like  Python  or Ruby, it’s not hard to work with the FTP data, which has solid docu‐ mentation.  More  important  are  the  lessons  learned  from  working with  the  data  and  understanding  the  political  system  that  it describes. That’s why it can help to have software that is regularly interviewing  the  data,  comparing  new  records  to  older  ones  and identifying patterns and outliers. At ProPublica, where I maintain our campaign finance data, we use PostgreSQL for storage and a Ruby on Rails application to handle regular updates, common analysis tasks, and the API that we offer  the FEC has its own API, in beta . Almost everything is automated. We load new electronic filings every 15 minutes, and update some of the larger files produced by the FEC daily or weekly. We need the ability to make manual edits sometimes, but not often, and usually to fix an obvious error in the data. This  isn’t  exactly  big  data  by  industry  standards:  we’ve  got  more than 100 million rows of data covering contributions, expenses, and other  records  included  in  the  FTP  data  dating  back  more  than  10 years.  But  some  individual  filings,  which  can  contain  multiple record layouts in a single text file and include millions of individual contributions, can consume a lot of resources to load and process. And while bigger campaigns account for more of the data, fundrais‐ ing occurs whether an election is considered competitive or not. Part of the software process is translating the questions we have into code. Most of these are basic heuristics, but machine learning can play  a  role  in  standardization;  The  New  York  Times  has  developed software to help standardize donors based on the name and address information contained in filings. We’ve also adapted statistical tests to find connections among donors and recipients, using cosine sim‐ ilarity as a measurement of how alike two recipients are. The harder task is trying to learn enough from changes in the entire campaign finance  system  to  look  for  things  we’ve  not  seen  before.  A  lot  of those changes have come about thanks to the Internet.  The Toolkit      27   What the Internet Has Changed When Bernie Sanders began his presidential campaign in 2015, he had few of the traditional fundraising networks to rely upon. As a senator from Vermont, he had access to some individuals willing to give him donations of up to the $2,700 federal limit, and something of a national following, albeit small compared to some other politi‐ cians. But he didn’t need one, thanks to online fundraising. Support‐ ers  could—and  did—repeatedly  donate  small  amounts  to  Sanders’ campaign, mostly through ActBlue, a unique type of committee that serves as a conduit to Democratic campaigns and related organiza‐ tions. ActBlue  provides  campaigns  with  the  standard  tools  of  a  digital campaign  platform—hosting  websites,  managing  email  programs, and  processing  donations—but  the  group  itself  is  organized  as  a nonprofit political action committee rather than a for-profit vendor. Because of that, FEC rules require ActBlue to report the details of all donations it processes for its clients, not just those from donors who have  given  a  total  of  $200  or  more   the  standard  for  donations directly  to  campaigns  or  through  commercial  processors .  This means  that  ActBlue’s  filings  provide  an  unprecedented  amount  of data to analyze. The group’s 2015 year-end filing, for example, was the largest single filing in the FEC’s history, at over 3.1 million pages, and  its  monthly  filings  have  averaged  more  than  a  million  pages each in 2016. Thanks to ActBlue’s filings, we have a much better idea of who Sand‐ ers’  financial  supporters  are,  and  likewise  donors  to  other  major committees   such  as  the  Democratic  Congressional  Campaign Committee   that  also  use  ActBlue’s  platform.  By  matching  these contributions to voter file records, campaigns can use this informa‐ tion to identify voters receptive to these campaigns’ messages.  By law, other committees cannot directly use Sanders’ contribution data to  solicit  for  their  own  fundraising,  but  they  can  use  it  to  help improve what they know about politically active individuals.  We can’t see this in real-time, but committees file at least once every three  months   with  more  frequent  filings  by  larger  organizations and closer to Election Day , and committees often amend previous filings in between to correct mistakes and account for refunds. We do see filings almost every day, and direct online access to the FEC’s records makes it possible to examine not just the financial activity of  28      Chapter 5: How  and Why  to Follow the Money in Politics   a  single  campaign  or  race  but  of  the  entire  system  of  campaign finance. That’s the next step for those of us who work with campaign finance data. The Challenges Ahead To study the system as a whole, we need complete data, and right now we don’t have it. The most important single step that Congress could take is to require senate candidates to file their reports elec‐ tronically. This would close a loophole that makes it nearly impossi‐ ble to provide a complete picture before an election is held. Another task that’s getting easier is donor and recipient standardiza‐ tion.  Both  require  a  combination  of  machine  learning  techniques that  enable  comparisons  of  large  numbers  of  records  and  manual research. Now that it’s easier than ever to give smaller amounts, we need  to  pay  more  attention  to  donors  who  make  dozens  of  small contributions, not just wealthy ones who can write checks for thou‐ sands of dollars at a time, which has long been our focus. Shifting towards  examining  these  donors  could  make  the  system  more approachable  to  more  people,  since  most  Americans  don’t  make political contributions. Spending data isn’t just overlooked; it’s also one of the clearest indi‐ cations of political intent in campaigns, as opposed to what politi‐ cians might say. There’s a phrase I’ve heard clergy members tell their congregations  that  applies  here:  “Don’t  tell  me  what  you  believe. Show me your checkbook, and I’ll tell you what you believe.” Finally, we’ve long placed an emphasis on campaign finance in races for president and Congress, and less on state and local races. That’s largely because there’s a single federal system for campaign finance data, while each state runs its own for non-federal races. The single federal regulatory system is easier to deal with, but 50 disparate reg‐ ulatory environments can provide opportunities for those looking to exploit the system for personal or political benefit. Most people don’t think of elections as “federal” or “state,” and races at one level can impact the others. What we need to work on in the years ahead are systems that help make it easier to see the money connections between campaigns no matter where they are or who contributes to them. The open data example set by the FEC is a good  The Challenges Ahead      29   one  for  states  and  counties  to  follow   and  some  state  and  local authorities do that and more , even if it’s not perfect in every case.  30      Chapter 5: How  and Why  to Follow the Money in Politics   CHAPTER 6 Digital Advertising in the Post-Obama Era  Daniel Scarvalone  Daniel Scarvalone is the Associate Director of Research and Data at Bully Pulpit Interactive  BPI . BPI serves as the largest digital mar‐ keter for the Democratic party as well as working for major corpora‐ tions  and  causes.  Before  joining  BPI,  he  served  as  Director  of  Data and Modeling at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in  2014  and  as  National  Reporting  Director  for  the  Obama  2012 campaign.  President  Obama’s  presidential  campaigns  revolutionized  the  way technology and data could be used together to identify and speak to voters’ interests, reflecting the increasingly sophisticated application of digital marketing to politics. But in this election cycle, and for the last 20 years, political campaigns still spend more than 70 cents of every dollar to reach voters via broadcast television. While broad‐ cast TV is an effective medium to talk to voters and change minds, there is great debate about how cost-efficient it is. In politics, there are countless conversations about the importance of matching the “red bar”  the amount of money the opposition is spending   to  the  “blue  bar”   the  amount  of  money  our  allies  are spending ,  irrespective  of  cost.  This  arms  race  means  TV  stations can charge an exorbitant price for ad inventory, especially as Elec‐ tion Day approaches. And this paradigm completely overlooks the effects of ad frequency—i.e., whether the 30th TV ad each week is as  31   effective  as  the  10th—taking  away  a  key  tool  for  running  efficient campaigns. As  voters  spend  more  time  than  ever  online,  digital  advertising combines  the  targeting,  persuasion,  and  measurement  capabilities that move the most votes at the least cost. Modern campaigns can no longer win using TV ads alone. They must shift their dollars to mediums where they can quantify the bang they are getting for their buck. This shift is critical to what will make or break the future of political campaigns, as well as how corporations talk to consumers or advocacy organizations talk to supporters. My  firm,  Bully  Pulpit  Interactive   BPI ,  is  a  digital  advertising agency that specializes in public affairs, corporate reputation, social impact,  and  political  campaigns.  I  work  on  the  BPI  Labs  team, where I focus on connecting measurement and analytics to our digi‐ tal advertising campaigns, and building out technical infrastructure throughout the entire firm. How Digital Advertising Works in a Campaign Digital  has  become  an  integrated  operation  throughout  campaign structures and part of the core strategy of most campaigns, operat‐ ing  at  the  intersection  of  fundraising,  communications,  and  voter contact efforts. Many parts of a digital advertising program are gen‐ erally  run  in-house,  from  email  writing  to  volunteer  recruitment and mobilization. For paid digital advertising, the process is often similar to that of tel‐ evision  advertising:  campaigns  have  the  final  say  on  the  strategy, budget,  and  message  of  a  buy  recommended  by  consultants,  but leave the execution and buying tactics to an outside firm. Like mod‐ eling, analytics, and television ad buying, the economies of scale that enable efficient digital buying and measurement aren’t available to individual  campaigns  like  they  are  for  high-volume  agencies  like BPI. At the outset of a campaign, the leadership will set an overall cam‐ paign  budget  and  allocate  that  budget  to  different  types  of  voter contact.  After  polling  and  research  determines  the  messaging  and audience strategy, the digital staff works with the rest of the consult‐ ing  and  leadership  teams  to  define  and  execute  media  buys  that attempt to register, persuade, mobilize, or turn out voters.  32      Chapter 6: Digital Advertising in the Post-Obama Era   Efficient and effective digital advertising programs are informed by a few rules and principles:  1. Let the audience be your guide.  Leverage  the  sophistication  of  political  analytics  programs  to define the precise audience you want to reach, and then build strategies matching the consumption and behavioral patterns of that audience  2. Tailor the creative.  Digital advertising allows campaigns to tailor creative elements of  advertising  to  specific  audiences  at  scale.  Audiences  can  be shown the customized messages that will move them the most, instead of speaking to everyone with one megaphone. But only be as granular as your creative capacity allows—each individual voter doesn’t need his or her own version of an ad. 3. Don’t just measure how much, measure how well.  Focus  not  on  how  much  media  was  delivered,  but  instead  on how that media actually changed the minds of their target audi‐ ences.  Campaigns  should  be  consistently  integrating  attitudi‐ nally  based,  experimentally-informed  programs   EIPs   to measure  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  every  dollar  they spend.  This last point is the key area of focus for digital marketers in 2016 and  beyond,  and  the  motivation  behind  many  recent  advances  in technology and tools for advertising agencies on both sides of the aisle. Using Experimentally-Informed Programs to Measure Effectiveness Borrowing from concepts developed in the academic world, an EIP divides an audience into random subsets that are exposed to specific advertising  conditions   treatments   or  to  no  ads  at  all   control . Because these groupings are assigned at random, we can assume that their  attitudes  or  activities  would  have  been  identical   statistical noise aside  absent any advertising. Therefore, any differences can be attributed to the advertising received by the treatment group.  Using Experimentally-Informed Programs to Measure Effectiveness      33   EIPs  follow  the  same  basic  principles  as  traditional  A B  tests,  but because  the  outcomes  they  measure  are  more  complicated  than basic click-through or purchase behavior, they also typically involve some kind of separate post-exposure measurement. Crucially, these measurement  cycles  take  place  within  the  advertising  campaign itself—allowing for the applications of those insights to optimize the remainder of the program. EIPs also allow for the testing of multi- part treatments and other complex strategies. Tools for Delivering Better Ads and Measuring Their Impacts In order to convince campaigns, companies, and causes to buy into digital advertising, the industry has had to prove that digital adver‐ tising could raise money, mobilize activists, and provide engagement with its content. But the days of proving that only by impressions and clicks are over. Now, in addition to those metrics, there are oth‐ ers that matter: exposure time, creative heat mapping, and audible  viewable metrics to ensure clients are getting the most exposure for their investment. A key decision point for any digital advertiser is choosing partners to provide the types of tools and metrics that are necessary to run a smart ad campaign and tell a story about effectiveness. Parts of the digital ecosystem are well monopolized, and custom-building a sol‐ ution would be foolish. No one has built a person-based advertising platform that rivals Facebook’s, a buying platform with breadth and reach that rivals Google’s Doubleclick, or a matching platform that rivals Liveramp and Neustar. This parallels the situation for offline components  of  a  campaign  as  well:  an  overwhelming  majority  of Democratic campaigns use VAN to record and measure their voter contacts,  BSD  to  send  their  email,  and  Acxiom,  Experian,  or Infogroup to supplement their voter files with consumer records. But in other areas, the ecosystem is sufficiently fragmented for agen‐ cies to have leeway in choosing with whom to partner to help detect fraud, to measure viewability, or to reach certain audiences. Across existing  technology  solutions,  a  lot  of  the  metrics  that  have  been effectively commoditized in the digital space don’t effectively tell the story of the persuasive effectiveness of our campaigns, and whether advertising  dollars  actually  moved  the  minds  of  our  audiences. When we talk about moving minds, we want to know which features  34      Chapter 6: Digital Advertising in the Post-Obama Era   of  our  campaign  made  voters  more  likely  to  retain  a  fact  about  a candidate, feel less favorably about an opponent, or shift their vote choice. In this environment, BPI made the decision to build its own meas‐ urement  tool,  Vantage,  which  quantifies  the  persuasive  impact  of different  types  of  digital  marketing.  By  surveying  individual  users online and connecting those surveys to exposure to a specific digital campaign, we’ve begun to build a platform that can integrate the full range of advertising tactics outlined above and to learn how to apply those tactics for maximum effect. None  of  what  can  be  done  now  would  have  been  possible  in  the technological ecosystem that existed 5 or 10 years ago. The ability to leverage scalable, modular pieces of infrastructure like Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Storage are absolutely critical to building the technology that powers digital advertising. These solutions give us the ability to rapidly and efficiently scale what we do to meet the ever-evolving  solutions  in  the  ecosystem,  without  locking  into  an unsustainable cost curve. Finally, there is some critical nuance to figure out which parts of our ecosystem can be automated and repeated, and which parts need to be iterated on and produced anew for each client. Measurement as a science belies easy cycles of productize-and-forget-it. Ad measure‐ ment technology has to be as tailored as the advertising that we run for  a  given  client  or  vertical.  And  since  the  advertising  ecosystem changes every quarter, the ad technology has to evolve as well. Adapting to a Changing Campaign Environment The most critical asset in broadening adoption of digital advertising isn’t technology as much as it is the way we talk about it. If digital practitioners  can’t  use  measurement  to  demonstrate  the  value  of their work, then it won’t be taken seriously, no matter how novel the campaign  or  technology  used  to  analyze  it.  What  we  do  is  just  as important as how we talk about it and measure it. The  end  result  focuses  on  a  clear  ROI  of  the  overall  persuasive impact of a campaign, but also on the relative performance of differ‐ ent  messages  and  tactics.  For  years,  campaigns  have  responded  to mail and field measurements that have put a precise cost-per-vote  Adapting to a Changing Campaign Environment      35   on their programs. Now digital advertising can optimize for persua‐ sion  in  the  same  way,  and  provide  campaigns  an  apples-to-apples metric of cost-effectiveness across mediums and tactics. Applying These Lessons for Non-Political Clients Digital  advertising  should  be  tailored  to  the  specifics  of  the  client and the objective of the campaign, but many parts of our approach remain  constant.  Focusing  on  a  defined  universe  of  individuals— from a model, poll, or external list—is a critical component of plan‐ ning,  executing,  communicating,  and  measuring  the  success  of advertising. Whether a campaign is devoted to motivating someone to  vote,  or  getting  someone  to  buy  a  car,  it  is  trying  to  generate actions that are difficult to move and measure at scale. Whether voting for a candidate or purchasing a car, the actions an audience  takes  can  be  difficult  to  attribute  to  the  specific  digital advertising they have received. To meet this challenge, it is impor‐ tant to create specific messages within a campaign to move an audi‐ ence through a “ladder of engagement”—for example, first getting someone  to  sign  up  for  a  mailing  list,  then  priming  them  to  pay attention to those emails, and ultimately inspiring them to make a purchase  or  donation.  This  allows  us  to  measure  success  at  each stage  of  the  process  and  optimize  the  overall  program  toward  the high-bar end goal. A deliberate focus on specific steps along the way helps us run better campaigns by making it possible to measure and optimize  a  program’s  effects  before  the  final  vote  tallies  or  sales numbers are in. What Comes Next Future campaigns, especially at the downballot level, will continue to embrace  and  elevate  digital  considerations  in  campaign  decision- making. More and more campaigns in 2018 and beyond will be led by staff with digital expertise or who have run digital programs. In a technological ecosystem that’s dominated at the top by industry giants like Google and Facebook, and fragmented at the bottom by hundreds if not thousands of ancillary solutions, the coming years will force advertisers to make difficult decisions about how to pri‐ oritize platforms and approaches to stay ahead of the curve. Digital  36      Chapter 6: Digital Advertising in the Post-Obama Era   components of a campaign are dependent on technological partners to  achieve  scale  and  efficiency,  and  so  decisions  about  advertising technology affect every facet of its program. Once those digital com‐ ponents  are  decided  upon,  you’ll  see  advertisers  begin  to  build budgets from the ground up  based on target audience size, ad ven‐ dors’ capacity, and a proven understanding of where marginal dol‐ lars are best spent , instead of allocating budgets from the top down based on outdated rules  like spending every required dollar to ach‐ ieve  television  parity,  and  then  allocating  the  rest  among  a  cam‐ paign’s other functions . And finally, digital survey technology—the actual tools that collect attitudes and quantify effectiveness—will continue to evolve. Cam‐ paigns  will  come  to  expect  the  same  forms  of  feedback  from  the online world as they do the offline world, and that means being able to  collect  more  demographic  information,  detailed  feedback,  and open-ended  qualitative  outputs  from  survey  respondents.  Digital advertisers  that  focus  on  developing  their  measurement  solutions will be the ones best equipped to successfully participate in the dis‐ cussions about campaign planning at the highest levels.   What Comes Next      37    CHAPTER 7 Election Forecasting in the Media  Natalie Jackson  Natalie Jackson is Senior Polling Editor at Huffington Post, coordinat‐ ing the Pollster section of the site. Her primary focus is on polling cov‐ erage and methodology, statistical methods, and using polls to forecast elections. Natalie has a PhD in political science from the University of Oklahoma,  with  heavy  emphasis  on  statistics,  survey  methodology, and American politics.  Election  forecasting  has  been  around  for  many  years  in  academic circles, but in the last few presidential election cycles it has seen tre‐ mendous  growth  in  the  media.  Networks  and  other  media  outlets have gathered polls and made electoral projections for decades, but recently advanced statistical models have become more prominent in  elections  coverage.  In  2008,  Nate  Silver  debuted  his  FiveThir‐ tyEight  blog  with  his  projection  that  then-Senator  Barack  Obama would defeat Senator John McCain, and the market for that kind of statistical model has expanded in each subsequent election cycle. In 2014, The Huffington Post, The New York Times, FiveThirtyEight  by then its own media outlet , The Daily Kos, and The Washington Post all had forecast models for the midterm senate races. The process of election forecasting is complex, but the general pub‐ lic seems to love forecasts. A challenge, however, is getting that audi‐ ence to understand that a forecast—for example, Candidate A has a 60% chance of winning—is not as simple as it sounds.  39   The Basic Mechanics of Election Forecasting Most  media  forecast  models  use  time-series  methods  to  combine data  into  a  rolling  daily  prediction  of  how  likely  a  candidate  is  to win an election. Much of the data comes from publicly released pre- election polls, although there are many other data sources that can be included as well. The key difference between these forecast mod‐ els and simpler polling aggregations is that forecasts project beyond the polls, whereas the aggregations simply average the most recent polls. Every forecast is slightly different, but there are some basics that dif‐ ferentiate  them:  whether  the  modeling  technique  is  Bayesian,  and whether the model includes data other than polls. Bayesian versus Frequentist Modeling From  a  data  perspective,  the  fundamental  difference  between  a Bayesian  forecast  model  and  a  non-Bayesian   frequentist   forecast model is the ability to incorporate ''priors” into the model that quan‐ tify what’s already known about the election. We usually know quite a bit about upcoming elections by learning from past elections, so this prior information can give us a place to start with our predic‐ tions. For example, the 2014 senate forecast model I created for The Huf‐ fington Post used a Bayesian method: Kalman filtering. To come up with priors, I used the Cook Report’s estimates of whether the senate race was a “tossup” or was leaning, likely, or solidly Republican or Democrat. An analysis of past Cook ratings and election results pro‐ vided information on the distribution of final vote shares for races assigned  to  each  rating  category  in  past  election  cycles.  Those parameters served as the priors for the 2014 senate races, effectively incorporating all the information inherent in current Cook ratings as well  as  their  past  performance.  As  new  polling  data  became  avail‐ able, it was used to update the priors and produce a distribution of possible outcomes for each race. The means of those “posterior” dis‐ tributions were the vote share estimates, and the distributions them‐ selves provided the estimates of uncertainty and the probabilities of each outcome. Non-Bayesian modeling eliminates the priors and works with tradi‐ tional  regression  techniques.  The  basic  procedure  is  similar,  how‐  40      Chapter 7: Election Forecasting in the Media   ever.  Polling  averages  are  typically  calculated  using  some  form  of time-series model. If election fundamentals—other non-polling data that  can  help  predict  election  outcomes,  such  as  the  state  of  the economy—are included, they are combined or modeled to get a fun‐ damentals  estimate.  Then  the  polls  and  fundamentals  are  put together to generate a single outcome. These outcomes can still be expressed in probabilistic terms using the confidence intervals and standard errors that the models produce, so that both the Bayesian and frequentist models are reported similarly. It is only in reading the details of each model that the difference in techniques becomes clear. Bayesian modeling requires different software tools than frequentist regression modeling. Most of the coding and analysis can be done in R, but you need special-purpose Bayesian modeling software such as JAGS  for Mac users  or BUGS  for Windows users  to execute the model.  For  frequentist  modeling,  depending  on  the  exact  type  of model you choose, you can use a wide variety of statistical modeling software,  including  many  open-source  packages  available  in  R, Python, and other common programming languages. Fundamentals versus Polls-Only Another  key  difference  between  types  of  forecast  models  in  the media is whether the model includes so-called “fundamentals” about the election or is only using polls to construct the forecast. Funda‐ mentals are generally anything besides horserace polls that contains information about how the election might turn out: indicators of the national mood, measures of the partisan makeup of the district or state, incumbents’ previous win margins, measures of political expe‐ rience  for  each  candidate,  fundraising  and  ideology  scores  for  the candidates, or any other relevant metric. There isn’t any evidence that fundamentals dramatically improve a model’s  predictive  power  close  to  the  election,  but  they  do  offer more long-term stability when the election is months away. Funda‐ mentals provide more information about the electorate and the gen‐ eral  election  atmosphere,  and  they  don’t  change  as  frequently  as polls can a long time before the election.  The Basic Mechanics of Election Forecasting      41   Estimating the Electoral College Most  models  use  Monte  Carlo  simulations  to  estimate  the  final probabilities of a presidential candidate winning an election across the various states, or as in the 2014 models, to estimate the likeli‐ hood that a party will maintain or take over control of the Senate. The  probability  of  each  individual  state  race  going  Democratic  or Republican is put into the simulations, and in a presidential election forecast,  winning  a  state  is  converted  to  the  number  of  electoral votes the winner would receive for that state; in a senate forecast the election in each state is counted as one seat. The Monte Carlo pro‐ cess simulates many different random elections and the proportion of times a presidential candidate gets more than 270 electoral votes or a party has 51 or more seats in the Senate is the final probability for the outcome of the contests. Communicating About the Model In media forecasting, it’s not enough to have a good model. You have to be able to explain it to the audience. This task can be even more difficult than building the model itself. Explaining the uncertainty of probability-based forecasting to the general public is a task that has flummoxed scientists, and particularly weather scientists, for many years.  It  seems  no  matter  how  many  times  you  remind  the  public that  forecasts  are  based  on  uncertain  probabilities,  some  people want to read the numbers as completely certain, and then castigate the analysts if the outcome is different from their expectations. All of the major media forecasts for 2014 measured the outcome in terms  of  the  probability  that  the  Republicans  would  take  over  the majority in the Senate and splashed those numbers on a main fore‐ cast  landing  page.  Most  forecasters  did  explain  the  uncertainty  of the  forecasts,  often  in  great  detail.  However,  these  discussions  of uncertainty were typically buried in long discussions of the methods used to generate the estimates—which most people will not read all the way through—and the message was easily lost. The  probably large  portion of the audience who went directly to the forecast pages, ignoring the methods explanations, saw numbers that declared how likely the Republicans were to take over the Sen‐ ate  without  any  explanation  for  what  an  80%  likelihood  actually means. Presenting the numbers with the appropriate explanation of uncertainty, without requiring the audience to spend an hour read‐  42      Chapter 7: Election Forecasting in the Media   ing model details, is something public forecasters will need to work on in the future. The Future of Election Forecasting Media-produced  forecasts  might  not  proliferate  much  more,  how‐ ever. These kinds of forecasts that need to appeal to a broader audi‐ ence could face a few issues if more outlets get into the game. First, presumably there is a finite audience that these media forecasts can appeal to because of their statistical complexity. Additionally, most forecasts  generally  come  to  the  same  conclusion  as  Election  Day nears,  so  the  utility  of  developing  more  forecasts  is  questionable. The skillset is expensive and complex. At the same time, forecasting is likely to become more common as technological advances make statistical tools more user friendly, also similar to what happened with polls in the last few decades. It’s pos‐ sible that more forecasts would flood the market and the bubble of election forecasting popularity could burst, particularly if forecasts are not as accurate as they have been between 2008 and 2014. And, although the forecasts might already seem ubiquitous, 2016 is only the third presidential election cycle to feature forecasting. It remains to be seen whether forecasting is a temporary trend or will become a permanent fixture in election coverage.  The Future of Election Forecasting      43    Epilogue: The Future of Political Data Science  Andrew Therriault  The 2016 election cycle will be remembered for many things, but for those who work in politics, it may be best remembered as the year that  political  data  reached  maturity.  For  years,  much  of  the  “old guard” of political strategists resisted the growing influence of data and  analytics,  preferring  to  stick  with  a  more  traditional  formula: instinct  and  experience  built  up  over  time.  This  conflict  persisted even as the 2008 and 2012 presidential races showed the advantages data  can  provide,  particularly  when  one  campaign  has  a  distinct technological edge. In 2016, though, it’s clear that this fight is all but over, and the data side has won. When it comes to technology, political data science is likely to fol‐ low a similar trajectory to the one playing out in the broader field of data science. If anything, the political field is particularly well-suited to  rapid  adoption  of  new  technologies,  since  the  election  cycle allows for many organizations to completely overhaul their technol‐ ogy  every  2  to  4  years.  Though  physical  hardware  is  still  used  by many organizations, the adoption of cloud platforms like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure has quickly become mainstream. Along the same lines, while commercial data analysis software such as Stata and SPSS was once standard, most organizations are now relying mainly on open source tools like Python and R. And as the scale of our datasets grows, traditional relational databases such as MySQL  and  Microsoft  SQL  Server  are  being  replaced  with  dis‐ tributed  platforms  such  as  HP  Vertica,  Amazon  Redshift,  and  the Hadoop ecosystem.  45   For novice and veteran data scientists alike, working in politics is a great opportunity to quickly build skills working with some of the most advanced technology and techniques available. While it’s prob‐ ably too late for readers to become part of a campaign this year, you don’t need to wait until 2020 to get involved. In 2017, there will be elections for governor and state legislature in both Virginia and New Jersey,  mayoral  races  in  many  cities  including  New  York,  Los Angeles,  Seattle,  and  Boston,  and  a  variety  of  other  local  contests throughout the country. And in 2018, voters will elect 36 governors, 33 US senators, and all 435 members of the US House of Represen‐ tatives. So even after the presidential race is over, the field of politi‐ cal data science will continue to grow and evolve for many years to come.  46      Epilogue: The Future of Political Data Science   About the Authors Andrew  Therriault  was  the  Democratic  National  Committee’s Director  of  Data  Science  from  2014  to  2016,  leading  a  team  that developed voter targeting models and other analytic tools used by thousands of Democratic campaigns.
