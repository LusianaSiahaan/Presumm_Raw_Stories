It aims to address the challenges  encountered in developing single-page applications. React's core principles are  declarative code, efficiency, flexibility, and improved developer experience.  What better way of learning a new technology than diving deep into it while  working on something? This book will guide you with the help of different projects,  each focusing on the specific features of React in your journey of mastering React.  We will cover everything from JSX, add-ons, performance, and Redux.  Let the journey commence!  What this book covers Chapter 1, Getting Started with React, covers the basics of ReactJS by building a simple  app with static data. We will study top-level API of React and its basic building blocks. Chapter 2, JSX in Depth, does a deep dive into JSX and how to use it with React. We  will also look at a few gotchas that need to be considered while working with JSX. Chapter 3, Data Flow and Life Cycle Events, focuses on data flow between React  components and complete life cycle of a component. Chapter 4, Composite Dynamic Components and Forms, shows how to build composite  dynamic components using React with more focus on forms while building a form  wizard application. Chapter 5, Mixins and the DOM, covers mixins, refs, and how React interacts   with DOM.  [ v ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 6, React on the Server, uses React on the server side to render HTML and   learn more about what server-side rendering brings to the table by building a   search application based on Open Library Books API. Chapter 7, React Addons, continues to use the search application and enhances it with  various add-ons provided with React. We will study the use cases of these add-ons. Chapter 8, Performance of React Apps, discusses everything about the performance of  the React app by going deep into how React renders the content and helps in making  our apps faster. Chapter 9, React Router and Data Models, helps in building a Pinterest-style application  and discusses routing using react-router. We will also discuss how various data  models can be used with React, including Backbone models. Chapter 10, Animation, focuses on making our Pinterest app more interactive with  animations and how to use them effectively with React. Chapter 11, React Tools, takes a step back and discusses various tools that we will  use in our journey while working with React. We will study the tools such as Babel,  ESLint, React dev tools, and Webpack. Chapter 12, Flux, explains how to build a social media-tracker application while using  the Flux architecture. We will discuss the need for the Flux architecture and what it  brings to the table. Chapter 13, Redux and React, covers using Redux—a popular state management  library—to enhance the social media-tracker application further in order to use  Redux-based state management.

[ ix ]  www.it-ebooks.info   www.it-ebooks.info   Getting Started with React  Web development has seen a huge advent of Single Page Application  SPA  in the  past couple of years. Early development was simple—reload a complete page to  perform a change in the display or perform a user action. The problem with this was  a huge round-trip time for the complete request to reach the web server and back to  the client.  Then came AJAX, which sent a request to the server, and could update parts of the  page without reloading the current page. Moving in the same direction, we saw the  emergence of the SPAs.  Wrapping up the heavy frontend content and delivering it to the client browser just  once, while maintaining a small channel for communication with the server based on  any event; this is usually complemented by thin API on the web server.  The growth in such apps has been complemented by JavaScript libraries and  frameworks such as Ext JS, KnockoutJS, BackboneJS, AngularJS, EmberJS,   and more recently, React and Polymer.  Let's take a look at how React fits in this ecosystem and get introduced to it in   this chapter.  [ 1 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:     What is React and why do we use React?    Data flows in the component    Component displays the view based on state of the component    Component defines display of the view, irrespective of data contained, thus   reducing the dependency and complexity of state for display     User interactions may change state of component from handlers    Components are reused and re-rendered  What is React? ReactJS tries to solve the problem from the View layer. It can very well be defined  and used as the V in any of the MVC frameworks. It's not opinionated about how it  should be used. It creates abstract representations of views. It breaks down parts of  the view in the Components. These components encompass both the logic to handle  the display of view and the view itself. It can contain data that it uses to render the  state of the app.  To avoid complexity of interactions and subsequent render processing required,  React does a full render of the application. It maintains a simple flow of work.  React is founded on the idea that DOM manipulation is an expensive operation and  should be minimized. It also recognizes that optimizing DOM manipulation by hand  will result in a lot of boilerplate code, which is error-prone, boring, and repetitive.  React solves this by giving the developer a virtual DOM to render to instead of the  actual DOM. It finds difference between the real DOM and virtual DOM and conducts  the minimum number of DOM operations required to achieve the new state.  React is also declarative. When the data changes, React conceptually hits the refresh  button and knows to only update the changed parts.  This simple flow of data, coupled with dead simple display logic, makes  development with ReactJS straightforward and simple to understand.  Who uses React? If you've used any of the services such as Facebook, Instagram,  Netflix, Alibaba, Yahoo, E-Bay, Khan-Academy, AirBnB, Sony, and Atlassian, you've  already come across and used React on the Web.  In just under a year, React has seen adoption from major Internet companies in their  core products.  [ 2 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   In its first-ever conference, React also announced the development of React Native.  React Native allows the development of mobile applications using React. It transpiles  React code to the native application code, such as Objective-C for iOS applications.  At the time of writing this, Facebook already uses React Native in its Groups and  Ads Manager app.  In this book, we will be following a conversation between two developers, Mike  and Shawn. Mike is a senior developer at Adequate Consulting and Shawn has  just joined the company. Mike will be mentoring Shawn and conducting pair  programming with him.  When Shawn meets Mike and ReactJS It's a bright day at Adequate Consulting. Its' also Shawn's first day at the company.  Shawn had joined Adequate to work on its amazing products and also because it  uses and develops exciting new technologies.  After onboarding the company, Shelly, the CTO, introduced Shawn to Mike. Mike, a  senior developer at Adequate, is a jolly man, who loves exploring new things.  "So Shawn, here's Mike", said Shelly. "He'll be mentoring you as well as pairing with  you on development. We follow pair programming, so expect a lot of it with him.  He's an excellent help."  With that, Shelly took leave.  "Hey Shawn!" Mike began, "are you all set to begin?"  "Yeah, all set! So what are we working on?"  [ 3 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   "Well we are about to start working on an app using https:  openlibrary.org .  Open Library is collection of the world's classic literature. It's an open, editable library  catalog for all the books. It's an initiative under https:  archive.org  and lists  free book titles. We need to build an app to display the most recent changes in the  record by Open Library. You can call this the Activities page. Many people contribute  to Open Library. We want to display the changes made by these users to the books,  addition of new books, edits, and so on, as shown in the following screenshot:  "Oh nice! What are we using to build it?"  "Open Library provides us with a neat REST API that we can consume to fetch the  data. We are just going to build a simple page that displays the fetched data and  format it for display. I've been experimenting and using ReactJS for this. Have you  used it before?"  "Nope. However, I have heard about it. Isn't it the one from Facebook and Instagram?"  [ 4 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   "That's right. It's an amazing way to define our UI. As the app isn't going to have  much of logic on the server or perform any display, it is an easy option to use it."  "As you've not used it before, let me provide you a quick introduction."  "Have you tried services such as JSBin and JSFiddle before?"  "No, but I have seen them."  "Cool. We'll be using one of these, therefore, we don't need anything set up on our  machines to start with."  "Let's try on your machine", Mike instructed. "Fire up http:  jsbin. com ?html,output"  "You should see something similar to the tabs and panes to code on and their output  in adjacent pane."  "Go ahead and make sure that the HTML, JavaScript, and Output tabs are clicked  and you can see three frames for them so that we are able to edit HTML and JS and  see the corresponding output."  "That's nice."  "Ok."  "Yeah, good thing about this is that you don't need to perform any setups. Did you  notice the Auto-run JS option? Make sure its selected. This option causes JSBin to  reload our code and see its output so that we don't need to keep saying Run with JS  to execute and see its output."  [ 5 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Requiring React library "Alright then! Let's begin. Go ahead and change the title of the page, to say, React  JS Example. Next, we need to set up and we require the React library in our file."  "React's homepage is located at http:  facebook.github.io react . Here, we'll  also locate the downloads available for us so that we can include them in our project.  There are different ways to include and use the library.  We can make use of bower or install via npm. We can also just include it as  an individual download, directly available from the fb.me domain. There are  development versions that are full version of the library as well as production  version which is its minified version. There is also its version of add-on. We'll take a  look at this later though."  "Let's start by using the development version, which is the unminified version of the  React source. Add the following to the file header:"      "Done".  "Awesome, let's see how this looks."                    React JS Example            Building our first component "So Shawn, we are all set to begin. Let's build our very first React App. Go ahead and  add the following code to the JavaScript section of JSBin:"  var App = React.createClass {   render: function  {  [ 6 ]  www.it-ebooks.info       return React.createElement "div", null, "Welcome to Adequate,  Mike!"  ;   } } ;  React.render React.createElement App , document.body ;  "Here it is. You should see the output section of the page showing something similar  to the following:"     Welcome to Adequate, Mike!  "Nice Mike. I see that we are making use of this React object to create classes?"  "That's right. We are creating, what are called as Components in React."  "The entry point to the ReactJS library is the React object. Once the react.js library  is included, it is made available to us in the global JavaScript namespace."  "React.createClass creates a component with the given specification. The  component must implement the render method that returns a single child element as  follows:"  var App = React.createClass {   render: function  {     return React.createElement "div", null, "Welcome to Adequate,  Mike!"  ;   } } ;  React will take care of calling the render method of the component to generate   the HTML."  Even if the render method needs to return a single child, that  single child can have an arbitrarily deep structure to contain  full-fledged HTML page parts.  "Here, we are making use of React.createElement to create our content. It's a  singleton method that allows us to create a div element with the "Welcome to  Adequate, Mike! contents. React.createElement creates a ReactElement, which  is an internal representation of the DOM element used by React. We are passing null  as the second argument. This is used to pass and specify attributes for the element.  Right now, we are leaving it as blank to create a simple div."  "The type of ReactElement can be either a valid HTML tag name like span, div, h1  and so on or a component created by React.createClass itself."  [ 7 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   "Once we are done creating the component, it can be displayed using the React. render method as follows:"  React.render React.createElement App , document.body ;  "Here, a new ReactElement is created for the App component that we have created  previously and it is then rendered into the HTML element—document.body. This is  called the mountNode, or mount point for our component, and acts as the root node.  Instead of passing document.body directly as a container for the component, any  other DOM element can also be passed."  "Mike, go ahead and change the text passed to the div as Hello React World!.  We should start seeing the change and it should look something similar to the  following:"  Hello React World!  "Nice."  "Mike, while constructing the first component, we also got an overview of React's  top-level API, that is, making use of React.createClass, React.createElement,  and React.render."  "Now, the component that we just built to display this hello message is pretty simple  and straightforward. However, the syntax can get challenging and it keeps growing  when building complex things. Here's where JSX comes in handy."  "JSX?"  "What? Isn't it bad?"  "JSX is an XML-like syntax extension to ECMAScript without any defined semantics.  It has a concise and familiar syntax with plain HTML and it's familiar for designers  or non-programmers. It can also be used directly from our JavaScript file!"  "Well, time to rethink the best practices. That's right, we will be bringing our view  and its HTML in the JavaScript file!"  "Let's see how to start using it. Go ahead and change the contents of our JavaScript  file as follows:"  var App = React.createClass {   render: function  {     return        Hello, from Shawn!      ;   }  [ 8 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   } ;  React.render React.createElement App , document.body ;  "As you can see, what we did here was that instead of using createElement, we  directly wrote the div tag. This is very similar to writing HTML markup directly. It  also works right out of the JavaScript file."  "Mike, the code is throwing some errors on JSBin."  "Oh, right. We need to make use of the JSX transformer library so that React and  the browser can understand the syntax. In our case, we need to change the type of  JavaScript, which we are using, to be used to interpret this code. What we need to  do is change from JavaScript to JSX  React , from the dropdown on the JavaScript  frame header, as follows:"  "That should do it."  "Looks good, Mike. It's working."  "Now you will see something similar to the following:"  Hello, from Shawn!  [ 9 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Back to work "That's good to start, Shawn. Let's move back to the task of building our app using  Open Library's Recent changes API now. We already have a basic prototype ready  without using ReactJS."

In this case, after you added the h1 heading, our app started returning two  elements, which is wrong. There'll be many cases when you will come across this. To  avoid this, just wrap the elements in a div or span tag. The main idea is that we just  want to return a single element from the render method."  "Got it.

We can use it to embed the JavaScript objects in our views,  for example, the name of a person or heading of this table. As you can see, what we  are doing here is using the map function to loop over the dataset that we have. Then,  we are returning a table row, constructed from the information available from the  row object – the details about when the event was created, who created it and event  description."  "We are using JSX syntax here to construct the rows of table. However, it is not used  as the final return value from render function."  "That's correct, Shawn. React with JSX allows us to arbitrarily create elements to be  used in our views, in our case, creating it dynamically from the dataset that we have.  The rows variable now contains a part of view that we had used at a different place.  We can also build another component of the view on top of it."  "That's the beauty of it. React allows us to dynamically create, use, and reuse the  parts of views. This is helpful to build our views, part by part, in a systematic way."

Our very first component using React!", said Mike.  "This looks amazing. I can't wait to try out more things in React!", exclaimed Shawn.  Summary In this chapter, we started with React and built our first component. In the process,  we studied the top-level API of React to construct components and elements. We  used JSX to construct the components. We saw how to display static information  using React and then gradually replaced all the static information with dynamic  information using props. In the end, we were able to tie all ends together and display  mock data in the format that is returned from Open Library's Recent Changes API  using React.  In the next chapter, we will dive deep into JSX internals and continue building our  application for Recent Changes API.  [ 20 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   JSX in Depth  In the first chapter, we built our first component using React. We saw how using JSX  makes the development easy. In this chapter, we will dive deep into JSX. JavaScript XML  JSX  is an XML syntax that constructs the markup in React  components. React works without JSX, but using JSX makes it easy to read and write  the React components as well as structure them just like any other HTML element.  In this chapter, we will cover following points:     Why JSX?    Transforming JSX into JavaScript    Specifying HTML tags and React components    Multiple components    Different types of JSX tags    Using JavaScript expressions inside JSX    Namespaced components    Spread attributes    CSS styles and JSX     JSX Gotchas  At the end of the chapter, we will get familiar with the JSX syntax, how it should be  used with React, and best practices of using it. We will also study some of the corner  cases that one can run into while using JSX.  [ 21 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Why JSX? Shawn had a great first day and he was just getting started with the next one at  Adequate Consulting. With a mug of coffee, he startled Mike.  "Hey Mike, I saw that we used JSX for building our first component. Why should we  use JSX when React has React.createElement?"  "You can use React without using JSX. But JSX makes it easy to build React  components. It reduces the amount of code required to write. It looks like HTML  markup. Its syntax is simple and concise and it's very easy to visualize the  components that are getting built."  "Take an example of the render function of a component without using JSX."     render without JSX render: function  {     return React.createElement "div",                                 null,                                 "Hello React World!"  ; }  "With JSX, it looks much better."     render with JSX render: function  {     return         Hello React World      ;   }  "Compared to the previous non-JSX example, the JSX code is much more readable,  easy to understand, and close to the actual HTML markup."  "The similarity between JSX and HTML markup means that non-developers such   as UI and UX designers in the team can contribute to a project using JSX. Having  XML-like tag syntax also makes reading large component trees easier compared to  the function calls or object literals in JavaScript." explained Mike.  "Yeah. The syntax does look familiar. We will be using JSX all the way in our   projects right?"  "Yes, we will", remarked Mike.  [ 22 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Transforming JSX into JavaScript "Shawn, as I mentioned, the JSX is transformed to the native JavaScript syntax."

It's a live REPL that can transform a JSX code to the native JavaScript code."  [ 23 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   "There is another editor available for converting HTML to JSX. You can check it out  at http:  facebook.github.io react html-jsx.html. This allows you to paste  an arbitrary HTML code that gets converted to JSX with extraction of styles, classes,  and other information and then create a component on top of it." said Mike.  "Pretty handy. However, this is just for ease of development, right? What happens  when we deploy our code?" asked Shawn.  "JSX is not meant to be compiled at runtime. Though there is a JSX transformer that  converts JSX to JavaScript in a browser. Using it to compile JSX at runtime in the  browser would slow down our application. We will use tools such as Babel, which  is a JavaScript transpiler to convert our JSX code to the native JavaScript code before  deploying the application."  HTML tags vs React components "Mike, I am intrigued by one more thing. In JSX, we are mixing the React  components as if they are simple HTML tags. We did this in our first component."  ReactDOM.render <App headings = {['When', 'Who', 'Description']}                       data = {data}  >,               document.getElementById 'container'  ;  "The App tag is not a valid HTML tag here. But this still works."  "Yes. That's because we can specify both HTML tags and React components in JSX.  There is a subtle difference though. HTML tags start with a lowercase letter and  React components start with an uppercase letter." Mike explained.     Specifying HTML tags render: function  {     return              .....              ; }     Specifying React components var App = React.createClass {..} ; ReactDOM.render <App headings = {['When', 'Who', 'Description']}                        data = {data}  >,                  document.getElementById 'container'  ;  "That's the primary difference. JSX uses this convention to differentiate between the  local component classes and HTML tags."  [ 24 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Self closing tag "Another thing that you must have noticed is how the component tag is closed in  ReactDOM.render" added Mike.  ReactDOM.render  , document.getElementById 'container'  ;  "As JSX is based on XML, it allows adding a self-closing tag. All the component tags  must be closed either with self-closing format or with a closing tag."  "Thanks Mike! Things make much more sense now."  Multiple components "Shawn, let's get back to our application. We are using almost the same code from  last time but you can set up a new JSBin. We have included the latest React library  and bootstrap library in the HTML tab. We have also added a container element,  which we will render our React app."                     <link href="https:  netdna.bootstrapcdn.com twitter- bootstrap 2.3.2 css bootstrap-combined.min.css" rel="stylesheet"  type="text css"  >     <script src="https:  netdna.bootstrapcdn.com twitter- bootstrap 2.3.2 js bootstrap.min.js">                                 JSX in Detail                             "Right now, we are only using a single component to display the data from the recent  changes API."  var App = React.createClass {   render: function  {     var headings = this.props.headings.map function heading  {  [ 25 ]  www.it-ebooks.info         return           {heading}         ;     } ;      var rows = this.props.data.map function row {       return             {row.when}           {row.who}           {row.description}               }        return   {this.props.title}                       {headings}                   {rows}            } } ;  "Let's split this single component into small composable components.

The Headings component is controlling how the props are passed to  the individual Heading components. In a sense, individual Heading components are  owned by Headings." explained Mike.  "In React, an owner is the component that sets props of other components. We  can also say that if the X component is present in the render   method of the Y  component, then Y owns X." Mike further added.  "Shawn, go ahead and build the Rows component similar to Headings."

The idea behind these concepts is to create a namespace hierarchy of code such  that the code from one module or package doesn't interfere with another."  "Yes. Is something like this available with React?" Shawn asked.  "Yes. React allows creating components that are namespaced under a parent  component so that they don't interfere with other components or global functions."  "We are using very generic names such as Rows and Headings that can be used later  in other parts of the app too. So it makes sense to namespace them now, rather than  later." explained Mike.

We just replaced   with a custom component. All it does  is just render this.props.children. How does it get all the headings and rows?"  Shawn asked.  "Ah! Nice observation. React, by default, captures all the child nodes between  open and close tags of a component in an array and adds it to the props of that  component as this.props.children. So we can render it using {this.props. children}. We will get all Headings and Rows as this.props.children in the  RecentChangesTable component. The output is the same as before, when we used  the   tag directly."  "Awesome!" exclaimed Shawn.  "Cool. Let's move on next step by namespacing all other components under  RecentChangesTable."

Everything is namespaced under RecentChangesTable now",  said Mike.  [ 34 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Spread attributes Shawn learned a lot of things about JSX but when he was reflecting on the previous  steps, he came up with another question.  "Mike, as of now we are just passing two props to the App component: headings and  changesets. However, tomorrow these props can increase to any number. Passing  them one by one would be cumbersome. Especially, when we have to pass some data  from the recent changes API directly. It will be hard to a keep track of the structure  of the incoming data and pass it accordingly in the props. Is there a better way?"  "Another excellent question, Shawn. True, it might be cumbersome passing a large  number of attributes to the component one by one. But we can solve this using the  spread attributes."  var props = { headings: headings, changeSets: data, timestamps:  timestamps }; ReactDOM.render  ,                       document.getElementById 'container'  ;  "In this case, all the properties of object are passed as props to the App component.  We can pass any object that can contain any number of key value pairs and all of  them will be passed as props to the component" explained Mike.  "Very cool. Is the  …  operator present only in JSX?"  "Nope. It is actually based on the spread attribute feature in ES2015, which is the next  JavaScript standard. ES2015, or ES6 as it is called, introduces some new features in  JavaScript language and React is taking advantage of these developing standards in  order to provide a cleaner syntax in JSX" added Mike.  ES2015 already supports spread operator for arrays at https:   developer.mozilla.org en-US docs Web JavaScript  Reference Operators Spread_operator. There is also a  proposal for objects at https:  github.com sebmarkbage  ecmascript-rest-spread.  "Not only this, spread attributes can be used multiple times or it can be combined  with other attributes. The order of the attributes is important though. Newer  attributes override previous ones."  var data = [{ "when": "2 minutes ago",               "who": "Jill Dupre",               "description": "Created new account"             },             {  [ 35 ]  www.it-ebooks.info                 "when": "1 hour ago",               "who": "Lose White",               "description": "Added fist chapter"             }]; var headings = ['When', 'Who', 'Description'];  var props = { headings: headings, changeSets: data };  ReactDOM.render <App {...props} headings = {['Updated at ', 'Author',  'Change']}  >, document.getElementById 'container'  ;  "Instead of showing When, Who, and Description, Updated at, Author, and Change  will be shown as the headings in this case" Mike explained.  ES2015 or ES6 is the latest version JavaScript standard. It has a  lot of features, which are used by React, similar to the spread  attributes. We will be using lot more ES2015 or ES6 code in the  upcoming chapters.  Styles in JSX "Mike, all of the things that we did today are very cool. When do we start adding  styles? How can I make this page look pretty? Right now it's a bit dull." Shawn asked.  "Ah, right. Let's do that. React allows us to pass styles to the components the same  way props can be passed. For example, we want our headings to be of the floral  white color and maybe we want to change the font size. We will represent it in a  typical CSS way as follows:"  background-color: 'FloralWhite', font-size: '19px';  [ 36 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   "We can represent this as a JavaScript object in the CamelCase fashion."      var headingStyle = { backgroundColor: 'FloralWhite',                          fontSize: '19px'                         };  Then, we can use it in each Heading component as a JavaScript object."  RecentChangesTable.Heading = React.createClass {   render: function   {     var headingStyle = { backgroundColor: 'FloralWhite',                          fontSize: '19px' };     return  {this.props.heading}  ;   } } ;  "Similarly, let's change the rows to have their own styles."    RecentChangesTable.Row = React.createClass {   render: function   {   var trStyle = { backgroundColor: 'aliceblue' };     return                    {this.props.changeSet.when}                   {this.props.changeSet.who}                   {this.props.changeSet.description}               ;   } } ;  "We now have some shiny new headings and rows sprinkled by CSS styling"   Mike added.  "Nice. The name of the attribute to pass these styles must be 'style', right?"   Shawn asked.  "Yes. Also the keys of this style object need to be CamelCased, for example,  backgroundColor, backgroundImage, fontSize, and so on."  [ 37 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   "Mike, I understood the inline styling, however, how to add the CSS classes?"  "Ah right. We can pass the class name as an attribute to the DOM tags. Let's extract  the styling to a new recentChangesTable CSS class."     css recentChangesTable {   background-color: 'FloralWhite',   font-size: '19px' }  "Now, to apply this class to our component, all we need to do is pass it to the  component using the expalined className prop."  render: function  {     return                                             ;     } } ;  "As we have seen previously, React makes use of the CamelCase attributes. Here, the  className prop will be converted to a normal class attribute when React renders the  actual HTML."     …    "We can also pass multiple classes to the className prop."     "That's it! We can simply start using the styles freely in our components. This makes  it trivial to integrate React with existing CSS styles."  JSX Gotchas The day was heading to an end. Mike and Shawn were still discussing about this  shiny new thing—JSX. Mike decided that it was time to tell Shawn about the issues  with using JSX.  "Shawn, so how do you feel about using JSX?"  "I liked it so far. It's very similar to the HTML markup. I can pass attributes, styles,  and even classes. I can also use all the DOM elements" explained Shawn.  [ 38 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   "Yes. But JSX is not HTML. We have to always remember this. Otherwise, we will  run into trouble."  "For example, if you want to pass some custom attribute that does not exist in the  HTML specification, then React will simply ignore it."     custom-attribute won't be rendered      "It must be passed as a data attribute so that React will render it."     data-custom-attribute will be rendered      "We may also run into some issues while rendering the HTML content dynamically.  In the JSX tags, we can add a valid HTML entity directly."     Using HTML entity inside JSX tags.   Mike &amp; Shawn      will produce  React.createElement "div", null, " Mike & Shawn "   "But if we render it in a dynamic expression, it will then escape the ampersand."     Using HTML entity inside dynamic expression var first = 'Mike'; var second = 'Shawn';   { first + '&amp;' + second }    var first = 'Mike'; var second = 'Shawn'; React.createElement "div", null, " ", first + '&amp;' + second, " "   "It happens as React escapes all the strings in order to prevent XSS attacks by default.  To overcome it, we can directly pass the Unicode character of &amp; or we can use  arrays of strings and JSX elements." Mike explained.     Using mixed arrays of JSX elements and normal variables   {[first,  &amp; , second]}    React.createElement "div", null, " ", [first,                                     React.createElement "span", null,  "&" , second], " "   [ 39 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   "Wow. It can get pretty messed up" expressed Shawn.  "Well, yes, but if we remember the rules, then it's pretty simple. Also, as a last resort,  React also allows to render raw HTML using a special dangerouslySetInnerHTML  prop."     Rendering raw HTML directly    "Although this option should be used after consideration about what is getting  rendered to prevent XSS attacks" Mike explained.  Conditionals in JSX "React embraces the idea of tying markup and logic that generates the markup  together. This means that we can use the power of JavaScript for loops and  conditionals."  "But if else logic is a bit hard to express in markup. Therefore, in JSX, we can't use  conditional statements such as if else."     Using if else directly doesn't work   Error: Parse Error: Line 1: Unexpected token if  "Instead, we can use a ternary operator for specifying the if else logic."     Using ternary operator   React.createElement "div", {className:  success ? 'green' : 'red'}   "But ternary operator gets cumbersome with large expressions when we want to use  the React component as a child. In this case, it's better to offload the logic to a block  or maybe a function" Mike added.     Moving if else logic to a function var showResult = function   {   if this.props.success === true      return     else     return   };  [ 40 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Non-DOM attributes "Alright Shawn, it's time to take a detailed look at our application again. If you  closely see the console output, you will see a few warnings related to Keys."  "Each child in an array should have a unique \"key\" prop. Check the  render method of Rows. See http:  fb.me react-warning-keys for more  information."  "In the render   method of Rows, we are rendering collection of the Row  components."  RecentChangesTable.Rows = React.createClass {   render: function   {     var rows = this.props.changeSets.map function changeSet  {       return   ;     } ;      return  {rows} ;   } } ;  "During the rendering of list items, a component may move up or down in the DOM  tree based on the user interaction. For example, in case of search or sorting, the items  in the list can change their position. New items can also get added to the front of  the list in case new data gets fetched. In such cases, React may remove and recreate  components based on the diff algorithm. But if we provide a unique identifier for  each element in the list, then React will intelligently decide whether to destroy it or  not. This will improve the rendering performance. This can be achieved by passing a  unique key prop to every item in the list."  In our case, the number of rows is currently fixed. But later on, we want to show  the updates page as the new data is being fetched from the API. The situation gets  complicated when children are added or removed dynamically as the state and  identity of each component must be maintained in every render pass. The key prop  will help React to uniquely identify the component in such cases. Go ahead and use  the index of the Row component for this purpose as it will be unique as of now" Mike  further explained.  "Cool. So let me try adding the key prop to Rows. I noticed same issue with the  Headings component too, therefore, I will add a key for Headings as well." said Shawn.  RecentChangesTable.Rows = React.createClass {   render: function   {  [ 41 ]  www.it-ebooks.info       var rows = this.props.changeSets.map function changeSet, index  {       return   ;     } ;      return   {rows}  ;   } } ; RecentChangesTable.Headings = React.createClass {   render: function   {     var headings = this.props.headings.map function name, index  {       return <RecentChangesTable.Heading key={index} heading =  {name} > ;     } ;      return    {headings}   ;   } } ;  "Perfect. Note that the value of keys for a given list should be unique. We will get to  know more about the keys when we start updating the DOM based on dynamic data.  But this is good enough for now" said Mike.  "Makes sense. Are there any more such keywords identifiers available for us?"  "Yes. Along with key, there is also refs or references. It allows the parent component  to keep a reference of a child component. Right now, we can't access the child  components outside the render   method of the component. But having ref allows  us to use the child component anywhere in the component, not just the render    method."  "Now, we can access these references outside the render method too."         this.refs.myInput  "It's pretty useful when we want to inform a component to change something   at runtime. We will discuss and use refs in more detail later when we deal with   event handlers" Mike added.  [ 42 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Summary In this chapter, we dived deep into JSX. We discussed why using JSX makes  development with React easy and how JSX gets transformed into the plain native  JavaScript. We split big the single React component into small, focused components  and understood the advantages of reusable, modular components. We saw different  JSX tags, JavaScript expressions, and how React is taking advantages of ES6 features  such as spread attributes. In the end, we discussed advanced topics such as namespaced  components and some gotchas that we should keep in mind while using JSX.  In the next chapter, we will focus on data flow and models to access data and  component life cycle and their use.  [ 43 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   www.it-ebooks.info   Data Flow and   Life Cycle Events  In the previous chapter, we saw the power of JSX. JSX makes it easy to write the  React components.  In this chapter, we will focus on the data flow between components and how to  manage state and life cycle of components.  In this chapter, we will cover the following points:     Data flow in React    Props    PropTypes    State    State versus props    When to use state and props    Component life cycle overview    Component life cycle methods  At the end of the chapter, we will get familiar with the data flow in the React  components and the ways of maintaining and managing state. We will also get   used to the life cycle of a component and various life cycle hooks provided by React.  [ 45 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Data flow in React Shawn and Mark were getting ready to start working on a rainy day with a cup   of coffee.  "Hey Mike, I have a question about props that we used to pass the headings and  changeSet data to other components."  "Shoot!" Mike exclaimed.  "It seems to me that we are passing data to the components that are below the current  component, but how can a component pass the data to the parent component?"  "Ah. In React, by default, all the data flows only in one direction: from parent  component to child component. That's it."  This makes the job of the child component simple and predictable. Take props from  the parent and render." Mike explained.  var RecentChangesTables = React.createClass {   render: function  {     return                                              ;     } } ;  "Let's look at our example. The RecentChangesTables component passes the  props to the Headings and Rows components. So basically, we can say that  RecentChangesTables owns the Headings and Rows components."  "In React, an owner component sets props for another components." Mike explained.  "Got it. Therefore, in the preceding case,   is also owned by  RecentChangesTables?" Shawn asked.  "No. The owner relationship is specific to the React components. In this case, table is  the parent of Headings and Rows, similar to the parent-child relationship in DOM.  But it's not an owner of them." explained Mike.  "A component is the owner of a child component if that child gets created in the  render method of the parent. I guess this will solve the confusion." Mike added.  "Yes. Got the difference between owner and parent-child relationship." said Shawn.  [ 46 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   "Furthermore, a component should not mutate its props. They should always be  consistent with what the parent has set. It's a very important point that makes React's  behavior consistent as well as fast, as we'll see soon." Mike further added.  "Props can be accessed by this.props, as we have already seen. If anything in the  parent's props changes, React will make sure that the changes are flown downstream  and will re-render the component tree." Mike.  "Excellent. Yesterday, I was reading something about validating the props."  remembered Shawn.  "Yes. React allows validating the props using PropTypes. Let's take a look at them."  said Mike, taking a sip from his freshly ground coffee.  Props validation "React provides a way to validate the props using PropTypes. This is extremely  useful to ensure that the components are used correctly. Here is an example of   using propTypes for our app." explained Mike.  var App = React.createClass {   propTypes: {    headings: React.PropTypes.array,    changeSets: React.PropTypes.array,    author: React.PropTypes.string.isRequired    },      render: function  {     return                                              ;     } } ;  [ 47 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   "Oh! Will it show an error as we are not passing the author, which is required,   I assume? I see that propTypes has set the author value to be isRequired."   Shawn asked.  "No. It will not throw an error, but it will show a nice warning for us to take a look  at." said Mike.  "Also, propTypes are only checked in development. Their job is to just check that   all the assumptions that we are making about our components are being met."   Mike added.  "Got it. I agree that it's better to have it rather than getting surprised by random  hiccups during production," Shawn.  "Yes. It's especially useful as, along with standard types, we can also validate the  custom types." Mike informed.  var App = React.createClass {   propTypes: {    headings: function props, propName, componentName  {    if propName === 'headings'       return Error 'Failed Validation' ;    }   },      render: function  {     return                                              ;     } } ;  "Therefore, if the structure of the props is not as per your assumption, you can   raise a warning by defining a custom validator as shown in the previous case",   Mike explained.  [ 48 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Specifying default props "Shawn, React also allows us to define some default values for props. This is useful  when parent component is passing props based on some condition or not passing  some props at all due to some change," Mike said.  var App = React.createClass {   getDefaultProps: function   {     return {       headings: ['When happened ', 'Who did it', 'What they change']     };   },      render: function  {             …   } } ;  var data = [{ "when": "2 minutes ago",               "who": "Jill Dupre",               "description": "Created new account"             },             {               "when": "1 hour ago",               "who": "Lose White",               "description": "Added first chapter"             }];  React.render  , document.body ;  "Here, we updated the code to not send the headings from props. Instead, we used  the getDefaultProps function to define the default props that will be used in case  they are not passed."  [ 49 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   "Therefore, our output looks like this."  "Oh, ok. Makes sense. Rather than fiddling with the if-else clauses to check whether  the prop is present, default props make it simple enough to predefine our data."   said Shawn.  Modifying this.props.children "Shawn. There is one special prop that we should know about. It's this.props. children," continued Mike.  "React captures all the children that are present in the opening and closing tag into  props that can be accessed through this.props.children." said Mike.  "Let's try to modify our code to use this.props.children. This is also required as  we want to display a header for our output table." Mike added.  var RecentChangesTable = React.createClass {   render: function  {           return                            Recent Changes                                {this.props.children}                                      ;   } } ;  var App = React.createClass {   render: function  {     return                                              ;     } } ;  [ 50 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   "Cool. So we extracted the table in its own component and also added a header."  Shawn confirmed.  "Yes and we rendered Headings and Rows using this.props.children."   Mike explained.  "Awesome. Let me change our code based on our discussion about props."   Shawn said excitedly.  State "Shawn, let's talk about one more technique of handling data in a component, state.  Every component can have its own state in React. The main difference between state  and props is that props are passed to the component from the parent component;  whereas, state is something that is internal to the component.  Props are passed when a component gets instantiated. State is something that can  change over time. Therefore, changes in state affect the rendering of components.  Consider state as some sort of private data structure of the component." Mike added.  "Mike, but then we have not used state at all until now. We were just using props."  Shawn asked.  "True. That is because state should be introduced only when it is required. You  already know managing state is hard. As we were playing with static data of  ChangeSets API, we didn't require state. However, we will need it very soon."   Mike added.  [ 51 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Setting initial state "The initial state can be set using the getInitialState function." said Mike.  var App = React.createClass {   getInitialState: function   {     return {       changeSets: []     };   },      render: function  {     console.log this.state.changeSets ;    prints []   } ;  "State can be accessed similar to props using this.state." Mike explained further.  Setting state "We might need to update the initial state based on some user events. Updating state  is also easy using the setState   function." informed Mike.  var App = React.createClass {   getInitialState: function   {     return {       changeSets: [],       headings: ['Updated At', 'Author', 'Change']     };   },      handleEvent: function data  {     this.setState { changeSets: data.changeSets } ;   },      render: function  {     …     } ;  Avoiding state "Currently, we don't need state; however, when we fetch the dynamic data from  RecentChanges API, we will use state with props." Mike added.  [ 52 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   "Cool. Based on our discussion, I think that we should avoid state as much as  possible." Shawn suggested.  "True. If a component does not change, then there is no need to use state. It's better   to depend on props passed by the parent component in that case. This also avoids   re-rendering of the component again and again as changes to state initiate a   re-render of the component." Mike explained.  State versus props "Shawn, it's important to understand the difference between props and state and  where to use what." informed Mike.  "Props are immutable. They should not be updated by the component to which they  are passed. They are are owned by the component which passes them to some other  component. State is something internal and private to the component. State can and  will change depending on the interactions with the outer world." said Mike.  "State should store as simple data as possible, such as whether an input checkbox is  checked or not or a CSS class that hides or displays the component." Mike added.  "Another thing to make sure is to not duplicate props in state." said Mike.  var App = React.createClass {   getInitialState: function   {     return {       changeSets: this.props.changeSets     };   } } ;  "It is possible to set the state based on data passed in props. However, the parent  component can update the props and send them again. In this case, the state will   be muddled up with new data if there have been any changes to the state."  "Also, the data is present at two places now, therefore, it becomes harder to manage  two sources of data." Mike explained.  [ 53 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   "I think that in such cases, it's best to use props directly, right?" Shawn asked.  "Yes. The state is entirely optional. It's best to avoid it as much as possible. You got  that right." Mike said happily.  Component life cycle overview "Shawn, now let's start taking a look at how to dynamically fetch data from  https:  openlibrary.org , store it in our component, and render it after making  it compatible to render.  A component goes through different life cycle events. They help facilitate when   we should initialize which part of a component or when should some external   data be fetched.  We have already seen some of these methods such as render, getInitialState,  and getDefaultProps.  An updated detailed list and example for the same can be found at http:  videos. bigbinary.com react react-life-cycle-methods-in-depth.html.  Let's go through each of these, one by one, and how they can be used so that we   can start fetching dynamic information for display. Here is a list of methods that   we will discuss:     componentWillMount    componentDidMount    componentWillReceiveProps object nextProps     boolean shouldComponentUpdate object nextProps, object   nextState      componentWillUpdate object nextProps, object nextState     componentDidUpdate object prevProps, object prevState     componentWillUnmount      React.unmountComponentAtNode document.body   You can follow along the next example at http:  jsbin.com  tijeco 3 edit.  [ 54 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Component life cycle methods "Shawn, let's start with an exhaustive example that triggers these methods."   Mike informed.  console.log 'Start'     Marks entry point of JS code. var App = React.createClass {     componentWillMount: function  {       console.log 'componentWillMount' ;     },          componentDidMount: function  {       console.log 'componentDidMount' ;     },          getInitialState: function  {       return { status: true}     },      getDefaultProps: function  {       return {name: 'John'};     },        componentWillReceiveProps: function nextProps {       console.log 'componentWillReceiveProps' ;     },      shouldComponentUpdate: function nextProps, nextState {       console.log 'shouldComponentUpdate' ;       return true;     },          componentWillUpdate: function  {       console.log 'componentWillUpdate' ;     },          render: function   {       console.log 'render' ;       return                    {this.state.status.toString  }                    },      componentWillUnmount: function  {  [ 55 ]  www.it-ebooks.info         console.log 'componentWillUnmount'      },          toggleState: function   {       this.setState {status: !this.state.status}      }     } ;   * List of methods and signatures for reference * componentWillMount * componentDidMount * componentWillReceiveProps object nextProps  * boolean shouldComponentUpdate object nextProps, object nextState  * componentWillUpdate object nextProps, object nextState  * componentDidUpdate object prevProps, object prevState  * componentWillUnmount      React.render  , document.body ;  "It simply displays a body with the true text and then on clicking, it changes it to  display false." Mike.  [ 56 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   "Shawn, to keep things simple, I have added just a simple console.log   method  for every life cycle method so that we know it was called. If we do a fresh run, the  following is printed:"  "Start" "componentWillMount" "render" "componentDidMount"  "Ah, got it. Basically, the window first printed Start to signal the file has been  loaded." Shawn said.  "Correct. Next, it printed out componentWillMount. That's the entry point for our  component. This method is called when a component gets mounted on the body for  the first time. If you can see, we are calling React.render."  React.render  , document.body ;  This is what triggers componentWillMount. In this method, we can call setState   to perform some changes to our internal data. However, that doesn't call a new   re-render or this method again.  Next is the actual render method call. This is responsible for the actual component  display.  Finally, we have a call to componentDidMount. This is invoked immediately after  mounting the component and only once after the component is rendered.  We can make use of this to fetch the dynamic information that we want to display in  our component after the initial render of the component.  "Once that's done, we are done with our initial run for the display of a component!"  "Nice." exclaimed Shawn.  "Now, we have added a simple onClick event. This calls this.toggleState, which  toggles the current status from true to false and vice versa."  As the state is affected, React re-renders the App component. We can see the method  call sequence when this happens, as follows:"  "…" "shouldComponentUpdate" "componentWillUpdate" "render" "…"  [ 57 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   "Ah, nice. It went through another re-render cycle." said Shawn.  "Correct. When the state was changed, React knew it needed to re-render the App  component. It calls shouldComponentUpdate first. This method returns true or  false indicating React to render the component or not.  "We can also control whether the component should be re-rendered or not even if the  state gets updated. This method can return false and then React will not re-render  the component even if the state is changed."      shouldComponentUpdate: function nextProps, nextState {       console.log 'shouldComponentUpdate' ;       return false;    Will not re-render the component.     },  "We can also compare nextProps and nextState to the existing values and then  decide whether to re-render."  "Awesome, this means that we could get faster components!" Shawn exclaimed.  "Exactly. By default, it always returns true, to always render on changes."   Mike concluded.  "Next up, componentWillUpdate will get called just before rendering. We can take  care of any changes that we would like to do or any housekeeping. One thing to  note is that we can't call setState in this method. State updates should be handled  elsewhere."  "Oh, ok," Shawn.  "We are only left with componentWillReceiveProps."   componentWillReceiveProps: function nextProps {       console.log 'componentWillReceiveProps' ;     },  "It receives nextProps, which are the new props that the child component receives  from the parent component. This method is not called for initial render. We can  update the state or do some other housekeeping work based on the changes in props."  "Nice, Mike. I think I am getting a better hang of this."  "Finally, we have componentWillUnmount. This is called when the component  is unmounted from the body. We can use this to release the resources, perform  cleanups, unset any timers, and so on."  "Got it."  [ 58 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   "Alright! Let's update our component to start fetching the information from  https:  openlibrary.org ."  "So, what we will be doing is updating the componentDidMount to perform an AJAX  call and fetch data to display."    componentDidMount : function  {     $.ajax {       url: 'http:  openlibrary.org recentchanges.json?limit=10',       context: this,       dataType: 'json',       type: 'GET'     } .done function  data  {       var changeSets = this.mapOpenLibraryDataToChangeSet data ;       this.setState {changeSets: changeSets} ;     } ;   }  "Here, we are making a call to http:  openlibrary.org recentchanges. json?limit=10 and asking for the ten most-recent changes.

Summary In this chapter, we looked at how to pass around data in the React components using  props and state. We also discussed how and when to use state and props. We looked  at how propTypes can be used to validate the props. After that, we discussed the  component's life cycle. We discussed about the various life cycle methods and how  they can be used. After that, we used these life cycle methods to get real-time data  from Open Library API.  [ 62 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Composite Dynamic  Components and Forms  In the previous chapter, we saw the various life cycle methods of a React component,  how the data flows between React components, and how to manage state and props  in our React application.  In this chapter, we will focus on multiple dynamic components and building forms  using React.  We will cover following points:     Multiple dynamic components with interactivity    Controlled and uncontrolled components    Form elements    Form events and handlers  At the end of this chapter, we will be able to create applications containing complex  forms using React with an understanding of the dynamic components.  Mike and Shawn are getting ready for their next project. The application is a  prototype for an online bookstore where people can buy different books. Shawn is  excited to work with Mike again and learn more about React. This project is based on  React too.  Forms in React "Shawn, in this project there will be many things related to placing an order, taking  user's shipping and billing information, and so on. We are going to deal with a lot of  forms now." started Mike.  [ 63 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   "Forms using React, right?" Shawn asked excitedly.  "Yes. That is why today we will only focus on forms. Let's go through the intrinsic  details of using forms using React." said Mike.  Setting up the application "Shawn, we were using JSBin up to this point. But now we will create the app locally.  We will use the following directory structure for our code:"  $ tree -L 1  .  ├── LICENSE  ├── README.md  ├── index.html  ├── node_modules  ├── package.json  ├── server.js  ├── src  └── webpack.config.js  2 directories, 6 files     The src directory will contain all of the React components    The webpack.config.js and server.js file will be used for setting up local   development server using webpack.     The package.json file will be used to contain information about all of the   npm packages used by us     The index.html file will be the starting point of the app  "Let's see our index.html file."     index.html            Forms in React      <link rel="stylesheet"  href="https:  maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com  bootstrap 3.3.5 css bootstrap.min.css"  >      [ 64 ]  www.it-ebooks.info                               "We are using bootstrap CSS to beautify our app. Other than this, we are including  the bundled JavaScript as static bundle.js. Webpack will bundle the JavaScript  code from our app and place it in static bundle.js."  Webpack is a module bundler that takes our JavaScript code  and generates static assets representing these modules. It also  has other features such as hot module replacement, which we  will be using in this book. We will be covering webpack and it's  configuration in more depth in Chapter 11, React Tools.  "Let's see our index.js file, which will be the entry point of the JavaScript code."     src index.js  import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'; import BookStore from '. BookStore';  ReactDOM.render  , document.getElementById 'root'  ;  "It will render our BookStore component in the root container present in index. html. Now, the only thing left to do is actually writing the code for our BookStore  component. Let's get started."  "Mike, in JSBin, our ES6 code was getting converted to normal JavaScript  automatically. How will it be converted now?" asked Shawn.  "Excellent question. I forgot to mention about using Babel. Babel is a JavaScript  transpiler that will convert our ES6 and JSX code to normal JavaScript. I have already  configured this app to use Babel. You can check package.json and webpack. config.js to see how we configured Babel to convert the ES6 code to ES5 code. But  let's not worry too much about it for now. We will come back to it and see how the  whole setup works later."  [ 65 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   We will be covering how we have used Babel and Webpack in Chapter 11,  React Tools. Right now, the reader is expected to not worry about it and  directly set up the application using the instructions given in source code  of this chapter. You can also check Chapter 11, React Tools for more details  before completing this chapter.  Getting started with forms "Forms behave slightly differently in the React world than in the normal HTML  world. They are a bit special than the other DOM components in the React world.  The  ,  , and   tags are some of the common input  components provided by React." explained Mike.  "These form components are mutated when the user interacts with them, adds some  text in the input, or selects an option. Therefore, we need to take care that we are  managing those user interactions properly." Mike explained further.  "Let's start with a simple input tag to understand the user interaction." informed Mike.     src index.js  import React from 'react'; import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';  var InputExample = React.createClass {   render   {     return                ;   } } ; ReactDOM.render  ,                    document.getElementById 'root'  ;  "Mike, what is the meaning of import here?" asked Shawn.  "Good catch. This is one of the ES6 features that we are going to use in this project. It  is used to import functions defined in other modules or external scripts."  More information on import can be found at https:  developer. mozilla.org en docs web javascript reference  statements import.  [ 66 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   "We are also using a new way of defining functions in ES6."     Old way of defining function render: function   {   return            ; }     New way of defining function render   {     return                ;   }  "Using this new syntax, we don't have to write word function every time we define  the function."  "Shawn, start our app by running npm start."  $ npm start  > reactjs-by-example-react-forms@0.0.1 start  Users prathamesh Projects  sources reactjs-by-example chapter4  > node server.js  Listening at localhost:9000  Hash: 8ec0d12965567260413b  Version: webpack 1.9.11  Time: 1639ms       package.json   ……   "scripts": {     "start": "node server.js",     "lint": "eslint src"   }, ……  "Awesome, it works because we have configured the package.json scripts section  for starting the app."  [ 67 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   "Let's get back to our input box. We see a normal HTML text input with a predefined  value, Shawn. All good." said Mike.  "Mike, I can't edit it. Seems like the field is read-only. Also, I am seeing a warning in  the console." informed Shawn.  Interactive props "Right. It also says that value is a prop. Similar to value, there are some other props  supported by the input fields." said Mike.     value    defaultValue    onChange  "As React has warned us that we need to either provide the defaultValue or  onChange prop to make this field mutable, let's take care of this and add a onChange  handler. The field is read-only because by setting the value prop, we have rendered a  controlled component." explained Mike.  Controlled components "What is a controlled component, Mike?" asked Shawn.  "It's an input component whose value is controlled by React. By providing the value  prop, we are informing React that the value of this field is "Shawn". Once React has  declared it to be "Shawn", any user input won't have an effect as the value is already  set in the ." explained Mike.  [ 68 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   "I think that we have to resort to state instead of props?" Shawn asked.  "Exactly. As an user is interacting with the input field, we need to update the   value prop using state and onChange event handler. Can you give it a try?"  suggested Mike.     src index.js  var InputExample = React.createClass {   getInitialState   {     return         { name: '-'}      ;   },    handleChange event  {     this.setState { name: event.target.value } ;   },    render   {     return         <input type="text"              value={this.state.name}              onChange={this.handleChange}  >      ;   } } ;  "Awesome.

Our first version of the form wizard is complete." Mike informed.  Summary In this chapter, we discussed how to develop forms in React. We saw how to use  different input types and event handlers to respond to the user interaction for these  inputs. We used state and props to manage the flow of form data from one step to  another. We also saw how to use dynamic components to display particular form to  the user based on the current step that the user is present on.  In the next chapter, we will continue with the form wizard and see how mixins can  help us in organizing the code better.  [ 90 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Mixins and the DOM  In the previous chapter, we took a deep dive into React Forms. We took a look  at building multiple components and interactivity between them, Controller and  Uncontrolled Components, building Forms and Form elements, and Form events  and handlers for the events. We build a form to capture cart-checkout flow and  orders being placed in a multi-step form.  In this chapter, we will focus on abstracting content using mixins and touch upon  DOM handling.  Here, we will cover the following points:     Mixins    PureRender mixin    React and the DOM    Refs  At the end of this chapter, we will be able to abstract and reuse logic across our  components and learn how to handle DOM from within the components.  Back at the office The duo was back at work. Mike entered with a cup of coffee. It was morning and  the office had just started to buzz.  "So Shawn, we did a lot of complex forms stuff last time. Our cart flow is now  complete. However, now we have been asked to add a timeout to the cart. We   need to show a timer to the user that they need to checkout and complete the   order in 15 minutes."  "Any idea how we can do this?"  [ 91 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   "Umm, maintain a state for timer and keep updating every second? Take some action  when the timer hits zero."  "Right! We will use intervals to reduce the timeout values and keep updating our  views to display the timer. As we have been storing the form data in a single place,  our Bookstore component, let's go ahead and add a state value that will track this  timeout value. Let's change our initial state to something similar to the following:"  getInitialState   {     return  {currentStep: 1, formValues: {}, cartTimeout: 60 * 15} ;   }  "60 X 15, that's 15 minutes in seconds value. We will also need to add a method to  keep updating this state so that we can use it freely from here as well as the child  components."  updateCartTimeout timeout {     this.setState {cartTimeout: timeout} ; }  "Cool."

Next, we will define a method that can be used to define new intervals,  as follows:"    setInterval: function   {     this.intervals.push setInterval.apply null, arguments  ;   }  "Got it. I see the last bit is defining the componentWillUnmount method and we have  already defined componentWillMount; but this isn't a React component. Why do we  have these method here?"  "Oh right. Let's take a look at the following method first:"    componentWillUnmount: function   {     this.intervals.map clearInterval ;   }  "What this method does is clean up the intervals, which we might have created,  before we unmount our component."  "Got it."  "Now, as you mentioned, we have two life cycle methods here— componentWillMount and componentWillUnmount."  "When we start using this in our component, they are called just like the other similar  methods, which we have in our component for life cycle."  "Oh nice.

Can you define a mixin to do just that?" asked Mike.  "Okay, I will first define a method to decrement the cart timer, something that will  keep updating the state.

We saw how to make  use of mixins and extract similar functionalities to use seamlessly across components.

Getting React to render on server "Hey Shawn!" Mike startled Shawn, entering their workplace with a cup of coffee.  "Good morning, Mike," replied Shawn.  Sun sparkled on Shawn's desk and they entered into a conversation about a new  project that they were about to begin.  "Shawn, I just came to know, from Carla, about a new project that we need to take.  The client has asked us to build a simple search page for our Open Library project."  [ 109 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Shawn and Mike had previously build an application to display recent changes from  openlibrary.com API. They were now going to build a search application on top of  Open Library's Search API.  "Awesome," Mike was excited about this. He was already loving working on React.  "Shawn, for this project, we will be exploring options on how to use React on   the server."  Until now, we have been manually mounting our components after page load.   Until the component is rendered, the page doesn't have any HTML content from   the component.  "Let's see how we will be doing this on the server so that HTML is pre-generated on  the page instead of after the page has completely loaded."  "Got it. How is rendering of components on server side useful though?"  "It is useful for a couple of reasons. One being that we are generating content on the  server. This is useful for SEO purpose and better indexing with search engines."  "As the content is generated on the server, the first render would display the page  immediately instead of waiting for the page load to properly finish, after which the  component would be rendered."  "This also helps us to avoid a flicker effect on our page loads. There are other such  niceties that we can harness, we'll explore them later," Mike explained.  "Cool. Let's begin then."  "Alright! For this project, let's begin with a starter Webpack Project to manage  our code. For the server element, we will be using Express JS. We won't be doing  anything complex here, we will simply expose a route from Express JS and render   a .ejs view that consists of our component."  "An example of such a starter project can be found on the http:  webpack.github. io  website," informed Mike.  "Cool, I think we will divide the code on client server side as well?"  "Yes. Let's put them under the  app directory to consist our components,  client  for client-specific code, and  server for the code to be used on server in our  src  directory," continued Mike.  [ 110 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   "Next, we will be setting up the server.js file in  app server directory."  import path from 'path'; import Express from 'express';  var app = Express  ; var server;  const PATH_STYLES = path.resolve __dirname, '.. client styles' ; const PATH_DIST = path.resolve __dirname, '.. .. dist' ;  app.use ' styles', Express.static PATH_STYLES  ; app.use Express.static PATH_DIST  ;  app.get ' ',  req, res  => {   res.sendFile path.resolve __dirname, '.. client index.html'  ; } ;  server = app.listen process.env.PORT  3000,    => {   var port = server.address  .port;    console.log 'Server is listening at %s', port ; } ;  "That's a pretty standard Express App setup.

We started with a client-side React component and in  the end, replaced it with server-side rendering using the methods provided by the  React API.  In the next chapter, we will look at React add ons for doing two-way binding,  class name manipulation, cloning components, immutability helpers, and  PureRenderMixin, while continuing with the search project build in this chapter.  [ 126 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   React Addons  In the previous chapter, we learned to use React on the server side. We understood  pre-rendering of the React components and changes in the component life cycle  when using React on server. We also saw how to use server-side API of React   using Express.js.  In this chapter, we will look at React addons—utility packages that are not a part  of React core, however, they make development process fun and enjoyable. We  will learn to use immutability helpers, cloning of components, and test utilities in  this chapter. We will not be covering other addons such as Animation, Perf, and  PureRenderMixin. These addons will be covered in the following chapters.  In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:  Immutability helpers     Getting started with React addons       Cloning React components    Test helpers  Getting started with Addons After completing the previous project about using React on server side, Mike's team  got some free time before starting the next project. Mike decided to utilize this time  by learning about React addons.  "Shawn, we got some free time. Let's use it to get started with React addons."  "What are React addons? Are they related to React core library?" Shawn asked.  [ 127 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   "React addons are utility modules that are not a part of the React core library.  However, they are blessed by the React team. In future, some of them might be  included in the React core. These libraries provide helpers for writing immutable  code, utilities for testing React apps, and ways to measure and improve the  performance of React apps." explained Mike.  "Each addon has its own npm package, making it to simple to use. For example, to  use the Update addon, we need to install and require its npm package."    $ npm install  react-addons-update --save       src App.js    import Update from 'react-addons-update';  Immutability helpers "Shawn, as we are learning about addons, let's add the sorting feature to our app so  that the users can sort the books by their titles.

Mark explained.  "This can be easily fixed using Object.assign from ES6. We can simply create a new  array and copy the current value of this.state.books in it. We can then sort the  new array and call setState with the new sorted array." informed Shawn.  The Object.assign method copies the values of all the enumerable  properties from multiple source objects in a target. More details can be  found at the following: https:  developer.mozilla.org en  docs Web JavaScript Reference Global_Objects Object  assign.  _sortByTitle   {     let sortByAttribute = this.state.sorting === 'asc' ?

This works. But the Object.assign method will make a shallow copy of this. state.books. It will create a new unsortedBooks object, however, it will still use  the same references from this.state.books in unsortedBooks. Let's say, for some  reason, we want the titles of all books in uppercase letters, then we may accidently  mutate this.state too," Mike explained.  _sortByTitle   {     let sortByAttribute = this.state.sorting === 'asc' ? "title" :  "-title";     let unsortedBooks = Object.assign [], this.state.books ;     unsortedBooks.map  book  => book.title = book.title. toUpperCase   ;     console.log "unsortedBooks" ;     console.log unsortedBooks[0].title ;     console.log "this.state.books" ;     console.log this.state.books[0].title ;    }  "As you can see, even after using Object.assign, this.state.books was still  mutated. Actually, this has nothing to do with React as such. It is due to the way  JavaScript passes references of arrays and objects around. However, due to this, if  we have arrays and objects in our deeply nested state, it becomes hard to prevent  mutations." Mike further explained.  "Do we always have to perform a deep copy of the state object to be on the safer side?"  Shawn asked.  "Well, deep copies can be expensive and sometimes hard to achieve with deeply  nested state. Fortunately, React provides the Update addon with immutability  helpers, which we can use to solve this issue." added Mike.  [ 131 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   "While using immutability helpers, we need to answer the following three  questions:"     What needs to be changed?    Where it needs to be changed?    How it needs to be changed?  "In this case, we need to change the this.state to display the sorted books."  "The second question is that where should the mutation happen inside this.state?  The mutation should happen in this.state.books."  "The third question is that how should the mutation happen? Are we going to delete  something or add any new element or restructure existing elements? In this case, we  want to sort the elements as per some criterion."  "The Update addon accepts two parameters. The first parameter is the object that we  want to mutate. The second parameter tells us where and how should the mutation  take place in the first parameter. In this case, we want to mutate this.state. In  this.state, we want to update the books with the sorted books. Therefore, our  code will look similar to the following:"  Update this.state, { books: { sortedBooks }}   Available commands The Update addon provides different commands to perform the mutations in   arrays and objects. The syntax of these commands is inspired by MongoDB's   query language.  "Most of these commands operate on array objects allowing us to push in an array or  unshift an element from the array. It also supports replacing the target entirely using  the set command. Other than this, it also provides the merge command to merge new  keys with an existing object." Mike explained.  "Shawn, my favorite command provided by this addon is apply. It takes a function  and applies that function to the current value of the target that we want to modify.   It gives more flexibility to make changes in the complex data structures. It's also  a hint for your next task. Try to use it to sort the books by title without mutating."  Mike challenged.  [ 132 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   "Sure. Here you go," said Shawn.         src App.js  import Update from 'react-addons-update';    _sortByTitle   {   let sortByAttribute = this.state.sorting === 'asc' ? "title" :  "-title";   console.log "Before sorting" ;   console.log this.state.books[0].title ;   let newState = Update this.state,                         { books: { $apply:  books  => { return books. sort sortBy sortByAttribute   } },                           sorting: { $apply:  sorting  => { return  sorting === 'asc' ? 'desc' : 'asc' } } } ;   console.log "After sorting" ;   console.log this.state.books[0].title ;   this.setState newState ;   }  "Perfect, Shawn. Using the Update addon makes it very easy to manage complex  state without actually mutating it."  Check https:  facebook.github.io immutable-js  docs  for a complete solution for using immutable data  structures in JavaScript.  Cloning components "Shawn, props are also immutable in React. In most of the cases, the child component  just uses props passed by the parent component. However, sometimes we want  to extend the incoming props with some new data before rendering the child  component. It's a typical use case to update styles and CSS classes. React provides an  addon to clone a component and extending its props. It's called the cloneWithProps  addon." said Mike.  [ 133 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   "Mike, that addon is deprecated. I had looked at it in the past and React has  deprecated it. It also has lot of issues related to refs of the child component not  getting passed to the newly-cloned child components," Shawn informed.  "True. However, React also has a top-level React.cloneElement API method, which  allows us to clone and extend a component. It has a very simple API and it can be  used instead of the cloneWithProps addon." Mike explained.  React.cloneElement element, props, …children ;  "This method can be used to clone the given element and merge the new props with  existing props. It replaces existing children with new children. Therefore, we have to  keep this in mind while dealing with the child components."  "The cloneElement function also passes ref of the old child component to the   newly-cloned component. Therefore, if we have any callbacks based on refs,   they will continue to work even after cloning."  "Shawn, here is your next challenge. We show listing of books in our app. In fact, in  all of our apps, we show the listing of other things such as products, items, and so  on. We want to show the rows with alternate colors in all of these listings instead  of just white background. As the code for this feature will be the same across all the  apps, I am thinking about creating a separate component that will accept rows as  input and render them with alternate colors. Such components can be used in all  of our apps. I think that you can make use of React.cloneElement for this." Mike  explained the next task.  "Sounds like a good idea to extract this as a separate component. We need it in  almost all the apps. Our QA was complaining about the lack of colors in our search  app yesterday." Shawn remembered.  "Let's add some alternate colors then." Mike chuckled.

Mike was happy.  Helpers for testing React apps "Shawn, we have not added any tests for our app yet, however, the time has come  to start slowly adding test coverage. With the Jest library and Test Utilities addon,  it becomes very easy to set up and start testing the React apps." Mark explained the  next task.  "I have heard about Jest. Isn't it a testing library by Facebook?" Shawn asked.  Setting up Jest "Yes. It's built on top of Jasmine. It's very easy to set up. First, we have to install the  jest-cli and babel-jest packages."  npm install jest-cli --save-dev  npm install babel-jest –-save-dev  "After that, we need to configure package.json, as follows:"  {  ...

We are also specifying the extensions for our test file  that will be identified by Jest as test files."  "Create a __test__ folder, where we will be adding our tests. Jest will run the tests  from files in this folder. Let's add an empty file too. We have to make sure that the  file should end with -test.js so that Jest will pick up it to run the tests." Mike  explained.  mkdir __test__  touch __test__ app-test.js  "Now let's verify that we can run the tests from the command line."  $ npm test  > jest  > react-addons-examples@0.0.1 test  Users prathamesh Projects sources  reactjs-by-example chapter7  Using Jest CLI v0.7.1  PASS __tests__ app-test.js  0.007s   You should see an output that is similar to the preceding output. It  may change based on the Jest version. Consult https:  facebook. github.io jest docs getting-started.html to set up Jest, in  case of any issues.  "Shawn, we are all set with Jest. It's time to start writing the tests now. We will test  whether the top-level App component gets mounted correctly. However, first, we  need to understand a bit more about using Jest," said Mike.  "By default, Jest mocks all the modules that are required in a test file. Jest does this  to isolate the module that is under test from all the other modules. In this case, we  want to test the App component. If we just require it, then Jest will provide a mocked  version of App."     app-test.js        const App = require 'App' ;    Mocked by Jest  [ 140 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   "As we we want to test the App component itself, we need to specify Jest not to mock  it.

It helps in testing both the structure and behavior of the React  components." Mike added.  Testing structure of React components "We will start with the renderIntoDocument function. This function renders  the given component into a detached DOM node in the document. It returns  ReactComponent, which can be used for further testing."     app-test.js  describe 'App',    => {   it 'mounts successfully',    => {     let app = TestUtils.renderIntoDocument   ;     expect app.state.books .toEqual [] ;     expect app.state.searching .toEqual false ;   }  } ;  "We rendered the App component in DOM and asserted that initially books and  searching state are being set correctly." Mike explained.  [ 141 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   "Mike, this is awesome. We are not testing real DOM, but testing the React  components instead."  "Yes. The TestUtils addon comes with finder methods that can be used to find  the child components in a given component tree. They are useful to find the child  components such as input box and submit button and simulate click events or  change events."     findAllInRenderedTree tree, predicate function : This is useful for  finding all the components in a given tree that returns the truth value for the  predicate function.     scryRenderedDOMComponentsWithClass tree, className : This is useful   for finding all the DOM components with a given class name.     findRenderedDOMComponentWithClass tree, className : Instead of  finding all the DOM components with a given class, this method expects   that only one such component is present. It throws an exception if there   are multiple components with a given class name.     scryRenderedDOMComponentsWithTag tree, tagName : It's similar to  finding the DOM components with the class name, however, instead of   class name, it finds the components based on a given tag name.     findRenderedDOMComponentWithTag tree, tagName : Instead of finding  all the components with a given tag, it expects that only one such component  is present. It also throws exception when more than one such components  exists.     scryRenderedComponentsWithType tree, componentType : This   method finds all the components with a given type. It's useful to find all the  composite components created by the user.     findRenderedComponentWithType  tree, componentType : This is   similar to all the previous finder methods. It raises exception if more than  one component with a given type is present.  Testing behavior of React components "Let's use these functions to assert that the search for books starts when a user enters  a search term and clicks the Submit button. We will simulate the event of entering  search term by the user." said Mike.     app-test.js  it 'starts searching when user enters search term and clicks submit',     => {  [ 142 ]  www.it-ebooks.info       let app = TestUtils.renderIntoDocument   ;      let inputNode = TestUtils.findRenderedDOMComponentWithTag app,  'input' ;     inputNode.value = "Dan Brown";     TestUtils.Simulate.change inputNode ;     let submitButton = TestUtils.findRenderedDOMComponentWithTag app,  'button' ;     TestUtils.Simulate.click submitButton ;     expect app.state.searching .toEqual true ;     expect app.state.searchCompleted .toEqual false ;   }   "We render the App component, find the input node, set the value of the input node  to the search term, and simulate the change event using TestUtils.Simulate  .  This function simulates the given event dispatch on a DOM node. The Simulate  function has a method for every event that React understands. Therefore, we can  simulate all events such as change, click, and so on. We can test the user behavior  using this method," Mike explained.  "Got it. Therefore, after changing the search term, we click the submit button and  verify that the state gets updated as per our expectations," informed Shawn.  "Yes, Shawn. Now, can you check whether the Spinner is shown once the user clicks  the Submit button? You can use one of the finder method that we discussed earlier."  Mike explained the next task. "Yes. Once the component state changes after clicking the Submit button, we can  search the rendered component tree to see whether the Spinner component is present  or not."     app-test.js     __tests__ app-test.js  import Spinner from '. .. src Spinner';  it 'starts searching when user enters search term and clicks submit',     => {     let app = TestUtils.renderIntoDocument   ;     let inputNode = TestUtils.findRenderedDOMComponentWithTag app,  'input' ;     inputNode.value = "Dan Brown";     TestUtils.Simulate.change inputNode ;     let submitButton = TestUtils.findRenderedDOMComponentWithTag app,  'button' ;     TestUtils.Simulate.click submitButton ;  [ 143 ]  www.it-ebooks.info       expect app.state.searching .toEqual true ;     expect app.state.searchCompleted .toEqual false ;     let spinner = TestUtils.findRenderedComponentWithType app,  Spinner ;     expect spinner .toBeTruthy  ;   } ,  "We are using TestUtils.findRenderedComponentWithType here to check whether  Spinner is present in the tree rendered by the App component or not. However,  before adding this assertion, we need to import the Spinner component at the top of  the test file as findRenderedComponentWithType expects a second argument to be a  React component."  "Excellent, Shawn. As you can see, the testing behavior of the React component  becomes very easy with the TestUtils.Simulate and finder methods." Mike  explained.  Note that we have not added a test to asynchronously load  the books from Open Library API as it is out of the scope  of this chapter.  Shallow rendering "Shawn, TestUtils also provides one more way to test the components in an   isolated fashion using the Shallow rendering. Shallow rendering allows us render   the top-level component and assert the facts about the return value of it's render  method. It does not render children components or instantiate them. Therefore, our  tests are not affected by the behavior of the children components. Shallow rendering  also does not require a DOM, unlike the previous methods, where we rendered the  component in a detached DOM," Mike explained.  let renderer = TestUtils.createRenderer  ;  "This creates a shallow renderer object, in which we will render the component that  we want to test. Shallow renderer has a render method similar to ReactDOM.render,  which can be used to render the component."  let renderer = TestUtils.createRenderer  ; let result = renderer.render   ;  "After render method is called, we should call renderer.getRenderedOutput,  which returns the shallowly rendered output of rendering the component. We can  start asserting facts about the component on the output of getRenderedOutput."  [ 144 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   "Let's see the output we get from getRenderedOutput."  let renderer = TestUtils.createRenderer  ; let result = renderer.render   ; result = renderer.getRenderOutput  ; console.log result ;     Output of console.log result   Object {   '$$typeof': Symbol react.element ,   type: 'div',   key: null,   ref: null,   props:     Object {      className: 'container',      children: Array [ [Object], undefined ] },   _owner: null,   _store: Object {} }  "As you can see, based on the rendered output, we can assert the facts about  props of the current component. However, if we want to test anything about  children component, we need to explicitly reach out to them through this.props. children[0].props.children[1].props.children."  "This makes it hard to test the behavior of the children components using shallow  rendering. However, it's useful for testing small components in an isolated way as it  does not get affected by children component due to shallow rendering," said Mike.  Summary In this chapter, we started with understanding the React addons and how to use  them. We used immutability helpers and test utility functions provided by the   addons. We also looked into how to clone the components.  In the next chapter, we will make our React app more performant. You will be  learning about addons that will improve the performance of the React apps.  Specifically, you will learn how to measure the performance of our apps and   how React can make faster updates without changing most of the UI.  Let's make our React apps faster!  [ 145 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   www.it-ebooks.info   Performance of React Apps  In the previous chapter, we learned to use various React add-ons. We saw add-ons  ranging from immutability helpers to test utilities.  In this chapter, we will look at React performance tools that can improve the  performance of our React apps. In particular, we will be using the PERF add-on,  PureRenderMixin and shouldComponentUpdate. We will also look at some of the  gotchas that needs to be considered while using the performance tools provided   by React.  Performance of React apps "Hey Mike, I have few questions for you today. I have been thinking about our search  app over the weekend. Do you have some time to discuss them?" Shawn asked.  "Sure, but let me get some coffee first. Okay, I am ready now. Shoot!" said Mike.  "I have few questions about the performance of React apps. I know React is very  good at re-rendering the component tree whenever the state changes. React has  made it very easy for me to understand and reason my code. However, does it not  hamper the performance? Re-rendering seems like a very costly affair, especially  when re-rendering large component trees." Shawn asked.  "Shawn, the re-rendering can be expensive. Nevertheless, React is smart about it. It  only renders the part that is changed. It does not need to re-render everything on the  page. It's also smart at keeping the DOM manipulation as least as possible."  "How is that possible? How does it know which part of the page is changed? Does it  not depend on user interactions or incoming states and props?" questioned Shawn.  [ 147 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   "The virtual DOM comes to the rescue here. It does all the heavy lifting of keeping  track of what changed and helping React make only minimal changes to the real  DOM." Mike explained.  Virtual DOM "Shawn, React uses virtual DOM to keep track of what has changed in the real  DOM. It's concept is very easy to understand. React always keeps a copy of the  representation of the actual DOM in memory. Whenever something changes,  such as some state manipulation, it calculates another copy of the DOM that will  be generated with new state and props. Then it calculates the difference between  the original copy of the virtual DOM and the new copy of the virtual DOM. This  difference results in minimal operations on the real DOM that can take the current  DOM to a new stage. In this way, React does not have to do major changes when  something changes." Mike explained.  "But isn't the diff calculation expensive?" asked Shawn.  "It's not expensive when you compare it with actual DOM operations. Manipulation  of DOM is always expensive. The comparison of virtual DOM occurs in JavaScript  code, so it is always faster than doing manual DOM operations." said Mike.  "Another advantage of this approach is that once React knows what operations   are needed to be performed on DOM, it does them in a single batch. Therefore,   when we render a list of 100 elements, instead of appending one element at a time,  React will do minimal DOM operations to insert these 100 elements on the page."  Mike explained.  "I am impressed!" Shawn exclaimed .  "You will be more impressed. Let me actually show you what I mean. Let's use the  PERF add-on from React and actually see what we discussed in real time."  The PERF addon "Let's start with installing the PERF addon."  $ npm install react-addons-perf --save-dev  "We need this add-on only in the development mode. This is an important point to  remember because in production, we don't need the debugging information as it  may make our app slow." informed Mike.  [ 148 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   "Shawn, the PERF add-on can be used to see what changes React is doing with  the DOM, where is it spending time while rendering our app, is it wasting some  time while rendering, and so on. This information can then be used to improve the  performance of the app." said Mike.  "Let's start by exposing the PERF add-on as a global object. We can use it in the  browser console while our app is running to see how React is making changes   as per the user interactions." explained Mike.     index.js import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'; import React from 'react'; import App from '. App'; import Perf from 'react-addons-perf';  window.Perf = Perf;  ReactDOM.render  , document.getElementById 'rootElement'  ;  "We have imported the PERF add-on in our index.js file, which is the starting point  of the app. We can access the Perf object in the browser console as we have attached  it to window.Perf." Mike added.  [ 149 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   "The PERF add-on comes with methods that can help us understand what React is  doing with the DOM when something changes. Let's measure some performance  statistics. We will start the measurement process by calling Perf.start   in the  browser console. After that, we will interact with the app. We will type in a query  to search a book, hit submit, and the search results will be displayed. We will stop  the performance measurement by calling Perf.stop   in the browser console. After  that, let's analyze the information that we gathered." Mike explained the process.  "Let's search for books written by Dan Brown."  "Once the results are displayed, let's stop the performance measurements."  DOM operations performed by React "Shawn, the PERF add-on can show us which DOM operations were performed by  React. Let's see what manipulations React did to the DOM to render the list of books  by Dan Brown." said Mike.  [ 150 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   "The Perf.printDOM   method tells us the DOM manipulations made by React. It  has made only two set innerHTML calls. First one is to render the spinner and second  one is to render the list of rows. In between, we see a call to remove, which must be  when the spinner was removed from the page."  "Wow, this method looks very handy as it can tell us if React is somehow doing some  extra DOM manipulations." said Shawn.  "Yes, but there are more tools for the purpose analyzing the performance. Let's see  how much time does React require to render each component. This can be achieved  using Perf.printInclusive  ." explained Mike.  Time taken to render all the components  "This method prints the overall time taken to render all the components. This also  included the time required to process props and set up initial state and calls to  componentDidMount and componentWillMount."  "Therefore, if we have some time-intensive operation in one of these hooks, it will  impact the output shown by the printInclusive function, right?" Shawn asked.  [ 151 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   "Exactly. Though the PERF add-on provided another method—printExclusive  — that prints the time to taken render without these hooks, which are used to mount  apps."  "But Mike, these methods are not that helpful for detecting the performance of React.  I get the overall picture about what all things happened, but it does not tell me how  to optimize which part." asked Shawn.  Time wasted by React "Shawn, the PERF add-on can also tell us how much time was wasted by React and  where. It is helpful in determining the parts of our app that we can optimize further."  said Mike.  "What is wasted time?"  "When React re-renders a component tree, some components may not change from  their previous representation. However, if they are rendered again, then React has  wasted time in rendering the same output. The PERF add-on can keep track of all  such time and give us a summary of how React wasted time rendering the same  output as before. Let's see this in action." said Mike.  "The PERF add-on tells us that it wasted time in re-rendering the Form component  twice, but nothing was changed in the Form component, therefore, it just re-rendered  everything as it is." explained Mike.  "Let's see the Form component to understand why it is happening."     src Form.js  import React from 'react';  export default React.createClass {  [ 152 ]  www.it-ebooks.info     getInitialState   {     return { searchTerm: '' };   },    _submitForm   {     this.props.performSearch this.state.searchTerm ;   },    render   {     return                                             <input type="text"                    className="form-control input-lg"                    placeholder="Search books..."                    onChange={ event  => { this.setState {searchTerm:  event.target.value}  }} >                             <button className="btn btn-primary btn-lg"                       type="button"                       onClick={this._submitForm}>                 Go!                                                                     } }   "Shawn, the Form component does not depend on state or props for its rendering.  It renders the same output irrespective of state and props. However, we update its  state when a user enters a character in the input box. Due to this, React will re-render  it. Nothing is actually changed in the re-rendered output. Therefore, the PERF   add-on is complaining about the wasted time." Mike explained.  "This is useful information, but this looks like an insignificant wastage, right?"  Shawn asked.  "Agree. Let's make some changes so that I can show you how React can literally  waste a lot of time re-rendering the same output when it shouldn't." said Mike.  [ 153 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   "Currently, we only show the first 100 search results returned by the Open Library  API. Let's change our code to show all the results on same page."     src App.js getInitialState   {     return { books: [],              totalBooks: 0,              offset: 100,              searching: false,              sorting: 'asc',              page: 1,              searchTerm: '',              totalPages: 1     };   }  "I have introduced a new state to hold the search term, total number of pages to fetch  from the Open Library, and current page number being fetched."  "Now, we want to fetch all the results from the API, by default, on the same page.  The API returns us the total number of books found for a query in the numFounds  attribute. Based on this, we need to find the total number of pages that we need to  fetch from the API."  "Also, each time maximum 100 records are returned that we have stored in state. offset already."  totalPages = response.numFound   this.state.offset + 1;  "Once we get the total number of pages, we need to keep asking for the search   results for the next page until all the pages are fetched. You want to try and get   this working?" asked Mike.  "Sure." said Shawn.      src App.js        Called when user hits "Go" button.  _performSearch searchTerm  {     this.setState {searching: true, searchTerm: searchTerm} ;     this._searchOpenLibrary searchTerm ;   },    _searchOpenLibrary searchTerm  {     let openlibraryURI = `https:  openlibrary.org search.json?q=${sear chTerm}&page=${this.state.page}`;  [ 154 ]  www.it-ebooks.info       this._fetchData openlibraryURI .then this._updateState ;   },       called with the response received from open library API   _updateState response  {     let jsonResponse = response;     let newBooks = this.state.books.concat jsonResponse.docs ;     let totalPages = jsonResponse.numFound   this.state.offset + 1;     let nextPage = this.state.page + 1;      this.setState {       books: newBooks,       totalBooks: jsonResponse.numFound,       page: nextPage,       totalPages: totalPages     } this._searchAgain ;   },          Keep searching until all pages are fetched.   _searchAgain   {     if  this.state.page > this.state.totalPages  {       this.setState {searching: false} ;     } else {       this._searchOpenLibrary this.state.searchTerm ;     }   }  "I changed the API URL to include the page parameter. Each time the response is  received from API, we update the state with a new page. We also update this. state.books to include the newly fetched books. Then, the _searchAgain function  gets called in the callback of the this.setState call so that it is the correct value of  the next page that was set by the this.setState call." explains Shawn.  "Nice, it's an important point to remember not to call the _searchAgain function  outside of the this.setState   call as it may get executed before setState     is finished.  Because if we call it outside, the _searchAgain function may use an incorrect value  of this.state.page. However, as you have passed the _searchAgain function in  the callback to setState, there is no chance this will happen." said Mike.  "The _searchAgain function just keeps fetching the results until all the pages are  completed. In this way, we will display all the search results on the page, not just   the first 100." informed Shawn.  [ 155 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   "That's what I wanted. Good job. Let me cleanup the render method so that spinner  will always be displayed at the bottom." said Mike.     src App.js render   {     let style = {paddingTop: '5%'};     return                              <Form style={style}               performSearch={this._performSearch}>                    {this.state.totalBooks > 0 ?          <BookList              searchCount={this.state.totalBooks}              _sortByTitle={this._sortByTitle}>            {this._renderBooks  }                   : null }          { this.state.searching ?   : null }              ;   }  "This will make sure that the spinner will be displayed until all the results are  displayed. OK, all done. Now let's measure the performance again." said Mike.  "Wow, the wasted time has increased a lot! Did Dan Brown release new books or  what? So much extra time than what we saw last time?" said Shawn.  [ 156 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   "Haha, I don't think that he released new books just now. Whenever the books on  next page are fetched, we add them to the existing books and start fetching books  from the next page. However, the books rendered for the previous pages are not  changed at all. As we are keeping all of our state in the top-level App component,  whenever its state changes, the whole component tree under App gets re-rendered.  Therefore, BookList is rendered again. In turn, all BookRows are rendered again.  This results in a significant amount of time getting wasted in rendering the same  BookRow components for the previous pages again and again." said Mike.  "So each time we fetch books from a new page, all books, including the existing ones  already present on page, get re-rendered again? I think just appending new book  rows to the existing list is better in this case." said Shawn.  "Don't worry. We can easily get rid of this unnecessary wastage of time.  React provides us a hook for short-circuiting the re-render process. It's  shouldComponentUpdate."  The shouldComponentUpdate hook "Shawn, shouldComponentUpdate is a hook that tells React whether to   re-render a component or not. It's not called for initial rendering of the component.  However, whenever a component is going to receive new state or props,  shouldComponentUpdate is called before that. If the return value of this function is  true, then React re-renders the component. However, if the return value is false,  then React does not re-render the component until the next time it is called. The  componentWillUpdate and componentDidUpdate hooks will also not be called in  this case." Mike explained.  "Nice. Then why did our code waste so much time? Should React not use this   hook to optimize it and not re-render the same BookRow components repeatedly?"  Shawn asked.  "By default, shouldComponentUpdate always returns true. React does this to  avoid subtle bugs. We can have mutable state or props in our code that can make  shouldComponentUpdate to return false positives. It may return false when it should  return true, resulting in the component not being re-rendered when it should.  Therefore, React places the responsibility of implementing shouldComponentUpdate  in the developer's hand." said Mike.  "Let's try to use shouldComponentUpdate ourselves in order to reduce the time  wasted in re-rendering the same BookRow components." Mike added.  [ 157 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   "This is our BookRow component as of now:"     src BookRow.js  import React from 'react';  export default React.createClass {   render   {     return                    {this.props.index}             {this.props.title}             { this.props.author_name  [] .join ', ' }             {this.props.edition_count}                ;   } } ;  "Let's add shouldComponentUpdate to reduce unnecessary re-rendering."     src BookRow.js  import React from 'react';  export default React.createClass {   shouldComponentUpdate nextProps, nextState  {     return nextProps.title !== this.props.title             nextProps.author_name !== this.props.author_name             nextProps.edition_count !== this.props.edition_count;   },    render   {     return                    {this.props.index}             {this.props.title}             { this.props.author_name  [] .join ', ' }             {this.props.edition_count}                ;   } } ;  [ 158 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The shouldComponentUpdate hook gets nextProps and nextState as arguments  and we can compare them with the current state or props to make a decision whether  to return true or false.  "Here, we are checking whether the title, author name, or edition count is changed  or not. If any of these attributes are changed, then we will return true. However, if  all of them are unchanged, then we will return false. Therefore, if none of the props  are changed, the component will not get re-rendered. As the BookRow component  only depends on props, we don't have to worry about the state change at all."   added Mike.  "Now, measure the performance again and see if we got some improvements."  "Awesome, we got rid of the time spent in re-rendering the BookRow components  completely. However, we can still improve a lot. Looks like we can also get rid of the  time spent re-rendering the Form and Header components, based on the preceding  result. They are static components. Therefore, they should not be re-rendered at all.  Shawn, that's your next challenge."

"Perfect find, Shawn. Make a note of such static components that do not depend on  anything. They are perfect targets for just telling React to not even compare their  virtual DOM as they do not need to be re-rendered at all." informed Mike.  "Right. I will keep an eye on such static parts of UI that can be extracted into smaller  components." said Shawn.  "Let's now see if we got rid of some more wasted time after doing these  improvements."  "Cool! We got rid of the time wasted for re-rendering the same Header and Form  components." said Mike.  "Awesome! Let me also try to get rid of the time spent on BookList and  RowAlternator too." informed Shawn.  "Hold on, Shawn. Before doing this, I want to discuss about an alternative to  shouldComponentUpdate."  PureRenderMixin "Shawn, PureRenderMixin is an add-on that can be used in place of  shouldComponentUpdate. Under the hood, it uses shouldComponentUpdate and  compares the current props and state with the next props and states. Let's try it in  our code. First, we need to install the add-on, of course." said Mike.  $ npm install react-addons-pure-render-mixin     src Header.js  import React from 'react';  import PureRenderMixin from 'react-addons-pure-render-mixin';  export default React.createClass {  [ 161 ]  www.it-ebooks.info     mixins: [PureRenderMixin],       ..       ..  }      src Form.js  export default React.createClass {    mixins: [PureRenderMixin],    ..    ..       }  }   import React from 'react';  import PureRenderMixin from 'react-addons-pure-render-mixin';  "Shawn, let's see the wasted time now that we have used PureRenderMixin."   said Mike.  "Oh, it got worse. The PureRenderMixin function added the time wasted in   re-rendering Form and Header components back. What is going on, Mike?"   Shawn asked.  "Calm down! I am going to explain why this happened. The PureRenderMixin  compares the current props and state with the next props and state, but it does  shallow comparison. Therefore, if we are passing the state or props that contain  objects and arrays, then the shallow comparison will not return true even if they   both have the same content." Mike explained.  [ 162 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   "However, where are we passing any complex objects or arrays to the Header   and Form components? We are just passing the book data such as the name of   author, edition count, and so on. We are not passing anything to Header, how   does PureRenderMixin fail?" Shawn asked.  "You are forgetting style prop passed to Header and Form from the App component."  informed Mike.     src App.js  render   {     let style = {paddingTop: '5%'};     return                              <Form style={style}               performSearch={this._performSearch}>                    ..          ..          }  "Each time App gets re-rendered, a new object for style is created and sent to Header  and Form in props."  The PureRenderMixin anti pattern The PureRenderMixin internally implements shouldComponentUpdate, as follows:   var ReactComponentWithPureRenderMixin = {   shouldComponentUpdate: function nextProps, nextState  {     return shallowCompare this, nextProps, nextState ;   }, };  The shallowCompare function is also an add-on provided by React that is a helper  function to compare the current state and props with the next state and props. It  basically achieves the same thing as PureRenderMixin, but as it is a function, it can  be used directly instead of using PureRenderMixin. It is especially needed when we  are using ES6 classes with React." Mike explained.  [ 163 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   "Mike, so the shallow comparison is the reason why PureRenderMixin is failing to  detect that there is no change in the next props?" Shawn asked.  "Yes. The shallowCompare just iterates over the keys of objects that are being  compared and returns false when the value of the key in each object is not strictly  equal. Therefore, if we pass simple props, as follows, then shallowCompare will  correctly determine that re-rendering is not required:"     shallowCompare will detect correctly that props are not changed. { author_name: "Dan Brown",    edition_count: "20",    title: "Angels and Demons" }  "However, it will fail immediately with a prop that is an object or array."  { author_name: "Dan Brown",    edition_count: "20",    title: "Angels and Demons",    style: { paddingTop: '%5' } }  "Though PureRenderMixin saves us a few lines of code, it may not work all the time  as we expect it to work. Especially when we have mutable state, objects, or arrays in  props." said Mike.  "Got it. So we can write our own shouldComponentUpdate function when we have  nested state or props right?", Shawn asked.  "Yes. PureRenderMixin and shallowCompare is good for simple components with  simple props and states but we should take care when we are using it." Mike.  Using mixins is discouraged in React world for various reasons.  Checkout alternative approaches for PureRenderMixin pattern  here - https:  github.com gaearon react-pure-render.  Immutable data "Mike, I have a question though. All said and done, why does PureRenderMixin  perform shallow comparison in the first place? Should it not perform a deep  comparison so that we will always have better performance?" Shawn was not   very happy with PureRenderMixin.  "Well, there is a reason for this. Shallow comparison is very cheap. It does not take  much time. Deep comparison is always expensive. Therefore, PureRenderMixin  does shallow comparison, which is good enough for most of the simple use cases,"  said Mike.  [ 164 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   "However, React does provide us an option of defining our own version of  shouldComponentUpdate as we saw earlier. We can completely short-circuit the   re-rendering process by just returning false from shouldComponentUpdate or we  can compare only those props that are required by our component."  "True, just like we had written shouldComponentUpdate for the BookRow component  right?" asked Shawn.     src BookRow.js  export default React.createClass {   shouldComponentUpdate nextProps, nextState  {     return nextProps.title !== this.props.title             nextProps.author_name !== this.props.author_name             nextProps.edition_count !== this.props.edition_count;   },    render   {     return                  ..              ;   } } ;  "Exactly, Shawn. If needed, you can also perform a deep comparison as per the  requirements of your component when needed."     custom deep comparison as per requirement shouldComponentUpdate nextProps, nextState  {     return nextProps.book.review === props.book.review; }  "Shawn, another option we have is using immutable data. Comparing immutable  data with each other is very easy as it will always create new data or objects instead  of mutating the existing ones."     pseudo code  book_ids = [1, 2, 3] new_book_ids = book_ids.push 4  book_ids === new_book_ids  false  [ 165 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   "Therefore, we just have to compare the reference of the new object with the old  object, they are always same when the values are equal and they are always different  when values are unequal. Therefore, if we use immutable data for our props and  state, then PureRenderMixin will work as expected." said Mike.  Check http:  facebook.github.io immutable-js   as an option for using immutable data for state and props.  Summary In this chapter, you learned about the performance tools provided by React and  how to use them. We used the PERF add-on: shouldComponentUpdate and  PureRenderMixin. We also saw which areas to look for when trying to improve  the performance of our apps. We also studied the pitfalls while improving the  performance, especially with PureRenderMixin. In the end, we discussed the  importance and advantages of immutable data.  In the next chapter, we will look at the data model of React in detail using React  Router and Flux. You will learn how to use React with other frameworks such   as Backbone.  [ 166 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   React Router and   Data Models  In the previous chapter, we took a look at the React performance tools that can  improve performance of our React apps. We explored using the PERF add-on,  PureRenderMixin, and so on and took a look at some of the gotchas related to   the performance tools provided by React.  In this chapter, we will take a closer look at react-router and perform routing  at different levels. We will take a look at nested routing and passing around  parameters, as well as see how react-router maintains history when performing  routing tasks. We will also take a look at passing and using context to render React  Components. Finally, we will explore data-models and mix and match them with  other frameworks to use as data models in React, Backbone in this case.  In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:     React in your apps    Routing with react-router    Different routing mechanism    Setting up routing and passing around the routing context    React and data stores models    Using Backbone models collections as data stores  At the end of chapter, we will be able to start using the react-router and different  routing patterns and start passing around context data in routing. We will also be  able to replace parts of plain data models with the likes of Backbone.js.  [ 167 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   A new adventure "Hi Shawn and Mike!" exclaimed Carla.  Shawn and Mike were startled. They had just got in and were about to start their  day. The past few days had been a lot of React exploration for them.  "I have some good news for you guys. We got a new project, where we need to   build a cat-based interest site. Something like say – Pinterest? Users can like images  and profiles of cats. They can then see and like related articles for sale, as well,"  continued Carla.  "Oh, nice," replied Shawn.  Shawn and Mike regrouped and started a conversation about the new project that  they just heard from Carla.  "This is nice. So, I guess, we want to display a small Pinterest-style gallery of images  in panel shapes?" inquired Shawn.  "Correct," continued Mike. "We also want to display the images in large scale, maybe  in a modal after a user clicks on the image. Carla said she wants random cats to be  featured in the footer, which should take us to a full-fledged cat display page."  "You know what, I know the perfect thing that we are going use. Let's take a look  at react-router today! I also know the perfect example to start with. We are going  to look at the Pinterest example from react-router at https:  github.com rackt  react-router tree master examples pinterest. We will then build our app on  top of it."  "Nice," said Shawn. "I can see the existing example has some of the things that we  discussed, such as the modal display. Let me see how the example looks."

"Yeah, let's go through the components that we need to create one by one. To begin  with, let's see how we are going to store our data and display the cat data across the  system. Currently, the images are stored in the PICTURES constant. We would like to  store more than that."  Creating Backbone models "So, Shawn, let's go ahead and build out our cats' collection that we want to display.  For the purpose of development, we are going to use cat images from lorempixel  service, for example, http:  lorempixel.com 600 600 cats . This will give us a  random cat image of 600 x 600 pixels."  [ 170 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   "Next, we are going to create a store of data using different-than-normal objects. We  want to explore how to embed different model flows with our React app here. In our  case, let's make use of Backbone models, instead of the PICTURES constant. I know  that you have already used Backbone."  "Yup, I have used it in my previous projects."  "Alright then, let's define our Cat model."  const PictureModel = Backbone.Model.extend {   defaults: {     src: 'http:  lorempixel.com 601 600 cats ',     name: 'Pusheen',     details: 'Pusheen is a Cat'   } } ;  "Here we store the src for the image of a cat, its name, and some details about it. As  you can see, we have provided some default values for these attributes."  "Next, let's define our Cats collection to all the Cat records."  const Cats = new Backbone.Collection; Cats.add new PictureModel {src: "http:  lorempixel.com 601 600 cats ",                                                name: Faker.Name. findName  ,                                                details: Faker.Lorem. paragraph  }  ;  Cats.add new PictureModel {src: "http:  lorempixel.com 602 600 cats ",                                                name: Faker.Name. findName  ,                                                details: Faker.Lorem. paragraph  }  ; …  "Here, we making use of the Faker module to create random names for the cats  using Faker.Name.findName  , adding random description using Faker.Lorem. paragraph   and passing the source as needed."

"Correct, we are creating a session history over here. We will use it for our router."  "Here, we are using the history module's useBasename method, which provides  support for running an app under a base URL, which in our case is  pinterest."  "Got it."  "Next, we are laying out how we actually want the routing to be. We wrap our router  into the   component and specify different   as paths." "This is called the Route Configuration, which is basically a set of rules or instructions  on how to match the URLs to some React Component in order to be displayed."  "Oh, can we discuss more about this configuration, it looks intriguing."  "It sure is. First, let's see what   does. When we  land on the   page for the application, which in our case would be  pinterest, the  component defined by IndexRoute gets rendered. As you might have guessed, the  component to be rendered is passed in the component argument of the route. Note  that this is displayed in the App component that is the base component for all."  Similar to the IndexRoute, we have different   definitions. In our example,  if you see  , it shows how  route is getting used, and how we are passing attributes for the same. "Here, the path  attribute is a matcher expression and component attribute specifies the component  that is to be displayed after the route is matched."  "Notice how the path is defined over here, it is specified as an expression."  The matching for a route based on a URL is done on the basis of three components:     Nesting of route    Path attribute    Precedence of the route  [ 173 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Shawn began, "I got the nesting part. I see that we have arranged our routes in a  nested fashion, like a tree. The route matching and building is being done on the  basis of this tree-like matching structure."  "Right. Secondly, we have the path attribute. We can see examples for these:"                <Route path=" this :cid is :randomId sampleroute"  component={Sample} >  "The path value is a string that acts as a regex, which can consist of the following parts:"     :paramName: For example, ID, which is the param passed in the URL such as    pictures 12. 12 gets parsed as param id.       : This can be used to specify an optional path, such as  pictures  :id ,   this will match  pictures as well as  pictures 12.     *: As in case of regular expressions, * can be used to match any part of the   expression, until the next  , ?, or  occurs. For example, to match all the JPEG  images, we can use  pictures *.jpg.     **: Greedy matching, similar to *, but it matches greedily. For example,    ** *.jpg will match  pictures 8.jpg as well as  photos 10.jpg.  "Got it. Finally, what remains is the precedence? Most probably, it should use the first  route that is defined in the file and satisfy the condition used to match the path?"  "Exactly," Mike exclaimed.  "Oh, before I forget, we also have a   route. This can be used to match  some routes to other route actions. For example, we want  photos 12 to match   pictures 12 instead, we can define it as code."     "Awesome."

Notice the URL. On clicking, the modal link changed to the  one on the anchor tag. We are on the same page and the  modal is displayed.  [ 181 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   "Finally, we have the sample page, where we display details of the cat. Let's see how  it looks:"  "Awesome!"  Data models and Backbone "Shawn, I wanted to discuss how we used Backbone models here or how we are  storing the data. We moved from the following code to make use of Backbone  collections. This helped us to define our data in a better way:"  PICTURES =[{array of objects}]  "However, if you notice, we ended up defining a static collection of objects. Along  with that, this collection was global and required to be passed around."  [ 182 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   "That is true. I also noticed that we had a fixed state in a global fashion for the data.  I believe, we could have not done much there. If we updated, the Views would still  remain the same?"  "Exactly! What's happening in our case is that we are sending and using modifying  the data in a fixed fashion, globally. Any updates to this data in a different part of  the application would not affect how our views were displayed or even the data that  was already being accessed in different components would not change. For example,  consider that the Home component changed the Cats constant. First of all, it would  not sync the changes with Sample, Modal, or other components."  "Secondly, the change in the Home component to the Cats collection would not even  change the Home component's display!"  "Ah, this is pretty tricky. I guess, we would end up storing all of this collection state  in a global component state, such as the App component, which is rendered only  once," followed Shawn.  "Yes, we could do that. The problem in that case would be that we would need to  manually maintain the state and update the state from the children components to  the App components, and so forth. Imagine having to change the state for a cat on  click, for example, someone faves an image of a cat. The event would take place on  the Picture component and we would need to manually propagate the event to  Home or Modal first and then to App in order to actually update the global collection."  "That would not be good. I believe this would be hard to track and debug as well."  "That's right. In our next refactoring, we will try to change this approach and limit it  to, say, the App. In the longer run, we would try out Flux."  "Oh, right, I have heard about it. It's for passing around or accessing data and  managing changes in data via events or something?"  "Umm, not exactly, it helps us to streamline the data flow in a unidirectional flow.  The state maintained is propagated to the components and they update as required.  Events, such as having a cat, may change the data store, which in turn changes the  components."  "Anyway, I just wanted to give you an idea about this and why we will explore Flux  later. For now, our solution works as expected."  The day was coming to an end. It has been another interesting day at Adequate LLC.  Shawn and Mike had collaborated and build a simple app using react-router and  mixing Backbone models with it.  [ 183 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Summary In this chapter, we built a simple Pinterest-like app, making use of react-router and  taking a closer look at it while performing routing at different levels. We also took a  look at nested routing, passing around parameters, how the react-router maintains  history, and so on, when performing the routing tasks. We took a look at how to pass  and use the context to render the React components and mix Backbone models to  maintain the Cats display data.  In the next chapter, we will explore adding animation to content and some other  display goodies on top of the existing app.  [ 184 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Animation  In the previous chapter, we took a look at react-router and performed routing at  different levels. We also looked at nested routing, passing around parameters, and  how react-router maintains history when performing the routing tasks. We learned  about passing around context and using context to render React components. We  explored data models and mixed and matched them with other frameworks to use as  data models in React-like Backbone, and were introduced to Flux.  In this chapter, we are going to explore a fun React add-on, Animation. We will start  off by continuing with our Cat Pinterest application and enhancing it to support  starring and sharing the data to update the views. We will then explore adding  handlers for animation. We will see how components get wrapped for animation and  how React adds the handlers for different events. We will also explore different events  and how we can easily enhance our application in order to create stunning effects.  In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:     Making changes to the data flow and passing data from react-router links    Animation in React    CSS transitions    Transition groups    Transition handlers    Animating our dynamic component  At the end of chapter, we will be able to start animating our React components for  different actions such as adding new content, changing data and position, and so  on. We will also be able to add handlers for different types of events and explore  different animation options out there, other than core animation add-on.  [ 185 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Fun stuff at Adequate LLC! "Hi Shawn and Mike!" Carla joined Mike and Shawn in their conversation.  The day before, Carla had asked them to build a Pinterest-style application for cats  for one of their clients.  "How are things going today?" she enquired.  "All good, Carla. Shawn, do you want to show Carla what we built yesterday?"  "Sure."  "That looks nice! Are we adding button for faving starring of cats next?"  "Yes, we were just getting ready for that."  [ 186 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   "Cool. The client called yesterday. What they want along with displaying the cats is  to show a stream of cats being updated on the screen.

We are adding a new faved attribute here to  maintain state about whether the cat was faved by the user or not.  "We will call this new class of ours CatGenerator, which will provide the  component that we use to display the cats, with the data to display, fetch,   and add new cats."  "Got it.

"Thanks. I moved createCat as a method of its own so that we can add cats to the  collection on the fly. I am just adding a random one right now, taking a random  height of 600-650 and a random width to create a new PictureModel instance."  "Also, to start with, I am creating cats collection as an attribute on the class. Next,   I have added six cats to begin with."  "Cool. We are now going to start changing its use in our Components."  Remember that we are going to update the components when  new data comes in. Easy way to do this is to start storing the  CatGenerator as a state object on the Home component.  "Let's start defining and changing our Home component, as follows:"  class Home extends React.Component {   constructor   {     super  ;     this.timer = null;     this.state = {catGenerator: new CatGenerator  };   }    componentDidMount   {     this.timer = setInterval ::this.generateCats, 1000 ;   }    generateCats   {     let catGenerator = this.state.catGenerator;     catGenerator.createCat  ;     clearInterval this.timer ;  [ 188 ]  www.it-ebooks.info       this.timer = setInterval ::this.generateCats, catGenerator. randRange   ;      this.setState {catGenerator: catGenerator} ;   } …  "So, what we are doing here is creating a timer to track time intervals. We are going  to use a random time interval to simulate the addition of a new stream of cats here."  "Got it," followed up Shawn.  "To do this, I have added the generateCats   method. In our componentDidMount,  we are adding and setting the timer to call this method after the first creation."  "In the method itself, I have added clearing of the old interval and we are calling  the catGenerator.createCat   method to actually create the cat from our  CatGenerator class."  "We are then resetting the timer and setting a new one, based on a random time  interval. I added the catGenerator.randRange   method to generate the random  time interval. Here's how it looks in the CatGenerator class:"  randRange   {     return _.random 5000, 10000 ;   }  "Got it. This should be creating a new stream of cats in the range of 5-10 seconds."

They also worked on how stars were faved unfaved.  Summary In this chapter, we worked around changing the data flow and passing data directly  from react-router links. We took a look at animating a collection of objects being  added removed or as they appear. We saw different transition events supported by  ReactCSSTransitionGroup and how to use relevant classes to animate our objects.  In the next chapter, we will learn how to test our app using Jest and React TestUtils.

We have also explored different events and studied how to easily   enhance our application in order to create stunning effects using animations.  In this chapter, we will look at various tools in the React ecosystem, which are   useful in the whole lifetime of an application—the development, debugging, and  build tools. We will see how these tools make developing React applications a  beautiful experience.  We will study the following tools in this chapter:     Babel    ESLint    React Developer Tools    Webpack    Hot reloading using Webpack  Mike and Shawn had some free time before starting their next project. They decided  to spend this time in learning more about various tools that they had used so far in  their React projects for development, testing, and bundling the apps.  Development tools "Shawn, today I would like to discuss about the tools that we have used until now  while building our React apps today. React is a very small library, which does one  thing right—rendering the UI. However, we had to use a lot of other tools with React  throughout our journey until now. Today is the day to discuss everything about  them." said Mike.  "Awesome, Mike! I am ready as always. Let's get rolling." exclaimed Shawn.  [ 203 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Using Babel for ES6 and JSX "Shawn, we have used ES6 or ES2015 code since the beginning. We are also very  bullish about using JSX. Sometimes, we have also used ES7 code, such as the function  bind operator in our latest Cats Pinterest project."     src Home.js  class Home extends React.Component {   componentDidMount   {     this.timer = setInterval ::this.generateCats, 1000 ;   } }  "Yes, Mike. I loved the conciseness of these new features." said Shawn.  "However, current browsers still don't understand the ES6 or ES7 code that we have  written. We use Babel to transform this code in ES5 JavaScript, which current browsers  can run. It allows us to use the JavaScript syntax from the future today. Babel also has  JSX support, therefore, it is very handy to use with React." explained Mike.  "Babel is very modular and comes with a plugin architecture. It has plugins for  different ES6 ES7 syntaxes. Generally, we want to use React specific and ES6 specific  plugins. Babel groups such common plugins into something called presets. Babel  has various plugins for ES6, React, as well as different stages of future language  proposals."  "We are mostly interested in using the ES2015 and React presets, which comprise  of all the plugins related to ES6 and React. Occasionally, we do need some of the  advanced features, such as the ES7 function bind syntax, so we need to configure  it separately. In such cases, we use the individual plugins directly, as we used  transform-function-bind for the function bind syntax."  All of these presets and plugins come in their own npm packages.  Babel is built this way—a small core and a giant plugin architecture  with a lot of configuration options around it.  "Therefore, we will have to install all of these packages separately."  npm install babel-core --save  npm install babel-loader --save  npm install babel-preset-react --save  npm install babel-preset-es2015 --save  npm install babel-plugin-transform-function-bind –save  [ 204 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   "Got it. I have also seen some Babel related configuration in our Webpack  configuration." said Shawn.  "Yes. Though Babel allows us to convert files from the command line, we do not  want to convert each and every file manually. Therefore, we have configured  Webpack in such a way that it will convert our ES6 ES7 code using Babel before  starting the app. It uses babel-loader package. Let's discuss it in detail when we  discuss webpack later today," said Mike.  We are using Babel version 6 throughout this book. Check out  more details about Babel at http:  babeljs.io .  ESLint "Shawn, you have seen my commits related to linting in our projects, right?"  "Yes. I used to get annoyed at these small little changes initially, but then I got used  to them." said Mike. "Linting is very important, especially if we want to maintain the code quality across  different projects. Fortunately, linting React projects is very easy with ESLint. It  also supports ES6 syntax and JSX so that we can also lint our next generation code."  informed Mike.  "We are using eslint-plugin-react and babel-eslint npm packages to lint ES6 and  React code. We have also globally installed the ESLint npm package."  Check http:  eslint.org docs user-guide getting-started  for details about getting started with ESLint.  "Mike, I also see that you have added lint command under scripts in package.json."  added Shawn.     package.json    "scripts": { "lint": "eslint src" }  [ 205 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   "Yes, Shawn. It is common to miss a few things here and there in a big project.  Having a command to lint the project helps us in finding such things. We need the  eslint, eslint-babel, and eslint-plugin-react packages to use ESLint within our code.  Therefore, we need to install it before trying to run this command."  npm install eslint --save  npm install babel-eslint --save  npm install eslint-plugin-react –save  "We are also using some standard configuration options for ESLint. These options  are present in the .eslintrc file of our project. We define the rules that we want  to check with ESLint in this file. We also enable ES6 feature that we want ESLint  to whitelist.

React Dev Tools "Shawn, React is excellent at improving the developer experience. They have  released react-dev-tools to help us in debugging our apps. React developer   tools are Chrome and Firefox add-ons, which make debugging React apps fun." "Once you install the add-on, you will then see a React tab in the browser console  while running a React app. An interesting thing is that this tab is also shown for  websites that use React in production too, for example, Facebook."  "Once we click on the React tab, it shows all the components in our app."  [ 208 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   "Shawn, as you may have noticed, we can see all our components on the left-hand side  pane. On the right-hand side, we see props and state of the component selected in the  left pane. Therefore, we can inspect UI state at any point of time. We don't need to add  console.log statements to see what is happening with our components." "More than this, it provides us with a temporary variable—$r. The selected  component from the console is available as $r in the console."  "Let's try to see what $r gives us in the console so that we can debug the selected  component directly in console."  "It also allows us to scroll to the selected component in the UI to see the actual source  code of the component. It can also show all components of a specific type."  "So Shawn, what do you think about these dev tools?" asked Mike.  [ 209 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   "I am very impressed. This is really nice! I will use them in each and every React  project from now onwards." Shawn was very excited on seeing the power of React  dev tools.  Check https:  github.com facebook react-devtools  for more details on React dev tools.  Build tools "Shawn, the build system is arguably the first thing that we should care about when  creating a new web application. It is not only a tool for running scripts, but in the  JavaScript world, it usually shapes the basic structure of our application."  The following responsibilities should be performed by a build system:     External dependencies as well internal dependencies should be managed          The development web server, browser reloader, and file watcher should be   It should run compilers preprocessors It should optimize assets for production  run by it  "There are a lot of different tools such as Grunt, Gulp, and Browserify, which can be  used as part of our build system. Each tool has its own advantages and disadvantages.  However, we have decided to go with Webpack in our projects." said Mike.  What is Webpack? "Webpack is a module bundler. It bundles our JavaScript with its dependencies into  a single package."  "Unlike Browserify and other tools, Webpack also bundles other assets such as CSS,  fonts, and images. It supports CommonJS module syntax, which is very common in  node.js and npm packages. Therefore, it makes things easier as we don't need to use  another package managers for frontend assets. We can just use npm and share the  dependencies between server-side code and front-end code. It is also smart enough  to load dependencies in the correct order so that we don't need to worry about  ordering explicit and implicit dependencies."  "As a result, Webpack alone can perform the task of Browserify as well as other build  tools such as Grunt and Gulp."  [ 210 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   This section will not cover every aspect of Webpack. However,  we will discuss how to use Webpack effectively with React.  Webpack configuration "Shawn, in a typical React app, we use ES6 code and JSX in our components.   We also use frontend assets within the same component to make it more portable.  Therefore, our Webpack configuration must handle the all these aspects correctly."  explained Mike.  "Let's take an example of our Pinterest app and see how Webpack is configured to  run it."  "First of all, we need to inform Webpack about the entry point of our app. In our  case, it is the index.js file, which mounts the App component in the DOM."     src index.js render                                        , document.getElementById 'rootElement'  ;  "Therefore, we mention the entry point as src index.js in the webpack.config.js.  file."     webpack.config.js path = require 'path' ; var webpack = require 'webpack' ;  module.exports = {      starting point of the application   entry: [ '. src index'] };  "Secondly, we need to inform Webpack where to put the generated bundled code  from our source.

The name of the file will be bundle.js.

Loaders are transformations that are applied to a resource file  of your app. They are functions  running in node.js  that take the source of a resource  file as the parameter and return the new source. We use babel-loader for our ES6  and JSX code."     webpack.config.js module.exports = {   module: {     loaders: [       {         test:  \.jsx?$ ,         loader: 'babel-loader',         query: {           presets: ['es2015', 'react'],           plugins: ['transform-function-bind']         },         include: path.join __dirname, 'src'        }]   } };  "We have installed the babel-loader package via npm and included it in package. json.

We also specify that babel-loader  should use es2015 and react presets as well as function-bind transformer plugin so  that Babel will be able to parse all of our code properly."

Check https:  webpack.github.io docs using-loaders.html  for more details about using and configuring loaders.  Hot module replacement "Shawn, one of the coolest features of Webpack is Hot Module Replacement  HMR .  This means that whenever we modify a component and save the file, Webpack  will replace the module on the page without reloading the browser and losing  component state." informed Mike.  "Wow! That sounds very impressive." exclaimed Shawn.  [ 214 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   "To get hot reloading working, we have to use the excellent react-hot-loader package  and webpack-dev-server. The webpack-dev-server package saves us from running  Webpack repeatedly for every file change before starting the server. It will run the  app for us using the config options provided in webpack.config.js. The key point  in setting up webpack-dev-server is configuring it for hot reloading.

All hail Webpack and hot reloading!"  [ 217 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Summary In this chapter, you learned about various tools from the React ecosystem— development, testing, and production tools that we have used in various stages of  our app development. We discussed Babel, the JavaScript transpiler, to convert our  next generation JavaScript code to ES5. We also saw how to use ESLint and React  dev tools that make React development easy. In the end, we saw how Webpack can  be used with React with its powerful loaders and configuration options. We saw how  these tools can make developing React apps a beautiful experience.  In the next chapter, we are going to dive deep into Flux as an architecture. We have  seen how problems arise during data sharing across components. We will see how to  overcome them using Flux.  [ 218 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Flux  In the previous chapter, we took a look at the various tools in the React ecosystem  that are useful in the whole lifetime of an application—development, testing, and  production. We also saw how React improves the developer experience using  developer tools. We learned about the various testing tools that can be used with  React. To summarize it, we saw how to use build tools such as Webpack and  Browserify and how they can be used with React.  In this chapter, we are going to dive deep in Flux as an architecture. We have seen  how problems arise during data sharing across components. We will see how we can  overcome them by having a single point of data store. Next, we will check out how  to use React to overcome this.  Dispatcher acts as a central hub to manage this data flow and communication and  how Actions invoke them. Finally, we will we take a look at the complete data flow  that takes place, while building our Social Media Tracker application.  In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:     Flux architecture    Stores    Actions    Dispatcher    Flux implementations  At the end of chapter, we will be able to start replacing parts of our application  that have tight data coupling, with Flux We will be able to set up the necessary  groundwork for Flux and easily start using the same in our React views.  [ 219 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Flux architecture and unidirectional flow "Hey Mike and Shawn!" entered Carla, on a bright morning.  "Hi Carla, how are you today?"  "Wonderful. The previous app that you build was nice, the clients liked it. They will  soon add more features to it. Meanwhile, we have got another small app to build."  "Oh, nice. What are we planning to build?" inquired Mike.  "We need to build a kind of social tracker. To start with, we show a user's reddits,  tweets, and so on. We will later extend it to display other information."  "Got it," iterated Shawn.  "Have a good day; I will leave it to you."  "So Shawn, what do you think about the new project?"  "It should be exciting. Umm… can we explore Flux and use it in the app? We had  discussed it when we were building the last app."  "Yeah, we can. This will be the perfect opportunity to see how Flux works. Before we  start using it, let's go through what Flux actually is."  "Flux is a simple architecture for React to make use of unidirectional flow. We have  discussed previously how unidirectional flow suits React. React follows the render- always model when there are any changes made to data. Data doesn't go other way  around, like in the case of two-way bindings." "It's not exactly the Model-View-Controller  MVC  way of working. It consists of  Model  Stores , Actions and Dispatchers, and finally Views  React Views ."  "There is no module for complete Flux as a framework as it's not meant to be.  Facebook provides the Flux module, which consists of the Dispatcher. Other parts  such as View and Stores can be done without much support. Let's go over them one  by one, shall we?"  "Sure. I believe we can go over how they correlate and why exactly are they useful  when an app starts to grow."  "Yup."  "As you can see in the following image, the various components are tied together  and function distinctly. Data flows in a single direction in a cycle."  [ 220 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   "As I mentioned previously, a Dispatcher acts as the central hub. Whenever an  event takes place from the View, such as a user clicks a button or an Ajax call is  completed, an action from the Actions is called. The Action may also get called from  the Dispatcher." "The Actions are simple constructs that deliver the payload to the Dispatcher, which  identify what the Action is and other details from the action and data needed to  update current state."  "The Dispatcher then propagates it to the stores. Dispatcher acts like a callback  registry, where all stores register themselves. Dispatcher notifies and callbacks   stores whenever some action takes place. Irrespective of the action, it is delivered   to all the stores." "The Dispatcher is not doing any complex activities, it just forwards the payload to  registered stores, and it doesn't process any data."  "The responsibility to perform logical and complex decisions and data changes is  entrusted with the stores. This helps to make the point of data changes at a single  place and avoid changes all around the application, which are harder to track." "On receiving a callback from the Dispatcher, the Store decides whether it needs to  perform any action or not, based on the Action type. Based on the callback, it can  update the current store. It can also wait for other stores to be updated. After it is  done with the changes, it goes ahead and notifies the view. This can be achieved  in our simple Flux version by making use of an EventEmitter module which is  available from the events module."  [ 221 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   "Similar to Actions, the Views register themselves to hear changes in stores. On some  changes, an event is emitted by EventEmitter. Based on the event type, it will call a  View method, which has registered to listen to an event." "The View receiving the event can then update its own state, based on the current state  of any stores that are available to it. The state update then triggers the View update." "This process continues with a View event, resulting in calls to the Actions and  Dispatcher and so forth." "Hope, this is somewhat clear now?" queried Mike.  "Umm… yeah, let me wrap my head around it. We have actions to perform an  Action, based on an event. It then notifies the Dispatcher, which then notifies any  store registered to listen for the changes. The Stores then update themselves, based  on the action type and notify the React Views to update themselves."  "Correct! Let's dive in the app right away. We will base our app from the official Flux  example. It will be structured like this."  js   ├── actions  ├── app.js  ├── components  │   └── SocialActions.js  │   └── SocialTracker.react.js  ├── constants  │   └── SocialConstants.js  ├── dispatcher  │   └── AppDispatcher.js  ├── stores  │   └── SocialStore.js  └── utils      └── someutil.js  "Now, as Carla mentioned, we need to show the user's data from Twitter and Reddit.  For Reddit, it's available openly via API calls, as we will see shortly."

Summary We did a deep dive in Flux as an architecture. We saw Dispatcher act as a central  hub to transmit our data and Actions to process them. We saw how the main  responsibility to manipulate the state and update itself was delegated to the stores  themselves. Finally, we saw how they were tied up together and made it easy to be  used in views and share stores across the components.  [ 242 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Redux and React  In the previous chapter, we dived into Flux as an architecture. We saw how  problems arise during data sharing across components. We saw different parts of  this architecture—Actions, Stores, Views, and Dispatcher—and build upon our  example using pure Flux, Dispatcher from Facebook, and EventEmitter. Finally, we  built a simple application to see how all these components are tied up together to  create a simple flow to share a common state across components.  In this chapter, we will take a look at using Flux in a popular Flux-based state  management implementation, Redux. We will see how it differs from pure Flux  implementation that we saw previously. We will take a look at different components  of Redux—its stores, actions, and reducers for the stores and actions. Finally, we will  see how an app connects with the store, maintains a single state of the store, and  passes information around in the views.  We will cover the following topics in this chapter:     Redux    Setting up Redux    Redux store    Reducers    Connecting stores to app components    Data flow in Redux  At the end of the chapter, we will be able to start using Redux in our applications  to maintain the state for the Views. We will be able to set up and connect it with  different parts of the app. We will be able to see how to distribute data in stores   and use reducers and actions to manage the store's data.  [ 243 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Redux "Good morning, Shawn," started Mike.  "Good morning, Mike. What are we working on today?"  "Ah, yesterday, we worked with Flux. It was to introduce you to the basics of Flux.  In most of our projects, we used something similar to it in order to manage the state  in the apps."  "Today, we will see how to use Redux."  "Cool." "As stated at https:  github.coktreactjs redux, Redux is a predictable state  container for JavaScript apps. It's kind of what we implemented previously."  "With Redux, we maintain a single state tree for the complete application and add  reducers to enhance the state of the store. Previously, we were directly mutating the  value of _state and then notifying the subscribers about the change. Let's take a  look at our app setup to get started with, as follows:"  │   └── SocialTracker.js  ├── actions  │   └── social.js  ├── components  ├── config.js  ├── containers  │   └── App.js  ├── reducers  │   ├── index.js  │   └── social.js  ├── server.js  ├── store  │   └── configureStore.js  ├── styles  [ 244 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   │   └── App.css  ├── utils  This is based on our previous application and example from https:  github. acktreactjs redux tree master examples todomvc."  "Umm, I don't see a dispatcher here."  "Correct. Redux deviates from the normal Flux; here, it does not have a dispatcher.  During the set up, we will see how we connect stores to the components so that the  components get updates for the changes to state in the store."  "Got it. Let's begin as before then?"  "Yup."  "Let's start with our Main Component; this will be wrapped to listen to store by  Redux, as follows:"           App.js import { bindActionCreators } from 'redux' import { connect } from 'react-redux' import SocialTracker from '.. components SocialTracker' import * as SocialActions from '.. actions social'  function mapStateToProps state  {   return {     social: state.social   } }  function mapDispatchToProps dispatch  {   return bindActionCreators SocialActions, dispatch  }  export default connect mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps   SocialTracker   [ 245 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Setting up Redux "Now, there are different things happening here to set up our store. Let's go through  them, one owing:."     mapStateToProps: We use this method to define how we are going to map   the state from the Redux store to the props being sent to the components  connected to listen to the store. Whenever new changes happen in the store,  the components get notified and are passed to the object payload from   this method.     mapDispatchToProps: This method is used to map the Actions and pass  them on the props so that they can be used from within the component.     bindActionCreators: This is used to wrap our Actions creator    SocialActions  into dispatch calls to support calling the actions directly.  This helps to call the actions and notify the store for updates, which are done  due to the dispatch.     connect: Finally, we have the connect call. This actually connects the React   component to the store. It does not change the original component, but  enhances and creates a new one. We can then start using the Actions from  our component.  "Got it. So, we are creating two methods to map how the actions and state from  Redux should be made available to the component. We are then connecting the store  to Redux in order to listen to the updates and make the actions and stores available  to the component when there are updates to the store."  "Yup. We are then going to start using this setup in the index, as shown in the  following code:"  import React from 'react' import { render } from 'react-dom' import { Provider } from 'react-redux' import App from '. containers App' import configureStore from '. store configureStore'  const store = configureStore    render               ,   document.getElementById 'root'     [ 246 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   "The Provider component from the react-redux module allows us to connect the  components to the stores.

It takes in the arguments—the reducer  our reducers that  we will see shortly  and initial state for the store.  [ 247 ]  www.it-ebooks.info      applyMiddleware: This is used to enhance Redux with middleware. Here,  we are using the thunk middleware, which allows us to do asynchronous  dispatches.     configureStore: Finally, in configureStore, we are creating the store by   calling the enhanced createStore: createStoreWithMiddleware. We have  some conditions here to handle the hot module replacement to auto-reload  the code changes, which we saw in HMR.  "Got it."

ReactJS is an open-source JavaScript library that brings the power of reactive programming to web applications and sites. It aims to address the challenges encountered in developing single-page applications, and is intended to help developers build large, easily scalable and changing web apps. Starting with a project on Open Library API, you will be introduced to React and JSX before moving on to learning about the life cycle of a React component. In the second project, building a multi-step wizard form, you will learn about composite dynamic components and perform DOM actions. You will also learn about building a fast search engine by exploring server-side rendering in the third project on a search engine application. Next, you will build a simple frontpage for an e-commerce app in the fourth project by using data models and React add-ons. In the final project you will develop a complete social media tracker by using the flux way of defining React apps and know about the best practices and use cases with the help of ES6 and redux.
